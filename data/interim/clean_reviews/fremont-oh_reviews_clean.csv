2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Me and my family stayed at the Dillon house for a little weekend get away and it was absolutely beautiful! I got to live out my Victorian Era dreams and did not want to leave.
My kids also loved it and played for hours on the swing out front and spent a lot of time watching deer in the backyard. Would 100% stay again!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family of 7 enjoyed our time at Dillon House immensely! We enjoyed reading about the home's rich and carefully preserved history and finding old pictures displayed around the house. The decor, of course, is fabulous, just like the pictures, but is also comfortable and very functional. We felt right at home! And the hosts are very friendly, responsive, and helpful. I cannot say enough good things and we would definitely return!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at this Victorian home was nothing short of enchanting. From the moment we stepped through the door, an ambiance of timeless elegance greeted us. My husband, who has a keen eye for architecture, remarked that this was the most exquisite Victorian home he has ever seen – and considering his experience, that's saying something!
The attention to detail throughout the home was truly exceptional. Every corner revealed another delightful surprise, whether it was the intricate woodwork, the ornate fixtures, or the tasteful furnishings. It was evident that every element had been carefully curated to evoke the charm of a bygone era while still offering modern comforts.
We found ourselves enchanted by the peaceful surroundings, and the proximity to President Hayes's house and museum only added to the allure of the area.
Overall, our experience surpassed all expectations. To anyone seeking a truly memorable stay in a picturesque setting, I wholeheartedly recommend this Victorian Gem!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was beautiful! Not only that but the hosts were so helpful! They communicated with me whenever I had questions almost immediately. There was so much history in the home and it was literally like going on an adventure. I wish the weather could have been better so we could have gone outside to enjoy the patio and porch but sometimes Mother Nature is just not on your side. I would recommend this place to my peers.

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you are even remotely considering staying at the Dillon House, do it!! It is absolutely stunning, especially if you like historic homes. My family asked if we could just buy it and move in! The house is huge with enough room for a large group. The kitchen is stocked with anything you could possibly need. The bedrooms are comfortable and quiet. The whole space is extremely clean. The neighborhood is adorable with a park directly across the street. The outdoor space is also beautiful. We had a baby deer visit! The home is about a 30 minute drive to Port Clinton and that general area but it's a nice drive. We go to Lake Erie every summer and have always stayed there but this is our new go to from now on."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I could not have been happier than staying at Mike and Aaron's Dillion House.

I highly recommend you stay there if are ever in Fremont!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This beautiful home is perfect for family gatherings. We planned a day at Cedar Point (only a 45 minute drive) and the remainder of the 3 days we spent at the Dillon House. The outside porches, garden area, and fire pit were perfect depending on the time of the day. It was a great adventure just admiring all the decor in the home. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes (we didn’t cook any meals), but ate lots of take out food. The beds were very comfortable and the the bathrooms were also well stocked. The quiet evenings on the porch were so relaxing and even had deer visit the front yard. We highly recommend the Historic Dillon House."

Great location, while there we visited Ottawa National Wildlife Preserve. Checked out Seneca Caverns, cool cave tour. Castalia Quarry Metropark was a great hike to check out.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Oh my goodness! That was my first reaction upon entering this stately home. The home was built in the 1920 's and is full of exquisit wordwork and architecture. The owners have updated the home to tastfully blend in with the ambiance of days gone by. Michael and Christopher have clearly spent countless hours in collecting a vast variety of antiques and collectibles that fill the home.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful late 1800s craftsmanship. Ever tried hanging a door at home? What about using 1890s tools and hanging a 300# door on three hinges perfectly so it glides smoothly for the next 120 years. And if memory serves there are about a dozen on the first floor. Even the flathead screws holding them up are all in alignment.
Enjoy the decorations, the pictures and imagine haven lived in this home. Granted, there are modern amenities, microwave, dishwasher, but not in a disruptive way to the vibe of the house.
Take some time to sit in each room and just let your eyes and mind wander."

Paul is nice and helpful. The back yard is to hang out. One of the best parts of my stay is that the dogs made friends with me and kept me company.

In years past, we used the common hotels in Fremont. Knowing the unpredictable quality of those hotels, as soon as we saw this Airbnb option, we wanted to try it.
The rental was spotless and smelled fresh and clean upon entering. The location was in a nicely kept area of Fremont. We felt incredibly safe and comfortable. There were a few family games in the living room that my boys enjoyed, and there was a multi-function keurig for the coffee lovers like me. I forgot my hairdryer and was grateful to find one in the bathroom. The mattresses were pleasantly firm, with plenty of towels, and extra blankets in the closets.
The host was incredibly responsive and helpful every step. We will gladly book again at this location! Thank you for a wonderful stay in Fremont!!"

We actually locked ourselves out by mistake and while we were out and about, he made sure we were able to get in when we got back—no waiting! Having a full house vs a single hotel room made our stay much more enjoyable! Only complaint is we weren’t able to get the tv in our bedroom to work, but there were 3 others, so we managed (🤣).

Marci was so responsive and was always there to help if we needed anything! It was the perfect place to come back to after chaotic days at Cedar Point! Very highly recommend staying here if you’re in the area!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Marci was amazing! We needed a place to stay for the night at the very last minute, but we had some questions. Marci was very prompt in responding, and she was willing to work with us on our needs. We found the house to be in great condition, exactly as pictured in the photos. Everything was very clean and very spacious. My friends and I enjoyed the early morning with peaceful nature views out back. There's a little dock, and we got to see seagulls, a blue heron, a bald eagle, and lots of egrets. We definitely want to go back and spend more time with all the amenities. Totally recommend it!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a very fun space to be in
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Outstanding rental. Really a place where it does actually look as good or better than the photos. We had a great time fishing off the pier on the river, lighting the firepit, and being in Fremont & Sandusky. Highly recommend!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Had all the “extras” that we needed
2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"I realize this is a former Amway mansion coverted to a BNB, but for a group of 10 plus visitors, North Wing doesn't have the dining space for all to sit together. As a rather elderly group, bathrooms for each bedroom would be nice. Still, I understand the limits placed by existing construction. Overall, visiting family members liked the place and enjoyed the location. If there's ever another Fremont reunion, we'll probably be back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! Marci was so responsive and helpful. The property was spacious, and beautiful. There were instructions and labels throughout the airbnb that answered all of our questions. We’ll be back!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was exactly as advertised. Clean and ready to go with no snags at all.
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We really enjoyed staying at Eagle Isle. Our group was traveling from northern Michigan but members were from all around the country. Marci’s Airbnb was a great location for us all to converge for our trip to Cedar Point. The kitchen was well equipped for making a dinner for a large group like we had. Sleeping areas upstairs were very comfortable and there were plenty of blankets around the house. We also enjoyed the outdoor space with the dock and volleyball net. One thing that stood out to me was Marci’s excellent communication. She made sure all our drivers had the parking and directional information they needed and she was always quick to respond. The check in process was also very smooth. I definitely recommend staying at Eagle Isle.
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you love outdoors, fishing, boating, games, etc... this airbnb is the place for you. The staff are excellent and there are plenty of attractions close by to do. All family friendly fun or traveling with friends for a party I highly recommend this location."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Honest and honest and will always deal with Marci
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed at Eagle Isle in July 2021. We went away for a guys weekend and 5 us had more than enough room. There were 5 beds and 2 futons. The property itself is amazing with beautiful views. You rent out the far right wing of the house and the nice family lives in the middle but you have complete privacy.
There is boat dock access to jump into the river if that’s your speed. We found Jimmy Bucketts bar which is walking distance down the road at the local campground. They have a snack shack there to buy food and drinks.
Go to Jimmy Bucketts! This place is a little hidden gem of a tiki bar.
Pack some K-cups since they don’t have a coffee pot. Hopefully we will be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Stayed here with my family of 6 coming in from Florida to go to Cedar Point. Very spacious and is exactly as advertised. We played a game of horse at the basketball hoop and enjoyed time playing games inside. Was the perfect family setting to make memories.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our group of 6 really enjoyed our time here. The home was clean, spacious, and had everything we needed.

2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,This property was nice & spacious. The view of the lake is amazing. The house doesn't have 11 beds but can sleep possible 11 people. The house did come equipped with everything you need for your travel besides food ...lol overall had a great stay & would stay again.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The North Wing was so perfect for our family of 6! While there is much room for more, we thoroughly enjoyed our time and the extra space! Very quiet! Kids loved basketball and the tire swing! This was the perfect spot for our family to launch out to go birding! The pictures are great but the space is so wonderful! So so, clean! I am always very concerned about the space being very clean for my family and this was sparkling! Thank you so much, Marci for being such a great host!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice home. Was pleasantly surprised when i walked in. Very nice place to stay if your looking to get away. 100% recommend.

Roomy for a group of 9. There are 2 family rooms, which was great. Thoughtful touches provided everywhere: firewood, lighter, bug spray, liquid hand soap, plenty of toilet paper, etc.
Charmingly decorated with beautiful landscaping.
Thank you for a great stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed at Eagle Isles twice, and both experiences were fantastic! Thank you, Marci!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I affirm all the positive things others have written. Responsiveness, cleanliness, friendliness, etc. - Marci does everything you hope for in an airbnb really well.
Our group of 16 rented both sides at the same time. The place isn't specifically set up for this. You have to go outside and back in to move between the two, but it worked really well. On our final full day there, someone asked if the 4 kids in our group (ages 9-12) were clamoring for screen time. Nope - they hadn't asked for phones/tv/tablets once. What a delight!
The south wing was a bit more spacious for group gathering, while the north wing had slightly more comfortable sleeping accommodations. They're both great for their own reasons, though. Go north if you love ping pong :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect stay for my work crew

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The south wing was spacious and quiet. Despite being attached to the main house. There is a separate entrance. Huge yard and nice patio sitting area. Enjoyed the view of the Sandusly River. Grandkids loved playing hid and go seek in the house. There was only 6 of us. So we had more than enough space and beds. If you have a large family it would definitely be a better alternative to multiple hotel rooms. Marci is great to communicate any instructions needed to make your stay easy. Appreciated the family friendly home to stay in.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice, peaceful place. Plenty of room for my group of 10!"

Private area and porch, well stocked kitchen and all the necessities of home, including extra blankets, W&D, etc. Important to note the downstairs bed is right next to W&D, and you must go through a bathroom to get to the two small beds upstairs (or you can walk through one of the small rooms to the other). not an issue for our family but might be strange for some."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The 4 bedroom home was just what we need to be able to accommodate our contract tool and die team. The location of the home was close to work and was close to many other sight seeing adventures in Northwest Ohio.

2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house far exceeded my expectations! It looked great from the pictures, but it’s even more spacious in person! The upstairs had plenty of space to accommodate 8 girls for a weekend away to cedar point and the downstairs had plenty of space for us to have meals and hang out as a group. Marci had the house stocked with the essentials (sheets, blankets, towels, toilet paper, etc), there is ample parking, and the checkout procedure was clear and easy to follow! The surrounding property was gorgeous and I would definitely recommend the place to others!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous location on the Sandusky River. It was the perfect place for our big family to celebrate our daughter's graduation from the University of Toledo. Loved the firepit and outdoor space.

No iron & ironing board. Bathroom door are sticky & get stuck. There was a cat with baby kittens, felt like I should find them a home but wasn't sure if this was the owners cat! But the Farmhouse was a wonderful retreat, will be back again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Bukkett's Farm House was a great place to stay. It is in a rural location, but not too far to anything you need. I only used one bedroom, the mattress was great! I was staying there on business, but it would be a great place to stay for summer recreation. Just across the road from a marina and the notes said there is a slip at the marina included with the house. I would definitely stay there again and recommend to others!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful property with lots of local history to discover. I appreciate the well thought-out amenities in the house. Plenty of towels, kitchen utensils, and games.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was my 4th stay. The house is clean, spacious, private. The house is historic but the amenities are modern.

I stay at the Octagon House after visits to family...I'm sure I'll be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janet, thank you for a wonderful stay! It was a perfect location to see family and friends in the area!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was very enjoyable. Spending time with family in my old neighborhood is always good.Will definitely stay again. Very recommendable. You would be hard to find better host and neighbors.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This my third stay of over a week. Christmas lights around the house were a pleasant surprise when I arrived…they made the house feel warm and lived in, as did the holiday decorations inside. The house is clean and contemporary, with unobtrusive charging ports in every room. The washer/ dryer are easy to use and already preloaded with detergent. Effort has been made to anticipate each part of the day from coffee in the morning to extra everything; pillows, blankets, tissues. The house seems designed for both gatherings and privacy. Janet is almost immediate in responding to messages. I’ll be staying again l’m sure."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed the stay tremendously! Everything felt like home. you could find everything you needed. we will return again .
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Miss Janet's Air B n B home was fantastic for our over two week stay. we utilized all of the bedrooms and bathrooms as well as the large two bay garage space.
The home actually has quite the history, however it has been updated with every modern amenity you'd like to see; like updated bathrooms and fixtures.
Anytime we had a question for the owners, they responded promptly and politely.
All in all 5 out of 5
Great place!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was amazing and worked great for our family of five. The actual home was much better than the descriptions or pictures portrayed. There is so much room in this house and it is so great for entertaining. The game room is heated and stocked with a tv, pool table, ping pong, foosball, and a number of games. There are folding tables, and plenty of chairs and where we spent most of the time. The bedrooms are updated and beds are super comfortable. We found air mattresses in the closet for use if there are more people staying than the number of beds. The location of the property was in a beautiful setting, and is only 40 minutes from Cedar Point! We also visited both Bowling Green University and Heildelberg University which was 45 minutes and 20 minutes away. This is a great place to stay if you are planning multiple college visits to these schools, or even Toledo University. The hosts were great and communicated by text, but everything was provided within the stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful sanctuary, extremely restful in a unique and inviting home."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is beautiful and is what the pictures show. Everything we needed was there; just like being at home. They also provided things we didn’t ask for but actually needed and didn’t think to ask for like baby gates, high chair and excellent game room. It is far enough from town for quiet serenity yet close enough to town to get groceries. We will specifically ask for this place on our next trip to this area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was beautiful. We love older houses and their history. It has everything you need for a great stay. Would highly recommend it.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Janet and Bill’s home and property are absolutely phenomenal. By far the best hosts and best Airbnb we’ve ever experienced. They made us feel so welcomed and made sure we had every thing we needed for a mini family reunion. The history of the home and area was so neat to learn about. The Lake Erie Islands and Cedar Point are also just a mere 40 minutes away. We will definitely be back and can’t wait for a return to The Octagon House!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Octagonal House was a beautiful weekend retreat. Janet and her husband were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the well thought out space, the beautiful views and the homey atmosphere. The local town provided a quaint charm that we thoroughly enjoyed."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay was perfect and the property and house are beautiful. We will be back next year for your trip to visit family in the area.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed staying very peaceful look forward to staying again. Thank you
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One word, perfection. The house was amazing and definitely the most interesting home we've stayed in. The surroundings were beautiful and peaceful. We didn't get to use the outside porch swing because it was raining the only morning we had free, but that looked like a wonderful way to start out the day with a hot cup of coffee. Janet has amazing attention to detail, down to extra toothbrushes and toothpaste if you forgot yours. the kitchen was amply stocked with anything you would need to cook meals. The house was spotless. We didn't have time to go into the garage to play, but it looked like a lot of fun. We went a perfect time of year with the corn in the field just about knee high giving us the opportunity to watch the tops of the corn blow in the wind. Janet was an amazing host. She was communicative but not overbearing. We loved our stay, and if we are ever in the area again we would absolutely stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very peaceful. Had a lot to do and a lot of space. We will definitely come back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home! From the moment we arrived, Janet welcomed us and wanted to ensure our stay was comfortable. The home had everything you could have asked for. It was big and very clean, plenty of things for the kids to do inside and outside, and a nice patio in the backyard to relax and enjoy the incredible view! The location was great, very quiet! We definitely recommend staying here and will be doing the same in the future."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful, unique place to stay. And it is so huge inside! Very clean, very well stocked, very responsive host, very pretty country views. Would definitely stay here again."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location with lots to keep the kids busy! Plenty of space to spread out. Friendly and responsive.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed the historic charm of the house. It was very comfortable and felt like home. The game room was an awesome distraction. Tiffin University was very close and easy to get to and from. We will stay here again when we come back to visit once my son starts college.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This was my 2nd stay. I had no problems or issues. The house as hosted by Janet was exactly what I needed.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It looked better than the pictures. Host went out of her way to get us checked in last minute and late at night. Everything was clean and comfortable. Not too much clutter or low decorations; was great with two little ones! They had room to run and be kids. The house had everything one would need to stay away from home. We all loved it.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Janet was a wonderful host. The house was gorgeous and she was more than accommodating for our family gathering. Everything we needed was at our fingertips. It felt like home away from home. We will be back next season!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome old farm house! My family loved the game room and the unique feel of the place. Janet is incredible, I highly recommend her property."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Chose to rent for a working holiday, with some family along for the trip. More than enough space for 2 adults and a teen. All living spaces were comfortable, full kitchen with more than basics allowed for expanded menu, and games (electronic and board/pool table) left much to do with down time. Janet provided timely info before the trip which allowed easier packing and was up front with check in instructions before I needed them (which was appreciated). In cold weather during visit house held temp well and the fireplace(s) were a bonus for relaxed talking in the evenings. Looking forward to coming back during warmer weather, and enjoying grilling/spending more time in the designated outdoor areas. Wi-Fi was functional for email and general browsing, did not try to stream since large selection of movies available and brought some from home as well. Thank you for hosting, Janet!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very unique house(octagon). Nice updates Five deer welcomed us upon arrival. Planning to stay again in the summer.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Following a family visit I needed to quarantine before I could return home due to my wife’s medical condition. Janet took my situation to heart and made sure no one came to the house during my stay. Thank you so much!
It’s impossible to get bored in this house—it has so much character—but if you want quiet, just turn all media off and you have quiet. Everything is clean and a clever mix of tradition and modern.
Every part of the day has been thought out, anticipated and provided for, from morning coffee to placement of night lights. You are never far from tissues, coasters, or a USB charging port. I'd seriously like to know where Janet got the bath towels.
I loved the easy to use washer/dryer.
Thank you!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property. Very clean and spacious home. We were very close to everywhere we wanted to go.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful! The house was exceptionally clean and well maintained… even the garage was cleaner than some rooms in my home ;). We enjoyed playing board games, ping pong, and the pool table, relaxing in the family room, and playing ball in the yard. I loved waking up and looking out the window watching the sunrise over the neighboring farm. So peaceful."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a cool and unique home! It’s beautiful inside and in a nice, quiet location. The garage/rec room is awesome! Janet was great at communicating with us and making sure we had everything we needed. We did have some issues getting the Wi-Fi to work, but not the owner’s fault and it wasn’t a big deal. We would definitely stay here again when we come to visit family."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay. The house was very clean and the remodeling job was very nice. It was a great place for the kids to run around and play. The location felt very safe and relaxing. We loved the games that were available and it made it feel like home. The garage rec room was awesome. It gave our kids the opportunity to try several new games they had never played before. Thanks for the great stay!
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet’s home was perfect! The pictures do not give this place justice. WiFi horrible (make sure y’all have Verizon or AT&T because t-mobile sucks). The home was very clean and we had a great time playing with everything the house had from basketball to board games and video games. The one thing missing in the kitchen was a blender! Overall super peaceful and lovely home. It was not that far away from sandusky (cedar point).
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The space is accurately described and above and beyond in cleanliness and comfort. Janet was a great communicator and made sure our needs were met during our stay. The extra touches and space were enjoyable.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We absolutely adored the house & enjoyed our stay. The house & scenery is beautiful. This is definitely a spacious family fun house. The deck & lighting, the tree swings, basketball rim, Foosball, pool , & ping ping tables were a delight. We had so much fun & Janet went above & beyond in accommodating our check in/check out. We'll be staying here every trip to Cedar Point!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The octagon house is one of my favorite stays ever. The location is incredibly peaceful with beautiful grounds and sunsets. The house is incredibly clean and communication is great. I would stay again without hesitation. A great place to un-plug.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful and clean. I highly recommend staying at this home! Check in was easy and everything went smoothly. I will be returning without a doubt!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The cleanest, most comfortable Airbnb we have ever stayed at. Janet was most attentive during our stay. She is the sweetest person to have a conversation with. She was very concerned we had everything we needed. We will definitely return next year!!!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a truly cozy country home. So much charm. It’s a very easy drive to Cedar Point/Port Clinton. The WiFi was out during our stay but we really didn’t miss it, We were too busy playing pool/ping pong/basketball/ and wii. It’s a nice quiet location on a barely traveled country road. The house had plenty of space for all 5 of us. We all had a great time! This was so much better than being cramped up in a hotel room!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful, clean home with excellent hosts! The sunsets behind the house were beautiful across the fields, and we enjoyed playing Wii, foosball, and cornhole. My kids also loved the swing! We will definitely be returning."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janet has gone above & beyond in keeping the house clean, comfy, & cozy! The quiet country/rural atmosphere was wonderful for our family to enjoy time together! We had fun times playing pool & ping pong in the spacious garage."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Janet has a lovely house and we will definitely be back!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The octagon house is a farm house beauty, full of antique furniture and surrounded by farmland. Janet does a wonderful job of making sure you have everything you need to enjoy your stay. It’s the perfect place to unwind and unplug, but you’re still close enough to town to grab a bite if you want."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful property with much more than we expected for the price. Everything was absolutely spotless and not just the house but the accessible property was much larger than we initially thought. The garage had a pool table, a foosball table, and also a ping pong table which we all loved. The hosts were very thoughtful with everything that was provided. The only negatives any of us could think of was the wifi was spotty but that was not an issue since our data worked just fine. Best of all the price was amazing especially compared to Airbnb's in Sandusky. Highly recommend thank you for the great experience."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very, very clean and tidy. Just the few touches made a difference like ice already made in freezer, a little sign greeting us by name, a water cooler dispenser, personal met and greeted us, and a washer and dryer (which came in very handy). Highly recommend."

Positive points include (1) a dedicated parking spot (2) good T.V. options (3) lots of towels in the bathroom (4) the washer and dryer are downstairs for your use anytime !!!!! (5) Great shower with plenty of pressure and hot water. Stayed there for a month straight without any issue ... and checking back in just 4 days for another couple weeks. Highly Recommended."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I liked Forrest's property so much, I booked for most of April and some of May. As a traveller it fits my needs well.
One big plus for me is laundry downstairs with the AirBNB. Also, the weather has been cold outside, but cozy warm inside. Also, theres a dedicated parking space in his driveway just for AirBNB guests.
Book with confidence .... he's good people."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Forrest's property is exactly what he advertises. It's clean, with good towels in the bathroom and plenty room to relax in the evening.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This accommodation was beautiful and had a wonderful backyard that it opened up to. One of the nicest Airbnbs I’ve stayed in. Spotless and Forest was great with communication. Awesome value.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My son and I had an AMAZING time here for our first airbnb experience!
We will be back ❤❤🥰"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just spent a perfect long weekend at this AirBnB! Not only were the accommodations exactly as described and pictured, the backyard was ablaze in colorful flowers of all kinds! Forrest was quick to respond to my questions and made sure I was comfortable and felt safe (there was a tornado warning one night!). I would not hesitate to return here or recommend it to others."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We just stayed for one night, but everything was nice and clean. It was a quiet area. My husband did not think the bed was super comfy, but I didn't have any problems with it. The lock was a little confusing to lock the door, but eventually figured it out. Forrest did reach out to make sure we were comfortable. The yard was amazing. Wish we would of had time to be able to sit out there and enjoy it a little bit. The one thing my husband noticed is that he was outside for something and said that he could see right into the place even though the blinds were closed. Overall, it was a nice place to stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I liked a lot of what Forest's place has to offer. I had a great stay. If you don't mind needing to drive to places where you may find people and food, it is worth it because it comes with a beautiful backyard and plenty of serenity. I appreciate being about to use the washer and dryer. Forest might have left out the picture book of Guilin for my enjoyment, a nice touch. I wish it has a sink in the ""kitchen"" area and maybe real wine glasses but otherwise, the place is well stocked. Thank you. I will go back again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the second time we stayed at Forrest's BnB and again we were totally satisfied. It's clean, completely furnished with great amenities. Very comfortable and very private."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was very friendly and caring for our stay. When we first checked in, Forrest had asked if we were all good and if we needed anything. The place had felt very comfortable and it truly seemed as if you were at home."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Forrest is a great host--very communicative, there when you need him, leaves you alone otherwise. Very helpful on local info/suggestions. He's just a darned nice man. This is my second stay at his property. I will hope to stay again in the future when the need arises.
Property is clean and well-maintained. Can't recommend his place highly enough."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Air BNB exceeded my expectations. Everything was perfect, and exactly what we needed after a long day of riding. If I ever come back to the Fremont area I will definitely stay here again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was so incredibly lovely! The garden area was so beautiful, the basement was prepared in any and every way possible, and the bed was so cozy! I would absolutely stay here again and will be planning a longer stay at some point in the future because this place is absolutely worth it! Host was also incredibly kind and responsive :)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We just needed a nice, clean place to stay the night as we were travelling through the area. Forrest's basement pad far exceeded our expectations! The entire apartment was very clean, comfortable and looked newly remodeled. We appreciated the feeling of safety in this nice neighborhood. It was super easy to find, and Forrest gave very clear instructions on how to get in via the private entrance. Just wish we'd had more time to enjoy the lovely, peaceful and charmingly designed backyard oasis! (Somebody has a very talented green thumb!!!) Communication with Forrest was timely, helpful and friendly! We would not hesitate to recommend this wonderful apartment!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay!
I had to drive in very late at night, and had to check-out early to continue my drive. I regret not being able to stay there for a few more days! The outside garden is beautiful and the pics aren't representative of the place. The actual place is actually a lot better than the airbnb pics. Definitely a great place to stay with a ton of amenities. I will be sure to stay here if I come to Ohio another time."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at Forrest’s. It was such a comfortable space we felt right at home. Forrest was helpful, friendly and a perfect host. We are so glad we were able to find this place. It is an example of why we like Airbnb, personal touches and attention."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Forrest's place was quaint, quiet, and lovely! He was a wonderful host and I definitely recommend his home."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Not enough characters available to write how amazing this place is! I will definitely be back. Such thoughtful hosts. The backyard is beautiful & I really wish I would’ve had more time to enjoy it - this was the perfect space for what I needed to crash after a long day at Cedar Point. It’s on the way home (I’m from MI). The bathroom was spectacular, the decor was so relaxing, a beautiful piano, TV with Netflix but sooo many DVDs available if you’re feeling nostalgic. The bed was comfy. The hosts left snacks. The dinette was great for the space. There was a full laundry room if you needed it too! I’ve already booked a couple return visits! Can’t recommend Forrest’s & his wife’s space enough!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the place. To start off as soon as you pull up to the driveway you can see how much work the Forrest’s have put into the backyard and aesthetic of the entire place. Such a cozy comfy background with beautiful decorations that remind me of being a kid. If I had more than a night to spend at this place I would of loved spending it in the backyard. The inside also was amazing. Great comfy furniture as well as beautiful decor that gives you a cabin/American home feel. Loved the beautiful piano as well as the art in the bedroom. Amenities were as listed you’ve got a washer and dryer as well as a microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker, fridge/freezer, and TV with provided Netflix. Also the Forrest’s go out of their way to provide you with small things like toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, plates, utensils, SNACKS :), and WATER :) SO SO IMPORTANT. Thank you for our wonderful stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean and comfortable. Nice kitchette with drip coffee, bottled water and snacks."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I traveled with my family for a trip to Cedar Point for my daughter’s birthday. I stayed in Sandusky last year (not with Airbnb) and didn’t really like the area. Forrest’s place was in a city about 40 mins from the theme park in a beautiful neighborhood. My family and I felt very safe.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, Forrest ... inside and out. Periodically I have cause to visit your area on business. Your place is just what I have been looking for for those overnight events. It had everything I needed, and I enjoyed sitting outside in the 'nook' area. Very peaceful. Thanks for a great stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very nice and clean room. same as it was described. Host was friendly and greeted at the arrival. I enjoyed my time at Forrest place.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super impressed with the hosts they were berh friendly & respectful. The basement pad is cozy, beautiful, spacious, peaceful, decorative, stocked very well and relaxing!! Will definitely come back hands down!!!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Forrest was very kind and helpful. The place was extremely clean and cozy. The bed and linens were so comfy. Everything was just perfect. It surpassed my expectations.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved it! Will be back for sure. Work with a company in Tiffin.
Thanks for everything!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was just great. Our quarters were tidy and clean which is important to us. Our host was wonderful and supplied the information we needed to enjoy local restaurants. Everyone has different needs for a comfortable bed. This bed was a bit soft for our needs yet very well dressed with plenty of extra pillows and blankets. If you are interested in history there is a presidential library in Fremont (19th President of United States Rutherford B. Hayes 1877-1881 and civil war general). His family opened the first presidential public library in 1916. Also, Spiegel Grove, the nineteenth century estate of President Rutherford B. Hayes is in Fremont as a point of interest. Maybe we'll come back to see them in summer. The stromboli and cookies at Elroys deli in Fremont are very good."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The description is accurate But it’s good to remember that the kitchenette consists of a small counter with a microwave toaster oven and coffee maker and a small fridge. No sink or cook top. Great for a night or two. If they could just add a sink and stove top it would be comfortable longer term.
But it’s a nice quiet very clean place in a safe residential neighborhood with a responsive host.
And the free laundry is en-suite and awesome."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Don’t hesitate to book this home, we were quite pleased. Loved it and would stay again any time. Wish all stays were this nice!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We just loved this 5 star plus airbnb. It's been newly remodeled and was cozy and comfortable. It had a large, private family room, kitchenette, bathroom and bedroom. A big screen TV and a piano were also in the family room. If you want a spacious, private, cozy place with tasteful decor, this is for you! My husband and I loved it."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place! Forrest was very helpful and responsive. We used the couch bed as well and they had everything prepared and made up when we arrived in the evening. Thank you!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is basically an entire private space, plus we were able to do laundry on our travels and being able to make tea and have dinner at a dining table was a luxury considering we booked it the night before. Forest was extremely accommodating and responsive."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Forest was a fantastic host. We were traveling through Fremont and he responded right away when I selected his place . super friendly and gave an excellent recommendation to visit the Marblehead Lighthouse. he also didn't charge a cleanup fee which can be outrageous sometimes. I wish we had more hosts like him on AirBnb.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay here! Comfortable and clean. Friendly hosts. Would highly recommend this place!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Forrest is a responsive and considerate host. The backyard is adorable and the neighborhood feels safe. I just needed a comfortable place to sleep and it definitely delivered.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked Forrest’s air Bnb last minute on my way from Chicago to New York. It was easy to get to, easy parking, private, clean, comfortable and cozy. Even though I booked last minute, they still put up a “welcome Christina” sign in the mini kitchen. Very grateful to have found this place. It was safe and comfortable - a perfect place to unwind after being in the car for 8 hours.
The laundry was a nice bonus (I had to pack light for this trip). They were also very accommodating when I needed to check in later, and they reached out to make sure I was comfortable temperature wise.
I also ended up needing to hop on a work call at check out time—they had no issue with me checking out late so I could use the wifi instead of making the call from my car.
The amenities were exactly as described and what I needed - I’m very grateful Forrest could host me last minute!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I am a travel RN and Forrest’s place is so convenient and comfortable! Very quiet neighborhood, warm, spacious and plenty of personalized touches! Would 100% recommend :)"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay! I am a travel nurse and I believe this is my 4th or 5th stay and am never disappointed. I always try to book here when it's available. They are always asking if there's anything I need or if I'm comfortable. Highly recommend!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I believe this is my 4th (maybe 5th) stay here in the last few months. I'm a travel nurse and am always exhausted, and this place makes me so comfortable. I feel safe and I sleep well. Forrest is almost immediately responsive and will ask me every stay if I'm comfortable or if I need anything. I leave a review each time and I'm running out of great things to say! I highly recommend. It is always as described. I'm going back again this week and always look forward to seeing them and experiencing their hospitality."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Forrest is an incredible kind & gracious host insuring our comfort. Their place is always impeccably clean with all necessities (and extras) provided. Their home is our favorite place to stay.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another amazing stay! I finally got to actually meet Forrest and his wife, and as I suspected, they are just as nice in person as they are in texts. Already planning more stays. Space is as described. It's quiet, peaceful, stores close by, and extremely clean. I can't wait to go back!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay could not have been better! We were passing through Fremont Ohio and stayed for 1 night - it was comfortable, clean and relaxing.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay while passing through the area. Had everything I needed, very cozy, comfortable and clean. Forrest was great about checking in with me during my stay to make sure everything was good."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was absolutely wonderful. I am a travel nurse, and my second day of my stay, I was so comfortable just enjoying the couch, my coffee, and TV, that I almost didn't even go to work that day. I tried to talk myself into taking the day off just to relax hide out. The space was very clean and neat. It's close to shopping areas but tucked away in a nice neighborhood. I work until 2a and I had no concerns about my safety coming in that late at night. I have already booked my next stay. Forrest is very accommodating and asked me several times if I was comfortable and if I needed anything. I have told my friends I could use it as a hide out, like a ""She Shed"" even though it's 3 hours from home. I highly recommend staying here!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay for a night or two to get to things around here. comfortable bed, great backyard."

Such a great experience that I will definitely be choosing Airbnb over hotels!"

He was flexible with our check in and check out times and always responded quickly to questions before and after booking and while we were there. The place is completely redone and everything is so nice, clean, new and modern. It was spotless and had everything we needed for our stay. The furniture and king sized beds were comfy (soft mattresses). Lots of nice, soft towels in the bathroom. There are so many windows so it's nice and bright, but there are room darkening curtains for sleeping. The location is super convenient to restaurants and Kroger (with a Starbucks inside) and parking is right outside the front door (with space for 2 cars if needed). We will definitely book again next time we visit family in Fremont!"

You can tell a lot of thought and character has gone into this place. When we arrived, another guest had needed medical attention and she went above and beyond to flag down the medical personnel that was on their way. She very very much cares about her guests visit. Would recommend to anyone. Well worth the stay."

Its newly refurbished (new bathroom, comfortable beds), yet with the charming details of an older property. Clean, cozy, and the kitchen was well-stocked. Communication was quick and easy.

Our host was on site and made sure all our needs were met.
I would definitely go back again if in the area. You will not be disappointed
Trudi"

Quick and kind communication, extremely warm welcome from Jeanne and her family, and The Apartment is as clean and beautiful as it looks in the photos. Also well-stocked with everything you need. Gorgeous property abutting a nature preserve—my two kids under 5 loved running around in the yard after a long day in the car. We then watched a beautiful sunset from The Apartment’s big living room window. Hope to stay again on our next trip through!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donald came and spoke to us personally which was super nice!! The price was very affordable, beautiful river behind the house, good parking, very clean, lots of towels, coffee was great, an amenity not listed is the toilet has a bidet which was amazing!!! The only complaint we have is that the stirs going up to the loft are rough on bare feet, due to them being a grate. But the stairs make the place feel more unique and rustic!! Right down the road is a delicious unique diner (speed trap diner). Over all we’ve had a wonderful stay here we highly recommend it!! 10/10!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Don was really nice and even brought us cookies. He has put a lot of hard work into his property and it shows. We enjoyed staying by the river and the campfire pit.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Donald and his wife were incredibly nice. Everything was clean and organized. They even provided things in case you forgot something.

Thank you for being wonderful hosts.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife wants our honeymoon there after 25 years without.
If you are looking for the Trump Tower, this isn't it. This is much more cozy and comfortable. You can get in the dual recliner and take a nap with the TV on. If you wake up too early, you can crawl into bed on the super comfortable mattress to finish the refreshing.
Perched high on the bank of the Portage River, it is not gold plated; but has it's own really cool patina.
The hosts have provided everything you need, from makeup removal pads to binoculars.
Think it's been too long since you renewed your undies? They have gadgets that will clean and dry them for you.
The list of provided ""make your self comfortable"" items in your home away from home is long.
The grounds around your temp abode are very natural and delightful. You may see :

Rabbit munching grass by the deck
Chipmunk running around wondering why you are watching him
Red headed woodpecker at the feeder.
YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED
LOVED IT"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and cozy
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"""Don't judge a book by its cover"": even tho it doesn't like much, this house exudes rustic charm! Beautifully remodeled/updated interior with a lot of repurposed material gives it the feel of old and new at the same time. Great porch at the rear overlooking the river. Very comfortable with all the amenities. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place to stay we really enjoyed it.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Cabin by the river appears modest from the outside but feels spacious on the inside due to the vaulted ceiling. The house was well-appointed and exhibited an interesting use of reclaimed architectural elements. It was comfortable and well served as a place to stay for my visit to Woodville.
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were willing to make things work even w/ inaccurate description/photos of the area. It would be preferred that if you are familiar with the area, especially when living on a cliff overlooking water, it’s good to mention that several times.
It’s a nice space for an intimate stay w/a couple/small family. There’s well water which usually isn’t a problem if there’s water softener available. The smell from the water being turned on smelled like sewage, it made people sick. We left and even left our turkey in the home. The host blamed the smell on us and dubbed it “marijuana” even though I reached out and communicated with him the entire time about issues that rose.
We barely stayed 20 minutes total. The sliding back doors didn’t open either. We planned to stay a few days and when it didn’t happen, we asked for a refund and was denied-He was only willing to give us barely partial refund for the inconvenience even during thanksgiving!

There were no surprises, and everything was just as advertized.
The unit is stylishly decorated with modern utilities. We had fun chatting with the kids playing on the street.
Pulling up to parking around back off the alley was extremely convenient. We love walking rails, and the nearby train tracks (not used as near as we could tell) cut through some really neat neighborhoods.
The address is super convenient for grocery etc. if you need, and--the tracks take you in a straight line there--a very easy walk home from the Depo or Chuds if you have a late night pizza or beer!
Definitely will be back!
thx Jacob!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved staying in Jacob's home over the weekend with my family. The home was spotless. It was by far the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed at.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful time staying at this airbnb! In fact, it was probably the best one I've ever stayed at. My husband and I, along with our 2 kids (1.5 & 3.5) stayed in the Everly King Suite and it was great. The small bed was perfect for my 3.5 year old and we brought a pack n play for my 1 year old. There was only a curtain separating the two rooms, so we had to turn our lights off when our kids went to sleep earlier than us, but it was separate enough that we were able to turn them back on after they fell asleep. Continental breakfast was above and beyond the normal airbnb experience and it was quiet and we had privacy even though we stayed in a room in a larger home. Everything was very clean and just as described! There were toys, books, and a playset for the kids. I definitely would stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We first stayed with Cyndi and Jim on a cross country trip to drop our son off at college and were really impressed with the amenities (incredible gardens and right by the river), the cleanliness and thoughtful touches from fans, great bedding and excellent B&B breakfast.

We were grateful for her being welcoming of families with a toddler and infant. The room was lovely, spacious and clean and
it was a good space for us. We appreciated the offering of a continental breakfast, however we already had breakfast plans with friends. We also really appreciated the affordable rate and not having an outrageous cleaning fee. Great place to stay that is close to great parks like Magee Marsh."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cyndi and Tim have a lovely home and were welcoming and accommodating. Things that I was not expecting, but were very appreciated were the use of a small fridge for the guests and the fact that she had almond milk, regular milk, and half and half. She certainly took the time to make sure her guests had what they needed for their tea or coffee in the morning."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything about the stay was wonderful.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed at Cindy’s many times. It’s the perfect beginning and ending to our vacation. What particularly struck me this time was the way Cindy keeps adding amenities that are super helpful to travelers. For example, the decorative pillows on the bed were new, and a refrigerator with the freezer was provided for our use. And it’s only 3 miles off the toll road. We will be trying to stay with Cindy every time we go to Michigan."

The home was prestine, very clean and organized. It had everything we needed. Breakfast in the sunroom was so peaceful watching the birds. There was a great variety of choices of things to eat! It was beyond just a continental breakfast in my opinion.
Downtown Elmore was so quaint with many shops and things to see. We got ice cream. Shopped at Mantiques (antique store for men) but us 4 ladies enjoyed going through it, many interesting things from history.
We had a dill pickle pizza at DeStazios, it was so good! So was the Mac n cheese and potato pizza.
Speed Trap diner is a must if you like retro, great food, unique place."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"after a long day of travell l looked forward to staying here once again. The Suite had individually controlled AC as well as the quietest small fan, making air circulation very pleasant. Bird watching materials and an active bird feeder outside the patio made for a pleasant breakfast of yogurt and granola...even a visit from a cardinal. Elmore is a unique picture of villages from years past."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Here for work, my family visited for a week, and we chose Cyndi and Tim's wonderful home directly on the scenic Portage River. A bird-watcher's paradise, we were entertained daily by the colorful display of robins, cardinals, chickadees and blue-jays attracted to the bird-feeders mounted just outside the wrap-around windows of the sun-room. There we could help ourselves to coffee, Danish and other breakfast treats set out there by Cyndi for her guests.
Our private suite upstairs from the main entrance was easy to access. The grounds were beautiful to wander on a sunny early spring day, and we lingered on the back deck overlooking the river. And our hosts allowed us to prepare a meal in their well-equipped kitchen. By and large, it was a very pleasant, quiet and restful stay and well recommended for weary travelers looking for a cozy, quiet refuge in a stunning setting."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cyndi and Tim’s place make for a wonderful, restful stop for whatever reason you may have.
This is our second stay here , it works out very well for our road trips to Chicago.
There is a small town( street) where you can grab a pizza or burger not far from the house.
The location is very peaceful and the house is welcoming and homely.
Provisions for breakfast is a plus and just makes that part of the day easier.
We enjoy this spot for our stay over and would always look here first to stay.
Thank you Cyndi and Tim."

Everytime has been a great experience!!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tim and Cyndi are a very welcoming and friendly couple. Their place is charming and has a at home feel. We stayed in the suite with our two littles with one being in a pack n play, and there was plenty of space for us. Our 5 yr old could have played for hours with the toys that they have available. While the town maybe small it has plenty of options for dining. We'd definitely stay here again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Always a pleasure to stay at Cyndi’s beautiful and peaceful home in Elmore. We are repeat customers, and would highly recommend Cyndi’s place. It’s Everything we want in an AirBnB!!"

Her continental breakfast was incredible...fresh fruits, breakfast bread, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, cereals and beverages. Plus you enjoy all of this from the beautiful sunroom. One of the nicest airbnb's we've ever stayed in!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic host! Highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the first trip we had ever made using Airbnbs along the way, so we only realized this was a shared home halfway through the trip. While we were a bit apprehensive at first, in the end the experience was wonderful. We arrived a fair bit later than expected due to traffic in the Chicago area, but Cyndi was still there to greet us and get us situated.
The room was beautifully furnished, the master bed had plenty of pillows, and both rooms had nightstand charging ports for our phones. The two bedrooms are only separated by a curtain, but this didn't pose a huge issue for us since we were only spending a night. There were bottles of water provided as well as a package of Oreos which were greatly appreciated.
The shared bathroom didn't cause any issues either, and was also well stocked with the necessities. Lastly, the sunroom off of the shared living room was amazing. Plenty of breakfast options to get the day started. If you're into our feathered friends, you're in luck as well, bird feeders aplenty.
Thanks again Cyndi, we hope to be back soon!
-Adam, Brenda, and Dorothy from NY"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place to stay after a long day at Cedar Point. We arrived late, but the check-in process was easy. They had us set up beautifully. Our three kids were very comfortable in their room, and we were very comfortable in ours. Everything was clean and very inviting. There was a cute little breakfast set up in the morning. I’m glad we chose this place!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cyndi and Tim and their place was easily one of the best experiences I've ever had with AirBnB. They were incredibly clear in their communications and notably generous with amenities and food. The suite itself was in impeccable shape--mote than what I'd expected. Most remarkable of all, though, was the unbeatable price. The entire way through, Tim and Cyndi were exceptionally patient, kind, and professional. Thanks again!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow! Incredible hospitality! Cyndi and Tom were incredibly responsive, communicated all rules and directions so clearly, and have such a comfortable home.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gosh, what a lovely well-appointed place in an idyllic setting! We arrived at midnight after a long hot day at Cedar Point and some rain-delayed travel, and were grateful for the incredibly comfy bed, easy check-in, and abundant bottles of water. Next morning we were off early for more roller coastering, so it was wonderful to be able to grab a few granola bars from the sunroom on our way out. Next time, though, I’d love to sit and savor! Recommended without hesitation."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a beautiful home and the beds were very nice. They provide a nice array of breakfast options including healthier options. The outdoor space very beautiful as well. Lots of nice amenities overall. Would be very happy to stay there again in the future if I was in the area.
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Plenty of room for a family of 5 (3 teenagers). Kids had their own private room, away from us. The king bed was extremely comfortable and having breakfast for us was the icing on the cake. We only stayed one night but wished we had some more time to enjoy the back patio."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a great place to stay! We spent two days for visiting areas around Lake Erie. The place was clean and the breakfast sun room was so relaxing.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had never stayed in a room in someone’s house before. We were a little hesitant about it - especially because we have 3 young and noisy kids. But, this place was so conveniently located and it worked out great! There is a shared entrance, but the suite is right upstairs with a bathroom just outside the door to the suite. We had total privacy during the stay. The kids absolutely loved the space - perfect set up with 3 beds just their sizes and some toys! We appreciated how convenient it was to the interstate. And we had a great rest there - very comfortable."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a great spot for a relaxing stay. We enjoyed bird watching and the delicious breakfast. It was super clean and had the perfect bedroom setup for us and our 3 small children.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Easy stop off the interstate on our trip west. Absolutely loved staying here! So cute, welcoming, comfortable and more amenities than we had time for.

Highly recommended!!"

Wish we could have stayed longer!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really appreciated being a guest in this beautiful home. The setting on the Portage River, with windows that overlook a ""forest"" full of birds (and a sunny breakfast room with bird feeders right outside), make this home feel like a retreat. Whether you're stopping in the middle of a road trip, visiting for bird watching, or just staying in the area, you'll enjoy a clean and comfortable and beautiful haven that's very well set up with the comfort of guests in mind. The hosts are very nice too!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We needed a place tostay for the night after cedar point and we are so glad we found this one! It was beautiful, comfortable, convenient, and had everything we needed for a relaxing, restful evening and morning. Would highly reccomend!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cyndi's place is so unexpectedly wonderful that I can't believe I stayed in sterile, expensive hotels all those years. We decided to look for an AirB&B for 3 of us, and we were thrilled when we discovered this hospitable B&B. It is super close to the Toll Road, but seems miles away... peaceful and serene. The grounds are lovely, the house is beautiful, the rooms are well appointed and spacious (the one we have stayed in, anyway) and it is just a wonderful place to break our journey. We have stayed there 4, maybe 5 (?) times on our way to and from Michigan, and hope to stay there again in the future. Value for money can't be beat! <3"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, beautiful surroundings of pmsbts and wonderful birds signing, love the touch for breakfast. I will be back"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cyndi’s place was beautiful! Pictures don’t justify how beautiful the place is. Tim & Cyndi were easy to communicate with. Would love to visit again.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the homiest airbnb I have stayed in. great value as it can sleep more than 2 with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean, and the breakfast was very well done! The bathroom is potentially shared with other guests, but we were the only ones staying at the time. Very secure, with 4-digit pin locks on the house and the room doors."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Truly great stay. Honestly spotlessly clean. The home is perfectly maintained with a really elegant multi level garden overlooking the river. Beds are ultra comfortable, fans in every room, separate temp controls, electronic locks, every amenity. Breakfast was great with fresh sliced fruit a selections of rolls, cereal and yogurt- even non dairy beverages. Pro Keurig. Cute dog. Nice people. Fireflies at night. A winner."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have Celiac Disease and Cyndi went out of her way to make sure there were gluten-free options and even extras to make me feel comfortable. Very friendly, clean and comfortable invironment."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can't say enough about this place...it was spacious, beautifully decorated, convenient...a balm to the spirit. We didn't get to meet Cyndi personally (in the time of coronavirus this was probably for the best), but we were dazzled by her generous hospitality (incredible breakfast, all kinds of luxurious touches in bedrooms and bathroom) as well as by her sense of style (a beautiful house and garden). Perfect!"

As a Celiac I was very impressed with the Breakfast options available. It was so nice to enjoy a healthy, delicious brekky with options while travelling and the breakfast nook and patio were so peaceful.
Tim and Cyndi have a lovely place and they're very friendly, so made for excellent company/ hosts.
It was so nice to have comfy beds for the whole family. I'm so glad we disnt use our normal hotel accomodations on this trip!!! We would have missed out on a true lovely experience if we had."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay even better host.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful view from the patio. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and found the beds very comfortable. If only we could have stayed a bit longer. Tim and Cyndi were great hosts and very friendly. The room was nicely set up and had everything we needed. We look forward to staying again in the future.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"No worries as we came in to the special suite. Peace was evident and attention to all needs was well done. Morning was relaxed and breakfast area is always a hit. Stars were out as we strolled downtown in the park and bike trail after long car hours. Quiet, comforting."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very nice place to stay. Great amenities. Great location. 10/10 would recommend.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Location is exactly as described. The hosts are very nice and quick with their communications. Very easy access to I80. Perfect for a place to sleep when you’re in the area visiting or just driving through.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Although our stay was very brief here, we quickly realized This BnB Property is truly a Special Place that touched all of our senses; The serene Setting is very calming & we wished we had time to stay & just relax; The interior & exterior layout and finishes are very tastefully done and pleasing to be around; The cleanliness is off the charts & this place can certainly pass any white glove inspection; We didn't have the pleasure of meeting the hosts, but they were very accommodating throughout and after the booking process; It was cold outside, but we would like to come back here on a nice weather day, to sit on the back patio area & enjoy this scenic and peaceful setting; This Airbnb Property fully deserves all of the top ratings and then some............... It's so much nicer than the photos can ever display & will leave you wanting to come back."

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was so beautiful and well done. The room was cute, the breakfast nook adorable, the hosts friendly. I wish I could have stayed longer and that I could visit when the weather is nice to enjoy the outdoor patio. Very nice air bnb all around."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, great people. Thoughtful continental breakfast even included blueberries and milk choices for cereal. Thanks again!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great everything
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is as close to the dream Air bnb you can find. It's close to the highway, but honestly - you drive 10/15 minutes to their house and you'd have no idea you aren't just in the middle of nowhere. They were so kind to us, even though we were hours later than expected. Met us at the door, very genuinely people, very helpful.
The room was beautiful, and had cute chocolate laid out for us, and lots of brochures of what to do in the area. I think I misunderstood the listening - the second ""bedroom"" holds two children's size small beds. Luckily I'm pretty petite and it was perfectly fine for me! It was a little chilly, but that a conversation we had beforehand so it was okay. It was super quiet and peaceful all night.
The breakfast in the morning was a great touch. Fresh pastries, coffee, cereal, orange juice, granola bars, fruit - it felt cozy and warm. We briefly shared the sunroom with another traveling pair and Cyndi made sure to come check on us.
I would absolutely come back here. The atmosphere is great, the house is gorgeous (a little chilly to sit outside, but in a different season I'd live on that deck, phew!), and over all our experience was as close to 5/5 as you can get."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You literally have to come here ready to never want to leave. It looks like a scene from a movie the scenery and ambiance is breathe taking, warm and inviting! My Family and I loved every minute and we didn’t want to leave!!!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Look no further to stay for a warm and cosy experience if you are in the area for a visit to Cedar Point. Cyndi & Tim are spot-on in communicating and making sure you reach the house and check in smoothly. The house itself is a beauty and I would have loved to spend more time if the schedule permitted.
The stay beat my expectations and would highly recommend to anyone looking for an accomodation in this area. High five to the hosts for supporting environmentally sustainable cosmetic/toiletries."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect for a Cedar Point trip. Really nice property, a good breakfast and most importantly a good night's sleep. Would definitely recommend staying with Cyndi and Tim."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay. Easy check-in (even with a late arrival). I would highly recommend staying here.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,An unexpectedly amazing setup! We loved staying at this home!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tim and Cyndi are exceptional hosts. Very nice people. Easy to talk to and communication was quick and easy. Their home is warm and welcoming and in a great location along a river. Beautiful patio area and gardens overlook the river. Very tranquil setting. Thoughtful breakfast selections of fresh fruit, eggs, baked goods, various milks, juices, coffees and teas. The breakfast area was nicely decorated, sunny and bright. The bedrooms were roomy, also nicely appointed and very clean. Loved the pillows.
There is a road closure on their street but the detour isn't much of an inconvenience. The small town closest to their home has very limited restaurants and shops so you'll need to travel 20 to 30 minutes to find a variety.
I highly recommend staying here and would definitely stay here again."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ideal location for travelers exploring cedar point and the Hollywood casino in Toledo.

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great space, wonderful continental breakfast, and great sleep. It felt like home."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing stay! I wish I could have stayed longer, but it was a last minute stay after another reservation fell through, and I had to get home to KY. The bed was so comfy, it was peaceful, private, and relaxing. Breakfast was fantastic!!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at this beautiful secluded house! The breakfast in our own private space was a nice touch too. We would definitely stay here again if we are in the area. The listing says it’s 35 minutes to Cedar Point, but it took us a little over 50 minutes both times, just a heads up."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This property is awesome. It backs up to the Portage River, and has beautiful manicured gardens in the back. The hosts are SO nice. They are very interesting people, and listening to their stories filled our morning. There were so many amenities. This is like a mansion that is now a bed and breakfast. Next time we are in the Port Clinton area we will definitely be staying there if there are rooms available. Our friends that we brought with honestly thought we were lying to them, and some relative of ours let us stay at their house. That's how nice it is. Thank you to our hosts."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great! Very cute and quaint country house tucked away. Very quiet at night and you can see the stars!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very friendly hosts, very clean & neat, TV in the room & wonderful continental breakfast. Local bar has a good, but cheap, pizza if you like, plus typical bar food. Name says it all as it's easy to get to their place off the highway. I'd use them again which is the best rating I can give."

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome hospitality and value your every buck
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I have lost track of how many times my husband and or I and our family have stayed at Cyndi's place. It is always a delight! Two family members are vegan and also some gluten free and we always find breakfast options are pleasing for all.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was above our expectations! Beautiful place, so thoughtful, and we loved the view of the river as we were eating breakfast the back patio."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely wonderful! It was perfect for us and our 2 children! The snacks and children's books were a great touch!

2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is straight out of an HGTV show. Beautiful location, home, and impeccably decorated. Amazing hosts and breakfast better than at any hotel i’ve ever stayed at. You can’t get anything better for the price."

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet, relaxing spot in my favorite small town in Ohio. Close to Magee Marsh and Ottowa wildlife center for viewing the annual warbler migration. I could spend days here soaking up the calm atmosphere of the area."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cyndi and Tim have an absolutely gorgeous house. They gave us a free upgrade to a nicer room and the free breakfast in the morning was amazing. Loved staying here and would do it again.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful house and great host!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfection is what Cyndi’s place is! Just returned from staying four nights and cannot say enough good things! I was there during Biggest Bird week and it was about a 25 minutes from Magee Marsh. The home is absolutely stunning! Blooming trees line the drive and fill the air with beautiful fragrance upon walking up to the door. The common area is to the right as you enter her home and is very large and comfortable, decorated beautifully! Continuing through this a gorgeous sunroom that she has turned into the continental breakfast room . So many choices she offers such as cereals, breads and muffins , hard boiled eggs, bananas, berries and more. There is a little fridge in there with juice, 1/2 and 1/2, almond milk, etc. And, don’t forget the Keurig with many choices of pods and to go cups with lids! WOW! I truly think she should be calling herself a B & B with what she offers! There is a 1/2 bath on that level , and a full bath upstairs where all the rooms are located. The Entire place was spotless and it seems like anything you could possibly need has already been thought of for you!
I really cannot wait to stay again next year !"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A perfect place to rest our heads and enjoy some peace and quiet. We will definitely keep it in mind if we need to stay in the area again!!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and convenient location off the highway! Would recommend anyone to stay at Cyndi's house!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We did a quick stop on our road trip and Cyndi's place was perfect. We have three young kids and the playset outside and beautiful river front property was perfect for our kids to run around and explore after being in the car all day. And the room was set up perfectly for you family. Thank you!!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cyndi’s home was beautiful, the room and connecting room were more than we expected. I slept so good in the king bed!. We had a local pizza place (Marco’s) that was open til 1030pm deliver to her house. Mozart was their cute and friendly pup. Cyndi also provided some good options in the morning for breakfast. My teenagers and I enjoyed our experience and recommend this Airbnb!! Thank you!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Liked it so much the first time that we stopped by again on our way home.
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very, very nice place, beautiful home, location and very comfortable. You will miss out on a great nights rest if you do not book this place. Breakfast bar set up, nice snacks in room and great communication."

Cindy and Tim are perfect host ans everything was confortable, cosy ans sweet.

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My friends and I had a very comfortable stay!
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cyndi and Tim’s house is in a beautiful location, off the beaten path but yet close to the interstate. The rooms are clean and well-maintained, the whole space is comfortable and warm. I’m generally not one who likes to stay where I have to share a bathroom, however, I never overlapped with other guests and it was not a problem at all. Can’t recommend it highly enough, I will stay again should I ever be in the area. The carrot bread for breakfast was out of this world!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tim and Cyndi were great hosts and I found the house and bedroom space and amenities to be comparable to a bnb, not airbnb especially since they bumped me up to the suite with a king bed due to being booked. Location wise it was perfect for me midway between Pittsburgh and Chicago (in case you are following that route) and right off I90. Everything was comfortable, clean and very quiet, and there is a veranda and pond for hanging out on a summer night."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cyndi’s home is beautiful on the inside and out. We loved the quiet morning in the sun room with the breakfast bar and the keypad for the home and for our private room. Cyndi is pleasant to talk with and had nice little touches for our stay.
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cyndi & Tim’s house is just lovely, and our stay couldn’t have been better. I really appreciated the extra special touches, such as excellent toiletries and (most important to me) lots of pillows! The bed was really comfy, and breakfast was very good with excellent coffee. I hope to visit them agIn."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were amazed at how quickly our children warmed up to you and your dog.
This was our first Airbnb, and you definitely both exceeded our expectations and set the bar for our next Airbnb. My family and I cannot thank you enough for your hospitality, quick response, and just general understanding of our noisiness and messiness. We will definitely recommend you to our friends and family."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place for a family to stay, with adjoining rooms and continental breakfast"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Host was very polite and accommodating. The house was gorgeous, quiet and very peaceful."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cyndi and Tim's home is beautiful and in a very convenient location for the I-80/90 corridor. They were wonderful hosts and we had everything we needed at our fingertips. Fresh flowers, yummy breakfast choices, the soothing sound of frogs in summertime. Just great."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful rooms, very child-friendly, super-good continental breakfast, but best of all was the gracious hosts!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We spend a really good time. Cyndi and his husband was very attentive. The house was very clean and comfortable. We had, also, appreciate the handmade cake for the breakfast."
,,,They were very mean ale called the cops and said we “shot guns” even tho the cops found no weapons I believe it was a race thing. We were forced to leave at 9pm because we had 10 people even tho it’s states 11 by the police causing us to leave behind $100 in food and $300 in my belongings smh . Also this is false advertising we didn’t have the “entire townhouse” we are In one third of TWO peoples house spying on us and evading our privacy I do not recommend this space
