The house books seemed picked out of our own library! Seriously, my wife found a book she was in the middle of reading and picked up like we were back at home.

Definitely appreciated the snacks, filtered water and ice cubes in the freezer too; nothing was overlooked.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is really a cute house in Lawton, Okla.! We were in town for a graduation and it was perfect. We ended up having family stay with us and there was plenty of room for all of us to congregate and the beds were comfortable.

2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This is a very rough town and I should not have to spend xtra time getting supplies that the BNB should have if it has a full kitchen. having basic things like a sponge to wash dishes and paper towels would be nice. ultimately we couldn't use the kitchen if we wanted to since we can't clean everything with only a bottle brush. the upside is our host was very responsive when we locked ourselves out and was able to get us in quickly. my family members had an otherwise comfortable stay and enjoyed each other.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The nest has been one of our coziest stays. We travel with our two year old daughter so it‚Äôs hard to find a place child safe. Shae has beautiful minimal decorations that we weren‚Äôt worried about our terrible two year old getting ahold of and breaking.
We checked in extremely late in the evening and the only issue we had was maps bringing us to the apartment complex across the street instead of the bnb. Otherwise the keyless entry was great and the apartment was nice and cool and smelt amazing.
The alley parking is amazing and great for kids to go straight to the car.
Neighbors were friendly and helpful with directions. The bnb is right around the corner from locals highly requested food joints and close to Ft. Still to visit our soldier.
Shae was responsive and helpful. We had zero complaints during our stay. If we ever came back, we would rest at the nest again."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb we have ever been, it was very close to the military base, Fort Sill. Which was a plus, due to our son graduating from basic training. Also if you needed somewhere home-wise to stay if you wanted to hit up any of the casinos, this is definitely the place to stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful house for our family stay, comfortable furniture & bedding with ample space.
We were visiting family to introduce our newborn son, Whitney even gave us a 'Welcome Home' gift for our baby- so sweet! Even our visiting family members were impressed by the home & grew interested in learning of AirBnBs. We made full use of the kitchen (pots&pans were great!), the awesome step in whirlpool bathtub was a treat after a day of cooking. The sunroom was a dream in the mornings (it even has A/C) with our cup of Joe, pups & baby by our side. We hope to make this home our regular stay when we visit family!
** our pup ran out from the garage door (our fault) and the neighbor was able to catch her and held her for us till we realized she was MIA, such a nice neighbor.
couldn't have been the most perfect stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Whitney was an awesome host. She was very responsive and patient as I asked so many questions. Her house was easy to find, it was clean, and welcoming.

The house was very clean with all the amenities you could need. It‚Äôs also much bigger than the pictures show with plenty of room for everyone. The Walk-In Whirlpool tub was a great amenity and the multiple entry points and ramps were also a big plus too. The hosts are quick to respond should you need anything although it‚Äôs so well stocked I doubt you‚Äôll need to! Basically the entire rental gets 5 Stars from us and we hope to come back!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had the best experience ever renting this airbnb. The host came out and unlock the door for us. Only because I was not doing it right. After hours the house was amazing everything was clean. The hospitality was through the roof. I recommend this to anybody looking for an Airbnb in the Lawton area. Mom is handicapped in this house was absolutely perfect for her. I am so grateful for everything the host did to accommodate our stay.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"The pictures do not do this place justice. It was clean and bigger than expected.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly has a beautiful place to stay. It is immaculate, stylish, and comfortable. A perfect mix. One of the best parts of the day was coming back and relaxing there. Kelly was super responsive every time I messaged her. I love the keyless entry and wish every Airbnb would do that - it makes it so easy. Kelly's place is exactly what I wanted. If you need a place in the Lawton area (I was visiting my daughter stationed at Ft Sill), you should try to get Kelly's place."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had an amazing stay at this Airbnb thanks to the incredible hospitality of the host. From the moment we arrived, they went above and beyond to make sure we felt welcome and comfortable. The host was not only accommodating but also incredibly friendly and helpful, offering to go out of her way to bring flash lights in the middle of a black out and making sure all our needs were met throughout our stay. I can't recommend this Airbnb and its host highly enough. It truly made our trip unforgettable, and we enjoyed spending our family day with our soldier at this Airbnb. It‚Äôs was perfect. Thank you so much Kelly!"

We came for my daughters graduation from Fort Sill and location was great, close to base, close to restaurants and stores, and on a quiet street. There were a lot great amenities; more than we needed, but for anyone who wants to cook a meal at the air bnb, there was a a full kitchen, a crock pot/slow cooker as well as a grill out back.

The best part was that it is a duplex where my extended family could stay and we both could enjoy visiting via the joined laundry room. It was perfect for all of us. Kelly was very accommodating and helpful in every way to include going above and beyond by clearing the drive of ice and snow prior to our arrival and letting us know about road conditions the day we arrived.
Without a doubt, when we return to Lawton, we will be looking to stay at Kelly's place!!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Kelly‚Äôs place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures.

2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent communication with Kelly. She went above and beyond when I asked about some workout equipment and had some hand weights available for me to use. Centrally located to downtown Lawton and Fort Sill. Plenty of towels (and cute monogrammed 'makeup' washcloths) available. The kitchen has a skeletal amount of cookware and baking sheets, so if you do plan on cooking, add some aluminum pans etc to your grocery order. She also owns the other half of the duplex, so if you can swing it, rent the other side too. The walls are very thin and only separated by a small laundry area. I totally would have rented the other side to not have to deal with the loud neighbors we experienced during our stay. I have already told friends who have family coming to town of this great place. I would definitely stay here again."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great find! We were in town for BCT graduation and spent a few days. Kelly's place was more than sufficient for the two of us and certainly would have been great for three or four. The proximity to Fort Sill, dining, dessert, grocers and drugstores is terrific and convenient. This home is comfortable, roomy and we'll appointed. The home and neighborhood are well maintained and the backyard a good addition to sit and visit or let kiddos run about. Kelly was welcoming and cheerful when we briefly met and quick to answer when we had a question. We would stay again without question and highly recommend Kelly's place."

I‚Äôve had the good fortune to work with Kelly and juggle dates/properties hosted by her and stay in Bell 2, Bell 1 and Arlington Place over an extended two month period. They are all great properties. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to find one of these properties available - don‚Äôt hesitate to book! An affordable home way from home, very comfortable, all the amenities and modern updates you will need and close to everything. A few minutes from Ft. Sill and in safe neighborhood."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Went above and beyond expectations. I have stayed in pricier and ""plus"" and this by far was one of the best stays I've had.

Stop looking and book this place now, that's is what I did when I was looking and it was totally worth it. This place is simply amazing!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly's home at 1007 Bell Ave in Lawton, OK, was far better than we were prepared for. Hardwood floors throughout, great new kitchen, really sweet bed, as well as nice and comfortable furnishings in the living room and a beautiful dining room table, as well as all the amenities you'd expect from a first class experience.

Very quiet neighborhood yet quick access to the east side of Lawton."

Kelly's place is in a quiet neighborhood with great front and back patio spaces, as well as off-street parking. The remodeled kitchen had all the wares and accouterments I needed for the several meals I cooked there and a W/D if needed. Check-in was a breeze with Kelly's instructions- it felt like she was right there helping me! Great communication, great place, great value! Will book again!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was beautiful, clean, and nearby all amenities you could need and want. Kelly had plenty of supplies you may need and even included a few snacks which made my kids very happy. My child had to still attend virtual school and the internet was very powerful. We didn't have any hiccups while doing school work. There are a few public parks that are walkable and a grocery store that is also walking distance. Medecine Park is about a 20 min drive and worth going to see and do everything it has to offer.
The neighborhood was clean and peaceful. It was nice having a laundry room and not having to drive anywhere. Definitely a place I will return to on my next visit to Lawton. Kelly's place is truly a home away from home."

I was worried about bugs or spiders since there were many outside and we did not find one spider/bug in the home! Home looks exactly like pictures and the keypad lock worked wonderfully. There was a bowling alley about 4 minutes away from the home and a Texas Roadhouse near the bowling alley that we went to.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't believe this cute home was available for our trip to boot camp graduation! Rather than weed through all of the F-book posts about which hotels were nightmares, I opted to look at Airbnb. I chose this because it was close by ... and I was so glad that I did. Micah kept in touch. We were able to check in after midnight. And it was a super comfortable place to hang out and visit with our new soldier. Cute tasteful decorations galore! An inviting comfortable front porch and a place to gather in back as well. Very clean and comfortable. I also enjoyed the complimentary snacks since our flight was delayed and we almost missed our connection and didn't get a chance to grab dinner. And the price was less than a hotel -- I wish we stayed longer."

We had some issues that we needed help with and she was right there when we needed her, but we didn‚Äôt l love the lack of amenities. There was only enough soap for one handwashing. Only one roll of toilet paper for each bathroom even though we were staying for three days three nights. Only one dishwasher pod no paper towels, no dish soap. I understand that it is not always the case to have amenities stocked, but I think hand soap is a basic one.
Aside from the lack of amenities is the house was great."

There were only 4 coffee pods set out for 5 people so we just went and bought our own pods and pot as their pot didn't make hot coffee. Usually at any other AirBnb we have used there has been an array of coffees and teas for the guests. Here there were only 4 pods set out. On the last day we tried to take showers and there was no hot water! Made driving home not very comfortable but the host was caring and gave us back some of our money for the inconveniences. I have many trips to take to OK so we will see if I chose this one again. Time will tell!

It is an older home in a quaint, quiet older neighborhood, but it has been redone and modernized (so have many of the surrounding homes) and the AC kept us plenty cool in the July heat.

One thing they could add that would take it over the top is a hot tub out back."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,We would highly recommend this Airbnb! There were five of us in town to spend the day with our new soldier. This was a perfect location; just 12 minutes from Fort Sill.

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Spenser‚Äôs place was perfect for our family while we were in town for BCT graduation. We have a blended family so this was a great place for both sides to come over to our place and share time with our soldier. We have a handful of teenagers 13-18 and the pool table, games etc plus two living spaces were perfect for both family to spend the afternoon together.
Spenser was great with communication. We only experienced one issue and it was quickly remedied. After we checked in I noticed the house wasn‚Äôt cooling, it was 74 and climbing but not a hot day. I reached out and Spenser watched the thermostat remotely for a bit and agreed immediately it increasing. He quickly arranged for his HVAC guy to come over and communicated along the way. Within a few hours everything was working as it should!
If you need space to entertain teens but relax at the same time I highly suggest Spensers place."

It is important to note that the air conditioner experienced an issue and it was repaired in a few hours. We applaud the ability to acknowledge and correct issues like this. It started getting hot in the late afternoon but the problem was repaired in time to cool off the home to 70 before we turned in for the evening. I could not have expected a better response.

We spent a lot of time at the large kitchen table eating and just enjoying each others company. The game room was entertaining for the kids and adults. Plus, the chest of board games was perfect.

2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Magical, comforting & soothing. We owe you some glade. üíÄ"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very happy with this house. The game room was fun to have. LOTS of space! We had family for lunch and it worked out great. We were in town for BCT graduation. As far as locationit was super easy to get to and from base, there is a grocery store very close by, but this would not be central location to lots of restaurants and such (which wasn't a problem for us as we planned to cook). Kitchen supplies were avaliable for cooking. Very clean and comfy. Communication with host was easy and timely."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Spenser‚Äôs home is just as described, but better! We were in town for our daughter‚Äôs Family Day and BCT Graduation üá∫üá∏ Communication was timely and thorough, check in was a breeze and the home is so warm and welcoming, it‚Äôs like visiting a friend. There were plenty of towels, washcloths, makeup washcloths, shampoo, conditioner, body wash. The beds and pillows were comfortable, as well as the couches. The quality washer and dryer were so nice to have so we weren‚Äôt lugging a ton of dirty laundry back home with us. We were surprised to find salt and pepper and some basic condiments in the kitchen, but most importantly coffeeüôÇ We would recommend this home hands down-if you‚Äôre on the fence, just go ahead and reserve Spenser‚Äôs home, you will not regret it."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"visited from Housto, TX. for my son's army family day and wanted to give him that home feel with a home cooked meal. We enjoyed every minute of it.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very good experience for our first time to Lawton for R&R (we live in OKC). We came down to do a low key celebrate of our 3rd wedding anniversary with our 8 month old daughter. Went to medicine park, mt scott and the wildlife refuge which are all in the same area and about 20 mins from the home. The home is in a good area, so cute on the outside and inside and very spacious. I felt very comfortable letting my baby crawl around due to the cleanliness and the great floor plan. Also it was wonderful they had a pack n play and high chair, very family friendly home and of course the games were an added plus. It was so very comfy, had tons of electrical outlets to charge our electronics and still lounge in bed or on any of the couches. It didn‚Äôt feel like a strangers home, it felt like I was at a friend‚Äôs house with nice cozy throws to use and a roku to watch streaming services and lots of college football on Saturday. Check out instructions were very easy as well. Last but not least, communication was Spenser was easy, helpful and responsive. Overall I highly recommend this home!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this space! It was super clean and comfortable. There was enough room for all of us to hang out together or separately for some down time. Having the game room was a fun touch and our kids spent plenty of time enjoying that:)
Shampoo, body wash, conditioner and plenty of towels available in the bathroom. The kitchen was well stocked with cook/bakeware as well as condiments and coffee.
The neighborhood was quiet and felt comfortable, and there was a grocery store, subway, and dollar general right around the corner. We got grinders from Subway and brought them to graduation at Ft Sill, which was an easy 11-12 minutes to Key Gate East/West.
What really made the stay great was communication with Spenser. We had a very brief issue with WiFi and she was quickly responsive and had the glitch resolved ASAP.
I guess if we had to recommend one thing, the teen girl in our group said a mirror in the 2nd bedroom :)"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great family place to stay! We were in town for a weekend getaway to the Wichita Mountains. The refuge was about 30-40 minutes from Spenser's place. Not a bad drive at all for us. Their kitchen is great and equipped with more than you'll need to cook a great meal. Our son really loved the game room. Much better than sitting the kiddos in front of the TV during some down time. The house was very clean and had everything we needed. There's also a gas station and grocery store just a couple minutes down the road from the house as well. Spenser was so great at communicating with us on check-in and check-out procedures. Some places I have to go back to the original listing to find the information I need, but Spenser messaged us all the details even with reminders and made it easy and simple to follow. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Spenser was a great host. I absolutely recommend this home for families in town for Ft. Sill graduation. The home is close to the base, the Lawton airport and Lawton.

The home was clean and cozy and the host is quick to respond to questions/communication."

Spencer was great with communicating with us during our whole stay. Even with addressing any concerns."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such an amazing time! The house was the perfect get away for my soldier on family day! The game room was the escape he needed for some much needed down time!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is our second stay at Spenser's place within a month which tells how much we love it. We were there to help with our daughter's family's move. Spenser is very caring and accommodating. The game room remains our grand daughter's favorite. Each day she discovers something new.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect place for our little group that went to watch my son graduate from Basic Training. Perfect home away from home and located near a little grocery store for those little things you forgot. Very clean. Loved the game room for activities to do so we wouldn‚Äôt have to leave the house. Beds were very comfortable, my daughter is now wondering where you purchased the pillows because she loves them. I loved the sheets they were very soft. Just the right amount of space to separate if you wanted to or enjoy everyone in the same quarters. Everything was nicely set up and instructions were easily able to be followed. My son loved his time we got to spend together there for his family day. Thanks again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spenser is such a wonderfully responsive host. Everything was thought of from kitchen, to game room, to laundry, to towels and a soap dispenser in the shower. It is very clean, well decorated, with plenty of open space. It is on a quiet block, but still conveniently located."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place for families. Game room keeps the kids entertained! Loved it
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Our only problem was you couldn't turn the air below 70¬∞. We like to put ours on 68¬∞ at night. It was above 100¬∞ when we stayed and the house pretty much stayed at 75¬∞ or above. Other then that the house was nice and the kids enjoyed the game room.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was just as described and as the pictures portrayed. Communication was great and check-in was effortless. The home had everything we could have possibly needed. The game room was great and there were even additional board games for the kids to play with.
The hosts also noticed, after checking-in, the air was higher than usual and sent a message letting us know they‚Äôd noticed and would have someone out the next morning to check on it.
Overall, this was a wonderful experience and we‚Äôd highly recommend booking with Spenser."

2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"All in all my stay was good, she was very helpful and when I said I was getting in late she even turned on some lights for me! The doors did cause some issues, the are very difficult to close fully and the house isn‚Äôt level, it leans into the middle."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, our Great Pyrenees, and I were on the road for days after PCSing from NC to OK and visiting family in Nevada. On our way back home, we booked Caitlin‚Äôs place last minute, and we‚Äôre so glad we did! Caitlin accommodated us on short notice despite our late arrival. Her home was truly a gem!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Caitlin was a responsive host! Her place was as described and is a close drive to Wichita Mountains. Caitlin also has decorated the place very cute and cozy. Thanks for the great stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Caitlin, for the peaceful stay. We loved the home and how comfortable the environment was. I would recommend it to anyone anytimeü§ó"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was fantastic!! Beautiful, aesthetic, functional home."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautiful and so clean! It was exactly as advertised. The beds were comfortable and so cute!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband just needed a one night stay while traveling. He said this house was very comfortable & enjoyed his short stay. Caitlin was a terrific host & recommended an awesome late night restaurant after his long day of travel. Would definitely book here again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent communication and accommodating.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Caitlin was a great host. Her communication was wonderful and she was very accomodating. I would gladly book with her again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay here was amazing. Caitlyn was an amazing host from beginning to end, was extremely accommodating and helpful at every point. I had a very peaceful visit and am happy I got to stay at this property! Loved the small touches like the suggestions for activities and food it was so helpful as I am not familiar with the area. Felt right at home"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was so aesthetically cute and comforting. Felt like home. It was super clean. Had a list of things for us to do. Super convenient.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Caitlin was a wonderful host. We needed an earlier check in and she was able to accommodate just with an extra charge. She was very helpful, friendly and answered all questions. We loved our stay, really felt at home. Definitely recommend"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Caitlin was a great host. She was very responsive and helpful. She checked on me during my stay to make sure all was well after a thunderstorm. The house was nice and clean!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Once I saw the records, We‚Äôre Not Really Strangers game, and MHN painting I knew it had a good, welcoming vibe. The neighborhood and town is older so it could feel a little sketchy at first, but the neighbors are super friendly and talkative, kids rode their bikes, and people listened to music in their backyards so it felt safe. It is fairly quite, but since it‚Äôs an old house you hear every creek and doors open/close due to A/C which spooked me a few times at night since I was staying alone. Not a far drive from grocery stores, Fort Sill, or Viridian coffee (highly reccomend). Elmer Thomas park is a big sunny park nearby good for walking (on less hot days) and it‚Äôs filled with prairie dogs. Not a far drive from the Wichita Mtns Wildlife Refuge or Medicine Park. Host is super responsive and the house was easy to find and get into. I would stay here again when in Lawton."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We needed a last minute place to stay and Caitlin was super responsive and allowed us to book the morning of check in. The house was super clean and comfortable and adorably decorated.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Cait was a great host, very responsive and let us check in early from the heat wave with our dogs which we appreciated a lot!! The place looks like the pictures, very cute decorations, had what we needed in the kitchen, comfortable foam mattress queen bed, and the back yard was well maintained. The only thing I would say is the neighborhood overall was run down - boarded up houses across the street/down the street. we felt uneasy and not welcome walking our dogs around, and had many stray cats. Overall it was a fine experience to stay one night after long travels. Cait was great at communicating and friendly!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute little house! Close to restaurants and the wildlife refuge. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My second time in Lawton & first time staying with Caitlin! The home had the cutest vibe & every room was clean, trendy, and tidy. It was the perfect proximity to all of the activities we wanted to do. She was super responsive & had great recommendations for us for food & entertainment - will definitely choose her again when we‚Äôre in the area in the future üíõ"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"While the neighborhood isn‚Äôt the nicest looking, the house is cute and clean, we met a neighbor who was friendly and it was easy to get around the area from the house.
One of the girls accidentally threw her key away and Caitlin was willing to dig through the trash to find it. Can‚Äôt tell you how much that was appreciated!
Little touches were nice, snacks, a cute postcard and recommendations for local spots were available."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute, clean house. It is evident that the house is a labor of love."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice renovation very well stocked with essentials. Nicely decorated and very comfortable. Will stay again when back in the area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice and respectful. Helped me with a super short notice as well!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Caitlin was an incredibly attentive host who made us feel at home. Her home was beautiful, comfortable, and clean."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The check in and out process was very smooth and Caitlin was very responsive. The house has a fenced yard and security camera in the front. The neighborhood was quiet and easy to get to the highway to drive towards Wichita Mountains, dining options, or to the casinos. Good place to stay if you don't mind a short drive to the refuge or medicine park."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Worked well for our trip
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our favorite Airbnb stay ever!!!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Caitlin's place was the perfect spot to stay at while in the area for some hiking. I highly recommend if you're looking for a great value!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"First Caitlin, I loveeeeee the way you decorated your space. The sofa was sooo comfortable as well.
Wish I had a longer stay to capture photos but for now the experience will suffice.
Thank you for having me ‚ú®üòä"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and nice place. Will book again for future visits.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful Airbnb!! Would highly recommend if you‚Äôre staying in Lawton! The aesthetic was lovely, and Caitlin was a sweet and responsive host. Will definitely stay here again when we come back. Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a nice stay for me and my family we needed a get away and this definitely was the right place was really pretty and clean. They also have really good communication, I happened to lost my purse and they kindly asked to return it."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a really great stay in Lawton - clear communications from Caitlin helped make check-in really easy - great location for access to the City and wider locations
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a really lovely time at Caitlin‚Äôs place! Check in was easy and Caitlin was responsive to any message.
The only advice I have for renters is to check out the location a little and make sure it‚Äôs for you. It‚Äôs sort of an odd neighborhood, but it was quiet and we felt perfectly safe.
The house was absolute adorable and well put together. Everything was squeaky clean and the master bedroom mattress was comfy.
We‚Äôre considering returning in the future! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The place was very clean. Usually you see something that cleaners missed, but not here.
It matched the pictures. The linens weren‚Äôt beat up like some places I‚Äôve stayed at. Caitlin was very responsive and friendly. The couch with built in USB ports was a nice touch.
A negative- the Glade plug-in smell was overwhelming. We unplugged them right away but even hours later when we returned after a long day out the house still reeked. In today‚Äôs day where even dr offices ask you to avoid perfumes that was an interesting choice.
In the future I‚Äôll ask if hosts use overly scented products and avoid those locations.
Side notes:
The neighborhood had a lot of barking dogs that bark at all hours of the night. Pack earplugs or a sound machine when you stay.
If you plan to use the washer and dryer know that a small load took three dryer cycles to dry clothing so start it early.
Overall our stay was fine, if it hadn‚Äôt been such an overwhelmingly strong scent it would have been five stars."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was very clean, cute, and smelled great."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Had everything we needed, beautiful decor & can‚Äôt beat the price!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Caitlin was an amazing host! The decor of the place is adorable and we loved the cute little touches that made it cozy and happy. The shower had great water pressure with plenty of hot water.
The bed was comfortable. We were very happy with the experience."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The host was responsive and helpful and the air bnb looked identical to its pictures! It was super quiet and quaint.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot to get a large family all together in one location! Lots of room for everyone to still have their own space! Loved the fenced in yard and swing set! Quiet street and very easy to locate!
2024-06-01,3,Group trip,Over all great. Met our needs for our large party.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay in Lawton at this home. We were in town for a state golf tournament with our team and the home was perfect for the team. Joshua was great to work with and I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Lawton.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Pleasant home in a peaceful neighborhood.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Thank you Joshua, enjoyed staying at your place. Very clean, everything in order, great place all rooms were comfortable, 2 living rooms and rooms had tvs where we were able to separately view different showings on tv. What's best is there is Wifi available. We were also able to Bar-b-cue in the backyard. Your place is great! I highly recommend your place. Safe, private and quiet. Airport is 10- 15 minutes away. There are many places to sightsee, we liked seeing the buffalo roaming on the plains."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We recently stayed here for my husband BCT graduation at fort sill it was only 11 minutes from base . The house had absolutely everything we needed .

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed here for my son‚Äôs Army BCT graduation. It was located close to base, Walmart, and several food options.
The house had plenty of room to hang out and spend time together during family day. The 2 living room spaces and backyard were great areas to gather. Neighborhood was quiet and felt safe.
We were a party of 7 but there‚Äôs so much room and many beds to fit a much bigger party.
Joshua and Nathan were super responsive and informative."

We decided to add an additional day to our original booking and the hosts were extremely helpful with that and even gave us a discount on the additional day!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,It‚Äôs a quiet neighborhood. The place was easy to find. The driveway was large enough for our large passenger van. Each room has its own cooling system so you can adjust the temperature to your liking. There‚Äôs a large backyard but it was too hot to spend much time out there. Plenty of space for a large family.
