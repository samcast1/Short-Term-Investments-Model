2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house of Ashley was a great place to stay while visiting WVU! Be prepared for the stairs! Whew got my workout in!! Loved the family atmosphere and enjoyed playing games on a rainy night!!! Although the downtown of Fairmount was a less than I expected we felt safe returning to the house and enjoying the amenities!!
Thank you for a great stay!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for a great stay!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I stayed at The House of Ashley because we were taking a weekend of classes nearby. We found this place to be beautiful and just what we needed. It would have been great to have had one more day to spend more time in the hot tub and enjoy the fireplace that A David so graciously prepared for us. He and his wife were very kind to provide everything we requested and I hope they are willing to have us back if we're ever back in the area .
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David’s place is a definite must. It’s quaint and very neat on the top floor of a very historic home. There is a nice yard, a shade tree, seating and a hot tub to enjoy as well!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David was responsive and easy to communicate with. The apartment was spacious, comfortable, clean, and stocked with everything we needed. We had a wonderful stay!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was cute and exactly what I expected. The host was responsive and helpful. I was there for work (nightshift) so basically to eat sleep and shower. Room was accommodating and quiet for a day sleeper.
Be sure you collect all items from your car because the stairs are plentiful and steep😆."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Third floor apartment was ideal for visiting Fairmont State University. My daughter and I were comfortable with the space. Small kitchen was good for heating up leftovers.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great old house!
Comfy and convenient for what we needed to do."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Good host. Would recommend.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was fantastic! Spacious and clean. 10/10 would recommend.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"""The House of Ashley"" was quaint, charming and comfy. This home, from what I understand, was built in 1904 and this is what I based my expectations on prior to my stay. With that being said, I was pleasantly surprised at how ideal the condition of the home was when I arrived. I thoroughly enjoyed the ambience from being in a home with history and character. As far as the hosts, they were amazing. David was nearly immediately responsive any time I reached out to him about anything. I also got to know him on a personal level as he shared details about his family and what they use the BNB and house for as a whole. I even got to meet the resident cat, Karen, during my stay. Overall, it was lovely and I'd 100% stay here again if I ever find myself in Fairmont again. Hands down. No question."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great! Lots of stairs but as long you don’t forget anything in your car it’s good lol
Very homey and cute!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were down for WVU Family Weekend and decided to opt for a less expensive accommodation than those in Morgantown. David’s place was just that, and clean, a very comfortable feel, with all the amenities one would want for a weekend. Our only constructive feedback would be that the larger/double bed could use a new mattress as it was not only uncomfortable but made noise every time you’d move resulting in not the best night’s sleep."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay very much. This house is so beautifully restored/maintained, keeping the history of architecture alive! The host thought of everything and has communicated it so well, checking in on us yet letting us be on our own. Highly recommended for cat lovers."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful spot, awesome host. Beautiful area, nice town, 40 mins from the old Lunatic asylum which was awesome to visit"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,David was amazing. This was my second time staying at his place and I enjoyed it even more than last time. He was very friendly and talked to us for quite some time about the history of the area. His and the surrounding homes are beautifully crafted and provided for hours of employing and wonder for my friend and I. We came for the mountains and waterfalls in Morgantown and fell in love with Fairmont as well! Neighbors were also very friendly!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a short stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"A definite stay if visiting the Fairmont area! The house was beautiful and in a great area, with easy access to lots of restaurants and to the highway. The house also had a large porch you can use and a wonderful yard with a great hot tub. The host was also super attentive and will look out for you! He even helped us start a fire in the fire pit when we were having issues without us even having to ask! Everyone was so friendly and we felt so welcome. We had no problems at all. The place is very nice and affordable. If we ever need to stay in Fairmont again, this place will be at the top of the list!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,David’s House of Ashley was a lovely historic apartment. The furnishings were quite comfortable and the location was very convenient. David and crew were very responsive.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our 2nd stay! It is the perfect place for us! Convenient to downtown Fairmont and did I mention how charming the space is? A perfect space in a quiet neighborhood. Can’t wait to come back again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay!!! This space was perfect for us! Quick and responsive communication from the host. After staying in hotels for several nights for a business trip this was a welcome and nice change of pace. Historic, peaceful and in a great location!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay. The price was excellent as well. As someone traveling around a lot it was nice to have a place that was modestly priced. I would return here again!
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"While a charming building, the kitchen counters had large sticky spots from previous renters. No complimentary bottle of wine as described. Also no kitchen linens to wash & dry dishes. I had to use the bathroom towels."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a peaceful stay in the heart of Fairmont!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, historic spot, with a very communicative host.
Very spacious, comfortable, and at a good price.
Recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A great place to stay in Fairmont! The home is exactly as the listing describes. Keep in mind that includes the stairs to the third floor apartment. We highly recommend A. David’s listing.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great third floor walk up. Exactly as described. Close to interstate and downtown
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great price and location. The flight of stairs is definutely something to watch out of if youre not keen to stairs, as they are a bit tight. 3rd floor is spacious, check in/out was really easy. Definitely recommend this home if you need to stay in this area of West Virginia"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay, what a beautiful old home!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value. Close to everything we needed. Thanks
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Aron and Stefanie were on site to greet us and give us some great recommendations in the area. We were there for our daughters graduation from WVU. Only about 20 minute drive to Morgantown. Had a few drinks at the Rambling Root. Highly recommend the locally crafted beer here. The place is as described and is very cute and spacious for a weekend getaway for us.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley House was a lovely historic home with a separate apartment. As others have mentioned, the apartment was on the third floor, but we were able to manage the well-lit, inside stairs. The space is charming and welcoming. The beds were comfy. You cannot charge the thermostat but the temperature was comfortable. Walked to dinner both nights. Wish we had had time to enjoy the hot tub. Maybe next time!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at David’s! We were performing with the Fairmont Chamber Music Society and it was so convenient, just a few minutes away. Thanks for making our stay in Fairmont great! From Vision Duo :)"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although I didn't use much of the amenities or even much if the space, the kitchen, bathroom and bedrooms had everything as advertised. Hot tub was on and other's used it so it definitely works. Fire pit was offered to use so also available.
As for extra miles, you can't change the thermostat yourself as it affects the house as a whole but don't worry, they are more than willing to raise or, in mt case, lower the temperature.
They had an umbrella that i used in the rainy days and even printed a document for me i needed.
I had a very early check out and even on such a early time they were responsive to my questions.
Good place, would come again and recommend."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The third story space was interesting and very comfortable. We loved staying in this historic home. Super cool to walk to the downtown Fairmont district. Lucked out and caught The Feast of the Seven Fishes. Wished we had more time there.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice old house
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was a great value for the price. Location was ideal for us. The kitchen was pretty well stocked with a few extras like coffee pads. Bed were comfy. The host promptly replied to our questions and needs.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So calming, peaceful and enjoyable, from the gretting we received from A. David and Stefanie (I got lost and knocked on their residence door) to the entire apartment. The apartment is exactly as described...well, maybe better."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, wonderful house. There are many stairs, as other reviews have mentioned. But the apartment is spacious and I had everything I needed. Would definitely like to stay here again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in the upstairs apartment of this charming home. It was
comfortable and cozy. The shower was wonderful; like having a massage and
the towels may be some of the nicest I've ever used. The place was roomy and convenient
for navigating the surrounding area. I would definitely recommend this home.
L. McKinney"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the apartment, it was great! Our entire stay was wonderful and we have such fond memories of our trip to WV."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley house was a lovely place, just be prepared for three flights of stairs. We had a good time there."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a VERY easy place to spend a few days! It was a cute, cozy, and comfortable stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David's place worked perfect for what we needed. The internet allowed working remote with ease, there was a brief moment we had issues but it was quickly resolved when we messaged the Davids. Be prepared there are 33 stairs going up to the spacious loft/apt but it is worth it. The space was more than we needed and in a great location of Fairmont. Every morning I walked to The Joe which has great coffee and in the evenings we walked to Rambling Root and JAG Burgery both delicious. There are hikes within 30 minutes and the Coal Country miniature Golf (10 minute drive) is fun and educational."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely fabulous weekend! Clean, comfortable and the complimentary bottle of wine was just what we needed after a long 6 hour drive! Beautiful home, quaint town, close enough to WVU to see a football game with our WVU student. Awesome and fast communication
with Aaron too. Thank you!!!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay, lots of room, everything you need and clean. Location very good for many day trips to both West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Highly recommend, great hosts, thank you!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet and quaint place. Loved the historical feel. Could use a little sprucing up and attention to detail. But overall good.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Prefer here over a hotel so we have a living room to relax and watch a movie in. Also nice to have the kitchen available even if its just to store and heat up restaurant leftovers! Hosts are friendly and responsive.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This third story stay was perfect for my girlfriend and I for our 10 day exploration of the area. It is central to many points of interest and activities in the area including a handful of great disc golf courses (orange crush: challenging but very rewarding). It is located very close to a major highway which made getting places very easy. The hosts were also very kind and were always willing to reccomend fun things in the area or help us with anything we need! We will be back to stay here again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So much more comfortable than being in a hotel. I like having all the basic comforts of home. Location is easy to find and an quick drive to the college where we visit our student. We will be back!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time at Aaron and Stefanie's lovely, clean, and comfortable, third-floor apartment. The space is attractively decorated with nice views of lovely Fairmont. Aaron and Stefanie's house is a beautiful old home surrounded by other stately turn-of-the-20th Century homes. We really enjoyed our walk through their neighborhood and the downtown area, admiring the lovely architecture. We really appreciated how well-stocked the kitchen was in terms of cookware, utensils, spices, and cooking basics. If you don't want to cook while you're in town, the Rambling Root is within walking distance, and looks like a fun place to have a drink and/or a meal, and if we return to Fairmont, we'll give it a try. In Fairmont, you can pick up the Marion County Trail (MCTrial) which travels through the Meredith Tunnel out to Prickett's Fort State Park, where it connects to the southern terminus of the Mon River Trail. Aaron and Stefanie's apartment is a short, approximately 10-minute drive from the MCTrail parking area. We had an awesome day cycling up to Uffington and back before getting caught in late-day rain showers. We enjoyed ""drying off"" during a visit to the fun to Mountain Dragon Mazery, Fairmont's local maker and purveyor of meads and other honey wines made with WV honey, which is located on Morgantown Avenue about a block from the bike path parking area. We really enjoyed our chat with the owner and tour of the mazery (an old-fashioned word for meadery), and purchased four bottles to take home and enjoy. If it hadn't been raining after our bike ride, we would have definitely taken advantage of Aaron and Stefanie's hot tub, which is available for guests to use. (Same with the fire pit.) If you do stuck with a rainy day, the apartment is stocked with several fun board games. Fairmont is a lovely town with great access to the bike path, and Aaron and Stefanie's apartment is a great place to stay when you visit there."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"No complaints! Space is beautiful and very cool, and pretty centrally located as well! Quick tip though: for the hot water dial in the shower, you actually want it to be just barely set to hot water because it gets cooler again if you turn it too far."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was alright overall.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while visiting family and friends!
The apartment is spacious and well stocked with bath and kitchen necessities. The beds are comfortable as is the living and kitchen area. Smart TVs and strong wifi. The hosts were always available by text. We don't have one negative thing to say about this apartment.
We are healthy seniors so the inside stairs weren't a problem. Just a way to add to our stair total for the day. We were well aware of the stairs from their description as well as other reviews. The stairs aren't straight up. There are two landings dividing them.
We have already shared the David's place with other family members who live out of town, with the warning that we're the oldest so we get first dibs.
Happy to see new businesses in town, especially the Rambling Root tavern/restaurant a stone's throw from the David's. Good selection of craft beers and pub food."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, very nice place. I chose it for price, mostly, since our destination spots were a town over. It's a third floor space so be prepared for quite a few steps. Also, do not try to enter from the stairs outside- that's not where the entrance is.
Even though the owners live there, it's a private space completely separate from the rest of the house. Better than the pictures show. I recommend for a good price and a nice, safe place to stay in the area."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great for our needs. I don't understand the remarks about the neighborhood. It didn’t seem bad at all but we're from a big west coast city.
Aaron was an awesome host. We had plenty of privacy, beds, were comfy, water pressure and heat was top notch. We appreciated the games and smores fixings. The stairs are narrow and a bit steep but that is mentioned in the details and they didn't bother us. We would totally stay here again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, cozy, and exceptionally quiet. Great stay and friendly host."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space in a lovely home. Close to everything we needed it to be our stay. A+ host with thoughtful touches and fantastic communication.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place great location great value
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean and well stocked with everything we needed, in addition to a few extra thoughtful touches by the host. The separate entrance and access to the entire floor offered complete privacy."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful apartment ! Perfect place to stay in Fairmont and near Morgantown !
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely 3rd floor apartment in a historic home. So much character. The hosts were wonderful. They were very accommodating and readily available as they live on the premises. There are 33 steps to get to the apartment so if you have a hard time with steps that may be something you should know. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom had plenty of towels and supplies. All in all a lovely place and if I come back to Fairmont, I will definitely stay here again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for where I needed and I absolutely loved being able to stay in this historic third level instead of a boring chain hotel. Everything was very comfortable, spacious, lovely view out every window. Smart TVs and a delightful little bar. I just loved it. I want to move into it! Haha"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Aaron and Stefanie were warm and friendly hosts. They were very easy to work with and had a plethora of knowledge about the community and surrounding areas. I rented the space with my sister and sister-in-law for my birthday and used it as a home base while we explored Cooper's Rock. Our hosts offered suggestions for events and eateries and even extended an invitation to join them for their four year old's birthday party.
The space was clean and well stocked. I don't think we had to run out for any of the basics. They even left supplies for s'mores and a bottle of wine. The rental is on the third floor and offers two bedrooms, a full bath, kitchen, and living room. There is a fireplace and hot tub, which we would have loved to have utilized but we ran out of time.
If you've never been to Fairmont, it is clear that the occupants are working hard to restore the historic buildings and really build up the community. We loved The Rambling Root, Poky Dot and Jag Burgers and Brews. Everyone we encountered was extremely friendly and helpful. Would definitely rent the space again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The House of Ashley was in a the perfect location for a quick getaway from Columbus, Ohio. The house was beautiful and clean and in easy walking distance to restaurants in downtown Fairmont."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would stay again in the future!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Communication, had everything we needed. Great stay!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little 3rd floor suite with great amenities. There are a lot of steps to get to it since it is on the 3rd floor but other than that real nice place. Would recommend
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice place to stay in Fairmont especially if you are a fan of history. This old home is located in a convenient location and although the weather wasn't cooperating with us, there are some amenities there I wish we could have taken advantage of. Keep in mind that it is on the third floor so be sure that you can handle stairs before booking!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here. The kitchen was well equipped in case you'd rather cook for yourself, which was our case. The hosts were always available with prompt communication as well. Would stay here again!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy, spacious, and welcoming. I absolutely love this spot. Perfectly located in the middle of Fairmont with easy access to main roads. Hosts are friendly and communicative. I 100% recommend this spot to anyone traveling through or visiting the region."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My favorite part of the rental was the three flights of stairs! Every time you ascend, it's like you are stepping back in time. The woodwork is beautiful, and there is lots of it still in original placement throughout the guest suite. There are also some antique furnishings that are familiar in many West Viriginia homes. The hosts were actively having gardeners keeping the place looking nice, and it is located right next to the Fleming Mansion, another beautiful older home that is currently managed by the Women's Club in Fairmont.
In all, it was very nice to finally stay in this area of town during the visit with my extended family. I think it will improve significantly as more people, like our hosts, continue to invest in the ongoing downtown revitalization efforts. We also enjoyed a couple of the new restaurants and pubs nearby, as well as the standby favorite Muriale's."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice space. Fit our needs well.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Some nice little spots close by and also has a great view of the river and bridge just down the road.
The stairs are a little rough getting up after a night out, but nothing that the awesome hot tub can't fix!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,amazing
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location. Place met our needs for the weekend. Hosts were friendly and helpful when we had an issue figuring put the TV.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"CLEAN, beautiful, safe, comfortable, and warm stay."
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lots of good to say about this particular Airbnb! Good comm with host, unit was clean. We really enjoyed our weekend in Fairmont and getting to explore local places to eat and the area. Few things to consider when renting- 3rd story walk up which would be troubling for anyone with mobility. We had no issues. Kitchen has utensils and things for eating but limited napkins or paper supplies. Keurig coffee with limited supply of k-cups. The thermostat is very bright in the main bedroom.
We did not take advantage of the hot tub but it looked nice with plenty of towels. There is not a whole lot to do in Fairmont in the winter but a nice charming WV town all the same. If we come to the area again, would definitely come back."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay! Really enjoyed all the personal touches they had put together in the bnb. The hot tub was a fun surprise, provided plenty of towels. Everything was honestly wonderful its hard to know what to write about. Very clean, provided everything, kitchen had everything we could need."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at the historic Ashley house in Fairmont. The space was very clean and well-maintained, the host provided excellent service and communication, and the central location is very convenient for traveling in and around the Fairmont area. The monumental staircase could prove impassable for some travelers, but was not much of a problem for us. Once upstairs in the unit, we even found that it was baby-proofed to a degree thanks to an abundance of doors."
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice place to stay for where it is located. Most of the things to do are at least a half an hour away if not more. The city looks like it used to be beautiful and a great spot for tourism but is now pretty run down. Was a good place, just wish I would have known ahead of time about what the city was like where it is located."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A. David's place was very cute. Alot of stairs though so one must be in fairly good shape. We never had a problem with communication and always got prompt responses to our questions. Lots of strong sprayed hot water in the shower. Place to cook where you could see and here the other guest's in the living room. Near Fairmont College and all the little quaint things a small town has to offer. People in WV seemed very friendly. Had a great time visiting and cooking for my grandson who goes to college there.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice suite and kind hosts
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very clean and the host was very accommodating and helpful.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the best Airbnb experiences I’ve had so far. Would stay again.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Not just the place to stay, but even the location of the house. The space was used really well; it was like staying in a spacious apartment. The house is minutes from everything. I would definitely stay again!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and roomy, had everything in kitchen that was needed for cooking."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little spot in downtown Fairmont. The host was very communicative with us and it was as described. Great spot. Great water pressure heat etc. my son and I felt very comfortable there on a weekend trip to Morgantown to go to the ball game
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute rental in a historic house. Very spacious. Nothing fancy, but great for the price. It was clean and smelled great. It is 3rd floor, but has private entry. No issues with finding street parking right outside my door."
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and good communication from owner, location was not so great however. Abandoned lots on all sides of the house and once we walked a few feet from the house we were immediately followed by two people that began harassing us. The place is nice, just not in the best area, just a heads up!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a picturesque building and apartment to stay in, nicely furnished and decorated. We found previous reviews to be very accurate as well."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Located in the beautiful town of Fairmont, this was a great place to stay!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice time pretty clean place decent location.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a nice stay at this place. No complaints.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for a quick, quiet stay!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for two nights, and everything was great. The beds were comfortable, wifi is fast, and the shower pressure was great! Don’t hesistate to book this unit."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice rental with quick access to the surrounding area. Great value for a single person, a couple, or a small family. While not super spacious, it still had two bedrooms. a decent bathroom, small kitchenette, and living area. Would recommend."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay here! We really appreciated Aaron’s hospitality and suggestions. The wine, smores, and hot tub really helped make the stay relaxing and fun!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Apartment was very comfortable and clean but renter needs to be able to climb 2 flights of stairs (was no problem for us).
Overall Fairmont location is good for exploring other parts of WV but the area around house has no restaurants or evenings activities."
2021-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location, the parking situation, and the price are great! It’s close to the interstate and easy to find, as well as close to lots of dining options. The suite is cute, spacious, and quiet. There’s a private entrance so it really feels like you have your own space without disturbing the rest of the house. There’s complementary wine which is a nice and thoughtful touch.
I was very proactive in reading reviews for this and other Airbnbs in the area before selecting one for my trip and I was impressed with the reviews for this rental and felt confident in booking it.
I was disappointed, however, to find that the unit had not been cleaned very well or at all before our arrival. The owner has been alerted to this, and I’d happily stay here again if that issue is corrected for future bookings."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Would definitely stay here again. Note, the key box is inside the door frame."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Central part of town and very convenient. The loft is cute and spacious, and Aaron is very friendly! He went above and beyond not only for the stay but even after we checked out!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Recommended! My husband and I stayed here for two nights while visiting family in the area. The place was huge, much bigger than the photos! But it is only for those who can go up two steep flights of stairs with their luggage. That being said, the place was clean, tidy, and very cozy. The bathroom was setup with an odd floorplan so it felt a little cramped near the toilet, and the shower was a bit poorly lit (but clean!). We definitely recommend this place."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"a place where you can rest, at the same time enjoy a good wine for the atmosphere you breathe, read a good book... a place where you can rest, at the same time enjoy a good wine for the atmosphere you breathe, read a good book ..."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very welcoming and great response time to any needs or questions :)
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ashely House is wonderful, the most pleasant stay I've had on Airbnb. The owners are extremely prompt to reply to inquiries (within minutes). The house comes pleasantly stocked: with the ingredients for s'mores, tiny boxes of cereal, and a bit of wine, if that's your thing. The architecture is immaculate. I'm obsessed with history and this property does not disappoint. The owners have made an effort to preserve the aesthetic with antique furniture and vintage touches throughout the space. There is a deep-pile rug in the living room so soft and thick I could have slept in it. The couch is extremely comfortable, as are all the beds.
The house is within walking distance of a beautiful scenic overlook, a view of the river with blooming honeysuckle by the road, and neighboring mansions, as well as many restaurants and stores downtown. There are endless huge white fluffy towels for your shower, along with shampoo and conditioner. There is a first aid kit in the bathroom among many thoughtful of additions. There is a Keurig with dozens of k-cups available to select. In addition to the fifty-inch TV in the living room with every streaming app available, there are two additional TVs in each bedroom.
There are hardwood floors and the doors all appear to be original wood with their original knobs. It has been very well-kept and professionally updated while still preserving its character. Ryan, whose wonderful personality and kindness were a highlight of our trip, is available to help you with whatever you need.
I want to further emphasize how pleasant my stay was, but this is already turning quite long, so I will just say if you are planning a trip to Fairmont, Morgantown, or anywhere nearby, this is a wonderful option and I enjoyed it so much."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice location, the hosts were super helpful at check-in!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home is beautiful and extremely peaceful. Location is close to a lot of the fun activities in Fairmont. Great host with a beautiful home to offer. Cannot recommend enough!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is truly a gem... peaceful location.
Exceeded our expectations.
Dave could not have been a better host... he even helped me with a little surprise for my wife's birthday helping make it a special weekend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice house, quiet area , had a great stay"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adrienne and Dave’s place was pristine, beautiful and in such a peaceful location for the perfect low key getaway. It has all the comforts of home and the hosts were great at checking in and making sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend the copper house!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always perfect! The best place to stay in Morgantown.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The copper house is a nice private getaway. Enjoyed the lake and wrap around deck. Short drive to downtown Morgantown.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home on the small lake. Enjoyed coffee on the deck and watching the wildlife. The bathroom and kitchen were well stocked. Very clean and bright - with lots of windows to view the scenery. Easy to connect with the hosts. Thanks for a wonderful stay. We highly recommend Copper House!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our short stay at Copper House! The space felt very homey but had such a beautifully designed interior. My wife and I went for a relaxed babymoon together but would love to see this lake house in full glory during the summertime. The wrap around deck was an added bonus for stargazing and quiet morning conversations. Very quaint location teaming with wildlife (and nearby chickens!) but the location was also conveniently located close to Morgantown -- perfect for a getaway! Adrienne and Dave were very kind, we'd recommend this spot to anyone!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was very peaceful and just what we needed for the weekend. The location was nice and quiet, the view of the lake was gorgeous, and the inside of the cabin was so comfortable. We also loved watching the chickens! We’ll definitely be back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"As other's have stated in their reviews, the cabin is in a serene setting with birds, water, chickens, and simplicity. The following is not under control of the hosts but I imagine because the leaves were not yet formed on the surroundings trees due to the season so some of the road noise sneaks through but this time of year that that's a factor would be a little push to really spend too much time on the beautiful deck. The seasons supporting leaves on the trees would be much better I'm sure but I feel it's necessary for someone to know going into it. Other than that, the hosts were EXTREMELY catering on a couple of matters that really made our vacation a true pleasure. Add to that the beautiful scenery... I could not be more pleased."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time here and we love it! Great location, adorable house, great kitchen and drivable if you want to get something!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A small cottage so well appointed where you can retreat and rest. The kitchen was so well appointed that you could make food like at home. The bed was very comfortable. We loved the visit to the roosters and chickens coming in the morning near the house. The path to get there is a little tricky sinceit's in dirt and it rained a lot when we were there, but you just have to take your time and everything is fine. I would 100% recommend the Copper House. Thanks Adrienne and Dave."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was a perfect spot for a quiet weekend getaway. the hosts were very accommodating and responsive and the house was very clean and well taken care of. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to visit again. Lots of wildlife to look at and the lake and surrounding area looked beautiful in the snow we had. A relaxing weekend sitting in front of a cozy fire was just what we needed.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was perfect for what we were trying to accomplish, which was disconnect and relax. The fireplace was awesome that it had a thermostat controlling it so it would automatically come on and turn off as needed.

It was the relaxing getaway we were hoping for."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just a perfectly situated house in a beautiful setting. Wonderful water views from the inside of the house. I cooked a Christmas dinner in the perfectly stocked kitchen. Thoughtful touches everywhere- from walking sticks and an umbrella, to a mixer and crockpot. Just so well thought out and gorgeous. Would be a terrific summer vacation home"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time, the location was stunning. Adrienne and Dave gave excellent directions, easy check-in, and were quick to reply (though I really didn’t really need to communicate much since everything was perfect). Kitchen was well stocked, and included many pantry basics. Location is so peaceful and quiet, right on the lake. We enjoyed the company of many free range chickens, much to my daughter’s delight! Would highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a cozy cottage for us! Just a quick 15 minute drive to the Milan Pusker Stadium with great food joints along the way.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place truly is a gem! Very peaceful, beautiful and warm. We enjoyed the scenery and calmness of the area, and easy access to the main road. This is a place for you to get unwind and recharge for sure.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cottage with gorgeous view of the lake. We really loved the deck and fire-pit. The weather did not cooperate but still really enjoyed ourselves. The kitchen was beautiful and well equipped. The chickens greeted us haha. Great weekend away.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful house. I would recommend to anyone. We were there for a WVU game and it was easy to get there, about 20-25 minutes to our lot with traffic. Large cable tv selection for our rainy evening inside. Very secluded, beautiful inside and out. Would be great for a getaway with lots to do on site (kayak, hike, secluded deck with fire pit, etc) Loved the snacks on arrival and coffee in the morning. Thanks for sharing it with us!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved this AirBnB! The lake view was great— particularly in the heart of fall with the changing leaves. The house was lovely and very well-equipped. Highly recommend it!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy lake house cottage in beautiful surroundings in the fall. Wished the rain hasn’t put a dampener on enjoying the awesome deck and amenities. Clean home and responsive hosts. They even left out some snacks. Clear instructions and easy check in and check out. House is down a rough dirt road, so be prepared for that. And not much else around so expect to drive a bit to get most anywhere. A bit further than anticipated from downtown WVU campus but a very easy drive."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a wonderful staying at Adrienne and Dave’s place. Gorgeous scenery and really nice amenities for outside so we could enjoy our time at the house when we got back. The place was very clean and had everything we needed for a weekend getaway. I would definitely come back next time we visit WV!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The copper house was a beautiful place to stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay. Dave met us personally upon arrival and made us feel comfortable from the start. What you saw online was what you got in person. Beautiful all around. Wish we could have stayed longer. Look forward to coming back soon.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had another amazing weekend at the Cooper House. This lakefront home is absolutely beautiful inside and out. The location is beyond peaceful. Dave and Adrienne are outstanding hosts and have thought of everything to make your stay very relaxing. This is our 3rd visit and we will keep coming back.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Walking into the Copper House was just as beautiful as the pictures looked. The location was great! We had the chance to go shopping and out to eat then come back to a secluded peaceful oasis! Sitting outside on the deck watching the neighborhood roaming chickens and the birds was the highlight of our weekend! Adrienne & Dave were responsive and accommodating. We will definitely be back for more relaxation!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adrienne and Dave’s house was an amazing home away from home. The lake is beautiful and the neighborhood is very quiet. We loved having our morning coffee by the lake and going fishing all day long. Morgantown was a short drive away and we found so many amazing restaurants to eat at. The place was very clean and comfortable. The heated bathroom floors were AMAZING! We loved every second of our stay. I would highly recommend booking a stay here!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our relaxing time at Adrienne & Dave's and all their thoughtful details. Great location for taking day trips to the many state parks in WV.
Thanks for everything!!!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adrienne and Dave’s place is so peaceful and serene! House is clean and very cute. Perfect location for a couple or small family to enjoy some peace and quiet away from city hustle yet close enough to Morgantown for restaurant and shopping options.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Adrienne and Dave’s place was lovely and peaceful. It was close to all the things we wanted to do. My girls loved the paddle boat and the friendly duck. The place was nice and clean and we felt at home.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I would give Adrienne and Dave 10 stars if it were permissible. We stayed for 3 weeks and found them to be attentive hosts and very responsive to any request. My favorite part was relaxing on the deck, and the peacefulness of the property. I definitely hope to return for another vacation."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is nice and clean. It has very peaceful views of trees and water. Bring your own food and fun!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second trip and it was just as lovely as before. We loved coming back for some spring weather so we could enjoy the kayaks and pedal boat. Though I'm convinced there is no bad time to visit Copper House! The house is cozy, well appointed, conveniently located and offers such peaceful views of the lake. It serves as a great jumping off point for all the great activities nearby including state parks, and downtown Morgantown. Thanks for having us Adrienne and Dave!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"An amazing adventure for two youthful boys that love fishing & kayaking; it was beautiful both inside and out, and the hosts are gracious & friendly."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful Place, lots to do the four days we stayed. Glad that there was a grocery store and restaurants 10 mins down the road. And Major Highways 10 mins too. Dave also came the second day to see how everything was going. I feel like they went above and beyond for us. Will be booking agian in the future, such a nice place. Enjoyed our stay."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Adrienne and Dave's Copper House is a slice of heaven. The setting in the woods on a lake makes for a peaceful, secluded -- with the exception of visits from gaggles of geese, trio of white ducks, neighborhood roaming chickens, and chirping West Virginia birds. The house itself is divine: every creature comfort was anticipated, the wraparound deck felt glorious, and the interior design clean and comforting. The best part? Meeting Adrienne and Dave!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was the perfect place to stay for a few people outside of Morgantown. A short drive away from the college campus. We only wish we would have found this spot 4 years ago.
Everything was clean and organized to make guests feel comfortable."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house on a small lake in the woods. Great place for birding and canoeing. Very Quiet area as well. The hosts were super friendly, had quick responses, and were very helpful. The house was very clean and had everything you would need for amenities. We did have a power issue due to a tree branch falling, so we did cut our trip shorter than planned. However, the hosts were very understanding and did give a full refund in a short time period. We will be scheduling a visit to Copper house in the near future."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Copper House numerous times and have been satisfied each time. Anytime we visit Morgantown, Copper House is our first choice. Adrienne and Dave are super hosts!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adrienne and Dave were excellent host. We met Dave the first day and he was super friendly!
We loved the setting- so peaceful and a lake view. The house was so modern and clean- We loved that they thought of the little details from the kitchen to the outside space. It was just what we were looking for. We are totally relaxed and home. I would highly recommend this AIRBNB!
The road to the house is a little rough- (just go slow)
Thanks again for a great relaxing weekend-
Oh and a couple restaurants to recommend are ""Table 9"" and"" Sargasso""!!
Sue & Chris"

This place truly feels like a hidden gem."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adrienne and Dave were extremely accommodating and helpful during our stay. The weather and high winds caused a power outage and they were very quick to communicate and went above and beyond bringing over a generator to help us.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at Copper house. We were looking for a peaceful weekend getaway in the woods, but were also looking for a place where we could find good restaurants and have some things to do. Morgantown was exactly what we were looking for, and Copper House was in the perfect location (out in the woods on a pretty lake, but within 20 minutes of downtown Morgantown). Adrienne and Dave were helpful and we knew they’d be there if we needed anything. 10/10 experience!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very nice, very quiet and peaceful"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have been to a lot of Airbnb’s and this one was in the top 3! The location, the space and the intention to detail was amazing! Down to the pillows on the bed having a firm and soft option! Not sure if that was intentional but A+. Adrienne and Dave were so kind and helpful the entire time!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very comfortable, beautiful place to stay. It's well taken care of and the hosts are so kind and responsive."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Copper House was a beautiful, peaceful, and private place to stay during our visit to Morgantown. Gorgeous views of nature abound and are visible from every window and the spacious back deck. We preferred to stay in and cook our own meals, so the large kitchen (and kitchen island) were awesome and well appointed. Adrienne & Dave were super friendly, went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. This location will definitely be somewhere we return on a future visit."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adrienne and Dave set the bar with the Copper House. The place is always spotless and the welcome note is a great gesture. They make sure every aspect of your stay is great.
I sent my wife of the kitchen at the Copper House and now she wants to remodel ours. Also, I never knew how much I liked heated tile in the bathroom until visiting the Copper
House.
If you are looking for a place to stay on a business trip or just to get away in the Morgantown area, I highly recommend the Copper House."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, peaceful, clean waterfront house. Exactly what we needed. Hope to return in warmer weather to truly enjoy the environment"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect setting for a wonderful peaceful getaway. My husband and I came here for my birthday and to just unplug for a few days. The home is beautiful...exceptionally clean and full of amenities. We never left the entire weekend and my favorite thing was the heated bathroom floors! So enjoyable when weather was so cold out! Everything you would need to make all of your own meals and the views from the back were breathtaking! The guest information book was wonderful to view and especially enjoyed seeing the before pictures. What you've done with this home is amazing. Cozy and comfortable and we can't wait to return in a warmer season to enjoy the outdoors and hopefully stay longer than a weekend. Thank you Adrienne and Dave

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adrienne and Dave made us feel right at home. Absolutely the cleanest air b&b thus far, a nice guest book with instructions and local recommendations. Dave even took care of the stairs by removing the snow, putting ice melt down, giving an update on the road condition (due to some ice), and giving us some home made fudge on the way out. 10/10 would recommend for a great getaway."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful and cozy little house. It was the perfect stay for my 3 friends and I. It came with everything we needed plus a great view of the water from the deck.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adrienne & Dave set the place up so nicely. They were great hosts and made for a very relaxing weekend. The place is absolutely beautiful and nearby great hiking like Coopers Rock. The kitchen was well equipped and the place was very private and nice. We loved our stay and are looking forward to going back!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cooper Lakehouse had all the comforts of home located in a private community, super quiet and was only minutes away from all activities. We went hiking at Cooper Rock National Forest, with overlooks with amazing views, stopped by Forks of Cheats Winery for a wine tasting, the Blackberry wine was my favorite! We ate dinner at Bourbon Prime restaurant at Marriott hotel, dinner was delicious, we tried pepperoni rolls for the first time, so good."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Lake Cottage was great, and as advertised. It was very clean , it has recently been renovated and it is beautiful inside. The beds and pillows were really comfortable. The gas grill worked really well. Kitchen is well appointed; it has everything you need to make a great meal. The lake front setting is awesome, would love to rent the house in the Summer, it's a great view, right on the water, with a dock. Dave and Adrienne are excellent hosts, very responsive and welcoming, would stay here again for sure."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting, clean, great experience and communication. If you're looking for a place to relax, but is still somewhat close to Morgantown, then this is the placefor you."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I wish I could have been there when the leaves are changing. The home is beautiful.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great relaxing stay! Enjoyed fishing, paddle boating, cooking (kitchen well stocked), drinking coffee and having breakfast on the deck overlooking the lake, and watching the Maryland game. Appreciated having a wide variety of channels and Netflix. Adrienne and Dave are thoughtful hosts! Hope to be return to Copper House :)"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It rained when we were there but still enjoyed our stay as this home was so cozy and welcoming. Also everything was spotless and even smelled fresh and clean as soon as we walked in. Loved the lake out back as my husband was able to fish even in the rain!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adrienne & Dave’s place is beautiful. The views in the fall are breathtaking. The place was super clean and the beds were comfy. The couch can convert to an extra bed which is a nice bonus. Loved the heated floors in the bathroom. Only thing to note is the road to get to the place is very uneven/bumpy. Also very steep at points. My small car struggled a bit. But overall we loved our stay here and would love to come back! Would highly recommend staying here
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Home is very warm and cozy feeling loved the fall feel on the waterfront very peaceful place to spend a couple days away from the everyday hustle!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house: incredible. Location: incredible. View: beyond words. Had the most beautiful kitchen and living area with everything you could need. Beds were very comfortable. Bathroom was quite luxurious, especially with those heather floors! But the winner was the view from the back of the house. It’s just incomparable to anything I’ve ever seen. If you’re even slightly considering a stay here, you confirm it right now!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Another amazing stay at the copper house. Beautiful….Peaceful … wonderful! We did a little fishing and enjoyed the changing leaves from the deck. The home is quaint and lovely providing everything you need for a lovely stay.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to enjoy the fall colors and relax on the spacious back deck over looking the lake. The place is very well stocked and comfortable.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Copper House cottage was such a cozy, relaxing spot with panoramic views of the little lake. The leaves were all changing colors and reflecting off the water in the sunlight. Although it was a little too cold to kayak, this would have been great fun. Instead, we went for a walk around the lake. The kitchen/open layout was lovely and everything was well-stocked, from K-cups, to spices and a few staples. The bathroom with the heated floor was such a luxe touch! The only little trouble we ran into was the TV connection was a little spotty at times but the Wi-Fi worked great. We explored nearby Lake Tygart, as well as had a few meals out at the Boston Beanery and Mariachi Loco, both delicious. I also recommend visiting the nearby Botanic Garden for a great hike. We hope to come back again in warmer weather and enjoy the deck/lake more. For colder days, the fireplace in the living room was perfect. I highly recommend staying here. Dave and Adrienne communicated quickly and were very helpful. The little road coming in is a little rough in spots but manageable."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely fabulous stay! The owners of this property have paid attention to every detail that one could want in a home away from home. Quiet reading by the fireplace was a highlight. And the outside is just as wonderful as the inside! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the large deck and firepit in the evenings. Great location - only 10 minutes to Morgantown. We sampled every coffee shop and can confidently say that if you are headed to the area definitely stay at the Copperhouse and get something warm from Quantium Coffee :)
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely trip! We enjoyed watching the visiting chickens!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home is immaculate and beautiful. The area is so quiet and pretty. An excellent place to relax and get away from it all.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing getaway!!!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a cozy little place with a beautiful view! Adrienne and Dave are wonderful hosts. The house is renovated and has thoughtful details. The heated floors were a fun discovery. We love the deck and being in the middle of the woods. It’s serene & peaceful. It’s a wonderful spot away from downtown Morgantown, yet just a 10 minute drive in to see our son at WVU. It’s clean and has everything you need. We will be back in a few weeks."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful renovations and great location. Excellent hosts and a great experience. We’ll be back.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a very enjoyable getaway. Very happy with everything at Copper House.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is so cute and cozy!
Sometimes I feel uncomfortable in airbnbs because they are too perfect and I feel like I have to keep after my 8 year old to be overly careful or to tip toe so we don’t mess anything up. This place was perfect for us. It was very clean but very cozy and welcoming in all the right ways. We took the paddle boat out on the lake multiple times and it was a nice little lake to paddle around on.
THERE IS ALSO A BEAVER 🦫 that likes to eat the lily pads to the left of the dock area which you can see and hear munching away around dusk. We are very into wildlife so we were super happy to see it enjoying some dinner while we were eating on the deck.
The only bad thing about the lake is that I wouldn’t swim in it- it was a bit mucky and not super swimmable, which was sad because my daughter loves swimming but we had fun paddling on the lake instead. We didn’t take the kayaks out so I can’t speak for them, but they had one green small one and one red larger one. Neither were tandem I don’t think but they seemed to be in great condition.
The lake house is on a very bumpy/hilly road. We drove a Chevy Malibu there in good weather and it was a bit of a bumpy ride for us- but we managed just fine in good weather. I can’t imagine driving it in a car in the winter, a couple parts of the road were a bit steep- and that’s coming from a Michigander. It was also a nice road to stay off of to just take a walk around the lake- not a super busy road.
As well as having a beaver, the lake was frequented by a few green herons which were cool as well.
The kitchen was VERY well stocked. They had a good sized crockpot- lots of pots and pans, and even spices to cook with (although some of them were a little old so if you’re a spice snob like my husband- pack your own)
We usually cook all of our meals and we were pleasantly surprised by how well this Airbnb’s kitchen was stocked.
Bedrooms were comfortable, warm, and beds were comfortable to sleep on. The large bed was softer in the queen sized room- the smaller bed was more firm.
Bathroom had nice towels, hand towels, and heated floor was a treat!
Dave was extremely good at communicating and checked in with us during our stay- we could have asked for anything and I am sure he would have been happy to help out.
We had a super nice stay in WV at this house! We would definitely return, and would recommend staying here."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, Comfy, a WHAT A VIEW! We had the BEST stay! My family and I were attending a reunion just down the street. What a picturesque and sireen location. Right on the lake. The interior was clean, bright and very comfortable with lots of modern touches and style. We will definitely be staying again. Thanks so much!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures don't do this place justice -- and they are very good pictures. We enjoyed a lovely midweek getaway here. The setting was just idyllic. We loved cooking and eating on the deck overlooking the small lake. It was great to kayak from the dock right on the property. We can't give Copper House and our hosts enough kudos. We'll definitely be back!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time during our stay. Close enough to town to explore, but far enough away to unwind and enjoy the beautiful scenery. The house was very clean and check in was seamless. Be sure to check out Oliverio’s restaurant and the breweries in town. They were great!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cottage is amazing and we hope to return some day! The kitchen was very well stocked and I was thrilled to be able to make our son a home cooked meal after moving him in to his apartment at WVU! We loved using the kayaks and relaxing in this cozy and inviting space! Just delightful!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place…there are simply no words. Every single thing about it took our breath away. What a perfect, relaxing Mom’s weekend away. We might just bring our husbands next time!!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our 3rd time coming back and it was lovely as always. Super clean, comfortable and well stocked with all the things you may need when away from home. Looking forward to our next visit!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time here and even better than we remembered. We love it! It’s so cute and clean, close to things but feels like the middle of nowhere. We used the kayaks a lot, and went to the brewery and Mexican place the hosts recommend in the book and both were great."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Happy to have been back at the Copper House. Love being amongst the trees and witnessing all the nature. Had a great time kayaking and fishing. The house is so well maintained, well equipped, and very comfortable."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adrienne and Dave's place is such a nice and quiet spot to relax! We really enjoyed having dinner on the back deck, and the sound of the frogs were fun to hear at night. The house is just outside of town which was convenient, and the beds were super soft. If you are looking for a place with a great view of the lake that feels secluded, yet isn't too far out, this would be a great place to stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a beautiful, quiet and extremely relaxing house and area! Copper house exceeded our expectations and my husband and I had a wonderful time! Fishing was awesome; my husband caught multiple large mouth bass and a bluegill on the lake there! Highly recommend; phenomenal stay 👍"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved Copper House! Great location (so quiet and private) , super clean and well-decorated. The perfect place to relax on the deck by the lake or take one of their boats out and fish. Comfy beds, too!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Copper House is a special property. It is a beautiful and quiet location. The house was spotless and well stocked with utensils and bedding. Beds were super comfortable. Shower pressure and water temperature really good as well. Hosts checked in a couple of times to make sure all was well and were very accommodating. We really enjoyed our stay. It was a perfect location for our visit to West Virginia University!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We miss Copper House already! The home is so well appointed, comfy and thoughtfully designed. The views out every window are just awesome. Adrienne was a wonderful host who truly seemed invested in us having a wonderful time. The location was close to many fun places to visit while remaining secluded and peaceful. Our kids enjoyed the property and fishing from the dock. We hope to come back in warmer weather to enjoy the deck and lake to its fullest!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at Copper House! Adrienne and Dave were incredible hosts, and have really put a lot of effort into this place. The house is extremely well-equipped, decorated, and well maintained. We specifically enjoyed spending time in the living room and the back deck that has a gorgeous view overlooking the lake. Definitely take advantage of the fire pit and fireplace! Cozy and quaint are the best words to describe this house. We absolutely plan on returning during the summer to take full advantage of spending time on the lake and enjoying the scenery. Thank you so much again for your hospitality, Dave and Adrienne!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adrienne and Dave’s house was a lovely long weekend away. It’s quiet, peaceful, and cozy. We loved the fireplace and well equipped kitchen, and getting to relax on the porch with the view of the lake was heaven!"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I rented here for the first time as a weekend getaway. Our stay was wonderful. Adrienne and Dave were great hosts with good communication. The house was very clean and well appointed. We enjoyed having our morning coffee and listening to the geese in the lake. Their guest book had recommendations for local restaurants and even had a few ordering recommendations which we took advantage of and quite enjoyed. We would certainly rent this place again.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy scenic stay on the beautiful wildwood lake made a perfect getaway. The house is well equipped and extremely clean.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful, recently remodeled little gem has everything in the listing and more! We loved the heated bathroom floors, the gas fireplace, beautiful gourmet kitchen, and views of the lake and trees. The TV has cable and streaming available. We enjoyed walking on the roads around the two little lakes which made a perfect 2 mile loop. Adrienne and Dave are super friendly and great at communicating. They live only 2 doors away so were available in case of any problems (we had none!) It was beautiful in the snow but we can't wait to see it again in warm weather."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay!! We want to come back in the summer for the water activities.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adrienne and Dave have a great place to relax and to enjoy time away from the everyday life. From the quite setting to the nice outdoors that surrounds the like. All I can say is everything is perfect.

Will return in warm weather to take advantage of outside activities on the lake."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely place to stay! Cozy, clean cottage with a fireplace on the lake--perfect! Hosts are fantastic, a great place to spend some time."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay in the Cooper house was fantastic! Adrienne and Dave are the best host! We visited during the winter and got snowed in! Adrienne and Dave came and shovel the steps for us and made sure we had everything we needed for the entirety of our stay. We couldn’t have asked for a more peaceful and beautiful house to spend a couple of snow days in!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is great little house in a very nice setting. It was the perfect spot to spend a rainy new years.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is a wonderful place to stay just outside of Morgantown. Well equipped, very clean, relaxing, and comfortable."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had the most perfect stay! Everything you could think of needing to feel comfortable Adrienne and Dave provided and then some. Beautiful inside out will absolutely be returning!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Book here! I reserved this for a weekend getaway from DC. It sits peacefully on a nice lake away from the highway. The home is extremely well maintained and decorated. They have added nice little touches like: biscotti to go with your coffee, matching decor around the house, fully stocked kitchen, board games, etc.
If want to shoot into Morgantown its a quick 15-20 minute drive. I would highly recommend to stay here and will hopefully be able to return in the future. 5 stars.
Please listen to their warning about their driveway in inclement weather. We only had some rain but it's a fairly bumpy dirt road so just keep that in mind."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Copper House is perfectly positioned to see a brilliant sunrise peek from behind the hills and light up the woods across the lake from the cottage. The sunset is reflected in the lake itself. Adrienne and Dave provide everything you need except your food and drink; you can come to the cottage and stay tucked in amongst the trees, the beauty of the lake, and the solitude for the duration of your stay."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay at Adrienne and Dave’s place. It was spotless and had everything you need for a enjoyable stay. Highly recommend!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Adrienne & Dave we’re responsive and great! The place was spotless and really had everything you needed for your stay. It’s so updated and cozy. The porch is amazing the lake is right in the backyard. We loved how peace and quiet the location was. Highly recommend!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A beautiful home on a beautiful lake! The house was impeccably clean and we appreciated the well-supplied kitchen and the propane fire pit on the deck for s’mores. We had great weather for November and were able to take out the kayaks and pedal boat. We saw otters during our walk around the lake! Lots of great hiking in the area. Can’t wait to visit again!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful weekend. Beautiful lake view and lots of fresh air. Just what we needed to relax and recharge.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as advertised. The kitchen has everything you need and the place was very clean. Great hosts!!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view from this house is stunning, the pictures do not do it justice. The house is gorgeous and decorated really well. Highly recommend!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A quiet and peaceful little get-away! We enjoyed taking the paddle boat out on the lake, having coffee on the deck and just being away from reality for awhile! Dave and Adrienne for gracious hosts and were sure to check in. We will return!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Another great stay at the Copper House! Such a lovely setting in the fall with the leaves changing colors. The house has everything you need, is super clean, and so well organized. We will be back!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, quiet, and relaxing! The cottage is very clean and well equipped. The deck area is a wonderful place to sit and relax and, hopefully, catch a glimpse of the deer, ducks, snapping turtle, and geese just like we saw. The kitchen was well-equipped for cooking but, if you’re too relaxed to cook, try one of the suggested restaurants provided in the house guide binder. Adrienne & Dave are wonderful hosts and we’ll be back next fall for our 3rd trip to the Copper House!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Copper House! Dave and Adrienne are great communicators. We enjoyed the beautiful location as well as the house itself. It was clean, comfortable, and well thought out. The local wild life (which included a couple of kitties) was enjoyable to observe and we also enjoyed a paddle boat ride on the lake. Truly note worthy experience."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love Adrienne and Dave’s place so much!! It is clean, clean , clean. Gourmet kitchen. An amazing view from every window. Privacy. Nice and bright. I miss it already and I just left it today. A little piece of “almost heaven. “ My husband and I plan to go back. Do not hesitate to book!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I were looking for a quiet, relaxing place to get away and celebrate our anniversary. The Copper House exceeded our expectations! This cute 2 bedroom is perfectly decorated, you can tell Adrienne & Dave went out of their way to make it look so good. The deck overlooking the lake is an amazing place to hang out, read a book, or just take in nature. The small private dock has a paddle boat and kayaks, it was so peaceful to go out on the water for a bit. Adrienne and Dave were very friendly and responsive and we would not hesitate to go back again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adrienne and Dave’s place couldn’t have been more perfect if you’re looking for quiet with all the amenities of a vacation home. It was hands down, the cleanest and most organized place we’ve ever stayed.
If you food shop to prepare your meals, you’ll never have to leave the property.
We had access to the lake with their paddle boat and canoes. I highly suggest taking them out for a ride. We spent hours in the quiet waters.
The bed was extremely comfortable.
The outside gas fire pit was a great addition for a peaceful evening on the deck.
Adrienne and Dave were as prompt as can be with our emails.
This place is a hidden gem and we will be back!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great option for a stay near Morgantown. The house is cozy but not too small with all of the amenitites of a home. We loved being near the water!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adrienne and Dave's beautiful home on a lake is the perfect retreat. The home is modern, well appointed, very clean, and feels very homey. Anything a traveler could want is provided, i.e., linens, all appliances (including washer and dryer), Keurig and coffee maker, toaster, etc. There were nice touches throughout such as the face wipes and wrapped (think hotel type) soap in the bathroom. I didn't take advantage of the kayaks or pedal boat, but they were there at the dock for my use. Morgantown is nearby and there are several gas stations on the road to their home as well as a super Walmart right at the highway exit. Communication was easy, check-in and check-out couldn't have been more convenient. The wraparound deck was beautiful and a lovely place to sit and watch the lake. I would highly recommend staying at their home if one needs a comfortable, modern place to stay in the area."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second visit to this charming cabin and it won't be our last. It's the perfect place for us to unwind and relax. My husband even caught a few little bass from the dock (catch and release). I enjoyed just sitting on their nice deck with an amazing view of the little lake. Lots of good places to eat in near-by Morgantown but the kitchen is well equipped for meal preparation too. Many thoughtful touches make this the ideal get-away retreat for us.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family of four had a great time at the Copper house and made lots of memories. The house is well equipped with everything you need for a more than comfortable stay. The hosts were quick to respond to any questions. We especially loved all the small details they've put into their home. We hope to return in the future!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place is really clean and comfortable! The layout is great too. Being on the lake and getting out on the paddle boat is nice! The hosts were super friendly and provided a relaxing place to get away. Thanks!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful, quaint home on a private lake. It’s an easy drive to Morgantown, West Virginia but also far enough away to hear the crickets in the evening and enjoy a peaceful coffee in the morning overlooking the lillypads off the dock. The house is very well stocked with all kitchen amenities you’d need. They were very quick to respond with all questions we had. Highly recommend!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible place to stay with great hosts. Had a good and relaxing stay enjoying the house, deck views and lake area. Convenient location and few minutes away from town. Totally recommended, will be back."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was exactly as described. The inside was very clean and very relaxing. The outside was so peaceful and the scenery was amazing. We enjoyed just sitting on the deck watching the wildlife. We also enjoyed the walk around the lake each morning. Dave and Adrienne were very nice and great hosts. We plan on coming back again!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy, courteous communication and
check in / check out Super clean and stylish. Very private"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Beautiful lake! Kayaking the lake was great it was so peaceful and quiet. Lots of beautiful lily pads in the lake too. We walked around the lake a couple times during our stay. Stay here and you will not regret it.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Private beautiful place!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is awesome!!!! It was so clean and beautiful. The location was quiet and had a great porch to overlook the water. It's the perfect get away if you're looking to escape and have a tranquil vacation. The inside was stocked with everything you could need. The bed was comfy. The bathroom and kitchen were spotless. I wanted to live there and not come home. Great hosts!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed another fantastic stay at the Copper House. The house is very nicely updated, clean, has all the amenities needed, and is so relaxing to be surrounded by nature. Dave and Adrienne are great hosts—very prompt with communication. We look forward to staying again soon."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at Copper House several times and have been extremely satisfied! It is the perfect place to spend time relaxing and catching up with family. Dave and Adrienne are wonderful hosts!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was as advertised! The house was clean and well-equipped. Dave and Adrienne were extremely quick to get back to the couple of questions that I had. No complaints from the whole experience of my family's stay!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very relaxing setting. Patio was great, loved the dock on the water, house is clean and comfortable."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome house tucked deep into the West Virginia wilderness. Taking the kayaks and paddle boat out on the water was our favorite part. Dave and Adrienne are gracious hosts and are there if you need anything extra, but you likely won’t since the house is all stocked with the expected essentials. I would also recommend a 4WD vehicle as one of the other reviews did, as my camaro had a bit of a tough time getting up the steep gravel."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a modern, relaxing,and peaceful place then this place is for you! The beds and pillows are so comfy! Loved the decor and finishing touches. Enjoyed the shaded deck overlooking the lake and listening to the frogs at night! We took the kayaks out on the lake and got to meet Dave and Adrienne. They were very good about communicating and answering any questions we had. They had a newly installed propane fire pit added but we did not get a chance to use it. We will definitely be back."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Copper House is amazing! Set on Wildwood Lake, get ready for some beautiful views and a restful visit to West Virginia. My family and I took advantage of the paddle boat and fishing. The inside of the house is so well appointed and comfortable, but the deck on the back is the real star. We grilled and visited with local friends. We made some fine memories. Dave and Adrienne are gracious hosts. We will be back!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Copper House is a wonderful retreat. Being on the lake was an added bonus, the house itself is comfortable and well equipped with everything you need. Dave and Adrienne were fantastic hosts, easy to connect with and very gracious and hospitable. This is definitely a place we plan to visit again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value, very comfortable and well appointed. The deck overlooking the Lake is so peaceful and the setting serene. The road into the lake is gravel and a bit bumpy. I would recommend a SUV or truck that has clearance. A quick trip into Morgantown with many fine dining options. I would highly recommend this place for a wonderful vacation."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely modern cottage on picturesque small lake. Has a wraparound deck with table, chairs and fire pit. Kitchen is well equipped and beautiful. The entire house is comfortable."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to relax and enjoy a whole lot of peace & quiet.... but close enough to Morgantown to go explore.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Adrienne and Dave’s charming little lakefront cabin. The cabin is cozy, bright, and thoughtfully appointed. It was very clean as well! The weather was less than perfect, so we just enjoyed the tranquility. It is a wonderful place to relax and unwind with a great panoramic view of the lake from the many windows. I love observing nature, and I was not disappointed. A busy little beaver built his lodge right across from the cabin and was fun to watch. I also saw a variety of birds, some of which we don’t see around Pittsburgh, so that was fun too. With better weather, I know we would enjoy just walking the perimeter of the lake and relaxing on their deck. Despite being “out in nature,” the WIFI worked perfectly and there was a large assortment of TV channels to enjoy. The cabin is very convenient to downtown Morgantown and many good restaurants, but the kitchen is well stocked for meals there as well. Check-in and check-out was simple! I honestly don’t have any suggestions for improvement; we loved everything about the Copper House and will certainly plan a return visit."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed Adrienne and David’s place! They were super easy to communicate with, check-in and check out were not a problem. The view and lake were incredible. We very much enjoyed our stay."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adrienne & Dave are terrific hosts.
In our view ""super"" applies here.
The home was clean and inviting in every way. Lovely decor, cozy blankets and oh the windows and all that light.
We had a question about something and had a response in minutes. Love that!
We were only there two days but came away refreshed and rested-it's that kind of vibe. Comfortable kick back and everything we needed was there as promised.
(my sis especially loved the heated bathroom floor!)
Yummy breakfast treats to grab with our coffee making for easy mornings and the fire pit on the deck at night was just what the doctor ordered.
Thanks Adrienne & Dave it was a pleasure."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Light and airy, comfortable, and clean! Adrienne & Dave have provided everything you could need for a relaxing getaway."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Copper House. The house has been beautifully and thoughtfully updated, was very clean, and was in a great location for us to visit with family around the Morgantown area. Adrienne & Dave were very easy to communicate with and were incredibly responsive when we needed a little help getting the fireplace's pilot light re-lit. Recommend!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adrienne and Dave were reliable and professional and the stay was amazing. I can't say enough good things. Highly recommend if you're in the area.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was cozy, beautiful, and located in a very serene environment right over a lake. Cooking in that kitchen was a dream. We could not have asked for a better weekend. Adrienne & Dave are excellent hosts!"

The location is amazing being on the lake. The home is great and updated. Adrienne and Dave are awesome communicators and accommodating (we arrived a few hours early). They left out instructions on how to work the fireplace and explained everything well. Would definitely stay here again.
If you’re looking to get away and be isolated with lake views, this is your place. Highly recommend."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. Lap of nature. Well stocked kitchen. Definitely need a AWD or 4WD to access during snowy weather. Cant wait to see if we can make it there for summer.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay at Cooper Lake house. The house was incredibly beautiful both on the inside and the outside. It had everything we needed and made our Christmas trip a delight. As for the weather and outside it was amazing. We got to enjoy the snow as well as the lake and the view from the house was great as well. Adrienne went above and beyond to make sure we were okay. We can’t wait to come back next year and hope you can enjoy the house as well!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was amazing. Adrienne and Dave are great and were quick to answer all of our questions and made sure we had a great time. Can’t wait to go back in the summertime!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adrienne and Dave were the model host, kind, friendly and respectful. Their space (house) is beautifully designed and very cozy. We especially liked the color patterns throughout the house, the attention to details and of course, the walk around the lake. The scenery is breathtaking in the Winter; just imagine Spring and Summer. We highly recommend their space (house) and it's on our list."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pictures definitely don't do this place justice! It was way better than we expected! Adrienne and dave's hospitality was great! Will definitely be using them again for future trips to west virginia!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Worth the stay! Adrienne and Dave's place on Wildwood Lake is a little piece of paradise. The views from the house and back deck are unmatched. You are directly on the lake. The house has been recently renovated, with the entire home being redone. It is very clean and stylish, with a great open floorplan. Adrienne and Dave are extremely nice and responded to all of our questions quickly. I highly recommend this place."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When you see the online exterior photo, don't judge a book by its cover. Once you walk through the door, you will notice the clean fresh look of the Copper House with all its upgrades. Bright and inviting. Numerous windows allow a spectacular view of Wildwood Lake. Have your morning coffee or evening drink sitting on the deck enjoying the view. You can relax closer to the water on the floating pier with its bench. Bring your hiking shoes for the beautiful 2 mile lake loop. Dave and Adrienne are very thoughtful and gracious hosts. Their guests are a number one priority. You will not go wrong booking a stay here. Don't wait."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is wonderful! Tucked away in a secluded forest, this cabin has a rustic touch and feel, with modern amenities! Loved the style and decor, the indoor fire place and outdoor fire pit were also very cozy. Not to mention the fantastic view of the lake and other cabins in the facinity. Me and my friends had a fantastic trip and would highly recommend this cabin!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave and Adrienne’s home is beautiful! Everything is sparkling new and so comfortable.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a short stay for just 1 night, but it is an incredibly peaceful and relaxing place to stay. Despite other houses being nearby, it felt like we were at a cabin on the river by ourselves. Well worth a stay and I hope to be back again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was very nice. It was clean. We loved the screened in porch and the fire pit area. This was way better than staying in a hotel.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing house on the river. Came here to disconnect from work for an extended weekend and do some fishing. Fishing wasn't great (think the water was still too cold) but the house is very comfortable and peaceful.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is wonderful and the location is great for a weekend getaway. Heather was always available to assist and provided clear instructions. The cabin itself is beautiful and cozy! My group and friends and I loved it. The only reason I’m giving this 4 of 5 is because is the amount of rules the we had to adhere to during our stay and after checking out. The check out was at 10 am with no room for flexibility which made it feel like we were running against a clock on the last morning given while we were cleaning up. Otherwise, great stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay. Beautiful location. Will definitely be back!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10/10 would recommend. Right on the water and close to the main part of town. enjoyed the quiet surroundings for morning walks
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we walked into this home, we were quite impressed. Then, when we went up into the loft, even more so. Be sure to enjoy the sunlight coming in all the beautiful windows in the loft in the morning!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved Heather's Haven. It's so cozy and absolutely adorable. It was so peaceful and quiet, which was just what we needed. It's very comfortably furnished and has a lovely view of the river. We enjoyed watching the Canada Geese floating by. We've already booked for next Christmas and this will be our first choice whenever coming to the area. Heather was also fabulous to work with, very responsive. We really appreciated her clear instructions posted around the place too."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were very pleased with our stay at Heather’s Haven. We would definitely stay here again. This cabin is more like a chalet. The woodwork is in pristine condition. The entire home is immaculately clean, and impeccably decorated. Heather’s home is warm and welcoming. It has everything you could possibly need for a peaceful and comfortable stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather’s place was very well prepared for us. Everything was clean and neat. She was responsive, ready to answer anything. The place location do not have so much to do. However as a person who would like to reunion with the family, that was everything. Kitchen had all things that we needed. Barbecue was very useful, we spend almost more than half day with bbq. There was a place just 7-8 min by car, we went for walking. That was amazing view, and weather. The sunroom of the house is very good. We would stay forever at that sunroom. Had our breakfast and tea time there."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather's place was very clean, neat and updated. Everything was organized and instructions were clear. The tv's didn't work for the second half of our stay. Not sure what was wrong because the wi-fi seemed to be working on my laptop and phone. I did not tell Heather that they weren't working because we were in and out a lot. I'm sure she would have handled it had I informed her. I thought the ""welcome"" chalkboard sign was a nice added personal touch."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We visited in the heart of fall color change. Right on the river along a small, quiet road."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Heather’s place was an absolute dream! The location was gorgeous and the area was peaceful. We spent all of our time in the sunroom enjoying the views! It had all of the amenities we needed and then some. We will definitely be returning!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather's place is amazing! It is absolutely gorgeous inside, gives you a real cabin feel! The outdoor space with the porch and the fire pit is perfect for relaxing and watching the water. The dock was great to get some fishing in! It was the perfect spot to swim and tie off a raft too! We met the one neighbor too, who was incredibly sweet! We will definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful and exceptionally clean.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather’s Haven was beautiful and inviting from top to bottom. Being situated on the Tygart Valley River, the water view was great and access to that water was easy for my wife to take her kayak out. Heather’s house rules pay off in how clean and well-maintained the interior of her B&B is. Everything you need is at hand, so all you need to bring are food, clothing and toiletries (and firewood, if that’s your thing.) Heather provides a guide to area restaurants which was very helpful (Murial’s Italian Restaurant was amazing - FYI, ask for outside deck seating.) There are two queen beds to chose from (we chose the soft mattress over the firm) in case you have a preference of firmness. Our only warning would be for anyone with mobility issues as the front steps could be a challenge. We had no problem with them ourselves. Heather was very responsive and made the stay easy with her instructions. Thanks for the wonderful weekend stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time! Was really quite and relaxing. Felt like there was a lot of attention to detail and was very neat and clean.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place for me and my wife to get away for the weekend from our busy lifestyles. Everything was perfect and extremely enjoyable. We caught a few fish on the dock. The house was extremely clean and the location was perfect. We will be staying again in the future. Highly recommended.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying on the river. It was very peaceful and relaxing, easy to find and close to many restaurants. Heather was very responsive and we had everything we needed. This was one of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve had. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean home. Heather left us delicious pepperoni rolls for check-in. The sun room and dock were our favorite parts of the property. We didn't catch any fish, but maybe next time! Highly recommend going to the Duchtman's Daughter and checking out all of the surrounding parks."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Probably the cleanest rental I’ve ever stayed at. Beautiful house. Quiet, peaceful and relaxing. Had everything we needed with very comfortable beds."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather's place is stunning! I was sad to leave. Nature abounds everywhere you look from this property. The craftsmanship of the house is impressive and it was spotless! The host is very friendly and responsive. Bring your own boat, this is my only regret, not having something to ride on the river but the swimming worked out just fine."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Heather's Haven. The listing could never possibly do it justice. The property includes a myriad of thoughtful amenities. Any question you could possibly ask is answered in advance by the Air BnB description or a sign at the property. The place is more charming than the pictures could ever show. Heather is extremely communicative, patient, and kind. Fairmont has wonderful restaurants and activities. There is also a ton of activities within a short drive (30-40 minutes) of Fairmont. You won't regret staying at Heather's Haven if you're looking for a quiet getaway in a modern rustic setting with plenty of nature focused activities."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather’s Haven was exceptional! This is a 5–Star Airbnb! I travel and frequent Airbnb often. Heather’s cabin has moved to one of the top of the list. This space is beautiful, peaceful and serene. The view of the river was wonderful! I spent much of my time reading and reflecting in the lovely sunroom. Her cabin is one of the cleanest I have stayed. Heather has thought of every possible amenity to make your stay comfortable and welcoming. From the personalized welcome sign to her talented eye for interior design and color and stocked kitchen. You will not be disappointed. Heather is super responsive and helpful. We stayed in the area for an extended family graduation party. This location was super convenient to downtown Fairmont and to family in Farmington, WV. There are also several options close by for dining or pickup up necessities. We are thrilled to have discovered this gem on the Tygart River, and will definitely return. Thank you so much Heather for opening up your lovely home!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There was absolutely nothing negative about this place. Starting with Heather being an amazing host and she accommodated anything you needed or asked with an immediate response. The house was THE cleanest house we have ever stayed in and you can tell she prides herself on that. The location was amazing, with the river and the mountain view it was so peaceful. The area was super quiet and was one of the most relaxing experiences we have had. I would stay here again 100% and you should absolutely stay here or any of Heathers locations!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was very clean and well supplied with kitchen ware. We so enjoyed sitting in the sunroom looking out to the river. Only thing we had an issue with was all batteries in remotes for tv’s were dead. So we had to go out and buy replacements.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My second stay at Heather’s Haven. Felt like coming home during my stay in Fairmont. Heather was tremendous as always. Look forward to visiting again!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,She was so gracious and went above and beyond to make our stay one we will always treasure. Thank you Heather. May the LORD JESUS CHRIST bless everything you lay your hand to.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heather's Haven was incredible, it was better than the pictures. It ended up snowing when we came and through the night. It made the experience so much better that we extended our stay.
Heather was friendly, accommodating and fast to respond.
We will definitely return to this clean, welcoming and blessed home! Thank you!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay and right on Tygart River.. Nice boat dock and beautiful view of river from sunroom.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather's Haven is an excellent bucolic getaway! The home itself is on a quiet street, right on the river. The home is immaculate and beautifully decorated. It's very well insulated. You never catch a draft or feel fluctuations in temperature even though there are many windows. Heather is an excellent host. She set up a beautiful welcome with a personalized message and a local food item. She was always available via the Air BnB chat and answered right away. She provides excellent detail in all of the information about the home. She even has descriptive signs throughout the property to make sure you are set up for success. We can't wait to visit again!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heather's Haven is just as described in the description. In fact the pictures and descriptions don't do it enough justice. This place was clean and very well kept and was perfect for a couples retreat. The water access with the private dock set this place apart from most. Heather was very easy to get a hold of if there was a question and she was very clear about everything. Beautiful scenery and with the sounds of nature all around it really is a little piece of heaven. I would go back and would recommend this to anyone.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heather’s Heaven is an absolute delight. All the care and attention to detail made this a peaceful and relaxing stay. The home is beautiful and had everything we needed. I can’t wait to return!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heather’s home is very warm and inviting with nice personal touches around the house. She has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable. Very easy to communicate with and very prompt to answer any question. Also a very nice dock on the river. You can’t go wrong with this home.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don't hesitate to book, if you think you're interested in staying here. This place is absolutely gorgeous, inside and out. The weather was a little less than cooperative over the weekend we stayed (100+ heat index and intense storms), but the house made that almost inconsequential. You have constant views of the river from inside, or plenty of places to hang out outside. The dock is nice for hanging out on the water and watching the boats roll by, and there were a lot of them cruising around. It's clean, it's cozy, it has everything you need for your stay, and the host is great with communication and the personal touch to make your stay worthwhile. Honestly would not think twice about staying again. Thanks for having us!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This property is definitely a hidden gem on this app. Everything about our stay was perfect and the attention to detail was amazing! We will be back soon!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want peace and quiet with scenic river in front of you, this is the place. Lots of things to do in the area."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heather's Haven is a wonderfully relaxing retreat. Heather is a gracious host and the cabin is thoughtfully appointed to make your stay comfortable.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heather’s Haven is gorgeous! The location is excellent; close to the highway, stores, a few restaurants, and most importantly, right on the river! The view is perfect, and it’s such a tranquil setting! On top of that, Heather is very accommodating and very responsive. I highly recommend her place! 🙌🏾"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing spot and an excellent host
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and so clean!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the personalized greeting on the chalkboard as we walked in the door, to the beautiful views of the Tygart Valley River from the cozy sunroom, our stay could not have been more enjoyable. Heather’s Haven is the perfect way to disconnect from the daily grind we so often find ourselves a part of. Heather’s is perhaps the cleanest and most well organized home we have ever visited, yet it still remains welcoming and comfortable. The warm wood tones of the interior spaces, along with the tasteful decor make it feel so much like “Home” and not just a place to stay. And, I can’t say enough about how helpful and accommodating our host, Heather has been. Definitely an overall 5 Star experience.
Thanks for everything, Heather!
Jim & Diana"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazingly chill place with unbeatable craftsmanship and attention to detail with an epic design, truly a diamond in the rough."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely cabin full of warm wood tones; cozy and comfortable. Very clean and well kept. I really appreciated the full kitchen--and the laundry room, complete with detergent and dryer sheets. If I'm in town again, I will try to book Heather's Haven again!
Some things to note: There are 30 steps to get to the front door, and there are train tracks across the river, with an early train that could wake you if you are a light sleeper."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful time. If you are looking for the “cabin in the woods” experience I highly recommend. It was close enough to town to be able to get groceries and such, but far enough away that you really feel “away from it all”. The house is gorgeous and the amenities are perfect. Sooooo much better than a hotel stay. I will say, it is a tin roof, I’m not a light sleeper so it doesn’t bug me, but when it rains you hear it. I find it calming, but the cheap foam ear plugs would be all you would need if you are a light sleeper- again I found it soothing because I love the sound of the rain. The sun room was by far my favorite part. Coffee and watching a calming river, I could relax all day.
And of course I should mention the owner. She was great to work with. She was so kind and honest and upfront. If you have questions just ask her and she’s quick to get back to you.
All around 10/10 will definitely be coming back again!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfort and cleanliness are the top two descriptions of this home. Beautiful views, quiet location and a cozy fireplace made this the perfect weekend getaway!

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather, thank you so much for opening your home to us! The pictures on the listing did not do it justice. We cannot tell you how much we enjoyed our stay. It really was the perfect getaway for the weekend and had everything we needed. And the view was just amazing. We hope to come back in the summer and take advantage of being so close to the river. Thank you again for such a wonderful, clean, beautiful place to stay in!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, everything you needed for a quiet and relaxing getaway. Sunrise in the sunroom, charcuterie in the sunroom at night, both overlooking the river. I could spend a few nights during each of all 4 seasons and be thoroughly content. Thank you heather for such a beautiful and accommodating place!!!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather's Haven is a great place for a quiet getaway along the Tygart River.

We are planning on going back!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather's Haven is a one-of-a-kind experience! From the time I pulled up and ascended the stairs, the incredible care and attention to detail that went into creating this place is evident. It cast a spell that lingered throughout my romantic getaway and for quite a while after I left. Even in the wintertime, the place was warm and perfectly suited to a relaxing yet invigorating mood. I'll definitely be back to fish and get out on the water in the warmer months!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing 2 night stay at the Haven, you won’t regret booking as soon as you walk into the sunroom and see it’s breath taking views, we would spend hours just enjoying the beauty of the home and respective land. Will most definitely be returning to our new favorite getaway soon!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,extremely impressed with Heather's Haven ! cute and super clean 😍 loved the special touches 💕 her quick responses to questions was extra helpful! the rules were very clear and a great idea for sharing your home 🏡 will definitelybe back
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful place that is immaculate. Very restful. Deer come to visit some days and birds in a nearby tree sing. It was delightful
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heather’s Haven was absolutely perfect! She provided many little extras throughout the cabin! The cabin is so charming and cozy! We can’t wait to return!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great location! We loved this cabin. It has a great view of the river from the sitting room in the morning. Great place to have tea, coffee, read a book or gather for a night cap. A special feature, or at least we thought as 2 best friends (or if traveling with a child etc). It was cool that the upstairs is open so you can see each other.
Heather was great with communication in the event we needed anything or even just making us aware of the weather! We had an awesome time!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place! Great for a weekend get away or just a nice place to relax. I will definitely plan to stay here again.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing views.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heather is amazing host! She was so kind and responsive. She was able to accommodate an early check in and was super fast in getting me in.
The place is a literal slice of Heaven. Peaceful, serene, and so beautifully decorated. If you are looking to recharge this is your place! I won’t stay anywhere else. The best!!!"
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Let me first explain that less than a week before we arrived, my husbands mother passed and it was our 5 year wedding anniversary. Heather was very accommodating and understanding, as well as prompt with her communication. I would have given 5 stars, however the house rules were posted on bright neon paper and posted in multiple places throughout the cabin, as well as in the listing and again during the check in communication. I can only assume that Heather had previous issues, but we both felt like we couldn’t relax. We wore slippers when in the house but were constantly worried about the floors or water from the shower leaking. The view was relaxing and the near by Valley Fall State park was a great stress reliever and had wonderful views. Lastly, the bed was very uncomfortable and I ended up on the couch one of the nights. The place is beautiful and on the water and would be a great retreat. I think we were overwhelmed and were unable to relax."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very sweet cabin. it had everything we needed. clear communication around expectations.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time here. It’s so beautiful in the morning when the sun starts to peep up. My wife caught several cute fishes and we enjoyed dinner at DJs 50s & 60s diner. If you turn right from the drive way and up the back incline it’ll take you to beautiful rolling views of the town below. Fairmont even offers .50cent parking and you can stroll around. Definitely check out the million dollar bridge. I could go on… so much to explore. Oh and you get greeted by Robert the cat!
We would love to stay here again"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect!
We had a wonderful week at Heather's Haven."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would recommend staying at this beautiful cabin! I loved our sunroom and loft. It was a great place for fishing too. We thoroughly enjoyed celebrating our 1 year anniversary here
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I enjoyed a quiet weekend at Heather's Haven! Everything was very clean and we really appreciated labels and signage throughout.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, highly recommended"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had the hardest time finding a place to stay near Lost Creek, WV — until we found Heather’s Haven! The pictures are accurate, the dock is lovely, the home is spacious and cozy all at once. We only wish we could stay longer."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather’s Haven is a great place to stay. She responds very quickly to any questions and I had a lot! Her place was very clean, location was fantastic, so relaxing! Just what we needed. We definitely will be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I had such a blast and it was so needed. It was easy to get to, communication was easy and fast response time, and the location was so ideal. Not far from town but tucked away right on the lake in a quiet neighborhood. The house was so cute and we loved the cabin feel. We had everything we needed for cooking and entertainment. I’m not a local but we wanted to try our hand at fishing while there and she sent me the info I needed for a weekend fishing license. The weekend flew by way too fast but we’d definitely love to come stay again if ever we are out that way!!! Definitely recommend this place if you’re looking for a weekend getaway with a water view for a totally reasonable price!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather's Haven was the perfect getaway spot for my family. It is in a peaceful location on the river, yet within 5 to 10 minutes of plenty of dining and shopping options. It is also only about 20 minutes from Morgantown, so a great location for a WVU football weekend or if you're coming to visit a student there. It is a beautiful cabin with everything that you need. We spent two nights and enjoyed fishing, playing on the river, sitting by the firepit, and relaxing! The sun porch is the perfect morning coffee spot. We rented paddleboards from Wood's Boat House just down the river (they were the nicest people!) which were so much fun and exhausting for the kids! Everyone had a nap afterwards. The washer/dryer at Heather's Haven was a much needed amenity after playing in the river! LOL! We tried the Dutchman's Daughter and Muriale's and had excellent meals from both. We did take out from Dutchman's Daughter and ate at the picnic table by the river at Heather's Haven. We dined in at Muriale's. Muriale's salad and bread would be a meal in itself! Go hungry! We also went to Pufferbelly's for ice cream...great soft serve and friendly people! We hope to return to Heather's Haven for another getaway, maybe a WVU football weekend this fall!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for peace and quiet this is the place! Very relaxing , lots of nature and activities to do that are close. The house is absolutely wonderful! We will be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"we chose heather’s haven for my birthday weekend, and my name is heather so it just called to us! it’s an absolutely beautiful space, very quiet but not far from food and entertainment. the river is great to float in and soak up some sun. there are so many personal touches that make this place feel like home as opposed to just some hotel room. heather is so thoughtful and even wrote a little sign to wish me a happy birthday at the front door when we checked in. the perfect weekend get away for couples or a small group if friends. will definitely be back!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, views, and immaculate house. Every detail was thought of, I highly recommend staying there! Extremely clean and welcoming. Loved the Keurig and coffee ready to go!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I loved our short stay here on our way back from a 2 week cross country road trip out west and back to Maryland. This home is clean and cozy and has everything you could need. Heather is a great host and was easy to reach and quick to communicate/give us needed info. Staying on the water was so tranquil and peaceful! We hope to return!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were looking for a scenic spot to break up a long drive, and Heather's riverside cottage was just the ticket! We were transfixed by the view of the Tygart River from her front room, a perfect place for a glass of wine or morning coffee. The space is thoughtfully appointed and so comfortable, we would have enjoyed a longer stay. Heather is a terrific host. When questions came up, she was quick to answer. Highly recommend."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I booked this trip for my mother and father and I cannot say enough about Heather. She went above and beyond to accommodate them and make their trip that much more enjoyable. My mother is super OCD and was very pleased with how well kept the home was. She also loved the views offered from most every room. All in all they were very pleased with the trip and I plan to make another visit with the Mrs in the near future. ❤️
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"House is impeccably clean, very comfortable, and host provides for all of your needs. It's a beautiful home. We were very happy during our stay. It was easy access, and close to the highway but also a quiet and peaceful retreat."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great time on our trip to Heather's place. The place was well stocked with everything you needed. The kitchen had everything we needed including a blender, keureg, and crock pot! We brought our kayaks and fishing poles and loved it. It was very peaceful and rejuvenating to wake up with the river right there and have tea on the front porch. We stayed here with our kids and there was plenty of room - make sure you know the upstairs is an open area so there aren't separate rooms. Heather has privacy screens if you want them but we didn't bother. One of our kids slept on the couch downstairs and the other one in a bed upstairs. Worked great for us. Highly recommend and would go back in a heartbeat. highly recommend a hike at valley falls state park and coopers Rock state forest. we also loved the pepperoni rolls (a local favorite) from the County Club Bakery - hint get the sauce with peppers from there and bake them in the oven with mozzarella cheese and sauce - yum!) and we also enjoyed Murialle's for Italian. The young man at Coal County Mini Golf was great. We also quite enjoyed our visits on the dock from Robert the neighborhood cat. Check this place out. You will love it!"

We had a busy weekend with h.s. class reunion functions and gatherings with family and it was so nice to come back to this comfy rustic cabin and relax on the porch Frid, Sat and Sund night. We enjoyed the awesome storm on Saturday night."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"My three brothers and I stayed here after spending 4 days in Dolly Sods Wilderness, so we were craving a cozy home. Dora's house was perfect for it. Beautiful home, tons of space, comfy furniture and beds, wonderful firepit pre-stocked with wood, and they even got fresh propane tanks for the grill. The town of Grafton is beautiful too, from the Tygart Lake and massive dam, to the delicious restaurants and friendly people. Definitely stop by The Strand Bar, the pool tables are pro tables, the owner has a rad record collection, and his dad just celebrated his 86th birthday!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Group trip,.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are 4 older guys (H.S. Buds - Parma HS, Class of '64) who get together twice a year for a few days of beer and poker. We stayed here a couple of years ago and liked it. But we then tried a few other places closer to Morgantown that were less expensive.
We are back for good. Dora's place has EVERYTHING we want.
I had a small problem with the door code - made one call and got it figured out quickly!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"""Cabin"" is a complete understatement, this HUGE home is absolutely beautiful! Pictures do not do it justice!! Everything was wonderful, peaceful and relaxing.

There's a fire pit outside and a huge stack of wood for a peaceful evening. Who would want a hotel over that? I am recommending it to everyone I know! We will be booking again, for sure!"

There was plenty of room to spread out and everyone found their ""nook"" to hang out in.
The weather wasn't the greatest and we would have liked to be able to spend more time on the front porch or the back deck.
Would definitely recommend staying in the house for anyone who wants a quiet place to retreat and unwind!"

The master bedroom has its own beautiful bath, entrance to a side porch and the sun room (which is lovely!). The layout of the kitchen and the first dining room made it so easy to prep food, feed the hungry kids (after a day of swimming) at the large counter/island while chatting with adults and then having our own diner at one of the two beautiful dining rooms. There was so much room for our group of 10, from the multiple sitting rooms/living rooms, areas upstairs, numerous porches and the lovely yard where we enjoyed a campfire every night with wood provided. The location is perfect; so close to ice cream, kayak rentals and the AWESOME Tygart Lake. We LOVED the lake. Wonderful stay!!!"

We all enjoyed this lovely home."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great property with great hosts. Positives include lots of room/space, a well-appointed kitchen, and great space outside. The trees provide great cover so it feels cooler, and if the sun or rain hits you on the back deck, you can always move to the covered front porch. I would definitely stay again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Do not hesitate to rent this wonderful house. It’s even better in person than as presented in listing. The house lives large and is thoughtfully stocked. The outdoor spaces are fantastic. Covered front porch would be quite handy in the rain. It is very private yet accessible to stores by a short drive into town. Due to pandemic WVU was late in finalizing graduation weekend plans. I explained this to host and she worked with me to confirm actual dates needed. Check in was simple. The house was clean and ready for guests. The outdoor spaces were beautifully maintained and we used all of them. Great property for multigenerational groups.
If we ever get back to West Virginia this will be the house we get! Thank you for helping us celebrate our daughter’s graduation from WVU."
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our family loved the cabin; its surrounded by trees all around, with nice lawn area. Lots of seating outdoors, with patio, swings, rocking chairs, picnic table. The cabin was well furnished with lots space, with a really nice sun room. Would definitely visit again.
Thanks Shayla and Dora"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a very nice home in a secluded area surrounded by beautiful natural areas. We enjoyed visiting the nearby Tygart Lake and Dam and Valley Falls State Park (off season too). The home was clean with all the necessary amenities for a home away from home.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would highly recommend Dora's home as an airbnb destination!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was an excellent place for a family to stay. In addition to the number of beds, it was a good space to bring a young child because there were no little or breakable decorative items on the main floor to worry about. The accommodations were very comfortable and the host was easy to communicate with."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dora's home is beautiful and has everything you will need for a relaxing week or quick weekend. The kitchen is ready for cooking and the porches and property is beautiful. Dora's niece was able to allow us to check in early which was great and was quick to respond to our questions.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,An adorable little WV get-away! Very clean and inviting; we very much enjoyed our stay! :) Thank you for everything!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin and wooded location are beautiful and peaceful. The charming cabin had lots of space, and was very comfortable. Our host did her best to let us check in early after a long drive there, which was hugely appreciated. We enjoyed our week long stay so much that we were sad to leave."
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is a hidden gem! We had such a nice fall weekend at this beautiful home nestled in the woods. We enjoyed the sun room and being able to view all of the fall foliage surrounding the home. The place was SUPER clean and had everything one could need for a relaxing vacation.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was the perfect spot for a family getaway. The house is very well furnished with everything you could need. It was very clean and tidy on arrival and the hosts were quick to respond to inquiries.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great place to relax and enjoy the scenery. We had an amazing time. The location is very easy to get to.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house is better than expected. Spacious and plenty of room for a large gathering. The surrounding property is amazing and secluded.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,You'll love it.
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing home! Only minutes away from Tygart Lake! Reserve your water toys (pontoons, kayak, etc.) early!! We had a great time and were so close to the house, we could run home if needed.
The hosts are very responsive and kind!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is absolutely better than described. It was sparkling clean, very spacious, and had everything and more that we could want or need in a rental. I would not hesitate to book again and again. Location from the lake is perfect. We had our privacy but could be on the lake in less than 5 minutes. Dora and Shayla have thought of everything with the ""extras"" they included. We had a fantastic time and I know you will too! This is what I call luxury camping :)"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dora's place has lots of room including ample porch space (with swings) in the front and back, two living areas and a work space, and two dining areas. The proximity to Tygart Lake State Park is great. This is a lovely place to spend time with family!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin was lovely. Exactly what was needed for perfect social distancing trip!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden Paradise Awaits! Dora’s home is a perfect retreat for families with kids, or couples seeking a restful and well-appointed home. Spotless and welcoming, you’ll find everything you need for the perfect getaway. There are so many lovely places to relax, chat and/or play inside and out! The beds are comfy, linens of great quality and thoughtful touches to make your visit perfect. The marina at Tygart Lake is very convenient, making this a great home base for boaters. We will definitely return!!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin is beautiful and was the perfect family getaway!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This lovely log cabin house is a great place to get away from it all. It has several very nice outdoor spaces with views of the woods and lots of deer. Inside, there are many comfy nooks and crannies. There are four recliners in the living room for evening conversation or movie watching.
It’s only about a 15 minute walk down to the Lake Tygart Lodge, and there’s a great trailhead even closer. We enjoyed renting a pontoon boat for the day and spending time on the lake."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay at Dora's cabin was exceptional. The location is beautiful with the cabin being surrounded by woods and the lake was just a short distance away. The cabin itself is quite large and the accomodations were very nice. Staying there was just like being at home. The bedrooms were comfortable and homey and the bathrooms as well. The kitchen was well stocked and easy to navigate. The living room had a reclining sofa and loveseat that was great for late night talks. We were there for an aunt/niece getaway and we really enjoyed our time there!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is perfect for medium to large groups looking for a lot of different spaces to make memorable moments. Close to the lake and surprisingly charming downtown Grafton. The hosts worked with us on early check-in (free) and late check-out (small fee) and were really great about both. Would come back to the property and the area.
2020-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had an amazing stay! The location is perfect, just minutes from the marina yet far enough away that you aren’t disturbed by anyone. The pictures don’t do this place justice.. There was plenty of room and the house has everything that we could have possibly needed. The master bed was very comfortable which made each night so restful. We will definitely be back for another long weekend this summer!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! The cabin was extremely clean when we arrived. There was more than enough room for our family of 5 to spread out, but definitely big enough for two families to stay if needed. The beds were so comfy! We loved the fire pit and sun room. We also spent a lot of time rocking on the porch swings and watching the birds. We saw a giant wood pecker which was fun for the kids. The house had everything we could possibly need and I had no trouble cooking meals in the kitchen. I loved that I could look out the window and see the kids playing from the kitchen. Thanks Dora and Shayla for thinking of everything and giving us a break during these stressful times!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for a getaway in nature. This place had even more space than we expected and the park and multiple trails were less than 5 minutes away. There is also a Walmart only 10 minutes away, so you’re in the peace of nature but not too far from convenience. The beds were super comfortable and we loved the outdoor porch spaces to enjoy the stars and sounds of nature."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family had a wonderful stay at Dora’s cabin. It was comfortable, well equipped and close to Valley Falls State Park, which provided lots of opportunities for hiking. We will definitely be back again soon!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent everything
2020-01-01,5.0,Group trip,We travel from Guatemala to Pittsburgh. We had taken the best choice for this house. It is a beautiful house. It has nice views. Our stay was during Christmas and New Year and the weather was cold but inside the house you have all what you need.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family like many live far apart. Instead of traveling 8-10 hours each we decided to meet half way! It so happened this home was in the perfect location! There were 10 of us and we all fit just fine. The kitchen was so clean and easy to use (we made thanksgiving take 2). Every morning there were white tailed does up by the door close enough to touch! There is a very steep hill in the backyard that if you’re brave enough you can see the lake and a gorgeous view of West Virginia! What amazing way to view a state that the news and world would have you believe is dying as we speak, And I can assure you it is not!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful home, close enough to stores and WVU, while far enough away to escape the day to day for a little bit."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay here. The house was much bigger and nicer than we expected! Definitely recommended!!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was, by far, one of the best escapes we have ever had! The home was an absolute gem- tucked away in the woods with access to everything. The home was spacious and had every perk you could possibilities think of. We loved walking the grounds, watching the deer wander through the yard and exploring the local sites. We did not want to leave. This home is perfect for large families or your secret hide-away. The beds we heavenly and the great rooms were spectacular! We enjoyed a fall fire, coffee in the deck and front room with cathedral ceilings and windows that opened up to nature. Well stocked! No detail was overlooked. Best bargain available and a very quick, charming drive to West Virginia University! Don’t pass this opportunity up!!!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was very clean. It was perfect for our visit to Fairmont State University. We had the best time and so much room. The property is so nice as well. Wonderful place for our stay. We definitely recommend this and would stay here again.
2019-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"I would highly recommend this place. The house was beautiful, with an amazing view. The kitchen was well equipped, more than what we were expecting. This place is so close to grocery stores and places to eat and yet very secluded. We enjoyed outdoor firepit and and spend time watching stars during our visit. We had cell phone coverage at all times and wifi worked pretty well. Overall we loved the place and would love to return."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you have a desire to explore West Virginia this is the place for you! There were only 4 in our party but this home can house a good size crew with room the spare. We hope to return with our grand-kids. If you plan to take one of the scenic trains in this area you need to book early!! Dora and Shayla are great host!!!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is huge with a lot of space, tucked away, and extremely peaceful!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this perfectly clean and spacious home. It was so comfortable and in a perfect setting right near Tygart Lake State Park. There was plenty of space for everyone in the family to relax and spend time together. The outdoor spaces were perfect at Dora's house, as well. We enjoyed coffee in the mornings and wine in the evenings on the porch swing on the lovely front porch. We visited WVU for Fall Family Weekend while we were there and also ventured down to the state park to take a look at beautiful Tygart Lake. The beds were very comfortable after a full day of activities. The Wi-Fi signal was good, which my son's enjoyed. The kitchen was spotless like the rest of the house and was fully stocked with dishes and cooking utensils. We were able to cook dinner and two big breakfasts with no problem. I am looking forward when we can return to this beautiful home for some R&R and family time in the future. Thanks again to our gracious hosts!!!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin in the mountains! Very clean, large, and inviting. One of my favorite stays to date!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"What an amazing stay! You only had to think about something and there it was! This home is A+ and so clean and comfortable. We traveled with 9 and there was space for everyone. It was typical winding “country roads”, from WVU to our stay, but gorgeous and worth the extra mileage. Dora and Shayla were the best hosts! Stay with confidence and treat yourself to this amazing opportunity to stay in one of the best appointed Airbnb homes ever! Please care for it and preserve it for it gives so much joy."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This lake cabin exceeded expectations in every way. The place was so clean and inviting it was easy to feel at home. There was nothing we couldn’t find or needed further than what was available at the cabin. Everything was so thoughtful. We are sure to stay here again very soon!
(There’s a puzzle on the open cabinet in the living room that kept us busy the whole stay..)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay in Brigitte's Fairmont WV home was excellent. The home is spacious, well stocked and very clean. Brigitte was very responsive to any questions that we had before and during our stay. It is a beautiful home directly on the Tygart river. We had 5 people stay, and we had family that live in Fairmont visit us. There was plenty of room for all--and a huge table for all of us to play cards! We all had a fabulous visit to West Virginia, and this house was the perfect place for all of us to gather. Thank you Brigitte! We would definitely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The entire family had a great time and felt right at home! The house was clean and very user friendly! We spent our days outside playing in the water and slept like babies at night in the air conditioning!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We had an amazing stay. Great location for our daughter’s WVU graduation. Brigitte was very quick to answer any questions.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a very nice stay for our business conference.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable beds. Nice view of the lake.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was fantastic! The house had everything we could've needed. I do a lot of cooking and always take certain kitchen items with me that you don't often find in rentals, that was not necessary with this house. The kitchen is very well stocked. The house was very comfortable and nicely decorated. We loved the pellet stove in the evenings. The outside area offers ample seating options and bring right on the water was a blast. The only complaint we had was the neighbors dog. It barked anytime it was outside and just wouldn't stop. I'm sure there is not much the owner can do about this and it didn't effect our stay, just a little annoying. We would definitely stay here again and are trying to figure out if we can get back while the weather is warm this year."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had an amazing stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a nice house, wow."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great host. Five stars all the way. Definitely recommend to everyone.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice Place
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Traveled for a business trip in Fairmont. Great location, close to town, restaurants, etc."
2023-12-01,4.0,Group trip,The place was true to pictures. We were there in December so could not utilize the kayaks that are available. Beds were all extremely comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked. The only thing for someone not from that area is the parking is a little hard to manage. The view of the tygart river is beautiful.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Peaceful idyllic location for a family gathering. There are lots of nooks for each person to have independent time, and large welcoming spaces for games and watching movies. Fully stocked kitchen, outfitted well enough for a full Thanksgiving meal for 7 people! The wood burning (pellet) stove was cozy and warm and the river was gorgeous flowing by. It was too cold and too rapid flowing for boating or even fishing but there was plenty of other things to go. The memory foam beds were a great and there were thoughtful extras everywhere. Don’t miss out on the Valley Falls state park nearby. The views are exceptional."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was our third stay, and I am sure it will not be the last. It’s a perfect for place for families to stay and reconnect. Plenty of room and a beautiful location on the river."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is wonderful, clean, and quiet, with gorgeous views of the river. It has tons of space and lots of things already there for kids to play with. The kitchen had everything we needed and the house book was helpful anytime we struggled finding something. There are multiple spaces outside for relaxing, too!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Brigitte was a great host and very accommodating. We had an awesome experience! The kids loved it and it was a nice a relaxing retreat for everyone! Highly recommend.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property located right on the Tygart River, very spacious & comfortable and a well stocked kitchen! We enjoyed our stay & will be back again when there are WVU events!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Thanks.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful setting. House was very clean and comfortable. My 3 grandkids had fun at the river. I wish there had been more of a sheltered area where they could play in the water. The current was very swift and we were afraid to let them swim.
We enjoyed our stay very much.
The only criticism would be that I wish shampoo, soap and conditioner were provided. They always have been in houses I’ve stayed in before so I didn’t bring any. Required an extra store run.
With that aside, I would recommend this property."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying at Tygart and we will definitely continue! So much better than the price of two hotel rooms. Great location, and Brigitte was very communicative!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"A great surprise! House was across river from the house our daughter was born in 52 years ago, and the church was the one my husband left to become a minister 50 years ago! We were there for family reunions and were so excited to introduce (or reintroduce) our grandchildren to our family and friends, and to the area! My husband has dementia, so this was a very special vacation to see all our family. The house was perfect for it, as our grandchildren loved the river. Comfortable, plenty of room for the seven of us. Kitchen easy to use.
We have rented dozens of houses in Italy, Mexico, Hawaii and many in California (where we have lived since 1983) but none as special as this!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Made our family reunion extra amazing. We will most definitely be back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome location! Great experience!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time staying at Bridgette’s home over Memorial Day Weekend. Right on the river and very close to town if you forgot something. We spent the entire time kayaking, swimming and hanging out on the deck. The home is large and I would recommend for large groups as there is so much space and areas to relax. Beautiful locations and waking up to the peaceful river each day was my favorite. The hosts were very communicative and worked with us on multiple requests. Thanks so much for making our weekend unforgettable and relaxing!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was well-stocked, clean, and inviting. The surroundings were beautiful and so peaceful. A great place to relax and enjoy the area. My daughter and her friend loved the ability to take the kayaks down the river. The covered outdoor space was nice since the weather was a bit rainy the one day. Would definitely recommend it."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. House was great. Everything as expected. The door code was very easy to use and convenient. My only add is the parking lot below is a little dicey getting in and out of. You just have to drive carefully.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My colleagues spent a couple days and nights at Brigitte's place for a team training and evening hang-out time. They reported: Great view, plenty of room, kitchen was awesome, dino sheets on the bunk beds were appreciated!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good hosts and co-host william is very handsome!!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Highly recommend
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay here. The house was clean and as described in the listing. We were at the max capacity for the house and had plenty of room and seating for everyone. There were a lot of kids’ toys in the playroom, which was great and kept our little ones busy. Brigitte was very responsive and helpful when I messaged her with a few questions. I would stay here again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home on the water. Perfect for a family or group. Will visit again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place. We visit West Virginia 1 weekend in October every year since 2014 and this has been the best one yet! The accommodations were great. Very spacious and clean. The home had everything that you could need or may have forgot to pack. I am an owner of a construction company and enjoyed looking at the hard work in progress all around the home. If you pass this rental up, it would be your loss. Great job Bridget with everything. Thanks for allowing us to enjoy the home."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay and it was once again fabulous. This house is great location to get away and relax right on the water. Brigitte is great and always very helpful. We hope to be back again soon.
2022-10-01,4.0,Group trip,Great view and nice host
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay on the river! Very clean and comfortable! Host was quick to respond to any questions you have. We recommend dining at nearby Muriale’s Italian restaurant- very authentic!
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The location is perfect. It's 10 minutes off the highway but feels incredibly secluded. The river access and available kayaks make for a great time. The house is exactly as advertised with a lovely deck, huge great room, ample bed space, and well stocked kitchen. Brigitte was quick to respond to any issues or questions and everything went very smoothly for our stay. We will 100% be staying here again if its available."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We have a great staying!!! I will book again.
They don’t need to change nothing the house is great. They got everything you need.I recommended this place to anybody."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"The property is excellent and has all of the amenities. Location is perfect with great access to the river. Host also provided kayaks, tubes, and other accessories needed for the river. The host was extremely helpful and always responded in a timely manner. Kitchen was fully stocked with most everything you need. My family and I enjoyed our stay and would return again in the future."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great home and owners. Everything you need to enjoy your stay is provided. Beautiful river view and easy access into river. Everyone enjoyed the kayaks. Hope to return some day.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Easy to find this awesome house on the river. Plenty of space for everyone. Easy check-in and great communication from owner. Plenty of parking and lots of water toys.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Our grandkids loved it! They were excited about their bedroom with all the reading books, toys, the bunk bed and the chalk board. We all enjoyed our short mini family vacation. Thank you Brigitte’s for sharing your beautiful and spacious home with us!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was great, everything we needed!! Brigitte was on top of all communication. We will be back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"A great location for our family. Very peaceful and spacious. Soooo clean and I have never been to an air b n b with such an extensive kitchen set up. We never lacked for quality pots, pans or cooking utensils as we were there a week. The river was a bit fast for me due to rains, but a few in our group loved using the kayaks. Would definitely stay here again if we are in Fairmont.
Also, as a side note, we ate one night at the Dutchman’s daughter restaurant. If you are looking for great home cooking at reasonable prices, look no further. Their lemon meringue pie rivaled my grandmas!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was as advertised. It was perfect for my adult children and their families. The home was clean and spacious. It had everything we could have wanted. Canoes, kayaks, river access, beautiful camp fire area, very nice grill and outside sitting area, sandy play area for the toddlers, wonderful comfortable sitting areas inside. Had a rainy day but it worked out well with all of us being inside. Perfect family vacation spot! We all loved it!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family loved this house! We enjoyed sitting on the deck and looking at the river and also loved fishing and kayaking with a few steps out the back door. The first floor master bedroom was very convenient for those who don't want to climb steps. This house appeals to families of all ages, since there are toys and kids' books and a separate hangout space for teenagers in the loft. It feels very peaceful and remote, but you can get to the grocery store in ten minutes. We hope to return to this house for another relaxing stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay in the house. It is spacious, well appointed and in a great location to have a little time in the river. Wish I could wake up to that view everyday!
We were also able to check out 2 local breweries this time. A really lovely area. Thanks!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The property was near perfect. It was clean and the location was awesome, right on the river.
Owner communication was very good.
My one and only complaint is that there were renovations taking place. Most of it was completely tolerable, understandable, and turning out really well. The one incomplete renovation that I didn’t like was the exposed soffits at the roof which can lead to problems if not finished soon. I’m sure they’ll address that as soon as they are able.
Bonus- the living area has a HUGE nice leather couch that wasn’t there when the picture was taken.
Overall- it’s a beautiful property that they’ve done a great job updating. You can’t beat being right on the river. I recommend renting the place, as long as you are aware that, as the listing mentions, renovations are taking place (that theoretically won’t affect your stay at all)."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is beautiful and has great location. The town of Fairmont is close by. We found a great little coffee place Joe And Throw. Communication with Bridgette was great. This home is amazing. We had a wonderful time and booked another visit.
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a great house for a little getaway on the water! Perfectly set between Clarksburg and Morgantown, Fairmont has things of its own to offer but it’s also close enough for events in either of the other cities! Would definitely stay again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house is in a great location and everything is as described. The river was great for kayaking and the wifi was strong for feeling like you were in the middle of nowhere. Kitchen was well stocked as well.
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to have fun and experience nature. Very relaxing. Plenty of space. Lots to do. We went kayaking, canoeing and fishing. Played cornhole and toasted smores.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time visiting my son at WVU and celebrating a birthday. The house has a nice view of the river and had everything we needed. We kayaked, fished, played games, and hiked Coopers Rock. Host was very nice and answered any questions we had promptly."
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Large house out door river setting positively beautiful very nice was like home loved it
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,The home was perfect for our needs. So much so that we have shared the info with other family members who come to Fairmont to visit family. The set up of bedrooms and furniture is perfect for families with children. We had 3 children 7 and under and 4 adults. We could have easily hosted several others for the 3 days. Highly recommend.
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful location! Brigitte is the best!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,we had a good time beautiful house by the river nice view
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Brigitte’s place. House was spacious and although we weren’t actually there a lot (visiting friends) - when we were it was great. Love being right on water. It was very cold, but I’m sure in warmer weather the outdoor activities would even take it up a notch.
Host was superb - provided detailed info and check-in/out were a breeze. Snow was predicted and she had ice melts dropped off for us.
There are minor things being worked on - mostly cosmetic and nothing troublesome, at least for our group. And that was made entirely clear in the listing.
Overall great stay!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Awesome home! We were in town for a college football game but didn’t want to stay in Morgantown. Very accurate description & photos!

2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful, clean, informative host"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space and plenty of room for the whole family. The space was clean and inviting. Gorgeous kitchen and deck.

The train passing by, under the moonlight and by the river was magical!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Brigitte’s place was wonderful. It had lots of great *extras* like kids toys, boats and rafts, a fire pit and indoor fireplace.
The house was well appointed and lovely. Very clean. And the views and access to the river were the best part. Would not hesitate to stay here again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great host and a lovely home in a beautiful scenic area. Above and beyond as described (and the pictures don't do the scenery justice). Thank you for sharing your wonderful space with others to enjoy.
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,We stayed at the house with a group of 7 family members and it fit everyone very comfortably. Lots of space to hang out with everyone and the upstairs has a place to hang out too if kids want to be away from the adults. The outside area was great. Really fun to take the kayaks and canoe out or have a fire at night. Definitely recommend staying here if you have a big group. Host communication was very prompt and informative. Such great time!
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Simple unbelievable and ideal! Beautiful home on the river. We got to spend time with the family and kids were able to use kayaks and canoes on the river. The house is spectacular with everything you need for a weekend or a weekly stay or even longer. Games for kids, kayaks, canoes, fishing, and beautiful view to sit down and look at the river and the peaceful views. Definitely recommend this house and definitely will be coming back! Great hosts!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home, tremendous host/communication. We used it for a group of old WVU alumni reuniting for Homecoming weekend and were 100% satisfied. Absolutely highest recommendation!!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect location for a getaway with access to river. Stayed with 7 of my best friends for a 30th birthday. Plenty of beds for everyone and room for everyone to relax. The house was very well stocked with all essential needs and some extras such as kayaks, tubes and cornhole boards for entertainment. House was very clean and spacious!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The host is great and communicates at every point in the process. The description and pictures are totally accurate.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was beautiful! My family had so much fun fishing, swimming, using the kayaks, floats provided by the host. We also explored spots around town recommended by the host. Great trip all around and hope to go back again! Thanks, the Johnson Family"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is spacious, comfortable, clean and the river location is relaxing. Plenty of amenities as listed. The access to the water for floating on tubes and kayaking was convenient. Our group had a blast outside on the lower deck, covered sitting area and gathered around the fire (lots of firewood provided!) It was so nice we barely left the property. Everyone agreed it was a fantastic find."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You will not be disappointed with the Tygart River House. Our Grandchildren age 13, 8, 7, & 2 had a wonderful time swimming in the shallow river and floating on the river tubes. The house is equipped with everything you need for an enjoyable stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a great experience! Great location and close to shopping.
The home is beautiful and very clean. I felt right at home.
We loved the river being in the back yard, use of kayaks and swimming.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place on the river! The whole family had a blast!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is beautifully decorated. The views are stunning and the windows let you enjoy the river throughout the house. The hosts thought of everything - the kitchen was very well appointed, the beds and baths cozy and comfortable. Our family had a great time kayaking and playing in the river. I highly recommend."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our weekend getaway on the River!
We are a family of five, with three children ranging in age from 10 months to 14 years. Finding a space that accommodates everyone’s needs can be tricky, but this location was just what we needed.
The layout of the house was perfect. Open floor plans that provided plenty of space to move freely. Everyone had their own room and my 2 year old LOVED all the books and toys. I liked the use of the upstairs landing area; my kids could play upstairs while I was downstairs and everyone was heard. Bring a baby gate though if you have little ones who haven’t mastered stairs.
The kitchen was spacious and adequately stocked with pots, pan, and culinary equipment. We enjoyed cooking our own meals, making burgers on the deck, and s’mores in the fire pit. (We picked up groceries from the Kroger on the way in - about 20 minutes from the house.) The house does not have a high chair, so if you need one, bring it.
The aesthetics of the house is very appealing. Clean and spacious. Beautifully decorated. As mentioned in the post, the house isn’t finished; however, it’s doesn’t interfere too much with the stay. (There are some un-tiled areas, exposed plywood, etc. Nothing too major.) The master bedroom is spacious and comfortable. It has its own entry to the deck and it’s own bathroom. The bathroom has plenty of room. Unfortunately, the gorgeous bath takes too long to fill for it to be enjoyable.
One recommendation I would make is to install a stereo/speaker system. If you want to listen to music throughout the house, bring a portable speaker. We played it from our phones and it was fine, but a speaker system would add that extra refinement. There is a tv in the upstairs landing, but you can’t have the downstairs tv and the upstairs tv on at the same time. It may make more sense to move the landing tv to the bedroom.
We were very grateful to the hosts for giving us access to the canoes and kayaks. There are life vests for all ages. And easy, walk-in access to the river.
On Friday, we traveled 40 minutes to Tygart Lake and rented a pontoon boat. Definitely call the marina well in advance to reserve a boat. On Saturday, we went to Adams Street for the market and antique car show. Fairmont also has plenty of playgrounds for your little ones.
Overall, we loved our stay. Hosts were friendly and communicative. The house was clean and appealing. The river was easily accessible. There are neighbors immediately next to you, so it’s not a private getaway, but they were friendly and not noisy.
Thanks for a great time!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing vacation home for a fun family stay, lots of activities to do on the water and surrounding areas

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time! We had 3 families with young kids. The house had lots of fun games and kids stuff around which helped entertain them since it rained most of our trip. There's lots of great things to do outdoors, we went to the fishing pond and visited Valley Falls State Park, which were both close. The house was fully stocked with everything we needed and Brigitte was quick and helpful with any questions that we had. We will definitely be back"
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The placeseems to be Harley Davidson themed by the colors of the home. It’sawesome! High ceilings, new kitchen, nice view off the deck, and the host was amazing. We’ll be back!!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location with river views.

Brigitte responds quickly and is delightful. Would definitely recommend."
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a great place for a getaway. We absolutely loved it! Lots of space and the canoes and firepit made our stay way better than expected. As mentioned in the description, there is still a bit of work being done on the house so keep in mind with toddlers and/or pets. The hosts were very detailed with providing information and letting us know if we need to take any caution with any areas"
2021-02-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, furniture condition, aesthetics were highly variable, multiple areas of the home were still under construction or unfinished. Accommodates a large group, kitchen is nice, master bed very nice. Price point is high for quality of home. Still a good place for a large group especially due to paucity of options in the area."
2021-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great house on the river with an amazing view. The kitchen was a dream to cook in! Will definitely come back during warmer weather to enjoy the river more.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A must stay! Traveling with kids has never been easier. The separate loft space and kids play room let the adults relax more than usual on a vacation! Even in January, it was amazing to sit out overlooking the river and take in the views. The kitchen is actually fully stocked, some places say that- spices, chefs knives, baking dishes, kids utensils, etc. One of our favorite stays so far!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had the moat amazing stay. Pictures really do not so this place justice. The home is well stocked with everything you need. Very clean and comfortable. Very quiet and serene. Do not hesitate to book here!
2020-11-01,4.0,Group trip,"Beautiful large house right on the river, and more spacious than it appears in photos. Wonderful family trip here, and enjoyed hiking in the area and canoeing on the river. As noted some parts of the house are unfinished, but this did not meaningfully detract from a great stay."
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing location right on the river. House is bright as there are big windows facing the river. We enjoyed breakfast on the balcony and the peaceful river.
It’s a quiet area and the neighbors are super friendly.
House is spacious and 4 bedrooms is a huge plus. Each of our guests had their own bedrooms.
Amenities were stocked - even down the details of floss.
Host was quick to respond for questions and the keypad entry was an easy check in process."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed a wonderful family getaway on the beautiful Tygart River in a this lovely house. The house itself was warm and comfortable for 6 adults and 2 children. The surrounding area offers park and recreation options to enjoy the outdoors. The owners were helpful and accommodating.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay here! Our host was very communicative, check in and check out was easy. The kitchen was well stocked with all the pots, pans and utensils you could ever need! Very comfortable beds as well. We went to Valley Falls State Park and enjoyed a scenic hike. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at the Tygart retreat. We came for a two family getaway and could not have been happier. If you have kids the place is (neatly) stocked with toys and a separate play area.
The pictures really do not do this place justice. The canoes and kayaks were a great treat. As they say in the ad theres small parts that are unfinished, but these didn’t impact our stay at all. They were so accommodating and fast to respnd to any questions, we will definitely be back!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I had a blast in West Virginia. We all met there as it was in the middle of where we all live. We canoed/kayaked, hiked, fished, grilled, baked and played games. It was just what we were wanting. There are a few unfinished projects as mentioned in the listing but none of it got in our way."
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay and great hospitality.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great perch on the Tygart river. We enjoyed taking our kids out on the canoes and fishing from the riverbank at the property. We had a great time -- William and Brigitte's home is lovely. Our kids really enjoyed the little climbing structure too. Very cool.
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This retreat is a great place to relax.
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our family loved being on the water and having access to canoes, kayaks and fire pit. Side trips to the state parks, brewery, and river trails were fun and easily done. We truly enjoyed our stay and this was the perfect setting if one of the group needs some time alone with nature!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Really nice spot if you just want to get away for the weekend. Has everything you need to just cook in and just relax. Kayaks and canoes were a plus. Definitely recommend!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great family house. We had a lot of fun. When driving in, avoid Pinchgut Hollow. Take Coalfax Rd instead."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is well stocked with kayaks, canoes and rafts! Getting to the water is a bit of a walk down from the kitchen but overall we had great time in a very peaceful neighborhood."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful, peaceful week at Tygart River Retreat. The river was lovely to swim in, the host recommended bringing water shoes and we were glad to have them along. The canoe and kayaks provided were a lot of fun. The house was well stocked and very comfortable. Other than a few day trips to nearby state parks for hiking, we didn't feel the need to leave!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, really great property. The location is great with lots of activities to enjoy. Definitely check out the nearby waterfalls at Valley Falls and Audra State Park Rock City Trail. The Dairy Creme Corner has excellent and affordable food and ice cream, WildFlour restaurant is yummy as well. There is a local putt-putt golf place nearby too. Everything is within 15-30 min.
The house was clean and communication with the hosts was responsive and easy.
The were two things with this property that a renter should be aware of. They should not detract from you renting the property but I think are helpful to note. First, the house is quite noisy. The loft makes it hard to watch TV both upstairs and down and noise really carries overall. The steps are extremely loud no matter how much you tiptoe and every door in the house squeaks.
Second, the access to the river is a bit frustrating. The basement exit is private to the owners and there is no safe walkway from the front of the house because you have to walk directly on the narrow gravel road. This is fine, but for little ones, you will be constantly walking up and down to the house with them. I would also be wary of people with issues walking since it is a bit of an incline down the driveway.
Really fun and relaxing vacation with a home with nice amenities. Definitely recommend!"
2020-07-01,4.0,Group trip,Beautiful location. So much fun to be in the river. Great amenities. Kitchen was great.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic time during our week long family vacation at the Tygart River Retreat. House is very modern, new, clean, and comfortable. A/C units (1 upstairs and 1 downstairs) worked very well during the hot weather and the wifi was very good. Kitchen has everything you need. Beds and bathrooms were nice, plenty of hot water, plentiful towels. Outside, we used the canoes and kayaks every day. The river was refreshing and clean for swimming. Water level was low so you can walk the entire river. (Recommend to bring water shoes as the rocks in the river are slippery.) We fished a lot and caught a few small smallmouth bass and rock bass. We used the gas grill and the fire pit for smores. Hosts were incredibly responsive before and during the trip. I highly recommend this house."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a true retreat in the wilderness! And great for families!
Everything that you need to enjoy the river is available at the house. Wonderful almost 360^ views of the Tygart river.
Enjoyed sitting at the private river beach, especially at sunset accompanied by a campfire...
The hosts were responsive and welcoming.
Looking forward to staying here again."
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you're looking for a beautiful, relaxing place to stay, look no further!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a fantastic family getaway! Our youngest loved having toys and books to read and our older kids loved the boating.

I feel so refreshed and relaxed."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pleasant Valley Retreat met our needs perfectly. I appreciated the nice shower head and plenty of towels. My very tall son appreciated his own queen-size bed. His little brother liked the bigger-than-ours screen tv. My husband liked that it was so close to the interstate exit and still peaceful. It was immaculately clean. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone.

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Our company was working near by for a week so it was a great place to go back and get cleaned up and rested up for our next day of work. This place had everything that we needed to get through our work week. Thanks for letting us stay at your place.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful host, clean home, very responsive. Would recommend to anyone."
2024-06-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an interesting stay. While we thought the place was nice, there was a lot of stairs. making it difficult to bring up luggage's etc. when we got to the rooms we were extremely disappointed when seeing the beds. one room had a 5 inch mattress on a metal bedframe with no box spring or anything to cushion you from feeling the metal bars underneath you. and then the second room had a box spring but the mattress was cheap and broken. it ""v'd"" in the middle of the bed when 2 people laid in it. making it extremely uncomfortable. all pillows sucked. we contacted the host and asked if he would do something because my mother was sleeping in the recliner downstairs because it was so uncomfortable to sleep in the bed. the host then acted as if he was going to get some mattress pads to fix the problem, and when we said we would be there for him to bring them he said he was absolutely not doing anything for our stay and we could leave. RUN FROM THIS RENTAL. host was rude and is unhelpful."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet safe location. Clean and comfortable. Be aware it is multi level and stairs are required to access living and sleeping areas.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time staying here. It is a perfect spot for a family. Great communication from the host and being able to park in the garage is a very nice and safe touch. Thanks

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"For anyone looking for a place to stay in the Bridgeport, WV area, this townhouse would suit anyone perfectly.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We enjoyed our stay at Andrea’s place! It is just a short drive to get to the hospital, mall, grocery stores, etc. There are also a few restaurants in walking distance.
The townhome is located in a quiet neighborhood and we enjoyed sitting on the porch soaking up the sunshine and admiring the surrounding hills.
Communication was very quick and easy. Andrea was the most responsive host I have ever interacted with!
Those with any mobility issues should note there is one flight of stairs to get from the entry/garage/laundry to the living room/kitchen and a second flight of stairs up to the bedrooms."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at the townhouse. It was well appointed with two large bedrooms that were both ensuite. Included was a Keurig coffee maker & well-stocked kitchen and bathrooms. A full-sized laundry is on-site. Check in was easy & check out was simple. The townhouse has one parking space (not including the garage) but there was overflow space nearby. It was a quiet place (except for our 17-month-old granddaughter).
Access off I-79 is very easy & US 50 is just a few miles down the road. The nearby amenities are very good with 2 gas stations nearby, one with Dunkin Donuts. Within walking distance are Meagher’s Irish Pub and Mia Margherita Coal-Fired Pizza. Just down the road is Mountain State Brewing. Highly recommend all 3.
Andrea communicated regularly and was quite helpful. It is a great alternative to the noise and expense of the nearby hotels.
Highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Andrea was such a wonderful, understanding host and this house is perfect if you need a spot in Bridgeport. Especially if you’re traveling with a child. The neighborhood is quiet but you’re a 3 minute walk to bars and restaurants and a quick drive to anything in the area. It’s especially convenient if you’ll need to go to UHC. It’s also a well appointed house with all the amenities that you need. It was perfect for us!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was awesome!!! A little home away from home. Very comfortable, affordable and clean."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the cleanest and best-maintained rentals I have experienced! The location was easy to find and in a quiet neighborhood. Many dining options are very close by, and it is just a few minutes away from the highway entrance."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The townhouse is lovely. We used it as a home base for visiting family in the area. We are two 80 year old gals who managed the stairs just fine. It was nice to come back in the evening to Netflix and Prime.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Andrea very responsive. Only problem we had and I probably just over looked when booking. A lot of stairs. My 81 year old dad traveled with us and it was difficult for him to climb the stairs from the garage to the living area and then more stairs to shower and bedrooms. Not Andrea’s fault. I should have paid more attention.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Andrea’s place was exactly what we needed for a weekend visiting the area (and more)!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cannot say enough about this place!!! Bonus was the powder room on the main floor and the Farmers market out the back door on Sunday. Love the Tiffany Blue accent color throughout the main floor.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed Andrea’s place so much that we came back for another week!
We will be staying here in the future for sure if we are back in the area"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed staying at this townhouse. About 10-15 minutes from Almost Heaven wedding venue and Bridgeport exits. Having 2.5 bathrooms was convenient and parking for 2 cars in garage and driveway was easily accessible. I recommend this as a place to stay. Andrea was responsive to messages and sent code and information for check in.

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, it’s in a quiet little community right off the freeway. Surrounding area appeared to be just as nice. Everything you would probably need is well within a 10/15 min. drive.
The property was neat, clean and well kept.
Heads up! lots of stairs. Three floors worth, lol
Do yourself a solid and either bring or go buy yourself some different pillows, cause those were about as flat as a…
A mattress topper would be a pretty solid investment as well.
Aside from that it really was a great place and we had everything we needed."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place to stay for our weekend trip for a WVU football game! Everything was incredibly clean and comfortable and there was clearly thought put into what would make us feel taken care of - there were extra toiletries in the bathrooms and a helpful list of places to eat. On game day, it was a quick 35 minute drive to Morgantown and there’s a brewery less than a mile down the road where we watched the rest of the games when we got back. Will definitely be back!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was so great. The house is beautiful, clean, and close to everything. Our daughter didn't want to leave the house while my husband and I went out exploring.

My family and I had a wonderful time and the house was definitely a highlight of our trip. No complaints."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andrea’s place was perfect for our out-of-town work stay. Comfortable, clean, cozy. Highly recommend!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We very much enjoyed our stay at this Airbnb. The home was nicely decorated, very clean & comfortable and had everything we needed to enjoy our extended vacation. We always travel with our own pillows and the comfortable mattresses ensured we had a very restful night's sleep. As to the location - PERFECT! There are several restaurants within walking distance (American, Italian, Peruvian, Irish...) and even more restaurants within a short drive. And the local farmers market held on Sundays - GREAT. We also like to walk for exercise and we were not disappointed in our options. Andrea was a wonderful host as she checked in with us to see if we needed anything and, if we had a question, she responded very quickly. Definitely will stay there again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andrea's townhouse was a wonderful place to stay. We were in the Bridgeport area for work, having a very comfortable and extremely convenient place to rest each evening was great. The fact that each bedroom had it's own well appointed ensuite and Internet capable TV was icing on the cake! We will go out of way to stay again
Chris, Cindy & Thomas Cartledge"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very convenient, good food nearby. Quiet home, comfortable sofa and showers are great. Only complaint was pillows were a tad uncomfortable so make sure to bring your own if you care about that sort of thing. All in all would definitely recommend staying here, Andrea communicated so well and everything was as described! Check-in was a Breeze, and the garage was such a bonus as we had mountain bikes with us and we loved that we could store them in the garage when not in use! Would stay here again next time we are in town!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway, spacious, smart TVs, clean, good location, quiet, private, nice patio. Would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was in a super quiet, peaceful area, with incredible views of the mountains. My husband and I really enjoyed how quiet and unplugged the home felt. I think we were the first visitors this summer (based on the guest book at least), so some of the outdoor spaces were super overgrown (and not really explore-able due to concern with snakes), but we did get some good use out of the firepit and main walking path!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Such a beautiful spot on the mountain, and with log cabins just around the bend.
Next door neighbor sells farm fresh brown eggs for $3 a dozen!
Sean was very responsive and accommodating.
Would gladly visit again"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had friends visit from Lancaster Co Pennsylvania. We loved the location and the Whip-poor-will who would sing when we were outside at night. The place is bigger than it looks and really clean. We were able to prepare meals at the location but also enjoyed the towns around us as well. We will book with Sean again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved everything about our stay!!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was very peaceful, exactly what we were looking for to enjoy our new years! Sean responds quickly and sends restaurant recommendations before you arrive! Also the home had kid toys which was great with our boys, Thank you!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,We are a group of old friends that love getting away for a weekend once a year. We chose this place because it was still near our old stomping grounds and it was out in the country. We enjoyed ourselves so much. Thank you again!!!

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Sean's place. We just needed a place to crash at night while we visited family during the days. It is very remote and peaceful. Sean was very responsive and proactive in communicating with us. They left nice snacks to welcome us. Things to consider for future guests are that it is not pet free. There have been pets at the home and it could use a good cleaning.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location. Very peaceful and quiet. Host was extremely responsive and very friendly.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Sean and Tracy's place provided us with an ideal setting for a peaceful weekend getaway with friends and family. The house is wonderfully situated, offering stunning views of the mountains and valley. The house was clean and it comfortably accommodated six guests, with all the necessary amenities and a well-equipped kitchen. The only drawback, I can think of, was the absence of an outdoor grill, but aside from that, our stay couldn't have been better.
Sean was incredibly responsive, promptly addressing all our inquiries and providing us with valuable recommendations for local restaurants and hiking trails. His helpful suggestions enhanced our overall experience and made our stay even more enjoyable."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sean's country home was a very nice weekend retreat. My husband and I enjoyed our stay. The country setting was a nice change from our suburban residence. The house was just as described and very tidy. The two small towns nearby were close enough to be convenient to grab meals on the go. Sean was a very responsive host. He answered all the questions I sent very quickly and in a friendly manner. In addition, he and his wife left a nice assortment of snacks for us to enjoy. It made us feel right at home! Sean and Tracy were wonderful hosts."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Head of the holler was a perfect spot for a getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. It’s located in a scenic, beautiful property where you can truly emerge in nature. Sean was incredibly responsive and accommodating. We had a wonderful, peaceful time and will definitely come back."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely great for our stay. We had a little one with us who was about 4 and she loved the kiddy room and we all felt right at home. The mountain side provided the seclusion from reality that we all needed.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the house was beautiful and sean was very helpful the whole time. highly recommend staying here!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Holler was breathtaking. We live outside of Philadephia in a much more congested area, and from the moment we arrived, we felt like we never wanted to leave.
Sean was extremely responsive with suggestions on what to do in the area down to offering a map showing us how to navigate the property and also telling us about local community events and places to eat. It was more than enough room inside for our family, and we especially loved the vintage furniture. I have a vintage furniture shop myself and truly appreciated the mix of mid century modern with newer items.
The colorful king bedspread was my favorite!
We forgot our bug spray while we explored the property and Sean had extra inside to use! Comfortable furniture, very clean space, and the most peaceful stay we have ever had. This was our first time in West VA but will not be our last.
Thank you Sean for making this such a memorable trip for our kids and having us at the Head of the Holler! We cannot wait to book again"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sean was so helpful and kind. At the last minute, he made his place available for us. The place was perfect for our needs. The surrounding area was beautiful and the chickens across the road were funny! We would definitely stay here again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was so easy to work with Sean. It is exactly as he describes. It was very clean and comfortable. I would recommend “Head of the Holler 100 percent.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We are from WV and moved to South Carolina over a year ago. when we come back to visit with our dogs, we've always stayed in a hotel. Clara's place was perfect for us. The big fenced in backyard was perfect for our dogs to run and play. The kitchen and bathroom were modern and had exactly what we needed as far as utensils, linens, etc. The rest of the house was homey and comfortable. We spent our mornings eating breakfast on the back porch and checking in on the bird's nest that was there. We will definitely stay again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What an absolutely delightful home! Very well taken care of. You can see the time & love they have put into the place. Lots of wonderful little details. Great back porch and beautiful yard! Even provide poop bags for the pups. Would wholeheartedly recommend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Felt like a cozy stay at grandma’s house, in the best way! Clara has thought of everything you could need and more. We got in late and the self check in was perfect. We were greeted by a welcome basket of snacks and waters. We took our dog and she loved the fenced in yard as did we. The house has the perfect porch for sitting and taking in the scenery. Parking was close and the area felt safe. Plenty of extra amenities you won’t be disappointed."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The unit was spotless and bathroom totally modern. Kitchen had everything we needed and we especially enjoyed the fenced back yard--as did our furry friends. It's hard to find a place that takes pets and is so much more rare to find one that WELCOMES them. Thank you Clara and Frank for going above and beyond for your guests! We'll be back next year.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay that is 10 minutes to restaurants and downtown Clarksburg. I stayed the night to go to a concert and brought my dog. The fenced yard was completely enclosed and safe for my beagle. Clean, very comfortable and thoughtfully decorated with all the amenities of home. I had no worries and felt safe. I would stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful place and great for your pups. Clara was very responsive and respectful. If you want a quaint and quiet place, sweet sisters manor is your place to stay!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our quick stay at Clara’s home. If you love antiques then you will love this house. It was a great place to stay, well appointed kitchen (included coffee, tea) and very pet friendly. Our dog loved the back yard."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We just loved the space!!! Felt right at home and the beds are oh so comfortable I know I slept like a baby. Space was clean and a great location. It was perfect for our dog he loved the backyard he explored every inch of it. It’s set up perfectly upstairs. We didn’t use the kitchen except to make coffee and tea but you have everything you need to cook a meal. My son says a 10 out of 10 he recommends this place. We will definitely stay again when we return to Clarksburg. You can’t go wrong with this place. I didn’t even mind the stairs to the second floor. Perfect place to stay!!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clara's place was great! it's important to know that the front half of the first floor is an antique shop. I was a little surprised that I only had access to the kitchen on the first floor and the rest of the living space was on the second floor. It was still very comfortable, quiet, and clean. Thank you for hosting us!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was amazing. Super clean and a great location. Would definitely stay here again.

Loved the history of the house. The owners were super responsive. We definitely would stay again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had to book last minute for a family funeral in the area. From start to finish Clara was kind, respectful and responsive. Property is pet friendly and my dogs loved the backyard. It was so nice not to have to worry about the paperthin walls and noise of a hotel causing my chihuahua to be a nervous wreck. So many interesting antiques in the house, we especially loved the fireplaces. It is an interesting layout with only kitchen downstairs and all else up, but was convenient for our needs. Nearby FOP restaurant also serves a great breakfast. We really enjoyed the peace and convenience of this location, thanks Clara!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clara's place was charming, spotless and extremely well appointed. I can't think of anything more she could have done. She included delicious treats as well as tea, coffee and cream. The bedrooms were comfortable and cozy. The kitchen and bathroom were spotless.The town is peaceful and we felt very safe. We will definitely stay again if we are passing through the area and would recommend Clara's place to anyone."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was my first time visiting stonewood wv, when I arrived the house was in excellent condition and considering I live far away I was allowed to check in early which was a huge bonus, there were even snacks! The neighborhood was very nice and cozy, the house was as well. Clara was a wonderful host and answered any of my questions right away which made me feel even better about staying in an unfamiliar place. There was even a paper with the history of the house and it’s ownership throughout the years which was very interesting to read about. She also provided a binder with a list of local restaurants/menus and activities. I stayed over the holidays and she even wished me a happy new year which was very nice of her. I would absolutely recommend staying in sweet sisters manor, and would definitely stay again. Originally I was only staying for 2 weeks but I enjoyed the peace and quiet so much I was able to extend my stay and Clara was kind enough to allow me to do so without hesitation."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a treasure to stay in such a beautiful and historic home. We loved staying here! Everything about the house was perfect!

Location is centrally located, making it super easy to visit our family members. We will definitely be back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars doesn’t do this place justice! Great place in an even better location-perfect for a short 3 day weekend getaway. My wife and I both attended school in a similar looking room—brought back alot of memories from grade school back in the 90s. It is located in a quiet neighborhood and only ~15 mins to WVU campus, Coliseum, WVU Hospital, Coopers Rock, and tons of yummy restaurants. We loved the beautiful oversized shower in the bathroom and soft close drawers/cabinets and full sized appliances in the kitchen. The beds were very comfortable and the sheets were a dream to sleep in, so soft. My wife didn’t realize she lost an earring while staying and the Host contacted us and we were reunited with the earring! Very responsive and attentive hosts!! They thought of every little detail and anticipated the needs of their guests with everything in the loft. We would definitely stay here if in the area again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My parents & I had the best time staying here the night before my college graduation! The unit lacked for nothing! Clean, large, perfect spot, we even enjoyed the quaint park directly next to the unit. The bathroom shower was beautiful, the mattresses were comfy & clean. Also, Joey is a wonderful host and had everything we needed upon arrival. If you need to stay in Morgantown for any type of event this is a wonderful place to book. The historical vibe of the old school house is also a super cool touch.
Thanks Joey!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A charming, refurbished schoolhouse room! The bedding was so comfy and everything was decorated exactly as the photos show it. The bathroom was high-end and awesome.

It was also just a cool space, honestly. I loved the old schoolhouse floors, doors, and backstory combined with the modern renovation. I will definitely be staying here every time I’m in Morgantown."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful time. Quick and perfect response to a minor issue. Felt very comfortable. Amazing shower!!! Took a hike at Cooper’s Rock.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As described. Cool open, updated and modern space with everything you need except for hairdryer. Parking can be a bit tight. We went for my sons game at WVU and this worked great. We hope to stay many more times next season."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had an amazing time staying at Joey and Genesy’s place! It was an old elementary school converted into 6 private lofts. The place was so clean, neat and they gave us a ton of recommendation during our stay. Communication was seamless and we are looking forward to coming back to Morgantown and booking this place again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was truly our fave spot yet!!! Such a unique place with a cool history behind it! The hosts were super attentive and accommodating.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joey & his wife are very friendly. They left a thank you note with waters, popcorn and mints on the kitchen counter.

I am saving this airbnb for future use for sure!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very cool, modern loft with everything we could ever need. Joey and Genesy are great. We had one issue and they solved it immediately.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came up for the WVU & Texas Tech football game, and we were so glad we chose the schoolhouse loft over a hotel! The unit was clean, stylish, well appointed, and organized. Our family of 3 was way more comfortable in this spacious loft than we would have been in a cramped hotel room. If we make it back up for a basketball game, then we will stay at this loft again. Such a cool place with loads of character."

It is quiet and close to a park -- it feels like it's far from town but it is actually walking distance from some restaurants, etc. if you don't mind hills. Everything was super clean and inviting and the hosts were very responsive. We had a great stay! Definitely recommended."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joey’s place was exactly like it said in the listing. It was super easy for us to check in and check out to get back on the road.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t be happier with our stay. We absolutely loved it & will find a reason to visit the area again, if only to stay here again. What a treat. We felt spoiled, a little boujie, and fell in love with the space.
Our hosts were nothing short of awesome. Their quick response to our few questions (had been sent prior, guest fail ), friendliness, and personal touches (hand written note & snacks) made us feel like fam.
The space is beautiful, exceptionally clean, quiet, simple but luxurious at the same time, and was more than we expected when we opened the door. Kitchen and bathroom were immaculate, all new appliances and features. Bed (we used only 1) was very comfortable, linens were clean and smelled fresh, lots of pillows to choose from. Living room area super comfortable & tv was perfect for the size for the room. Temp controls, tv, blinds all high tech but easy to use. Easy parking, less than a 5 min drive to restaurants, we'd highly recommend to anyone to book this spot"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kari is the absolute best! Her place was spotless, easy to locate and a breeze to enter late at night!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the farmhouse was even better than we had hoped for. It is even better than the description that air BNB provided. Our recommendation is, if the location works for you book your stay immediately. You will be so glad you did!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was beautiful! Very clean and comfy. The host were very friendly and the place was above and beyond what we expected
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was at my midway point in my travels. There were several reasons why this place caught my eye on the Air BnB site. The space was free of clutter, the wood floors, and the reviews of past visitors. The place matched the description and then some.
When I arrived a herd of cows moseyed over to see me. They settled on the hillside meadow across from the place for a few hours. This added the the peacefulness of the surroundings.
Indoors, the place had a calming affect. Great bed, super clean rooms, a nice sized bathroom well stocked and great towels, the back lounge area had a comfy couch where I unwound from my 6 hour drive.
I wish I could have stayed longer. I will definitely be back as this is one of my favorite Air BnB stays!
I was able to spend a little time chatting with Kari and Brad, a truly lovely couple, on their porch in the morning.
I was able to see the small waterfall on their property. I only wish I had more time spend next to this natural water feature."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely gorgeous view and wonderful apartment. Extremely nice hosts and was very worth the price
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious and cozy space. Easy to feel at home. As other reviewers have commented, the snacks are a really nice touch.

GREAT place!
#countryroadstakemehome"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our favorite Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. They were so responsive and helpful and my gosh the place is adorable. They thought of everything, cute little milk bottles and snacks. Unfortunately we went to the grocery store before we got to the place. The bed was so cozy, watching the cows outside of the bedroom window, the huge bathroom were just a few of our favorite things! We might go to West Virginia again just so we can stay here again."

Very clean, easy to find, and ultra cozy."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kari and her husband were kind, responsive and friendly. I booked last-minute but the suite was spotless and full of amenities and charm. Holiday decor was a nice touch as were all the thoughtful snacks, creamer in the fridge (huge one for me) and s'mores-making station. Bed was comfy, bathroom was large and very clean, heaters and wifi were great, and the location is really lovely, quiet and rural, while not being too far out of town (and a pretty drive out). I saw some deer grazing, and everything was beautiful in the snow. Also, easy access from main road onto a smaller backroad to arrive. Parking in drive right in front of suite. I'd stay again anytime I'm passing through."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay and enjoyed the peaceful surroundings! The space was just as pictured and had lots of thoughtful added details to make you feel at home. We would highly recommend a getaway at Brad and Kari’s!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is my favorite place to stay when I come to town… it’s the perfect getaway, exactly as described (but better!) and I’m grateful to have found this hidden gem! Thanks Kari for a wonderful stay."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just passing through and we arrived in the dark, but it was easy to find.
Woke up in the morning surrounded by farm country. Every detail was taken care of and the Decour was perfect. The bed was comfortable and bathroom was immaculate. Also many wonderful little amenities and treats that were not advertised, were left for us to enjoy. Highly recommend this comfortable getaway."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kari and Brad were extremely friendly and proactive with their communication! They have instructions for everything, answered any texts quickly, reached out to make sure everything was OK, and made me feel very comfortable in the space.
Their Airbnb space is extremely clean and nicely appointed. Everything that you could need is there. I was traveling for a work event and the kitchenette was perfect. Thank you so much for some yummy snacks and for providing for my love of coffee!
What a peaceful setting, it’s quiet and in the country, so it was perfect after several long days of work to be able to come back into such a relaxing environment! I was also quite fortunate to arrive and be greeted by 14 deer in the side fields!
I really can’t say enough about how comfortable they made me feel and how clean and comfortable the space was! I highly recommend and would absolutely return again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kari and Brad were fabulous hosts. The place was super clean, private, comfortable and quiet. Best sleep I had while on this trip. All the special touches and snacks were a welcomed surprise. Nice to wake up to the family of deer frocking in the fields."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Totally exceeded our expectations! The place was so clean with creative special touches. We sat outside and enjoyed the sunset, stars, deer and meadow view.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the nicest Airbnb’s we have ever stayed. Would definitely stay here again. Kari had gone the extra mile to make our stay special.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The night before staying at the Farmhouse we were at a Hilton in Pennsylvania. Night and Day!
The hotel lacked all the wonderful aspects we found at Kari’s: easy checkin’, personal touches, snacks, QUIET, great communication. Yes, the Farmhouse, is off the beaten path but well worth it. 15 min to Morgantown, WV, and a bit more to Fairmont, WV, on a gorgeous windy road was easier than navigating the registration process at the big name hotel. I’m a big fan of simplicity and sincere human connections. This gem had it all. Sincerely, Nancy from Whidbey Island, WA."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great if you want a secluded lovely get away! You get a real feel for being in beautiful West Virginia. The hosts are fantastic and took care of lots of details I would’ve never thought of.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,you can tell Kari and Vrad are thoughtful people by all the little extras they provided for the farmhouse.

It is very clear that Kari enjoys hosting and cares about providing a great place to stay. I would recommend this place!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely AirBnB that had all the amenities we could have hoped for! The location is tucked away on a quiet back road just a short drive outside of Morgantown. The apartment is attached to the main house, but also feels secluded because it has windows facing out to a large garden and backyard. Kari and Brad have thought of everything, from snacks to coffee (with fresh cream and milk!) to little s'mores kits to an electric water kettle to bathroom supplies. Everything was so clean and organized, and we only wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the space. We were touched by how thoughtfully everything was arranged for our stay! Will definitely be back!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kari and Brad are among the warmest and most gracious hosts I've ever experienced. With so many other reviewers I can only rave about the peace and beauty of this farm and its extraordinary personal touches. To be more specific--yes, I've previously been encouraged to enjoy the night sky. But only Kari and Brad provided actual star-gazing chairs! Thanks again for everything, you two, and I look forward to returning to this glorious place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another wonderful stay with hospitable hosts! We couldn't ask for a better place to stay after a long day hustling in the bustling city of Morgantown.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Let me start by saying that if I was EVER an Airbnb host, I’d ASPIRE to be like Kari! 😊She and Brad have done such an amazing job of creating a peaceful, clean, welcoming environment… as soon as I got there, I didn’t want to leave! I felt right at home, and they went above and beyond with the little touches that made it all the more comfortable… coffee/tea choices (with ALL the fixings), snacks, light breakfast choices… even though we didn’t get to meet while I was there (it was a busy weekend for all), I knew she was only a message away and was ALWAYS responsive. This will be our new place to stay when we are in the area… if you have the chance to book this Airbnb, do it. You won’t be disappointed! It’s a peaceful country setting but only 15-20 minutes away from all that I needed in the Morgantown area. I can’t wait to go back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Farmhouse was Awesome!! it was peaceful and quiet. The personalized welcome was cool. The s'mores maker was cool and a nice little treat before bed. The snacks and stuff to make coffee was appreciated. If you forget some essentials like tooth brush or stuff to shave. Kari and Brad have a little essentials basket made up.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"it was exactly what we needed and exerting that was advertised. we called the same day and were surprised at how available and gracious our hosts are. we didn't have an opportunity to meet our hosts, but we would certay stay again. highly recommend."

The fireflies were like fairies dancing all around."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful location and wonderfully appointed. Every detail was thoughtful and from the minute I stepped into the apartment I felt comfortable. The apartment was spotless and had I not brought anything with me in terms of toiletries or towels I would have found everything I needed right there. Fabulous stay and I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking for a restful and beautiful property.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kari and her husband are clearly gifted in hospitality. Every communication was friendly and thoughtful, going above and beyond any other hosts I have utilized here before. Their attentiveness was never intrusive, just full of kindness.
Walking in, you could immediately feel a warmth and coziness that I found so comforting. The nightly firefly performance was stellar, and I took their recommended “deer drive” to spot over 30 of them in a mile long stretch. Again, so peaceful!
I stayed at The Farmhouse as a personal retreat to refresh myself emotionally and spiritually. It was absolutely perfect for my needs!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kari and Brad's place was one of the most beautiful AirBnBs I've ever had the pleasure of staying at.

The view from the living room window was breathtaking, especially at night when the fireflies were dancing around. Thank you for everything!"

Kari's and Brad's place is exactly as described - a peaceful, country get-away with lots of wildlife and so many thoughtful amenities that make them super hosts!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kari and Brad's place was just as they showed in the photos. It was easy to find with GPS-directions and I found everything to be immaculately cleaned and organized. I appreciated the personal thoughtfulness Kari and Brad showed in their home i.e. They have snacks in the kitchen for guests that are organized ""sweet"" and ""salty"". They also provided a guiding book with listings for local food spots or outings (with descriptions and directions etc.) The stay was more than what I needed. I would definitely recommend Kari and Brad's spot if you need a quiet night or weekend out of the city. Definitely a good spot if you're looking to take a work-sabbattical or need some space/time to yourself. I would consider staying here again if I am in the area. Thank you Kari and Brad!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Magnificent! All of it… they made sure to leave lights on for our late arrival. Had a surprise snack activity waiting for us AND told us about the “light show” out back. Cannot praise this stay enough!!

By far the most cozy and comfortable place we’ve stayed at such a wonderful price! You will not be disappointed."

The home is neat with colorful and interesting accents. There are games and art materials placed all around the rooms. We particularly liked the braided rugs in the kitchen--very warm and brought back memories.
Overall, a great location."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amy’s place is everything we were looking for in a more private, peaceful stay. The pictures are exactly as the home is, but the outdoor area is even better than the pictures show. You just have to see that for yourself in real time to capture it. We did not get to spend any time in the outdoor space because of our dance schedule and rain, but will definitely return in the future when traveling to the area and make use of the yard, the grill, the fire pit and the yard games. We loved all the little details in the home, the decorative pieces with so much character, the thoughtfulness of the fruit and dessert (which we unfortunately forgot about!), the sketchbook with drawing tools in the writing space, everything. This home is absolutely beautiful, thoughtful, and provides such a peaceful vibe."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this place. Amy was very responsive. Had everything set up nicely. She even provided a few treats for us when we arrived.

The home was in a private area and the view was so beautiful. At night you could see every star in the sky. We all drive large vehicles and there was more than enough room in the driveway for us.
I would absolutely recommend this home to anyone looking to stay in the area. You will not regret it!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We went to stay at Amy’s Haywick Hideaway because we were picking up a puppy in WV the next day. We want to return just to stay there again!
This is a really lovely renovated house on a dead end country road. It’s exactly or better than the photos. It’s peaceful, and the views are spectacular. The house has everything you need - and all that makes an AirBNB special including wood for the fireplace (it was in the single digits when we were there), artisanal soap in the shower, a full coffee bar, and a complimentary chocolate chip cake and Hershey kisses.
As for the basics, the house is very clean, and Amy was super responsive.
I could not more highly recommend Amy’s place."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We felt right at home for a family Christmas gathering. We ordered take out & played with some of the games provided.

We really enjoyed the peacefulness and having our dog there to enjoy the night with us made it even more special.

The home is immaculate, and beautifully decorated. You can be in Morgantown, Clarksburg, or Fairmont well within an hour, so the location is perfect. Amy was a super responsive and hospitable host. Her little touches throughout the home definitely didn’t go unnoticed. We had a great stay and are highly likely to stay again in the near future since family is close. Thank you Haywick Hideaway!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Myself and a coworker stayed at Amy's home for a week of work in Grafton. We were there during peak leaf-changing time in mid-October and the view and weather were wonderful. We enjoyed preparing meals 'at home' in the well-equipped kitchen and the propane grill was a great amenity. The home was very quiet and peaceful and allowed us to have a nice break from work during evening hours.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is SPOTLESS!The cleanest Airbnb we have ever been to! It was so peaceful to disconnect from the city life & enjoy what Mother Nature Has to Offer! We were greeted with a huge smile that never left her face (even when she didn’t feel well) to the eggs we were given (which were delicious). Sitting by the pond & enjoying the birds & the frogs. The house was supplied with everything you need. All you need is yourself & groceries that you may want to bring! Inside there are outlets with usb C & A ports. We drove an EV & Heather was so nice to let us use her charger. There are lots of parks & activities to do within a reasonable driving distance & restaurants in town. You will also get to see beautiful mountains & will come across some deer (they stay out of your way). Overall, incredible Host, spotless Home. Peaceful & private! Wish we could have stayed longer! Recommend 10000% I’d give her a 1000 stars if I could! Not enough characters to Rave about Her! You WONT regret booking!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful property! Dogs were a great bit of company. Loved sitting on the porch with some tunes. Cows across the way in the morning is a nice touch. Tiny as advertised, but very cozy for the two of us.
Drier was loud, so do your laundry during the day.
Heather is a wonderful host! 🩷"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place holds a unique charm, nestled in the rolling hills of West Virginia. As evening fell, we indulged in stargazing—a spectacle of celestial wonders—and awakened to the melodic chirping of birds and a captivating fog settled in the alcove where this Airbnb resides. We witnessed the sunrise, painting hues of gold through the mist and over the pond cradled by the hills. Heather has meticulously attended to every detail, both within and outside the cabin, creating an ambiance of serene beauty. Our only regret is the brevity of our stay. I would love to come back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather was a wonderful, proactive host who was very attentive to make sure our visit was pleasant and comfortable. The location and atmosphere was superb.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heather is always a great host! Very responsive and accommodating. I’ve stayed twice at this property. I will definitely revisit. The cottage has everything you need, just bring your self and food and your set. The beautiful and tranquil setting is just fantastic. It makes me pause and forget about life for a little while. If you’re taking a break from a road trip or vacationing in WV , I recommend Heather’s place 300%, 6 out of 5 stars."

The bed was so soft and the pillows fluffy, just like I prefer! The front porch was peaceful and overlooked the pond. The landscape was fantastic. The pups, Winston and Molly, were a wonderful addition. Winston came to check on me often while out in his walks around the land. It was an amazing experience and a million times better than any hotel could be."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Almost stayed at a boring hotel in Morgantown, so glad we didnt! Worth the drive, beautiful countryside and an oasis she's created. Incredible decorating and attention to detail. Generous with amenities including farm fresh eggs. Hope to visit again."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We highly enjoyed our stay at Heather’s home in rural Fairmont. The country setting with beautiful views was lovely to wake up to each morning.

Nice touches inside and out and exceptionally well provisioned. The property is beautiful and Heather was generous with her time to tell us about it and to show us around. First time visiting WVa in the fall and there was so much to do. We will definitely be back. Can’t recommend this cabin and Heather as a host enough.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather was a lovely host and made us feel very welcomed and comfortable. The property was stunning and the tiny house was beautifully decorated. If you go in the cold weather, you may want to bring a space heater for downstairs."

The house of a tiny house but everything fits in! Two beds, full bath and kitchen.
If you are in the Fairmont area and need a nice quiet place to unwind, please consider this place."

But most of all, heather is a true Gem and we are blessed to call her a friend! We will definitely be coming back again and again !"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What can I say? WOW. Heather’s air bnb and adjoining farm are heavenly. The small house has everything needed to cook homemade meals, and is very clean with comfortable beds. There is nothing quite like waking up to the beautiful sunrise and sounds of nature outside the bedroom window. The way the morning fog settles over the surrounding hills is otherworldly. The farm features a pond for swimming, fruit trees for picking, and much more. I won’t give it all away — it’s a treasure trove of relaxing activities. My wife and I will absolutely be back. Again and again."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heather’s place is a beautiful traditional family homestead with a civil war era home, an apple orchard, chickens and a spring fed pond. It’s a tribute to early America. She has built a couple of lovely cabins that are comfortable & very well appointed. In addition she is a lovely host- very interesting & talented (her stained-glass windows are stunning).
