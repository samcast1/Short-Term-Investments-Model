2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was spotless and very much like a treehouse. Kaye was amazing and quick to respond to questions.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a hidden gem! Kaye was awesome. Always available for questions. The treehouse is beautifully decorated, smells amazing and white glove clean.
Kaye thank you so much for sharing your treasure. We definitely will be returning. Downtown Greenville is minutes away Uber was $11 give or take. Check out the treehouse you'll fall in love ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was BY FAR the greatest rental I have ever stayed at. The location was no more than 10-15 minutes to anywhere we went in downtown Greenville, yet while you were at the location, it felt like you were so secluded. The house was spotless and I am very picky when it comes to cleanliness! I didn‚Äôt think it would be possible for the house to be even more beautiful than the pictures, but it was! Kaye was so kind to leave easy directions, fresh flowers, coffee and treats. I am trying to find the next time I can visit again for the peacefulness and convenience of this home!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic home. Very well built, decorated, and maintained. Exactly like the photos. We loved the multiple outdoor spaces and quiet of being amid the trees. Our kids loved the rope hammock, and it was very comfortable. Host communicated very well and left a few items at check in that were greatly appreciated. House rules are to remove shoes, which we gladly did. The property is very clean and well maintained."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay! Kaye was amazing to work with! Cannot recommend this stay enough!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt say enough positive things about the experience. From the moment you walk inside, you feel comfortable, peaceful, and like you‚Äôve escaped. Comfortable linens, so well decorated, and everything you need. All the extra touches and beautiful interior design make it special. Fresh flowers and cookies were an added touch. The porches, heater, outdoor tv, and roof top deck were amazing. I will definitely come back and have already recommended to friends. Thank you"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in the Cozy Treehouse! That‚Äôs exactly what it is - cozy. Loved the decor, so well thought out and top quality. So peaceful nestled among the trees and greenery. Ate lunch on the deck with the sun shining through the trees. Near perfect! Coffee, creamer, and snacks were plentiful and appreciated. Shower was phenomenal. Everything really was just perfect!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve stayed in plenty of Airbnbs and NEVER have I been this impressed. The attention to detail in the building process, decor, amenities, cleanliness, location. Everything about this stay was perfect. Kaye was very responsive and welcoming with awesome recommendations. It was very close to downtown while also feeling like an escape from everything. The peaceful view and the comfy and cozy spots to lounge around made it the perfect spot. I was nervous because the photos looked perfect and I‚Äôve never stayed anywhere that the pictures matched the actual place perfectly. When I walked in I was in disbelief by how accurately it was all described. I will never stay anywhere else when I visit Greenville. Thank you so much kaye for creating such a dream for people. You should be proud! ü•∞"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kaye‚Äôs place is one of the best we‚Äôve stayed in by far. It was extremely clean and well stocked with everything we needed. Close to downtown Greenville, the location is great. Stay here when you‚Äôre in Greenville!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the coolest treehouse I‚Äôve ever seen and one of my favorite rentals ever! It was just perfect for my family! I will be sending pictures and highly recommending this to many friends and family members!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As pictured!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cozy treehouse was even more beautiful in person and extremely well thought out. As soon as we walked in we felt welcome. It is a perfect slice of peaceful nestled right in the city. We loved that downtown was only 10 minutes away. Our family enjoyed it so much we are already talking about coming back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family absolutely loved both the cabin and location. Kaye was terrific with communication.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are thinking of renting The Cozy Treehouse, do it! We very much enjoyed our stay. The kids loved the net, and we loved the enclosed patio!! The outside heater was perfect for the cold nights. The treehouse looks straight out of a magazine and was very clean. Perfect stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve been staying in AirBNB‚Äôs around the US and Europe for over 10 years and this was the most beautiful and cleanest one I‚Äôve stayed in. It was in absolutely pristine condition when we arrived and our host, Kaye, left detailed instructions on how to operate everything in the home as well as snacks, coffee, tea and fresh flowers. All of the attention to detail throughout the home really made it feel like a home away from home verses the usual stale hotel feel. The home is very close to downtown Greenville which was beautiful as well and filled with many things to do and restaurants. I would highly recommend staying here!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at this AirBnB. Accommodations were as described and my kids LOVED the hammock! Shower was amazing and we took advantage of the many outside spaces. So nice being remote and private yet within an easy commute to downtown.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is 100% worth the stay! The view was beautiful and loved the indoor Hammock!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It isn't often that places hit so spot on to expectations, but our stay at the cozy treehouse was as good as we expected, and more. The attention to detail that Kaye has put into her rental did not go unnoticed. Not only was this a great place for us to spend our time in Greenville, but it has the kind of lasting impression where I am thinking about what kind of projects I want to bring back to our home. The only negative I can think of is the train that comes nearby at night; be prepared to set up some white noise to help you sleep through the horn as it comes through. Even with that, I see ourselves returning to the treehouse next time we are looking to visit Greenville."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as pictured, absolutely beautiful styling and super clean."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kaye was awesome! The treehouse was so much fun and definitely exceeded expectations. There are other houses on the property but they are far away and don't take away from the seclusion/privacy at all. We will definitely be re-booking for our next Greenville trip. We could have lived there!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cozy treehouse is perfect for a Greenville getaway. It is absolutely precious inside. The colors, design, and concept all worked beautifully together. The house is peaceful, well organized, and cozy. The cargo net hangout was a big hit after a day of skiing. The modern Scandinavian vibe made it perfect for a winter weekend away. My family loved the stay and will recommend this listing to all of our friends and family. Kaye was a perfect host. We cannot wait to come back and visit again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cutest house ever! Perfect location. 5 miles from anything and everything Greenville! Nestled in the woods and decorated so well. We loved our stay!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The treehouse was wonderful will be back
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home! Very peaceful and nestled in woods! Bed is extremely comfortable and the decor is stunning!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful stay on a very unique property. This is indeed a very ""cozy"" location, but also quite spacious for what it is. It's built higher off the ground, which lends to the treehouse feel (although it's not the same type of ""treehouse"" you may have had as a kid!).
Very clean, comfortable, and quiet. Tons of natural light through large windows, which we loved. There is lots of outdoor seating, with several porch areas. This place was exactly what we were hoping for, and we were very pleased. Just be sure to read the description and instructions carefully. We were fine without a full kitchen, and came prepared accordingly.
We recommend this place highly. It was a peaceful, private stay in a uniquely imagined space. Host was excellent and very responsive to our needs. Thank you!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a fabulous place to stay!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Beautiful views to look out on and wake up to. The place was extremely clean just as pictured. Host was very responsive. Everything was within a 10-15 minutes drive.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this unique treehouse! no matter where we went in greenville - we were always just a quick 10 minute drive away! great location, the back porch with the heater was our favorite reading spot! so much fun!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy Treehouse is a hidden gem. We felt right at home and enjoyed every moment of our stay. We spent most of our time relaxing on the patios and decks, snuggled up watching movies. It was the perfect little getaway. Thank you for having us!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous home. My wife and I had a wonderful time!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing! Very beautiful and fun place to spend time with loved ones!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this place! My husband and I needed a small little getaway and this was perfect! We fell in love with the place! The location and the views were breathtaking, you almost forget you‚Äôre in Greenville! We will definitely be coming back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A magical stay! Such a beautiful home with tasteful decor, a relaxing view, and a great host- it exceeded our expectations! It rained for majority of our stay, but in my opinion, it only made it cozier. Must check out the outdoor shower! A one-of-a-kind experience!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Loved the views and the treehouse was just what we wanted! It was very clean and there were several cool features to the house that we enjoyed.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying at Kaye‚Äôs place and would recommend it to anyone! Would love to come back again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful treehouse, responsive host, and will definitely return in the near future. Thank you so much!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A short ride to downtown Greenville, this quaint, private, cozy little home was great."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a hidden gem. It's nestled into a hidden forest in a residential area, convenient to downtown and getting around. The architecture, aesthetics, and interior design of this place are awesome. The indoor-outdoor shower was great, and refreshing. The bed was super comfortable."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would stay here again and highly recommend for anyone looking for a clean, beautiful accommodation. It felt like home. You don‚Äôt even need slippers, it‚Äôs that clean.
Everything was perfect, from the decorations to the furniture, the comfortable bed and the fully stocked kitchen, just bring your food and drink to stay awhile. No corners were cut while building this tree house.
Kaye was also very helpful with any questions or issues we had. We had a hard time unlocking the door but soon figured out we were hitting more than one number with our fat fingers.
This property is well worth the money for privacy and tranquility. I plan to visit when it‚Äôs a bit warmer to try the outdoor shower and hang out on the roof top nest. Thank you, Kaye for a wonderful first time visit to Greenville. We will be back."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved it!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kaye‚Äôs cozy cabin exceeded all of my expectations ! I can‚Äôt say enough about how much I enjoyed the stay here. It was squeaky clean, all the pictures posted were accurate (maybe even looked better in person). The cabin is around 15 minutes from downtown but felt so private with all the space in the back. Some of my favorite features were the floating hammock and outdoor shower. Kaye went above and beyond to leave specific instructions for getting there and any questions I may have about the place itself. Also left a few treats before I arrived <3 Wish I could give this place 10 stars. Anyone planning a visit to Greenville definitely needs to book this place it‚Äôs so worth it !"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely loved this home. It was exactly how the pictures showed it to be, very clean & welcoming for our arrival. The host was easy to communicate with throughout our booking. We were looking for a unique stay in a treehouse & this checked all those boxes. Had the feeling of being in the wilderness but close to everything Greenville has to offer. The decor & style of the home was lovely & the little unique touches that made it stand out from other locations (outdoor shower, rooftop balcony, net hammock area). It was great to wake up and be among the trees in the morning & there was plenty of privacy. We would highly recommend this to friends & would definity go back to stay there again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect location and cozy stay! We will definitely be back.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Would stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and peaceful setting but still close to parks, restaurants and shopping for your weekend trip to Greenville. Kaye was a wonderful host and communicator throughout our stay. Was given clear checkin and checkout instructions. Enjoyed our welcome basket of snacks, water and sweets upon arrival. The treehouse was unique and tranquil with so many added features. Loved our time on the inside hammock between floors, the screened porch with comfy furnishings, and amazing indoor/outdoor shower. We even ventured up the stairs to the top deck for views which should not be missed. Definitely recommend Kaye‚Äôs place for your next trip to the Greenville area. It will not disappoint."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The treehouse was amazing very clean and privacy. We had a great time and will be back.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse is so unique, has all the modern amenities and beautiful design. Sleeping in the treetops is such a great experience. The view!
We loved Greenville. The food was great and we hiked, biked and played disc golf. There‚Äôs lots to do.
Coming home to the treehouse was always a huge plus and so relaxing. We loved it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Cozy Tree House was even more spectacular than we anticipated! I could live there !
We got a lot of use out of the screened in back porch. The outdoor heater made the porch even more cozy as the nights that we used it ,the air was quite chilly.
We also loved the huge walk in shower in the master bedroom and the adjacent outdoor shower.
The welcome basket and fresh flowers were a nice surprise !
We were there for a girls trip for the "" Fall for Greenville "" festival.
We also checked out Unity park , some breweries , wineries and great restaurants.
I hope to return for another girls trip in the spring."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in this adorable home. I will be honest and say we were a little concerned when we were approaching the driveway, but as we turned in we were pleasantly surprised with how private the location was. This home is absolutely adorable inside and out. The side screened in porch was one of our favorite parts. We loved the house so much that we decided to get take out and stay in the second night so we could enjoy the space. There really isn't one detail that was missed! Kaye left us snacks and worked with us on check in time. The decor is so cute and we had everything we needed for a fun weekend stay in Greenville. We will definitely be back."

I had one of the best nights of sleep there :).

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cool place! You feel like you are secluded in nature and at the same time, you are minutes away from restaurants and things to do around Greenville! We took a short trip up to Paris Mountain for some hiking and made visits to great restaurants and to downtown Greenville! When the weather turned rainy, we enjoyed our time watching movies from the provided streaming services.
Our host knew we had made this reservation for an anniversary gift to ourselves and even provided us with a thoughtful treat with a nice message for us. Overall, we had an excellent stay!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED our stay at the Cozy Treehouse. We booked our honeymoon stay in Greenville based on this Airbnb alone, and it was the perfect place to wind down and enjoy each other‚Äôs company in a peaceful environment surrounded by trees and nature.
The house itself was by far the most clean, homey, and well decorated Airbnb we‚Äôve stayed at. We enjoyed the incredible showers, large windows, outdoor decks, and the cozy screened in porch‚Äì it was the perfect spot for lounging or having a movie night! Although the treehouse is tucked away and feels very private, it‚Äôs still super close to downtown which is very convenient. The only minor inconvenience to staying here is not having an oven or stove, but we planned out meals ahead of time and also went out to eat.
During our stay, Kaye was super accommodating and responded quickly to any questions we had. Overall, we would HIGHLY recommend staying at the Cozy Treehouse for a unique and serene getaway! All of our friends and family members are dying to visit after seeing our photos, and we hope to come back again in the future!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was awesome! A great place will return
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at The Cozy Treehouse! This is a very unique property with stunning decor and really cool touches like the cargo net hammock that hangs over the living room from upstairs and the outdoor shower. The huge windows and multiple porches made us feel like we were sleeping in the treetops surrounded by green leaves, but it‚Äôs really convenient to downtown (a quick 10 min drive). The screened in porch was also a favorite hang out spot. Just make sure you plan ahead with meals since there is no oven or stove or plan to eat out. They have an outdoor fire pit (which we could have used for hot dogs and s‚Äômores) but it was pouring the first night and too hot the next. This would be super fun in the fall with all the leaves changing! We highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute dream!! Every detail was perfect and quite the jackpot for a girls weekend away! We had the best time and can‚Äôt wait to go back! Kaye is an awesome hostess! Don‚Äôt miss this one, but also keep this hidden gem tucked away for you time and time again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cozy treehouse was hands-down the most incredible stay I‚Äôve had. You are truly in the trees. The design is impeccable and there are so many well-thought out touches. It‚Äôs a warm and welcoming space with plenty of nooks for hanging out. Kaye was flexible and easily contactable. Book this stay and you will not be disappointed!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. Very secluded yet still super close to downtown Greenville. The interior design is 5 stars and it was a very comfy place to lounge around. Would definitely stay again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay here. It‚Äôs a unique place, very relaxing, clean, and calm. It feels very secluded, like you‚Äôre a million miles away from everything, but you‚Äôre very close to town. Easy to get to restaurants and things to do. Kaye was very quick with communication. Zero complaints, would stay again in a heartbeat!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED our stay at the treehouse. It was very spacious, clean, serene, and private. Everything about it was thoughtfully designed and there were so many unique elements and wonderful touches throughout.
We loved waking up to gorgeous views of the trees outside and feeling like we were immersed in the woods. The screened porch was the perfect place to enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning or a relaxing dinner ""outdoors"". For those working remotely, the WiFi was fast and reliable. The location was convenient to many things as well. Highly recommend staying here if you're visiting Greenville!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cozy treehouse is AMAZING! It was very accessible to downtown Greenville in a private, quiet area of town! Would highly recommend staying there and will be back again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough about this gorgeous, peaceful space! We had only been there a few minutes when we started planning our next trip there. It was cozy, comfortable, had lovely amenities - I'd return for the outdoor shower alone. Very close to everything in Greenville but we felt like we were in the middle of nowhere. Our group all agreed it was our favorite Airbnb we'd ever stayed in."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place that is perfect for a getaway tucked away only 10 minutes from Downtown Greenville. The place is done very nicely and well thought out. Kaye was great at communicating and had everything we could have needed. My wife is already planning her next trip back, would definitely recommend."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the Cozy Treehouse! It‚Äôs a beautiful home that feels secluded in the woods, but is also so close to town at the same time. The house itself is beautifully designed and has so many fun features to enjoy. It was fresh and clean and had everything we needed for our stay. The hosts are amazingly hospitable and great to communicate with. You will not regret booking this treehouse!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time at the Cozy Treehouse. We spent much more time on the screened in porch this time around; the ceiling fans kept it nice and cool, and we didn‚Äôt worry about bugs. Although it was hot outside, the treehouse stayed nice and cool thanks to the shady trees and the AC units! Can‚Äôt wait to come back again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is well maintained, beautiful and though fully organized. Loved the outdoor shower and the hosts were extremely helpful and responsive. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best long weekend at the Cozy Treehouse. The design is perfect, the bed is comfortable, the location is convenient, and Kaye was so helpful and communicative! Highly recommend this truly special and unique place!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This treehouse was a dream. From the treats on the counter when we arrived, to the ceiling fans on the screened in porch, to the extra toiletries provided, Kaye and Ben thought of every little detail to make our stay comfortable, enjoyable and unique. The treehouse itself had some of neatest features, but the hammock on the second floor had to be our favorite. The decor, ambiance and natural lighting made you feel like you were lost in the mountains, but in reality you're just 10 minutes from everything in Downtown Greenville. We didn't spend much time on the top balcony, at the fire pit, or on the back porch, simply because we went in May amongst an abundance of mosquitos and spiders. There was some work being done on the property (tree cutting), but Kaye and Ben were extremely communicative and apologetic that it coincided with our stay. Overall, highly recommend the Cozy Treehouse for a one-of-a-kind trip!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a gem! The tree house is a luxurious, unique stay close to downtown Greenville, yet private with all the beautiful surrounding trees. Host communication was great, and we felt safe and welcomed on their property. We loved our relaxing stay and look forward to enjoying it again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed here with a few friends and we had a wonderful time at the treehouse. The view and the details within the home were amazing. We enjoyed getting to hang out in the hammock and shower in the outdoor shower! There were so many places to enjoy the beautiful surroundings and we enjoyed all of them. The cleaning instructions at the end of our stay were very reasonable and easy to accomplish. I would recommend this place to anyone! We started discussing another trip to the treehouse about 30 minutes after we arrived.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unique, clean, safe and private with a bit of heaven sprinkled in. Top notch amenities, just about anything you need while on vacation. Every room offers a different atmospheric perspective. Outdoor shower, inside hammock, fire pit, stream and birdsong adds even more spirit to premises. Kaye and Bens extra careful attention to detail for their guests needs is especially noticeable. Only a 10 minute drive to downtown Greenville with a variety of things to do. No need to look any further. Book it. You won‚Äôt be disappointed."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse is absolutely perfect. I can‚Äôt say enough wonderful things about it. The hosts were communicative. The screened-in patio with the TV, sofa, and table was a highlight. The space made my time there so enjoyable. I would definitely return and highly recommend a stay there!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our stay in the cozy modern treehouse! Minutes away from all the downtown amenities, yet far away from the hustle and bustle of city life. We loved lounging on the screened-in porch as well as on the indoor hammock suspended from the second floor!! (I think our next home will have one!) Everything was finished with incredible craftsmanship and quality. Such a peaceful environment. It was a perfect, quiet setting for our family of four! Even our teenage boys enjoyed the space and slept well in the bunkbeds.
Our hosts, Kaye and Ben, were so accomodating. We celebrated a milestone birthday and Kaye was willing to pick up pre-ordered balloons and special treats from 2 Chefs as a special surprise for the birthday girl. And, they were super quick to respond to any questions we had during our stay. No wonder this space is AMAZING. It was built by AMAZING humans.
Thank you! We will return during our next visit to Greenville!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The most creative, unique, cozy stay you‚Äôll find in Greenville! I‚Äôve never felt more comfortable and at-home in an Airbnb. Such an impressive mix of nature & city. Wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer‚Ä¶."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tree house was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL!!! There isn't a bad thing I can say about our stay other than leaving too early. Kaye was helpful, warm and inviting before, during and after our stay."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a unique, very special property! The spatial layout and interior design is remarkable - beautifully appointed, very comfortable - a perfect getaway for a writing/reading project or simply hanging out. There is a sense of remote-ness, but it is completely connected for media. Loved it!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend at the cozy treehouse. The build quality, design, and amenities of the treehouse were top-notch, and it was perfectly suited for a couple‚Äôs getaway. The proximity to downtown Greenville was great‚Äîwe were still able to eat at our favorite places in the city, and retreat to our treehouse in the woods within minutes.
Do be aware that while the outside surroundings are beautiful and serene, there are neighbors close by, so you will be able to hear the occasional sounds of people, kids, dogs, and lawnmowers. You can also hear the train and sounds of traffic with the city being so close. However, if you‚Äôre inside with all the windows/doors closed it‚Äôs very quiet.
This is by far our favorite AirBnb we‚Äôve stayed in, and we‚Äôve already booked it for our anniversary!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is magnificent, highly recommend. The whole treehouse is VERY well built and tastefully designed. It‚Äôs super clear that the hosts are doing everything they can to go way above and beyond. You won‚Äôt regret booking"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tree house was the perfect getaway for a girls weekend in Greenville! It is so cozy and relaxing. We had dinner reservations for one night during our stay and opted to order delivery instead so that we could stay in and enjoy the house. The wall of windows makes you feel like you‚Äôre up in the trees, away from the busy world around you. We can‚Äôt wait to come back when it‚Äôs warmer outside and make use of the outdoor spaces more! Thank you for having us!! We will be telling all our friends about this amazing little spot."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one of the best Airbnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever stayed in. The treehouse is secluded and you do really feel as if you are up in the trees. All the appliances and technology is brand new. The house is incredibly clean and well maintained. I absolutely loved the screened in porch with the outdoor tv and heater. I also loved the outdoor shower! I would recommend this stay to anyone staying in the area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and clean apartment. Really the only thing that could of been better is the living room furniture. Other than that we had a great time in the city.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Would stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great location.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Ideal location for downtown area. Easily accessible and walkable to surround sites and entertainment.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In town for a wedding - Mint House was the perfect location. Great spot for all of the fun things going on....Arts Festival, Farmers Market, dining, etc.
Super easy check-in process!
Parking was easily accessible in the parking deck beside Hampton Inn.
Apartment was very clean and well-appointed.
Highly recommend Mint House!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place was just as described. It was a large apartment with high ceilings and plenty of closet space. It was nice having a full kitchen and a washer and dryer. Walkable to all the shops and restaurants downtown. We would definitely stay here again.
2024-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"Location was perfect walking distance to everything. Check in process was a challenge. AirBnB said we could check in early (1 vs 3) but the Mint House people had no record of that. Blamed it on AirBnB said they don‚Äôt communicate well. When I showed them the text they still said no. They did text me at 3:45 saying they were happy to inform me I could get in early. Check in time was 3pm we were already sitting in the apartment.
They gave us unit 4C which was literally in the elevator lobby so you could hear everyone come and go. There were only shades on the windows so sun came in pretty easily in the morning.
Overall for what we paid I would not stay there again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location for any events at Bon Secours- walkable or plenty of ride share options.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean and matched the description of the listing. While we never received a response on the parking situation, a kind lady informed us that when you‚Äôre staying at river walk Monday-Friday you can go the 7th floor of the neighboring office building and get a pass for $5 per day"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Very nice place! Well worth renting!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Easy to find, great location. The place was extremely clean and comfortable. They provided shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and even lotion (which all smelled amazing!) It was quiet, we didn‚Äôt hear any orange theory classes going on and there weren‚Äôt any rowdy neighbors."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Check in was very easy. The location was fantastic and you can walk to anything you want. The place was also spacious for an apartment. Would definitely stay here again!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful, clean place to stay for our relatives wedding weekend!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good stay
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, very spacious and clean. The owners even delivered on our request to get early check in. Enjoyed our time there. Would come back again!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great stay. Would return anytime.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome place to stay for a weekend getaway. Just one note that parking isn‚Äôt included (you just have to pay $10 per day to park in a lot in front of the building), but really not a big deal. Would happily stay here again"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved everything about this place. Once me and the kids figured out Main Street, we really appreciated how close we were to everything. Didn‚Äôt have to get in the car at all. The rooms were more than spacious, super clean, plenty of towels, the beds were very comfortable.
I read reviews about the noise from the Orangetheory downstairs but we didn‚Äôt hear it at all. The apartment had eye masks and ear plugs in cute decorative pouches just in case. The eye masks did come in handy because there are not black out curtains so it gets really bright in there in the morning!
Keurig machine with coffee options (including sweeteners) were there waiting for us in the very well stocked kitchen .
Thank you for an amazing stay at an affordable price for this single mama with two teenage boys who were also very impressed (and that‚Äôs hard to do)!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely rent from them again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed at the Mint House several times and it never disappoints. Perfect location, short walk to all the downtown attractions including great restaurants. We will be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"A clean, spacious apartment, very close to many restaurants and beautiful outdoor walks. The instructions to get in were easy."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay was great! It's only a three minute walk from the Falls Park. The city center was also in a walking distance. The room was in perfect shape with everything necessary for the stay. I'd love to stay at the place again!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Love the concept‚Ä¶.this is a cross between and apartment complex and a hotel. The location is awesome‚Ä¶.right at Falls Park.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, walking distance to everything. This place is fantastic and I highly recommend it. Cleanest place I‚Äôve stayed at in a long time."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything about the Mint House was great! The parking at the beginning was a little tough because the garage was full and had to figure out where the lot was. But once we figured that out it was great. A Mint House employee came out and helped us with our luggage and the apartment was spacious, comfortable, and clean. Perfect for our needs!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,nice
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,Great value for money! The concierge staff was brilliant and helped with check-in. We had an issue with the WiFi which was solved easily and completely after a couple of calls and conversations. The place was very clean and was just as expected from the description. Didn‚Äôt find the temp control/thermostat if there is one and that would have better. Fantabulous location and easy to get around downtown Greenville from the Mint House location.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. 3 bedroom apartment was a nice alternative to a hotel.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great view! Great location for walking into Greenville proper!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our stay! Great location and walkable to many places. Parking was a bit confusing but ended up using Embassy Suites parking garage. The walls are very thin! We were there for work and the 2nd night we were in town, there was a Stevie Nicks concert. We had some noisy neighbors for several nights. Other than that, it was a delightful stay!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"For one night I his place was great for our group to stay together and all have their own beds. This was definitely not a privately owned air bnb and was run much more like a business/hotel, meaning there were not the thoughtful extras that you get when you are truly in someone‚Äôs space."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,This was the perfect place for a group of ladies to stay while visiting Greenville. The building is very secure with a code required for building entry as well as for the apartment. The location was convenient to the river walk and to the restaurants on Main St. We parked in the underground garage by the Hampton Inn and never needed to move the car.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Fantastic place and location.
I can‚Äôt wait to be back."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Mint House was great! It looked just like advertised, the area was beautiful and we enjoyed our stay. It was peaceful, quiet and relaxing. Our heat wasn‚Äôt working the night we moved in and Mint House was extremely responsive and helped us to remedy the issue while we were at work. By the time we made it home that evening after 10pm they had made arrangements for us to move to another unit and the apartment was already pre heated. Our transfer to another unit across the hall was seamless and we went to bed nice and cozy. They even responded to us that evening to make sure we were all set. Thank you Mint House for a lovely stay. I would definitely recommend to anyone and come back and stay again when visiting South Carolina."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Would stay again. Great location. Clean. Plenty of space.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay at Mint House. Great location in downtown Greenville. Parking can be a little challenging but there are lots available close by or street parking if you time it up right. Overall a wonderful stay in GVL.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here before, met all expectations but had some minor inconvenience this time with gaining access as I had not received the necessary access credentials. Sent message and called toll free support who made an effort to assist but ultimately it was onsite support (excellent), that was extremely helpful and provided all needed guidance etc. Mint House continues to be an excellent option for staying in the center of Greenville with walking access to endless options."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,GREAT location‚Ä¶great city‚Ä¶perfect stay. Loved trying the local restaurants.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Great place for three couples to stay without feeling crowded. Super clean. Very nice to have plenty of towels and paper products and even a washer and dryer. Way better than getting three hotel rooms! We walked everywhere and thoroughly enjoyed our stay and everything Greenville had to offer!
2023-11-01,4,Group trip,Great Place and Location. Met expectations. Suggestion: TV was very complicated and frustrating to deal with without any real instructions.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mint House is in a perfect location. Very walkable to everything downtown, especially the river. The apartment had everything we needed for a long weekend stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Good location and clean place
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Really nice and spacious place. Only issue was we were right above orangetheory and woken up at 5:30am by loud music for their classes. Luckily we found the earplugs and used them the rest of the time. The elevator was also broken most of the trip but we were on the second floor so not a huge problem until we needed to bring down our luggage.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"The location was fabulous. Our unit was a corner one and was clean, bright and large. We used our suite to get ready for a wedding so it was perfect. Our other unit was a also a three bedroom, but not as large and bright. It was conveniently located to everything in Greenville."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Couldn‚Äôt be happier! The apartment was exactly how it looked online and the building is a short walking distance from EVERYTHING in Greenville. 10/10 experience, would go back."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed here two years in a row for a conference. Great location - right near coffee and restaurants and the river walking path. The place itself is solid - nothing fancy and no character to speak of (very bland and utilitarian), but just what you need for a conference. Beds very comfortable.
We had a few issues with checkin which i think reflected confusion between Mint House and Airbnb, and also the lift was broken for a full morning at least (for a 5th floor flat) which made coming and going that day extremely awkward (lots of stairs). Fortunately it was fixed in time for us getting to the airport with loads of suitcases.
Overall i'd say a good place with a few issues which aren't insurmountable, but good to be aware of if you book."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Close to everything.
2023-10-01,4,Group trip,"Fantastic location! Spacious and very clean apartment! But the noise was bad: apartment above (singing at 2am) , pipe noise in laundry room heard by person sleeping on the pullout couch, and especially the 5am noise from Orange-theory heard from every room! The ear plugs provided didn‚Äôt help! So as long as you know what to expect, it‚Äôs a great place to stay! The location really was great!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Rare feature to have two king beds. Perfect location
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great property, great location, great price."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great location! close to great restaurants and all that downtown Greenville has to offer
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Location is perfect! Walk to most anywhere downtown with ease. It was clean and spacious and offered everything we needed.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great location. Restaurants and Main Street were very close. Host answered all questions fast and easy to understand.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great walkable location. Well-stocked coffee supplies. Very responsive
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good place
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This was our 3rd time staying at Mint House while attending Fall For Greenville. The location is so convenient, the building is safe and clean and has everything we need. We love this place and hope to stay again next year."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great location! Spacious rooms. They do tell you there is no parking so you have to pay at a nearby lot. We had 2 cars. One we put the space number in and the price was $25/day but it ended at midnight and we had to go back early in the morning to pay for another day. My daughter put in her license plate number and it let her choose $30 for 2 full days.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location! Extremely clean and comfortable! We will definitely be staying here again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2023-10-01,3,Stayed about a week,"Be aware that this company is extremely corporate. This unit is obviously not someone's home that you are staying in. I canceled my reservation and re-booked less than 24 hours later and that mistake cost me $500 because they were not willing to honor the original price that I secured. There is about an inch of open space under all of the interior doors, making it easy to hear everything, and the place was echoey so it made it hard for people with hearing aids."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,very clean and open apartment right in the heart of Greenville. Comfy beds and clean linens and towels. The washer and dryer was a nice touch. Didn't use the kitchen but nice enough. Great weekend stay.
2023-10-01,4,Group trip,"Great location, very walkable to restaurants, shopping, and outdoor activities! Perfect size to accommodate our party of 5 for a girls‚Äô weekend. Clean with needed amenities; other than one hand soap dispenser, everything worked great. Property management was a little slow to respond to a beeping carbon monoxide detector on our first day (had to call twice when it wasn‚Äôt addressed after about 2 hours), but otherwise communication was great with very clear instructions. Very safe with key card entry. Would definitely stay here again with friends or family."
2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Fine interior but not as shown in photos. I wish the apartment was sunny inside as shown in photos.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mint house was a perfect place to stay while visiting Greenville. Great location with fabulous restaurants within walking distance.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a wonderful time. Really appreciated the help from the Mint House Staff, including providing a crib for our baby. Would recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful. Great location for everything we needed. Well appointed and even had my favorite brand of coffee, Peet‚Äôs!
We were close to the Prisma Hospital, which was the reason we were in Greenville, and it could not have been better located. We felt safe walking in the community. Took advantage of the large farmer‚Äôs market, along with the great restaurants, all were within walking distance. We will be back again."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"The location is amazing, right in the middle of downtown Greenville, next to the waterfall and a park. Very much walkable, great restaurants, it felt like Europe. The host is very responsive and easy to deal with. Apartment is clean and has great views of downtown. We enjoyed our stay very much, highly recommended."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our stay at the mint house was perfect! It was the absolute best location, walkable to all we had to do, it was much cheaper than a hotel and truly felt like our home for the week! We will only ever stay here any other time in Greenville!"
2023-10-01,4,Group trip,"Very clean, exactly as described, fantastic location, comfortable beds.
Limited kitchen items and off site parking are minor cons.
Perfect for family stays.
All said we would certainly stay here again."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,The house was very nice and so was the area. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was no tvs in the rooms but overall the house was very pleasing to our liking.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Loved! Would definitely stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This place is amazing, it was very clean and spacious. All of our needs were accommodated beyond our expectations and it is located in the most beautiful part of the city. I highly recommend staying here."
2023-09-01,4,Group trip,"Great location, nice and clean place space."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! We loved the coffee and tea station.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location so close to the river and the heart of the city. Loved how close the Reedy River Falls Park was. Apartment was clean and looked as expected. Building is quiet. No parking on-site. Parking off-site is inconvenient and $ adds up.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, clean, spacious and comfortable apartment.
Thank you"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay. Lots of room and great location.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Spotless apartment in a super location! We could walk to downtown right along the river. Great stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This unit is located in a building that appeared to be all rental units. The location is spot on, we could walk just across the street and down a set of stairs to the river. Two lefts leads you to downtown and all the shopping and eating you want to do. on the way to downtown try Bubble Tea (that tiger sugar boba tea was amazing!)
The rooms and layout were exactly as described, but the pictures of the furniture are not accurate. The headboards, sofa, rugs, chairs, trees/greenery are all different then pictured.
The bedding was amazing, very soft and clean (mattresses were wrapped in plastic covers [didn't make any noise though]) Each bed had at least six pillows on it.
Kitchen had wine glasses, regular glasses, plates, pans, pots, and utensils.
Elevator was very efficient and there was a luggage cart in the lobby area.
I would stay there again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay at Mint house. It was a very convenient location . Central location to shopping and restaurants within walking distance.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,The place was exactly as described and in the perfect location to walk everywhere in downtown Greenville. The parking is a little wonky but once you find the parking garage it's easy peazy. Turns out it's really not that far from the front door of the building and the per day rate was very reasonable. It's actually the Embassy Suites hotel parking garage and you can pretty much see it from the condo so it's really not a far walk at all. The hosts were very quick to answer all of our questions. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful condo in downtown Greenville! Ideal location for restaurants, shopping, biking and walking. Loved our stay and hope to return."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay at Mint House. Location perfect! Walking distance to almost everything - some great restaurants and activities nearby. Host was very responsive and flexible. I would definitely recommend Mint House.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at the Mint House a couple times in the past and this unit did not disappoint. Very clean and roomy with a nice little balcony in the main room. Perfect location. Everything in downtown Greenville is a quick walk away. Perfect if you want to visit downtown Greenville.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and awesome location!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location and you cannot beat the rate for a three bedroom two bath! We parked our car in a nearby garage and didn't have to touch it until we left three days later. This location is perfect and very walkable.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful condo in walking distance to everything in downtown Greenville. You really do not need to drive anywhere. Loved the entire trip!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Walked to everything.
A bit hard to find parking areas."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,This was the perfect place for 3 couples to stay and explore Greenville. Excellent location! The coffee station was a nice touch.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Had a lovely stay. Really enjoyed it
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Great restaurant right below the room. Clean and comfy. Parked in the garage down the road. 1 bad thing: ran out of toilet paper sadly. Right after crushing pounds of hibachi and sushi. Definitely needed another roll or 2.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location for visiting Greenville, everything is in walking distance and the quick access to the park is nice. The apartment had a lot of room. The furniture was different than the picture but it was fine. The pictures are accurate. I was a little surprised about the build quality of the apartment for such a new building but the pictures reflect this. The place could use some better design elements but not really important for our stay. The coffee supplies are a nice touch.
PARKING TIP: Parking in front of the building is not allowed. there is a big underground lot across the street. To enter, drive across to the Hampton Inn front door and pass the valet stand. Immediately to your right is a down ramp into the parking garage. It is easy to miss. You can use Parkmobile to pay (or credit card) and it is not very expensive. It would be helpful if the Mint House team would include this in their welcome email since the entrance to the paring garage is not easy to find."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Good spot in the middle of the action for sure but also quiet.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location next to Embassy Suites, very clean. We enjoyed our stay and was perfect for our group of 4. Pictures accurately describe the condo."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Everything you`ll need is there.
If you need additional things during your stay, the person at the lobby would bring it to your room within 10minutes.
Very nice stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Mint House was a great spot for an elongated stay. The venue is close to Falls Park where we walked each morning and close to restaurants where we dined at night. Nice facilities. Clean. Safe.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great weekend away!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"To find a 3 BR with full kitchen, washer/dryer, that functions like a hotel in the heart of Greenville at a reasonable price, this was a win! Definitely would recommend and stay again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,An absolutely phenomenal location to stay and access everything Greenville has to offer!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved everything about it except the parking situation. Had to park across the street and around the corner and had to go back every day and pay. So it was usually $16 a day to park. Would be nice if we were allowed to park on-site.
The place is very comfortable, we all loved the beds. It was extremely quiet and we hardly saw anyone else on the way to our three bedroom condo.
Easy to walk to shopping and restaurants, The Peace Center, etc. Fabulous location."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,great stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great location to be. Everything was walking distance, and it had enough space for all my birthday guests! We have a really good time, and knew we were coming back to a safe location."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect location. Clean and comfortable.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mint House had the perfect space and amenities while being at the heart of downtown. Just make sure you have a plan for parking. Would definitely recommend and stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 2nd stay at a Mint House apartment. It was very clean and the apartment was as expected. The location is great for access to downtown Greenville. We parked the car when we arrived and didn‚Äôt use it again until we left! I will definitely stay there again on my next trip to Greenville.
Our only complaint was access to the fitness center. In our arrival instructions it said ‚Äú24 hour fitness center‚Äù that was open from 10-5, but if you wanted to access it outside that time to let the management know and they would make arrangements. I emailed the day before our arrival to ask about getting access outside that window (10 seems very late to me as I am a morning exerciser) and never received a response. Then I asked when we arrived at the property and was told that the keypad entry was broken (and he made it sound like it had been for awhile) and there was no way for us to get in until someone from the management company arrived, generally between 9-10 am."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here with our two kids and it was perfect! We walked everywhere and definitely could have stayed longer than the five days!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was the first time we stayed at Mint House. It was also our first time staying in the West End of Greenville. The location is ideal! Falls Park was only a few blocks away and we were able to walk every morning. There were many restaurants within walking distance, the parking garage was right around the corner, and the apartment was clean and quiet. We couldn‚Äôt ask for a better place to stay. We can‚Äôt wait to return!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the location. So close to everything downtown. The employees were very accommodating. The only issue we had was the parking area. If I go back again I will park at another location as suggested by The Mint House.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Second time at Mint House Greenville and wonderful for larger family stays!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying at the Mint House. The location was perfect! We enjoyed being able to use the gym there as well. We had a great time.
2023-06-01,3,Group trip,"Was convenient to downtown for our sons wedding. Very clean and bedding in all rooms were very comfortable! And nice towels and linens. Unfortunately kitchen was lacking several basics (sheet pan, measuring cup, etc). One set of blinds in master bedroom was pulled up and we couldn‚Äôt get it down so room was very lit all night. Overall stay was good especially for convenience."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love this location! It is easy to walk anywhere you'd like. There are plenty of restaurants close by and the river is just across the street. The apartment itself is very comfortable and secure.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful neighborhood. It was exactly as advertised.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my stay. Great location
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay. Our apartment was great. Very well decorated and clean. It‚Äôs located in a excellent location, close to everything. You don‚Äôt need a car. You can walk to everything in Downtown Greenville! Would highly recommend it and would definitely stay again!"

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great location and great price for three bedrooms. Also very clean and comfortable. We would definitely stay there again.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great downtown spot in Greenville. Literally you can drop your bags and walk everywhere‚Ä¶restaurants, parks, shopping. It was great."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is our third time staying at the Mint House Greenville. The location is central to everything. Incredibly responsive team.
2023-05-01,4,Group trip,"We had a noise problem from the unit above the first night which caused issues but the 2nd And 3rd night were okay. Great location, great communication. Looked like the pictures!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Best part of this place is the location. It‚Äôs clean and pretty minimal inside. I would say for the price, it had what we needed but wasn‚Äôt very cozy for a long weekend stay. It would be nice to add curtains to the windows and more furniture in the living space."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We fully enjoyed our stay and felt right at home! The apartment was clean, well stocked, and in a perfect location for our needs. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Enjoyed having support on site for guidance

2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great location.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved this home and it was the perfect size for our family. We unexpectedly had to leave early and the host was accommodating and helpful!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Literally a two minute walk to the west end of Main Street. Essentially, everything in downtown is in easy walking distance. 5 minute drive to the highway. Offsite parking isn‚Äôt a hassle and we never had a problem finding a space either in the paid lot across the street or in the garage attached to the Embassy Suites - both a very easy walk."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We would definitely choose Mint House again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here for a business trip to Greenville. The apartment was as-described and was well-equipped. Check in instructions were clear. The place was clean and the hosts were responsive and friendly. We‚Äôd definitely choose this place again!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Mint house is in a great location - convenient to downtown Greenville, the park and the West End. The apartment was spacious, with very high ceilings. Parking was a bit confusing. There is an underground parking garage across the street that is shared by the Hampton and Embassy suites. I recommend pulling into the circle by the mint house door and unloading before parking. There was a door man in the lobby when we arrived that was very helpful. Once you park you really don‚Äôt need to use the car again. Everywhere we went was within walking distance. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Clean apartment in excellent location. Will definitely be back.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Jorgan, the manager, actually met up with us, brought us up to the apartment and made sure we had everything we needed! The apartment was nicely stocked. We felt extremely comfortable. It was perfect for my adult family and the location was PERFECT!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We had a better stay in the heart of Greenville! Would absolutely stay here, again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Excellent location. Roomy spaces with everything you need.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect location to walk to everything!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice clean condo near downtown. If you like a hotel room (s) with a kitchen, this place is for you. There were 5 adults and the space felt a little tight for us. Fine for a family or maybe 2 couples."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed here a couple times, great location and great place to stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay! Very clean and responsive. The only trouble we really had was finding a place to park
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The apartment was centrally located to fabulous restaurants and shopping. Very clean and easy to access.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great weekend in Greenville. Came in with extended family nearby. Excellent location, walkable, great restaurants, nearby river walk, park, and great children‚Äôs museum."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved Mint House! My family of 4 (2 toddlers) was very comfortable, and we're looking forward to staying here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing location and really convenient to do lots of fun things in the city!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,The Mint House was probably the cleanest Airbnb we‚Äôve ever stayed in. We had 5 of us in town for a wedding and all 5 of us were very impressed. And the bed was super comfortable. Fabulous location too. 5 stars!
2023-04-01,4,Group trip,Overall a GREAT place to stay in Greenville! Walking distance to everything. Very comfortable and spacious. Clean! The only downfall is the water sounds every time someone above you uses water. It was quite loud and disturbing while trying to sleep. We will stay again as we love visiting this area.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay! And super clean and convenient.
No parking though, which was slightly tricky."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at the Mint House. Very clean, the beds were incredibly comfortable, and the location was perfect."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great location! We would definitely stay here again!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"The apartment did not have a lot of extras, but it had everything we needed and was super-clean. Great location. We didn‚Äôt have to get in our cars once during our entire stay. Do yourself a favor and park at the Embassy Suites across the street for $7/day. I would absolutely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,This was our second stay here and I will go back. Excellent location and perfect size for 5 of us.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great area, great place!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting the area for the weekend and two out of our four days it poured rain. We were thrilled to have this extra roomy space and felt at home. The kitchen had everything you need to make a meal but the place is just a block away from an array of restaurants (and shopping). The space was clean and roomy. We had overlooked the note from the host that there was quiet time at 9pm on and the room had a sound decibel machine inside. Despite our concerns after reading this, we did not have any issues and did not hear any other guests in the building. We actually rarely saw anyone. The only down side, if it is one, is there is not onsite parking. This wasn't a problem as there is a parking garage across the street and the majority of our trip we walked to where we needed to go. The convenient location, spacious place, and accommodations were great! I'd definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great Location! No Parking, but a lot around corner only charges like $7 for 24hr! It‚Äôs under the building with Ruth‚Äôs Chris I believe. Overall a great stay and a cool town!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was great! Everything as advertised! 10/10 would definitely book again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for downtown Greenville stay. Walkable to everything, clean, & safe."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice location.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Ideal place to stay in Greenville‚Äîideal location right in the center of town and a nice place.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent location. Close to most popular things to do in the city. Would stay here again
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Young gentleman met us at the door and helped us with the process to enter the building. Building smelled extremely clean.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great location near Main St.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay if you are in the Greenville area with a group. The place was comfortable, clean, and had all the amenities we needed."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here during the NCAA sweet sixteen and elite eight and were able to walk to the stadium and all the restaurants. Parking was affordable at nearby parking garage.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Great spot great place.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing Stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome location in the heart of downtown Greenville. Parked our car and walked everywhere for the entire stay. The apartment was very nice and in a safe, quiet, building."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect location for walking around downtown GVL, great quality and cleanliness, and good price. Mint customer service was excellent. Only minor issue was that neither of the 2 addresses noted for parking were available when we arrived, but we quickly realized there is another entrance to the same parking deck around the corner that we could access at the entrance to the Embassy Suites (the listed one was closed off) and was a very reasonable price ($7 max per day)."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Lovely host, will stay again!!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely wonderful location! Great view from small balcony. Located on 3rd floor. Ended up parking in lot next door, not very expensive and so convenient. The place is stocked with everything you need for a longer stay. Very quiet and it was St. Patrick's Day weekend. Highly recommended."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Great location! Easy walk to Main St.and Falls Park. The condo was clean and had plenty of room for the 6 of us. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Great location. Walkable to restaurants and bars. Clear instructions for check in and check out.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location and a perfect alternative to spending a ton of money on multiple hotel rooms downtown. Only issue was it‚Äôs a little hard to find the entrance and no free parking. We were able to find parking for $15/day, which was not too bad! Beautiful on the inside and beds were super comfortable."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location ! It was a spacious and comfortable apartment. Very quiet inside but a lot to do nearby.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Mint House Greenville West End was the perfect location for a weekend getaway. Very clean and spacious and within walking distance to plenty of great restaurants, shops, and the park."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and great location!!
2023-03-01,4,Group trip,"The Mint House apartment we stayed in was clean, spacious and the beds bathrooms were really nice! It was in a great location, close to downtown and the river, and had a nice kitchen and washer and dryer too! We only stayed for one night so it was perfect for what we needed. I saw comments about it being bright, and these were definitely true. It wasn‚Äôt just bright in the morning but also bright at night. There are huge windows with thin blinds and the street lights and big blue light from the front entrance all shine in. That being said, they do at least provide 2 little eye covers to wear while you sleep if you like to use those. My only other improvement I‚Äôd make is more living room seating. The beds would sleep 6 comfortably but you could really only seat 3-4 on the small couch and chair in the living room. Overall it was a great stay for what we needed!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for what we needed. Will use again in the future.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Great location close to everything! The place was clean and safe. There's no here. We parked about a 2 minute walk away at the Embassy Suites, $7 for 24 hours."
2023-03-01,4,Group trip,It was very clean and spacious. We enjoyed our stay and loved that we could walk anywhere.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Beautiful place in a great location for the price!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at John‚Äôs condo! The space was exactly as described and the location was incredibly convenient. John was very responsive and friendly. Definitely recommend this gem!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really loved the location - close to bars, restaurants and touristy things! Loved Greenville - our first (of many) trips! Loved checking it out! We did hear the restaurant downstairs but it quieted down by 10pm! Really loved walking to everything. Once we got there we parked and left the car - so easy! Would definitely stay here again. Loved the high ceilings, cool, modern place and great kitchen and bedrooms! Very funky, cool spot!!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This spot was amazing- even better than I expected! The location was unbeatable - just walk out your door to tons of dining, shops, park, Peace Center, etc! Super spacious, clean and in great condition! 10/10 recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in the heart of downtown Greenville! The condo was lovely and just like it was pictured.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great location. It was everything we were hoping for. I can‚Äôt wait to come back to visit again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A premier location and beautiful downtown Greenville I would stay there again for the convenience they provides and directly over one of my favorite restaurants
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,John‚Äôs place was fantastic. It looked like the pictures and was very clean. It is along Main Street where the Reedy Falls are and lots of yummy restaurants. We had a great time and would stay there again!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Walkable to lots of fun places. On Main Street so may not be for early to bed light sleepers. But I felt that trade was worth it.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! John‚Äôs place was a perfect downtown Greenville apartment. Everything we did was walkable, from restaurants and shopping to the beautiful suspension bridge. The apartment was exceptionally decorated and it had everything we needed."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous unit. Amazing location. The description was accurate concerning the noise from downstairs. It did end around 11. It was really only an issue the first night because we were exhausted from an early travel day and wanted to turn in early. I‚Äôm a light sleeper and even with the noise machine it was loud.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,John‚Äôs place was exactly as described and as the pictures showed. It‚Äôs a fabulous location within walking distance to many great restaurants and shops. A perfect place to stay right in the downtown area amongst all the action!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host- Great location
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at John's place in Greenville! The apartment is enormous and is even better than the pictures. Johns is super attentive and answers any/all questions and problems within moments. We can't wait to go back and will absolutely return to John's Greenville apartments!
As John has mentioned, the apartment is above a vibrant restaurant. If noise is a concern at night I would avoid Apartment #1...especially on Friday and Saturday nights due to the late night bar crowd. Apartment #3 & #4 are further away from the street and the restaurant, and would be quieter."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place with great downtown location. Walk to restaurants and parks. Will definitely stay here again when visiting Greenville.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great apartment, well appointed with excellent facilities and plenty of space. The entry & exit was easy as was the car parking.
Our only issue was that we were in apartment 1 which gets a LOT of noise from the bar below. At the weekend this made the front bedroom (as shown in the main photo) unusable until the bar closed. The bar music was also loud in the lounge area.
We‚Äôd happily stay again but only if we could book one of the other apartments in the block."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This may be one of my favorite AirBNB's I've ever stayed in. The keyless entry to the modern aesthetic. This property made for a relaxing weekend of calling Greenville home! John was super responsive and everything was as described. It would be a pleasure to stay at this property again when returning to Greenville!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Lots of space! Lots to do within walking distance and great restaurants nearby! Everything was clean, and the space was great to spend our time there!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great rental !! Not sure which was the best - the great location or the well-appointed accommodation. Hope to stay there again in the future.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, location was excellent and near most of the downtown."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and beautiful place
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place looks better in person than in the pictures. Top quality place and very comfortable. It has everything we needed and more.
The noise from the bar downstairs didn‚Äôt bother us a bit! We use white noise when we sleep so, no problem there.
I would definitely recommend this place.
Especially great for two couples traveling!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved this location. Beautiful rental with plenty of room for a family of four. We could even have friends over for dinner. We are a family of four and there is plenty to do for everyone. Great location and amenities. Already planning our next trip.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! Great location, walkable to many restaurants and shops and the main waterfall areas. Apartment was clean and modern, very comfortable stay had everything we needed. Only complaint is a bit of noise on Saturday night, but that comes with staying on a main street (and we appreciated the earplugs provided). We will be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Like 3rd time I stayed in this unit. Perfect fit.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love this one! The location couldn‚Äôt be better and the space itself was awesome. I was in #1 so we had views to main st and an abundance of natural light. The kitchen was well stocked so we made dinner in, even though you are right above a really good restaurant and plenty more just up the street. John is great too! Go ahead and book it! You won‚Äôt regret it"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. The place is beautiful and the location was excellent. We walked all over downtown Greenville with such easy access to our accommodations. We stayed in one night enjoying the great take out from Rick Erwin‚Äôs (right downstairs about 10 steps). Really appreciate having two bedrooms and two bathrooms. Great for a couples getaway. We would certainly come back! Thank you!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the Condo! Great location, nice accommodations! Beds are very comfortable"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location downtown and very large space.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Great location! Thank you!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was amazing! Just like the pictures but maybe even better! Perfect location and beautiful view! We loved our bartender Claire at Rick Erwin's, which is right below the condo, drinks and dinner at Coral next door, wine flights at Foxcroft Wine across the street, and wonderful morning coffee from the Flying Biscuit after a walk by the falls. That was just on our same block. Downtown Greenville is so lovely and everything is walkable from the condo. John was excited for us to visit Greenville and was a wonderful host. We will be back!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was beautiful!! The location was perfect to everything.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful loft within walking distance of everything in the Greenville Historic District. There is lots of excellent shopping, great restaurants and the Reedy River and falls within steps of the loft. Unit #1 is spacious and bright. The noise from the downstairs restaurant and bar is noticeable but typical of an urban location. Trust me, the location is worth it. John provides white noise machines and earplugs which worked great. John is also one of the most responsive Hosts I've ever encountered. I will definitely be back."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"John‚Äôs place exceeded our expectations! Super clean & spacious, incredible location. Wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer. John was lightning fast to communicate and answer all my questions."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is THE place to stay in Greenville! The apartment is beautiful and spacious and extremely comfortable. The location is ideal as it is right on Main Street and close to restaurants and shopping. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We wish we could have stayed longer!! My husband said, ""Wow I could live here!!!"" Not only is the place perfect but the town is just wonderful. We are already trying to figure out when we can make another trip!!! üòä
Barb and Denny"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible spot, best we‚Äôve had !!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place near all of downtown Greenville. Easily walkable to Peace Center, Falls Park, tons of bars and restaurants. The apartment itself is gorgeous and perfect for two couples with separate bathrooms. It was so clean and decorated beautifully. We will def come back when coming to Greenville."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time staying here. John is a great host! I come back each year and look forward to my visit. The location is absolutely perfect to enjoy Greenville.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A perfect spot - beautifully decorated and ideal location. The place was exactly as described and very clean. I‚Äôll be recommending to family and friends!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rented for Fall For Greenville, and it did not disappoint. Even with the festivities, we weren't disturbed at all. The place was gorgeous, and we'd definitely stay again, given the chance."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This beautifully decorated apartment is in the perfect location if you wish to explore downtown Greenville on foot. Many nice restaurants and shopping close by. It‚Äôs in the heart of the historic district with the water falls just a few steps away. Such a lively part of this amazing town. The apartment is spotless and comfortable. I would highly recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"5 stars all the way around! Stayed for one night, but it was a great location, very spacious, and completely clean. Would definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a great place to stay. Perfect location close to walking trail and plenty of eating options.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We were two couples who stayed at this classic urban condo during Euphoria Festival weekend. The location was excellent and easy walking distance to all the events.
The condo is stylishly furnished and inviting.
We gave a four star rating instead of five for the following reasons:
the restaurant and bar below had noise and music all three nights until midnight. We were aware of this issue through the listing write up and reviews for the property but were left with the impression that the noise ended at 10 pm. The owners do provide ear plugs and sound machine which helps but does not eliminate the sound transfer all together.
The king beds are comfortable but the bottom sheets need deeper pockets as they keep coming off and we ended up sleeping on the mattress protector.
We left a note for the cleaning people
with a small list of other things that we felt you needed to be aware of.
Overall we were impressed with the condition of the unit and would recommend it."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is beautiful and sits in a fantastic location. Everything that you need is provided. Our family that live in the area were very impressed.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Just absolutely perfect!!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was very clean and in a great location with lots of walkable places nearby.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"John‚Äôs place was a wonderful place for our family of four. It was very clean, super spacious, and in an amazing location. We walked everywhere and loved the ease it provided us. Also loved the nearby parking spot!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Our second time staying at one of these lofts and it was absolutely amazing! Best Airbnb we‚Äôve ever stayed in hands down.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Apartment 1 was the perfect location and beautifully appointed....but VERY noisy. This is just the nature of the apartment being situated directly over the restaurant bar. If you are a night owl and out past midnight you will be fine in this apartment. If you like to be asleep by 10, stay somewhere else... even the back of the building in apartment 4 would probably be fine.
Living room furniture needs to be steam cleaned. Everything thing else was perfect, roomy, well appointed kitchen, convenient to everything. We absolutely will be back but we will try a unit at the back of the building in hopes of something more private."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This condo on Main Street was phenomenal. The condo is located central to everything and there's a great breakfast spot right next door. John provided great instructions making check in and out super easy. The space is beautifully decorated and is the perfect size for 2 couples because of the large bedrooms, each with its own bathroom! We were all able to work comfortably for the days we were there. John was a great host and was especially responsive when we let him know the keurig wasn't working and had another delivered the next day. He even went so far as to buy us coffee for the days we didn't have a coffee maker. I definitely recommend and will be back myself!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic place.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is beautiful, and in a great location to all things happening in downtown Greenville. We would definitely stay again."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John‚Äôs place is gorgeous, his communication was awesome, and the location is perfect! The pictures in the listing are totally accurate.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My favorite part about this place is the location. It is so close to everything great in Greenville!! I have stayed here twice and feel so at home here. The pictures are absolutely accurate and the parking space is such a nice addition in downtown Greenville. Thank you for a spacious and convenient stay in the heart of Greenville!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Best Air BNB I have stayed in.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great place to stay! My husband, our kids and I all enjoyed staying here! Very nice space and amazing location right in downtown"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous condo in the heart of downtown Greenville, close to everything. The space is large, open and beautifully decorated.
As mentioned in the listing, it can get loud in the evenings due to the restaurant below, but the owner provided earplugs and a sound machine."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment. Awesome kitchen
Good location"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay on Main Street Greenville! Really enjoyed it, great vibes! John was great always in contact if needed!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 3 loved our stay here! It was very spacious, clean and comfortable. Having a bathroom attached to each bedroom was wonderful along with a half bathroom in the main area for any guests. It was easy to make ourselves at home here and cook a couple meals in the huge kitchen while also being right downtown with ample dining options. The parking space was great to have! The white noise machines drown out any noise from the restaurant / bar downstairs and it was no issue for us, plus they‚Äôre closed on Sunday and Monday. We will definitely be back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location. Very Clean. The restaurant below was unbearable to deal with. The music/talking started at 12 noon and went until 12am. Obnoxious people screaming and shouting. The bass shakes the entire unit above.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent place. Can‚Äôt recommend highly enough.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location and beautiful space. We will be back!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific location for exploring Greenville! This lovely apartment has an upscale but cozy loft feel and is conveniently walkable to everything - Falls Park, Swamp Rabbit Trail and more restaurants and bars than one could hope for. Reedy Rides for bike rental is highly recommended. Host was extremely helpful. Would absolutely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous and location is fantastic!!! John‚Äôs place is ideally located for all the fun activities and restaurants in downtown Greenville. We didn‚Äôt take our car out of the provided space at all while we were there. The kitchen had everything you could possibly want and the decor is so tastefully done and yet cozy at the same time. We can‚Äôt wait to return!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was SO beautifully decorated and furnished. The host did a great job with food and entertainment recommendations and the place is walkable to all of downtown Greenville, including the west side and Gather Greenville, a unique outdoor food hall. The view to outside from the common area window was awesome and with good natural light. Kitchen had a coffee Keurig coffee maker with pods and if you wanted to cook, you had everything you needed. Great for couple or small family. Bonus of extra half bathroom outside of the two bedrooms. Thankful we were in this location, as it was so convenient. Would definitely recommend to anyone seeing Greenville for the first time or returning. Across the street from a great speakeasy named Vault and Valor that I recommend. üòé"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing and so is the location!!! We were in town for a wedding and the reception ended up being directly across the street! Downtown Greenville is gorgeous, we walked everywhere all weekend! We were so impressed and cannot wait to come back when we can visit longer!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful apartment in an excellent location right near the Falls and steps from some great restaurants and shopping. The apartment has everything you need. John was very responsive and gave detailed instructions which made for an easy check in. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent location for the best access to everything Greenville has to offer. It‚Äôs a spacious condo with a lot of walkable activities, pristine, beautifully decorated, and the host is readily available to help at any time, a perfect Airbnb experience."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The condo was lovely. It was exactly like the pictures and in walking distance to all we wanted to enjoy in Greenville. We will definitely choose to stay here again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,A perfect spot for walking over to restaurants and the liberty bridge! Great for our family. Kids had a great time.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was absolutely gorgeous.. The location was awesome and very convenient for downtown attractions. I highly recommend.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great condo, bright, clean, close to everything yet very quiet! Bigger than pictures suggested. Perfect for two couples. Thanks!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was very spacious, cool, convenient and clean. Will definitely stay here again during our next trip to Greenville!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"GREAT airbnb, and I‚Äôve stayed in many here and abroad! Beautiful, spacious - couldn‚Äôt get over the space - tasteful and good quality furnishings/decor. Easy to get in and out of. Perfect location for walking to all sorts of activities in Greenville. If you are an orange theory enthusiast, it is practically right out the back door so I loved being able to get a workout in! Next time I come to town with my husband he‚Äôs going to want to stay at the new Grand Bohemian, but it‚Äôs going to be a fight because I would love to come back to this apartment (which is just a lovely walk from the GB to go enjoy the restaurant and bar). John was a very friendly and responsive host. Highly recommend! Would note that there is a busy and loud restaurant below, but there were white noise machines in the bedrooms so that even my light-sleeper travel companion was able to sleep through it."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! Unit was spacious and clean. Great location in downtown Greenville within walking distance to so many great restaurants, parks by the river, the swamp rabbit trail and much more. We'll definitely be returning soon. Thanks for accommodating a wonderful few days with our friends."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time in Greenville and our stay was wonderful. The location was perfect and the apartment was very spacious. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,3rd time. All perfect.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was perfect for us in every way! Loved it and will stay there again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place wish i could live there
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible weekend in unit #1. Came into town for a wedding, wished we could have stayed longer. Everything was very comfortable and we can't wait to visit again soon!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. A little loud from the restaurant below until they close for the night.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful, spacious, comfortable Airbnb located right in the center of the action in town - great value for the rate. Great space for families with kids as well. The noise from the restaurant downstairs did go on until about 11pm, but a noise machine allowed us to sleep fine. We‚Äôd definitely stay here again."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was very nice, clean, in a great location, and professionally decorated. However, the sitting area was not very comfortable, with one sofa and 2 chairs that were not very comfortable. The bathrooms in the bedrooms had barn sliding doors that didn't close in a way that there was any privacy. I realize that we were located on Main Street and one must allow for noise at night, but the bar beneath us had no insulation from the sound below. We could hear distinct conversations like we were sitting in the bar. This is something to bear in mind when booking this property. Our group had 2 couples. We drove together and that was a good thing, because there was only one parking pass. If we drove separately, as we originally planned, one of us would have had to pay for parking. I think that is bad form, considering what we paid for the weekend."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Simply put, this condo is the literal definition of ‚Äúamazing‚Äù!
This is a place we will 100% visit again, and again.
It‚Äôs spacious, super clean, and a wonderful design form when it was remodeled with exposed brick and concrete from its original build.
The furniture and decor were ‚Äúmagazine cover‚Äù stuff.
The location is right smack in the middle of downtown, short walk to Gather, short walk to the Bridge, and just as centrally located as it can be.
The icing on the cake, is that it faces South Main St. Your windows look out and over the street, and thus the downstairs entrance gives you a very unique entrance right off the sidewalk.
You‚Äôd be hard pressed to find a more beautifully designed and decorated place to stay that‚Äôs closer to the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù of downtown Greenville."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Highly recommended! Conveniently located. Clean. Host was very responsive and friendly. Appropriately stocked apartment. Yes there was a small amount of noise from the restaurant below ( as stated by host) however the noise was minimal and was only during the early evening and did not impact our experience at all. Again I would highly recommended! Such a beautiful city. And so many great food options.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We left at 6:30 this morning. Pass is on counter. Sheets off the bed wet towels in the shower. Dishes all clean , we loved the place. Trash put out also. Thank you very much."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My best friend and I had a little mini getaway girls weekend and the location could not have been more perfect! It was right in the dow town area and walkable to everything‚Ä¶soooooo many good restaurants, bars and shops to go see. If we ever come to Greenville again we will definitely look to stay here again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Top 5 Airbnb that we‚Äôve stayed at to date. Great location with a host who communicates well. House was very clean and well done with the decor.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and easily walkable. John was very responsive when we had a question. Place is great!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful space in the West End of Greenville. Minutes walk from the park and endless restaurants. Some noise in the evenings to be expected in that area of downtown but ear plugs were in the nightstand if needed. We hope to come back to this Airbnb again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location! Location! Location! So close to everything you'd want to do in Greenville. Gorgeous condo with lots of stylish touches. John was a Great host! Would definitely stay there again!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"John was a excellent host! Responded very quickly, and was very accommodating to our needs and requests. John allowed us to check in early. Check-in instructions were super detailed and helpful. The apartment is beautiful and was very clean. We could not have asked for a better location. Overall a wonderful place; we would love to stay here again easily!. Thank you so much John."
2022-11-01,3,Stayed about a week,"We booked this apartment for a 9 night stay. We arrived a few minutes after 3p which was the designated check in time. The cleaning person was still cleaning stating they were running behind and would need another 20 minutes. She allowed us to bring in the few bags of groceries we had as well as our luggage. It ended up taking her almost 45 minutes to finish up. Not a big deal but we were ready to relax after a 11 hour drive that started at 4a. The apartment was much larger than expected and decorated very nicely. Bedrooms and bathrooms were large. Kitchen was well appointed. We made breakfast in the apartment most mornings but there were enough pots, pans, etc to cook a full meal if wanted. The vibe of the apartment as well as the whole floor was super cool. My husband and I were both very pleased with the apartment. Loved the exposed bricks, wood floor and beams, as well as the huge windows in our unit. The unit has 3 TVs but no cable or satellite so you watch tv via apps. Took us awhile to get used to that but once we did it was ok. The location was good as well although admittedly we always found ourselves heading north when leaving thru the door on Main Street. We did head south a few times but most of what you will walk to is north and a reasonable walk. As I said both my husband and I were very pleased with the apartment. Free parking was a huge bonus too. The downside to the apartment is the excessive noise from the restaurant, Coral, below. Coral is a restaurant with a popular bar, which sits directly below this apartment. They don‚Äôt start playing music until mid afternoon. They don‚Äôt stop playing music until 11p or a few nights closer to midnight. The building being old without any sound proofing and the location of this apartment being right over the bar is not a good combo. You not only hear the very loud music, but you can also hear peoples conversations - not muffled, full conversations. Again that stops by midnight so if you aren‚Äôt wanting to be asleep before then probably not a problem for you. We got used to it but both of us were very frustrated the first couple of nights. The thing we could not get past is the cleaning people showing up at 5am to clean the restaurant - with a shop vac. It woke us up every single morning with the exception of Monday and Tuesday since they were closed on Sunday and Monday. Our first night we sat in the bar at Coral and ordered dinner. My husband was talking to who he thought was one of the employees about the noise level. Turns out it was one of the owners. They were very nice and comped our dinner because of the noise level. They also said that they know that there are frequent noise complaints from the renters staying in the apartments above but that they follow the city ordinance. Regardless of how nice the apartments are the noise from Coral below is just too much for us to return or recommend to anyone else. It‚Äôs a shame because the apartment really is terrific. There are 3 other apartments on the same floor so apartment #4 (which would be over the back of the restaurant) may be quieter."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a great location. The interior is larger than it looks in the photo's and the layout is fantastic. This is an excellent place and we will be back.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, very roomy, and clean!!!!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt say enough wonderful things about loft # 1.
Checking in was a breeze. I had a quick question and response was immediate.
Extremely clean, upscale, well stocked for cooking, and amazingly comfy!
Gorgeous windows in the living room and main bedroom. This made it very special having my coffee in the morning.
Oh, there are nice thick drapes so the sunshine won‚Äôt wake you up.
Bathrooms were sparkling and nice linens.
Since you are staying in a loft above Main Street it quiets down in the evening. Bring a box fan if you go to bed early.
However, you may wanna stay up and enjoy a nite cap while admiring the beautiful lights strung along the trees. Also, a great view to people watch.
Great location, coffee shops, dining, and shopping.
One of my favorite trips and lodging!
I Will be back!!!!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was great! Very modern and updated with tons of natural light! The location can‚Äôt be best, either. Would definitely stay again if I‚Äôm ever in the Greenville area."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Jessica and Bryan's place was beautiful. They created a peaceful little oasis in busy Greenville. I loved the mornings on the deck and the special touches they provided through our the home. well planned space. We had a problem with the lights not working one day. The breaker had to be flipped twice in one day but Jessica was very quick to respond and fix the problem.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Tree House was a lovely place. A perfect 1/2 stop on my way from Naples, FL to Ocean City, NJ. I'll definitely look to stop again in the future.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful studio apartment surrounded by the canopy of trees. The mattress was comfortable and provided a comfortable sleep all night long.

2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"We had a good stay here. We were only there for the night, but managed to enjoy the firepit a little after the rain stopped. It was a little noisy for us because the cabin backs up to a busy road, but I think it was because it was a Friday night and there aren't a lot of leaves on the trees this time of year. The cabin is adorable. The only thing that bothered us was the fact that the TV/Internet access was not working. Again, we were only there for the night so we didn't bother them. Overall, we enjoyed our stay !"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the little cabin! Stayed for a night and it was perfect. Great deal for a small place (aside from fees from cleaning/etc which I‚Äôm not sure if host has control of).
Either way, a super nice spot for a couple or friends. There‚Äôs a nice bed and a pull out couch/futon."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay. The hosts were very responsive.
Because I had looked for this information in the reviews and didn't see anyone mention it:
1) as you would expect of a historic cabin, there was a very slight musty smell. It went away as we got used to it during our stay, and it wasn't a reason for me to not book again. Just something I had wondered about before our stay and thought I would include for others wondering
2) the property is next to a busy highway. It got quieter in the late evening, but there's definitely traffic next to the property. You are still in a city, despite the rustic setting. Since we normally live in a rural area, I brought a fan for white noise, and that was all I needed to get a good night's sleep."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect quiet get away with an authentic feel
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My 13-yr old and I enjoyed this cozy cottage passing through town. An absolute step up from the typical hotel offering.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted to go to Greenville but not pay the high hotel prices. There were many other Air B&Bs listed but none were as reasonably priced, and we didn't need much space. We loved everything being in one room (except for the kitchen and bathroom!) The floor in the bathroom sloped a bit, but given that the cabin was built in the 1800s we considered it ""character""! I also loved the minimum check out requirements -- basically just run the dishwasher before leaving, and leaving used towels in a hamper. Usually we have to empty garbage and sometimes even strip the sheets. They really took care of everything else! We also loved the privacy and coziness. If we visit Greenville again we will definitely stay there!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Quaint little cabin that was perfect for our weekend stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"ONE OF THE BEST STAYS. GREAT, QUIET FEEL YET SO CLOSE TO DOWNTOWN GREENVILLE. BEAUTIFUL, COMFORTABLE, SPOTLESS, AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE."

We took a great walk in the neighborhood. Incredibly helpful and nice hosts! And we felt so at home- I could even cook real meals, bed was comfortable, tv was easy to figure out. They thought of every detail! An absolute gem and we will definitely come back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Best weekend getaway!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My mom, son and I enjoyed our stay! We loved the coziness and the decor in the cabin. We hope to find our way back again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute cabin in a perfect location!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This a really cool little cabin. It was just perfect for my overnight stay. The sitting area outside is also very nice. I enjoyed a cup of coffee while waking up to the songs of the birds. I was hiking in Parris Mountain state park and this was a perfect base camp.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"It's immediately clear that this is an old place, but it is very well kept and super charming and comfortable! There is plenty of outdoor seating and scenery, though the one night my bf and I stayed, we stayed hidden away in the cozy and comfortable cottage. Though the bathroom was small, it was done up very nicely and had plenty of fresh towels available. The little kitchen also had everything, including a dishwasher, stove and wall oven. I don't remember if the bnb is pet friendly but we thought it was very cool that there was a big doggy door on the door leading to the side yard with the outdoor seating. The bed was super comfortable and had luxurious bedding. Also was delighted to see a functioning fireplace with wood handy!
As a local, it was a perfect couples retreat, a nice place to escape within the city. Will definitely return and 100% recommend. Nat 20s for hospitality! Thank you Tony and Racquel!"

They have a fire pit outside too, which was cool, even though I didn‚Äôt use it. It was a nice place to sit outside. While you can hear some street traffic, I mostly heard the birds chirping. I loved the cabin feel and would stay again. I met one of the hosts and he was very friendly and welcoming."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend staying here. It‚Äôs a perfect place for two people for a weekend get away. Great little cabin and cute outdoor space.

2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint cabin 10 minutes away from downtown. it rained the whole time we were there, but along with the cozy digs and local recommendations from our hosts, we were left feeling very content and happy to have spent our time there."

We came to Greenville for concert and only plan to stay overnight, but I ended up staying the whole weekend. there‚Äôs something about this cabin that is very special and I was able to unwind and relax for the first time in a long time. When we checked out, the host was quick to let me know that I had left my jewelry there on the nightstand, and they worked hard to make sure that it was returned.
I would definitely recommend staying here because it‚Äôs the perfect location to a lot of museums and events and there are amazing restaurants nearby."

The bed was so comfortable that I had the best sleep I have had in a while.
There were chocolates on the nightstand for us, fresh oranges in the kitchen and K cups in the coffee maker. Very welcoming touches.
I totally recommend that you stay here."

I was surprised at the amount of road noise (even when inside watching TV). Probably not a dealbreaker for most people, but I wanted to mention it because I combed reviews looking for any mention of noise and saw none."

The towels smelled like fresh lavender and were so thick and soft. I felt like I was in a spa! The bed was super comfy. We slept like babies. The coffee bar was fully stocked with good quality coffee. We were there to cycle the Swamp Rabbit Trail and it was easy access from this location. Tony and Racquel sent us a list of great recommendations. We enjoyed several of those‚Ä¶ a walk through Falls Park, pizza from D‚ÄôAllasandro‚Äôs, the Swamp Rabbit Cafe, White Duck Taco, and breakfast at Tandem Creperie & Coffeehouse in Traveler‚Äôs Rest. We couldn‚Äôt have picked a better spot for our 24th anniversary weekend. Our only regret was that it was too hot to use the awesome fire pit area and that there wasn‚Äôt a grill. Highly recommend!!"

Everything was clean and cute and we really appreciated the Kuerig machine complete with coffee pods, all the kinds of sweeteners and creamer. we didn't use the fire pit but the backyard space it was in is super cute and we hope to come back and sit by the fire one night."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Outstanding. This cabin charmed me senseless! Cozy and storybook, maybe the best value I've gotten from an airbnb. Warm and oakey vintage table lamp lighting in the evening, quiet as can be, super comfortable bed, no issues with the wifi, and though some previous guests lodged a minor complaint with poor shower pressure, this seemed a bit exaggerated to me."

Quiet, beautiful location and what a view of the South Carolina mountains from deck and the living room window. It also was 13 minutes to Furman University for the Greenville Highland Games. Great restaurants, breweries and trails nearby. A quick 30 minutes to Greenville. Lydia was a responsive and a wonderful host. We will look to come back again next time we have an opportunity to be up in the Greenville area. Thank you, it was an honor to be your first guests."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was very clean and very adorable. The only problem (minor) was that it was not walkable to the city, however it was a quick drive there. I recommend getting an Uber to take you back and forth to ease the parking problem we had. We would definitely stay here again. We are in our 70‚Äôs and felt very safe staying here."

2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for a Downtown Greenville getaway. A little bit of a walk to town, but we didn‚Äôt mind. Also a very easy drive into downtown.
The place was comfortable and clean. The bed was a bit low and hard for my liking but not terrible by any means. It is right off the highway but we didn‚Äôt get any road noise in the house.
The surrounding neighborhood was adorable and clean."

When we had questions or concerns, the host responded quickly. The site is located close to downtown Greenville. You will also have easy access to other surrounding communities due to the close proximity to main roads/highways. We would highly recommend this place for a relaxing and fun stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Easy walk into the main part of the city. Private parking area. What a lovely place! Spacious, big windows, lush landscaping, super sunny, comfortable furniture, cozy couch in front of the gas fireplace. Very comfortable bed, crisp white linens, fluffy white towels. Large bathroom. Surprisingly deep bathtub! Large refrigerator, great stove. The outdoor stairs were easy to navigate. The hosts were very responsive. We‚Äôd love to stay here again!"

The host was very responsive and helpful leading up do and during our stay at their cozy spot. This will definitely be the first place we look when planning our next outing in Greenville!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was better than expected! We were there for the women‚Äôs SEC basketball tournament, and the walk to the center was alot closer than I anticipated!! I have COPD and even I could handle the walk. My COPD didn‚Äôt love the stairs to the unit but I knew that going in! The unit was clean and bright and had all the amenities we needed. Actually more than we needed!! I had an issue with the door look and reached out to Erin and she replied immediately. Even sent someone to the unit. Realized it was my own stupidity and I still can‚Äôt apologize enough for that. But Erin didn‚Äôt seem to mind at all! 100% will stay here again and again! Thank you again Erin for the wonderful stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin's place was absolutely amazing!! Clean, bright, and so fresh! The white walls with the gorgeous gold accents were just so nice. Everything just felt perfect! Greenville is such a fun town, and Erin had great recommendations! Her place is super convenient to their beautiful downtown area. Falls Park is a beautiful park right in the heart of downtown!
We were in town for a concert at the Bon Secours Wellness Center and Erin's place is PERFECT! Just a short 5 minute walk. It made it great for going to the show! And we were able to enjoy her deck before the show! Overall, just an amazing experience! And little touches, like the blanket on the bed being folded in a flower pattern, and the same with the toilet paper. Love love love it!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great unit and host!

2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This 2nd floor apt. was very nice. It is just over a mile from the downtown area and we like to walk so the location was fine for us. The only downside was it was a little noisy due to the busy street nearby. We are not used to all those noises where we live. All-in-all, we had a very enjoyable visit to Greenville. Thanks Erin for the hospitality."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was our first time visiting Greenville, and the location couldn‚Äôt have been more perfect! We highly recommend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cutest airbnb, very cozy & comfortable. Close to Main Street. The host was great & the place was clean & organized."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was exactly the stay we were looking for in a little getaway, beautiful interior, close distance to everywhere we went, just perfect! Erin helped us with any questions we had and left clear instructions for everything we needed."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay, the location was perfect and so close to the downtown area. It was a short walk to all the restaurants and attractions. We were also very comfortable and felt right at home. We‚Äôd definitely stay at one of Erin‚Äôs locations again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time exploring Greenville & Erin‚Äôs place (top floor unit) was a great home base for a few days!
We appreciated the central location and personal touch of some sweet Christmas decorations; nice Roku TV and the electric fireplace was cozy.
Plenty of closet space with hangers & a nice chest of drawers in the br.
Updated, functional and full kitchen & coffee setup (Nespresso & old-school pot).
Solid shower setup with stationary shampoo, conditioner, body wash & black washcloths for makeup.
Amazing hot water & shower-head pressure and lots of towels!
Considerations: As other reviewers have noted, there are sirens in the area so use a white noise app/machine or bring a fan to help sleep. The bed is pretty firm, so if you prefer a softer mattress, just a consideration :)
All in all, good spot!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and beautiful place. I definitely wanted to make the place mine. Coffee pods available are so good, and everything i‚Äôm the kitchen you could possibly need."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I enjoyed my stay! Greenville was great and the space had everything I needed, and some. I'll be back :)"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin‚Äôs place was beautiful, peaceful, charming and well appointed. Thoughtfully stocked with top quality products including towels of all kinds and sizes, shower products, blow dryer, Nescaf√© pods (yum!) teas, misc cooking tools and ingredients, waters, etc. the apt was located on a top floor so might be challenging to the less able bodied. The bed and linens were comfy and clean. Lots of natural light, exquisitely decorated and a great home base while visiting charming Greenville. Easy to access with key code so we could come and go with not a worry. Erin was responsive and helpful. The neighborhood is so charming, flanked by gorgeous trees, and good mix of residential and professional offices. I love Greenville and was smitten with the home, neighborhood and stay. Thanks Erin!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, exactly as described. Very homely and lovely apartment."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adam and Abby are great hosts and if you‚Äôre looking for a comfortable 1 bedroom 15 min walking distance to downtown you will love this place. Working remote was comfortable. Kitchen had everything I needed. Parking was always super simple. Favorite features are the huge bathroom with lots of counter space, the fireplace, being on the 3rd floor with view of the fall foliage, and the coffee/tea station. It‚Äôs was also a nice perk to be able to do laundry before I left. I‚Äôm so grateful to Adam and Abby for hosting me and I look forward to staying here again in the future."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Adam and Abby's place! The unit was exactly as they described: lots of light! I loved all the windows. Everything was spotless and Abby and Adam thought of everything! We had been weighing our options between this and getting a hotel, but this was definitely the right choice. Everything was hotel quality or better, plus it was in a quiet neighborhood yet still close to downtown. One nice little touch that I noticed was the washcloths were black so I didn't worry about makeup staining them. It's clear the hosts think about how to make their guests comfortable here, and we appreciate it!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at Adam and Abbys place while in town for business. Lovely, spacious, and historic home set in a beautiful neighborhood. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place walkable to downtown Greenville. The place is very much as described. It‚Äôs in a very quiet neighborhood, close to the highway leading into town and super walkable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for my needs. I am so glad I found it. Hope to stay here in future business trips.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Although we had checked in a day late due to unforeseen circumstances we enjoyed everything about staying ! We will most certainly continue to use Abby and Adam for our ventures to Greenville. We walked to Bon Secours for the Jelly Roll concert and downtown for food.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is clean, bright, spacious, and well-stocked with supplies. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was beautiful. It is close to the great downtown area of Greenville."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adam and Abby‚Äôs place was absolutely fantastic. We had an incredible stay and would definitely book with them again.! :)
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful stay! Everything was as expected! Adam and Abby are very friendly and helpful!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay. Had some troubles with the wifi being offline but they were quick to work on it.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent communication from our lovely hosts along with a clean and charming house near downtown Greenville made for a wonderful experience! Side note for light sleepers, a fan might be necessary as the highway to downtown is near the house. I would certainly recommend this stay!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed staying at this spot, the place itself is a great price for its location. The room was very clean and neat and the kitchen was nice (although I didn‚Äôt really use it). The only complaint I had - and is no fault of the hosts themselves - is that the location is right off the main interstate that runs into downtown Greenville. I am a light sleeper and there is a quite noticeable amount of road noise all night in that area, so I had to sleep with earplugs. Other than that the location is great for getting around to the great food and entertainment that is downtown. Would definitely recommend (for heavier sleepers than I am)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect.
The accommodations were exactly as described, and the location of the AirBnb was extremely accessible to downtown Greenville + other destinations.
The space was exceptionally clean and tidy when we arrived, and we were delighted by the amenities + drinks/snacks provided by our excellent hosts!
I can't say enough good things about this location and I hope to return!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great location and perfect place to stay. Went to a concert at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena which was walking distance from the house. Also very close to downtown. The neighborhood was very pretty as well. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook dinner and the bathroom was well stocked with towels, shampoo, and soap. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place at walking distance from
downtown"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Adam and Abby are super kind and great hosts. I highly recommend staying at their place whether you‚Äôre planning on being in Greenville for just a few days or for an extended stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! Would totally stay here again. Felt right at home ‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was exactly as pictured and well cleaned, although the carpet has significant stains and probably should be replaced. Access to the unit was easy and Amy was very responsive any time I had a question. On site parking was easily accessed through the alley and felt very secure. In our opinion, access to downtown is not convenient. The fastest route to Main Street takes about 15 minutes but forces you to use the narrow sidewalk directly next to a very busy three lane road. Selecting the ‚Äúneighborhood route‚Äù to the Riverwalk is quieter and more pleasant than but takes about 30 minutes. If you plan on spending significant time downtown, this may not be the best location if you prefer to walk. The unit also backs up to that same busy three lane road (the feeder ramp to I385) making it very noisy for sleeping. With the bedroom on the back of the house, traffic noise is pretty much constant all night long."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space. Great time in Greenville.
Clean, comfortable, cute place!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Conveniently located close to downtown but a little longer than the stated 10m walk. Nothing to do in the immediate area unless you‚Äôre visiting 1 of many lawyers with offices there. You approach the unit from an unattractive alley in the back of the building up 3 flights of stairs. The house is not marked on the back but instructions helped me find it. The unit has alot of natural light which makes it cheery but could use some room-darkening shades in the bedroom which overlooks a busy highway. Fairly clean although the carpeting is old and stained in places. Spacious bathroom with good water pressure although I was freaked out when I found a huge palmetto bug one morning. The hosts said they had never seen one there, and they used preventive measures. I‚Äôm not from SC, but was told a rain event which we had the night before may have triggered it. Upon arrival there was no guidebook with recommendations but upon request the host put one together. Overall, an ok stay for a good price."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, cozy, and clean! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. Such an easy walk to downtown Greenville as well!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"There are a series of stairs to get up with your luggage. I have bad knees so probably wasn't the best for me. But easy to get into and host very responsive.
Very nice and clean, beautiful views in front, a little creaky and a teeny but musty. I am very sensitive to that, though.
All rooms are super spacious, lovely non wood fireplace, great shower, kitchen well appointed.
Overall a great stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Everything was perfect and easy. Walked to downtown multiple times. Would stay again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is marvelous, roomy and clean. Abby and Adam went out of their way to accommodate us at the last moment. Great place will definitely look them up when in the area again.
A lot of steep stairs, not recommended for people with physical difficulties climb stairs, or lift bags several steps."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very nice stay. Clean and comfortable
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay and would definitely come back in the future! very convenient location to downtown!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a couple nights and we really enjoyed the space! It was cute, cozy and looked just like the photos. Would book again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay here! The Airbnb was in a great location, it had a bright cozy feel and was very clean! I especially liked the bathroom, the plush towels were a nice touch. The price was great too, definitely worth it!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great apartment, as pictures! To recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay for our first trip to Greenville! It is a prime location with restaurants only 5 mins away. The place was very clean and stocked with anything you could possibly need. You can tell they have put a lot of thought into making sure their guests felt like they were home away from home!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If there was ever an Airbnb that was filled with peace and tranquility, this home is. It‚Äôs one of the best we have ever visited. My kids didn‚Äôt want to leave, they wanted to stay on vacation in that house. The care and beauty, the downloadable guest book that had over and above instructions to make you feel at home and know exactly what to do and how, to the comfortable bedding and beds, every aspect of this home was stellar. It‚Äôs immaculate and you can‚Äôt really quantify peace for those who travel
Like us! We love it and want to go back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay. This was close to everything. The host was responsive and super helpful when needed.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we had a great stay at Cynthia's place! it's a quick drive to downtown Greenville
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was sweet! Super clean! The porch was huge! I wish we had more time to hangout there. Cynthia was quick to respond when we had a question. I would def recommend this place to anyone!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying there! It was a great experience! We would stay here again any time.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful little home. Covered front porch with tiny roof was very relaxing, would have loved for it to rain. Would definitely stay here again if ever coming to area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice cozy and quiet place.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful updated home! Nice deck to sit out on. Great location as well! Definitely will be back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Looks just like pics. Extremely cute makeover on this trailer! Felt comfy and cozy, my husband really enjoyed deck for morning wake up and coffee. Location is excellent to get to downtown ($7 Uber) or 1.5 is miles I think. Easy access to swamp rabbit trail (so fun to bike! And bar hop check out shops). Would stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great area, lovely home, and great communication."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay as usual! I wish I could book for a month! Amazing hosts!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is absolutely beautiful and so comfortable! I recommend this to any and everyone!! Stay here ‚ú®
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay at Uptown Girl! Cynthia was extremely responsive and helpful with anything we needed. The space was great for 2, and our pup enjoyed her time there as well! We also had some cute kitty visitors throughout our stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay immensely. Great location. The place was absolutely immaculate...five big stars and we felt very comfortable. Beds were very comfortable.
We walked to and from downtown daily during the mornings, afternoons and evenings and felt safe during our travels and with our accommodations.
Parking is a little challenging due to very narrow and cracked driveway but once you get the hang of it, you will have not problem. We Ubered to some restaurants and places that were farther out since we didn't want to drive at night. Quick and easy to use Uber.
We would not hesitate to book a return visit."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time at Erin‚Äôs! The space is beautiful, comfortable beds, and just an incredible vibe. We‚Äôd recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Came to Greenville with friends and this house fit us perfectly! Bedrooms are large and the place was spotless! We could easily walk to downtown for the art festival and restaurants!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous home in lovely neighborhood, convenient to downtown, restaurants, bars, parks and greenway. Erin was friendly and helpful, and the house was very comfortable. We would stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it here!! We stayed in unit 1 (it is a split house) but our part had the main kitchen & living room. It was on a quiet street will beautiful houses, & everything in the house is so well put together. It even has a washer & dryer!!! I would absolutely stay here again simply to see what they did with the other parts because it was just amazing. It‚Äôs SO CLOSE to downtown too, a less than 5 min drive, so when we went out & came home Ubers were cheap! & most definitely worth the price for all the things they have for you. Don‚Äôt look anywhere else, book here for sure. Erin & her co hosts were very helpful with recommendations & instructions, I could say so much more about this place"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous, well-appointed home on a shady street. We felt very safe and comfortable. The neighborhood is quite accessible to the highway, and though it was close in proximity, street noise was never an issue.

We had no issues with our stay and would absolutely recommend this space to others!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Safe neighborhood, closer to main St than I expected, great communication w/ Erin. Super clean. Love Greenville.
We'll be back."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb unit (Unit 1) has large, spacious rooms in a nicely renovated historic house. The listing pictures are accurate. There is more than one unit in this structure. There are 2 things to note if both bedrooms are used: 1) one of the full baths is right off the kitchen downstairs and 2) the back bedroom is a half-flight down from the upstairs full bathroom which may prove a little tricky during nocturnal trips! The listing does describe this somewhat. The neighborhood is quiet except for the street noise coming from I-385 which is a block behind the house. Cleveland Park with an entrance to the Swamp Rabbit Trail is 4 blocks away. Downtown is about a 15-minute easy walk. Parking in the private lot behind the house is good. Turning left off I-385 into the neighborhood took some time during rush hour(s) so it's good to plan for alternate routes. Entry and check-out instructions were easy. Erin was responsive during the stay. Note: early check-in may be available for a fee."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully decorated with an open homey feel. Neighborhood was picturesque and felt safe. We enjoyed many pleasant evenings in this home.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This gorgeous home absolutely exceeded my expectations. As a first time Air BNB user, I was completed blown away at how clean and perfect this home is, in a way that I felt like it was my own. Nestled in a great quiet neighborhood, it was easy to walk to all the downtown hot-spots, my only regret was not staying longer to see what else Greenville has to offer."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful exterior and interior with lovely decor!! Very clean, comfortable and yes...has lots of light. Three friends and I had a wonderful time and would absolutely rent this charming house again. Our stay was perfect!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely older home really nicely re-done! Master Bed was so comfortable ! Plenty of light! One thing: Last step down to main floor needs to be more noticeable. We both missed it once. Didn‚Äôt fall. Just surprised. Then I put a small basket on step to make us more aware. All in all was a nice place. Perfect for us to attend our family wedding in Greenville . Thank you.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would stay again! Great location.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had hoped the walkable distance to downtown would have met our needs better. Ideally, we like to park our car where we are staying and walk. We were not comfortable crossing major roads. Though, The parking garages allowed us to spend a few days downtown comfortably."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of my favorite all time Airbnb experiences! This historic home is stunning and charming in every way. The location is convenient to downtown Greenville and perfect for our visit to BMW Performance Center. It was a quiet and comfortable home with great amenities including the awesome Nespresso machine to enjoy coffee on the great front porch each morning. The place was spotlessly clean and had wonderfully comfy beds and seating. I can‚Äôt give any higher reco and will stay here EVERY time we are in the area!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adam and Abby have a beautiful place in Greenville‚Äôs historic district. This home is well decorated, spacious and clean. Proximity to downtown Greenville was very convenient; it‚Äôs easy to connect to the Swamp Rabbit Trail that runs into Greenville and all the way up to Traveler‚Äôs Rest. We enjoyed a couple of long bike rides right from Adam & Abby‚Äôs place. We appreciated Adam and Amy‚Äôs quick responses to our messages. Their AirBnB was a wonderful find!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great weekend at Adam and Abby's place!
There was plenty of space for our family of four to relax together or apart when we weren't walking to the park & zoo or restaurants & sites downtown.
The bathrooms both have bath/showers so there wasn't a line to get ready in the morning or for getting ready to go out for the evening.
Plus, there was a full kitchen with separate dining space for the mornings, which came in handy for our impromptu leftover magic breakfast with fresh eggs and leftovers from Fork and Plough.
Of course, we can't forget to mention the Nespresso coffee machine, which definitely got some use since the closest coffee shops appeared to closed on the weekends.
Thanks for having us, Adam and Abby!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location easy access to Bon Secours Areaa and to downtown. Renovated space with large rooms. Worked great for our needs and owners responded quickly to our needs!

The home is clean and fresh, nicely appointed for comfort and style. Full kitchen with everything we needed‚Ä¶especially two ways to make coffee!
The ROKU accessible TVs made it simple to stream shows and USMT soccer matches.
The neighbor is very safe, full of attorney offices and other professional businesses. A walk to downtown was easy on the sidewalks."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Adam and Abby‚Äôs listing is charming and quiet. It looked exactly like the photos and was very clean. We enjoyed staying there very much.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adam & Abby‚Äôs place is beautiful and in a perfect location. Their home is about a mile from downtown Greenville, so it was convenient to get to all the shops, restaurants, and parks. They were also very quick to respond to my questions and offered lots of great recommendations."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adam and Abby‚Äôs place was absolutely beautiful! Spotlessly clean and in the perfect location, close enough to downtown but far enough to still be peaceful and quiet! Thank you so much, I would love to be back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"What‚Äôs not to recommend about this beautiful historic place, close to town and easy to get around. The apartment has an original period dining room which makes it perfect to spread out, entertain, or conduct a meeting. Adam is gracious and responsive."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"From the get go Jimmy was very proactive and friendly! Gave us great recommendations for local events and places to eat. Our apartment unit was on the 2nd floor-- I didn't realize that I probably overlooked that on app), but it was not an issue.
I loved and appreciated the fact that there is art on the walls to purchase! What a phenomenal place to showcase!! I also really appreciated that Jimmy included local menus and guidebooks for the area.
The apartment is adorable. There was some traffic noise, as this location is right on a Main street, however with the AC and ceiling fan on we only heard the occasional ambulance. Being near a hospital that is to be expected.
The double sided brick fireplace and gorgeous wooden mantle is a sweet call back to yesteryear.
This unit is minutes from the cute Zoo. We ordered in from Willy Tacos. Enjoyed a wonderful lunch at The Bohemian Cafe.
Thank you Jimmy for the wonderful host that you are. Hope to be back in Greenville soon!"

2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We had a mostly nice stay at this Airbnb while visiting Greenville for a week. The location is extremely convenient for visiting downtown. The air conditioner ran very cold during our heat wave week with temperatures over 95¬∞ which was needed. The entryway to the house was nice with lots of character.
Some downsides - being a pretty small place there‚Äôs no place to sit besides the bed or one chair, or at the kitchen table. Sometimes the Wi-Fi was a little choppy which was a problem for working remotely. The chairs on the front porch were majorly in need of fresh paint. But probably the main creepy downside was the appearance of four huge cockroaches scurrying over the walls and floor two nights while we were lying in bed watching TV. These things took multiple shoe smacks to take down. I killed three back to back one evening and flushed them in the toilet in the morning and was very amazed to find them still alive, their little legs squirming as they traveled down the white rapids of the toilet bowl into the sewer. My girlfriend nearly had a heart attack and then we were worried that a night time trip to the bathroom would result in the crunch of a roach body underfoot from guest yet unseen. I know this is the south and these little guys are locals, but I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt mention the gross out encounter. Other than that this was a nice stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super nice and clean. Comfy bed. 15 min walk from the heart of DT Greenville. If your walking alone at night I would get and uber because of the 1st 1/3 of the walk otherwise ur good.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything at Jimmy‚Äôs was easy and just as expected. He made check-in a piece of cake and we enjoyed being just on the north end of downtown. We didn‚Äôt discover the parking in the back of the building until our last day (we also didn‚Äôt think to ask), but it didn‚Äôt matter because the street parking is also abundant and (as far as I could tell) unregulated right on the next block."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Well located near local restaurants and a residential historical district this 2 room unit + bathroom has most of what you need for a short term or long term stay. I found the unit perfect for my needs over a month. Even though it is an older building it is clean, with no signs of bugs the whole time I was there and the charm of the building and neighborhood reminded me of Los Angeles. It is a little close to a busy intersection, but I personally did not find that bothersome or the traffic noise disruptive. It felt safe. The host is on top of everything and very knowledgeable about the city as a whole. Would definitely stay here again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jimmy is hands down the best Air BnB host I have ever dealt with! From the moment we booked he reached out with basic info and to see if we needed anything. He quickly answered any questions and gave us a great list of restaurants to visit.
