2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew is home was a really good place to stay for a short period of time. Easy check-in good view clean. I’ve stayed in this apartment complex before it’s pretty small. All the bathrooms are very small so it’s not just his unit, the bedroom was very nice, the only complaint I have, which is very minor is that the sheets that are on the bed kept sliding off I would suggest to get new sheets that go for the depth of the mattress because I think they’re two that are stacked on top of each other. there is no induction stove, the other unit I stayed in this complex had one and it was honestly super convenient. But again it’s pretty worth it to stay here for the price that we paid very clean fairly quiet. The walls are thin in this complex so I would keep that in mind that people can hear you vice versa."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent stay. Host was great, location was perfect, and place was very clean. I would recommend an upgraded mattress though."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place was great and we loved steamboat springs. I just wish there was more to do in steamboat
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Nook is a perfect place to stay in the Boat and Mathew was such a wonderful host!! We had great communication, easy peazy check in and an ideal location. Would stay here again 1000%!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A quaint little condo with million dollar views! Mathews place was perfect for our quick getaway to do some spring skiing in the boat!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing stay and get location! Also very friendly! Would recommend to anyone!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good and easy commute to the mountain and downtown! Small but has everything we need for a week stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean unit with good amenities. Easy to access and parking was good. Views are excellent off the front of the unit.
Nice location with good access to restaurants, shuttle etc."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Mathew’s place is just big enough for 2 people and is very true to the ad. The bathroom sink was very slow to drain, but beyond that the apartment was super functional. We really enjoyed staying there!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you! Excellent location in the Boat!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our time at Matthew's place. It is conveniently located w/ easy access to slopes. Bus stop is a solid 8-10 min walk in either direction (uphill on the way back) so we opted to drive to free parking lot instead to save some time. As described, the place is small but had everything we needed - except for closets/ places to hang wet ski gear, as others have mentioned. There was an issue with the sinks draining slowly, but hopefully that's resolved for future guests. All in all, a solid, convenient home base to play in the snow :)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The property was exactly as pictured and described. Convenient location. Gorgeous view. Matthew was very responsive and nice.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super great stay and easily accessible to the resort! We loved it

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to hang your hat. Centrally located and clean and comfortable.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great stay!
2024-01-01,4,Stayed about a week,"The apartment is exactly as advertised and is perfect for a 1-2 folks skiing at steamboat - the view is also not oversold at night it’s beautiful! That being said communication for issues will not be great as it’s clear its an automated service and not host responding.
1 example - I asked for early checkin. I got a message less than 1 minute later telling me they couldn’t guarantee it but would check with their cleaning service (clearly automated) and if it was cleaned already I could checkin early. I didn’t get another message from them and couldn’t check in early. When I got to apartment there was a notecard that clearly stated the apartment had been cleaned and was ready from cleaning service an entire day earlier. So they clearly never even looked into it.
Small things. But for a barebones getaway it’s great for the price. The free coffee offered was also nice. Just don’t expect any service while at the apt."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Matthew was always very timely with all questions.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and good location!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,everything was great. nice cozy place to stay
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew was the most responsive host I’ve ever had on AirBnb! We realized a pan was missing within being there for 30 minutes and let Matthew know. He responded within a minute and delivered a new pan to our doorstep with an hour! I highly recommend this Airbnb. Amazing hot, walkable location, great amenities in room, easy parking, etc!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute little spot!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy and Amazing location! The host was more than helpful! Book this unit you won’t be disappointed!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little condo. Close to the mountain, and beautiful views. Definitely cozy, I agree with previous reviews could use some storage for clothes but otherwise stoked with everything you need!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little place, in a good location. More like a hotel room since the kitchen was very small but they do have a nice coil burner if you need to cook something. Good place, good location, and super quiet!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute place in Steamboat. Small but just big enough for a couple.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A nice spot with easy access to downtown and the mountain base. A good size space but very minimal space to put items or hang towels/clothes/jackets. Also very small kitchen that would only be ideal for microwave meals or snacks, not really able to fully cook. Clean and comfy!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fantastic cozy nest in Steamboat Springs! Minutes from everything from ski resort to downtown to Strawberry Hot Springs to Fish Creek Falls!
Had everything we needed and the fridge and the microwave were great for leftovers. Bed was super comfortable and the decorations were cute and fit right in for the charming mountain-town vibe!
The stairs closest to the actual unit were closed down for construction but there was plenty of parking on bottom or top level!
10/10 would stay again- great value for the time we were there!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Small space, but that was expected. Really wish they had provided some space for clothing. No dressers, no closet, not even hooks to hang up wet towels. (There was one dresser in the bedroom but it was full of extra sheets and towels.) A shelf in the bathroom would have been nice. Loud construction next door and out back made it difficult to enjoy coffee on the patio or sleep. Easy 10 min walk to free shuttle was nice."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this stay! Gorgeous view of the mountains surrounding Steamboat Springs. Affordable for the area. We will definitely stay again if we visit again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks for the stay! Perfect for a quick weekend getaway.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice, clean, and cozy! Perfect place for 2. Really close to the resort and downtown. I would definitely stay again"
2023-09-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The location of this property is great, but it could use some serious TLC. The condo was dirty upon arrival (dusty and food on the floor). The pictures in the listing are old as everything inside is very beat up (furniture/walls). The kitchen sink had food in it and the bathroom sink would not drain properly. We also had dirty linens. Also beware of the construction for exterior structural issues that are ongoing if you missed in the listing. Mathew is a very communicative host but this property needs work."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Matthew's place was exactly as described. Very clean and stocked with everything needed. Easy to find and enter. Beautiful view and a great price.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was absolutely gorgeous, tucked in the hills with a fantastic sunrise and sunset! The neighborhood was safe, peaceful and the drivers were very aware of the pedestrians - Which was great because we walked to a neighborhood Bistro for dinner one night! The space itself was smaller than we thought but it was extremely clean AND it had everything we needed. It was described perfectly so we knew there wasn't an oven or a full fridge, etc. but it was enough for what we needed. No surprises. The bed was super comfortable and the linens felt fresh and lovely after our long days of hiking in the nearby areas. The town of Steamboat Springs is a wonderful place filled with shopping and delicious food AND it was easy to navigate. We felt like we lived there after only four short days. A fantastic location, a fantastic experience and a great host!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A quaint little spot for our couple of days hiking and explore the area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely and no frills stay with an an unforgettable view.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I would recommend this condo and host to other travelers. If I am back in Steamboat Springs, I would look for this Air B & B again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is scenic and perfect for a getaway! The only issue we ran into was that there’s no dedicated closet space - being in town for a wedding made fancy clothes a bit more challenging.
Other than that, this place is phenomenal!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would gladly stay again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Steamboat for a wedding and this was the perfect mountain spot. It was a quick drive into town and the views were beautiful. It's a cozy space, but for 2 people and one being 6'4"" we found the space easy to navigate and comfortable to relax in."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for your weekend getaway! The view on the porch is incredible, great place for a morning cup of coffee! It was a great place to come back to relax after a day of adventuring!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Post very accurately describes this cozy nook. In order to enjoy Steamboat you do need a car. I would suggest brining a knife and cutting board (and a can opener) if you intend on utilizing the kitchen as there isn’t one provided. However kitchen is very clean and functional for its size. Parking is easy and we throughly enjoyed our stay. Thanks!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy little place. I liked that it was a bit further away from the rest of the condos, you felt more secluded."

Bonus: have a breakfast, lunch or dinner in the balcony enjoying the city view is something that you can't miss from this house., no matter the season. 100% recommended."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew was very responsive and the place was great. The location is amazing- beautiful views of the town below, and views of the mountains from all sides. Waking up here was a dream. The only issue we experienced was that the blinds on the front window were broken and stuck in the down position, so we didn’t get to enjoy the view as much as we would have if they were able to go up. It was a really sweet spot though! Thanks Matthew"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Matthew was very responsive to our questions and made sure everything was taken care of for our stay.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mathew’s Cozy mountainside nook was perfect for my girlfriend and I. We had everything we needed for our weekend in Steamboat. The bus system was so easy to use, just a 8 min walk to the stop and it ran frequently. Highly recommend to anyone coming to ski."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot! Loved the location. Only thing that we wished we had was a full kitchen. We were there during a storm and couldn’t cook in the kitchen at all. Other than that it was good!
2022-12-01,2,Stayed one night,"The professional photos on listing hide the true condition.
In reality, the windows are moldy from constant condensation. The shower is also moldy.
Multiple areas are damaged - the towel hanger on bathroom door had been ripped off leaving a hole in the door. There was also a cabinet door falling off the bedroom dresser. Several baseboards with hunks missing.
The place needs some maintenance if the pictures are going to show a pristine condo."

It had every little thing we needed to be comfortable for a quick getaway. And for being a small place, having a TV in the bedroom as well as the living area is a nice perk, especially when you're tired from adventuring all day and just want to cozy up in bed and watch a movie.

2022-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"The Nook was a good place to spend the night in between ski days. As mentioned in the description, it's outfitted like a hotel room, and was comfortable and functional in that regard. We appreciated the Netflix on the TV, the tea selection, and the blankets on the couch after a long day of skiing! The views from the top floor are spectacular, and it's just a short drive to the hill. There are quiet hours for the building which keeps things very calm, but you may wish to bring earplugs in case a neighbour comes home late."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trudy's Crooked House was definitely the Steamboat getaway of our dreams. We'd definitely like to visit again the next time we are in town. The location is walkable to Steamboat's downtown attractions which allowed us to enjoy the Yampa River views on our way to coffee, meals, and more.
Trudy was an exceptional host, allowing us to settle right in. Her home is intentionally set up with cookware, linens, games, etc. Trudy's care for the property and her guests were evident.
If you are looking for a relaxing corner of Steamboat, look no further. :)
Many thanks again, Trudy."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,enjoyed our stay in the crooked house!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A peaceful retreat right downtown! We loved everything about this place. A beautiful location tucked in the trees. The hoot of the owl at night, as you drift asleep. The bunnies bounding through the snow in the morning while you drink your coffee. Each room has its own solar patterns. Sitting comfortable in the south facing sun, in the living room in the morning, and hanging at the dinner table, playing cards, with western sunshine during the evening. The night time walks along the river are practically right out the front door. The details inside the house reflect the thoughtfulness of the owner. Trudy makes you feel like a guest and an old friend. We won’t stay anywhere else when we come to Steamboat!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trudy’s place has a lot of charm and was perfect for our stay. It was walkable to restaurants and the town centre.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay and are highly recommending Trudy and her crooked house."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Trudy’s Crooked House. It is in a quiet neighborhood on the end of downtown Steamboat Springs near the Yampa River walk.
The house has character and charm. Trudy is a wonderful host and gave us great recommendations about things to do and see. The skiing was fantastic. Looking forward to our next trip to Steamboat Springs"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was a lovely cottage! Close to all amenities, downtown, shuttle was a few blocks walk. Trudy is very passionate about her home and ensured to give a full in person tour of the house upon check in. We had a large SUV which made parking in the snowy driveway a little challenging. Make sure you understand parking location and plow days as these weren’t listed in the binder and we had a little mix up. Overall a great place to stay, was very warm for cold winter snowy days!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful place that feels private but is right near everything. Loved the crooked house!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trudy was very responsive and friendly. The house was just as described, pretty crooked lol. But it was nice for a weekend getaway with lots of snow, felt like a cozy cabin in the woods. Trudy met us there to check in and was very thorough in explaining all the quirks of the house and showing us where everything was. Overall it was a great experience and I would stay there again"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trudy’s cottage was just what we needed for our stay. Cute place, comfortable, clean, with amenities like a full kitchen, washer, dryer, and a gas heater in the cozy living room. Great water pressure and very hot water after long days in the snow were perfect. Trudy was very friendly and helpful. It snowed tons while we were here and the plowers and neighbors helped us with car issues. Trudy was here shoveling snow herself!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Crooked Cabin. It’s such a cute, wintry spot. Very close to downtown and minutes from the Blackmer trail up the road in the neighborhood. Trudy was so helpful and responsive, meeting me to get into the house and do a walkthrough to get the ins and outs of the quirky cabin. Truly the most friendly host we’ve ever had on AirBnB! We hope to be back soon!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Excellent house! Minutes to the slopes, yet very private and quiet. House has everything you need and is very cozy and warm. Trudy was very responsive. Would definitely stay again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There just isn’t enough I can say about our stay. First, the location can’t be beat. Just a minutes walk into downtown, yet so quiet and peaceful you feel like you’re out in the ranch lands. Secondly, this is such a unique experience! This little house was once a mining cabin and you can see how it has evolved over the years into the quirky, quaint gem that it is. Trudy met us personally to let us in and explain all the nuances of the home. There is no AC, but we were there during a heat wave and had no issues as the home is quite shaded and we left the windows open at night and closed during the day and we’re completely comfortable. I will definitely be crossing my fingers that this little house is available on our next trip to Steamboat!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location and great place to stay. Trudy was very helpful with recommendations.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We hand a lovely time staying at the Crooked house. The listing for the home is accurate, which is very charming and feels cozy, similar vibes to staying at a relative’s mountain cabin. The home, located at the end of a street, is surrounded by trees and is very tranquil. If you’re looking for a peaceful getaway, then check out the Crooked House."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trudy is a wonderful and informative host, she provides a great introduction to the area and offers maps and area magazines to reference.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect last minute get away! The Crooked House was perfect. The grounds are beautiful for a quiet evening or breakfast on the porch. When you're ready to get out on the river or enjoy the town of Steamboat this location is perfect for a short walk or easy bike ride into the heart of town and Howelsen Hill. The house is fully equipped with options to cook and relax at the house with all the comforts of home.
Thank you Trudy, We will be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The place is great to stay and relax. Located in a quiet neighborhood, yet close enough to downtown and restaurants that you can walk. Trudy also is amazing!!!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Trudy’s! It’s spacious, good parking, basic cooking necessities, and lots of blankets and towels. It’s a short drive to downtown steamboat. Trudy is friendly and a great host. One thing to note is check-in restrictions- check-in is a direct key handoff and is requested to occur before 8 pm, so keep that in mind as Steamboat can have flight delays. Would stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trudy's cabin is all as described and more! The setting is lovely and quiet. The cabin is lovely, cozy, immaculately clean and well furnished. And wonder of wonders, the kitchen is well-equipped (we cooked four breakfasts and dinners). All in all, Trudy's cabin was our best Airbnb experience to date."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at the Crooked House. Cozy, inviting, plenty of space and a well-stocked kitchen. Older house with its quirks, but in a charming way! Stayed plenty warm. Loved meeting Trudy and she took care of all our needs!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Trudy's Crooked House really is squeaky clean! It was a charming place to stay. I loved the soft towels in the bathroom and Trudy's offer of extra towels to take to the hot springs. Trudy was very responsive! Would love to stay again!

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay at The Crooked House. Very clean and cozy, great location just off the Main Street a little bit- in a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Trudy was very helpful and responsive. And the value for the place was pretty great, the most affordable option I found by far. My only complaint is that we were a little cold on our first night, it got down to 15 degrees outside and it seemed like the house was having a hard time heating up. I also found the bed and pillows to be too firm and a little uncomfortable, so if we stayed again I’d just bring our own pillows maybe. But with that said I would still absolutely recommend this place, we had a great stay overall."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great time staying at the Crooked House! It was very easy to walk into downtown and close to lots of great restaurants. The house was very cute, comfortable, and clean. Trudy was kind and helpful. We look forward to staying again in the future!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I felt right at home in the Crooked House. She had >4+ foot of snow and we stayed warm and cozy. Just a hop over to town with tons of food/shopping options in town. We hope to visit the Crooked House again next time we are in Colorado Springs.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Trudy's place! It's an adorable little house close to town (about an 8-minute walk). We skied 3 feet of fresh powder during the day, had fast wifi when we had to work, and had a great time exploring the downtown restaurants and Strawberry hot springs.
Trudy was an excellent communicator, providing directions and check-in instructions, and met us at the house to explain the heaters when we arrived. It is an older house so some rooms are warmer than others, but we were plenty toasty even when it was in the negative temps outside.
We ended up driving to the mountain (again, negative temps) but there's also a shuttle from town that seemed quite easy. Steamboat is amazing, I can't wait to return!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trudy's cottage is in a peaceful, wonderful setting in a quiet part of town, but close enough to walk to shops and restaurants -- or just stroll along the terrific Yampa River walk. We loved our stay there! It had everything we needed, it was clean as a whistle, it's an adorable one-of-a-kind cottage, and Trudy is such a welcoming and helpful host. We're looking very forward to staying here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, fine, quiet location, and everything we needed! We will come again when we go to Steamboat Springs."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a charming rustic down to earth place within a short walk of downtown steamboat, then this is the place for you. Trudy is a very thoughtful and responsive host. We could not recommend the Crooked House more highly."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I came to Steamboat to visit relatives who had a full house. Trudy’s rental was a perfect choice! It was within walking distance and it was a place of peace.
The house was extremely clean and well organized. The “crooked” nature of an older home was comforting. I especially enjoyed the outdoor seating area for reading and coffee in the morning. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was large enough for more than one person to work.
An added benefit was that this house is close to the public library which gives temporary library cards to visitors of Steamboat. It is also very close to entrance to the core trail.
I would absolutely consider returning here during another summer visit."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This sweet little house was perfect for a romantic get away. The house was clean, comfortable, and walking distance to everything old town had to offer. My partner who is 6’1” had no issues with the ceiling height. We adored the large kitchen, comfy bed, and kind host. We will be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin house is nicely located within walking distance from a walking/biking trail along the Yampa River which also connects to the main section of town with restaurants and shops. It is nicely located in a private area that is accessed by a private road.
Although it is close to town, it is far enough away in a private, relatively quiet area, and decorated with interesting art and plant arrangements
Trudy is a great host. She met with us when we arrived and walked us through the house explaining how everything works and she was available if needed. She maintains the house impeccably."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is wonderful- walkable to downtown restaurants and shops, yet quiet. The kitchen is well equipped. We cooked and found everything we needed"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this cute house. Trudy does a great job of welcoming us to Steamboat and the Crooked House. The house stayed perfectly warm the whole time, and was a great place to rest in between runs on the slopes."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful clean house with character walking distance from downtown & the bus stop to the mountain! Great to escape condo life in Steamboat!

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place to stay for the ultimate mountain get away! The proximity to town and the ski resort it perfect yet its also far enough away you get some peace and quit.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trudy was a great host, giving us a lovely tour of the house so we knew all that we needed to make the best of our stay in the quirky little crooked house. If you are any more than 5'9"" you might have to watch your head and be careful when putting your hands above your head. The house was clean and cozy, like visiting your own family."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as expected. Wonderfully convenient location and the house was perfect for my daughter and I on our ski trip. It's nice to have Trudy meet you at and walk you through the openly quirky house. It's fun, and the ""crookedness"" never got in the way of having a great time. Kitchen is well appointed when you want to cook, and downtown is only minutes away. If you're considering it, just book it."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a very special cabin in an amazing location. If you appreciate staying in a little piece of history and don’t mind the small quirks that can come with that, then you will absolutely love this place. It would be advisable to be under 6’ to optimize your comfort level, as the ceilings are quite low in the bedroom. We did not rent a car and everything was accessible to us, as long as you don’t mind a beautiful walk to any location you might want to visit, including tons of restaurants, shopping , skiing. Howelsen ski area is an amazing centerpiece of Old Town Steamboat and a fun skiing experience with the added bonus of Ski Free Sunday’s during ski season. If you want to experience Steamboat’s big ski area, it is a short Free bus ride away with a bus stop just down the hill from the cabin. The CORE river trail runs along the Yampa River, also just down the hill, and makes everything easily accessible if you like to walk and take in the beauty Steamboat offers.
Trudy is absolutely the type of host we love…personable, easy to reach, so accommodating and helpful. Quite a gem! The kitchen is well stocked with anything you might need. The house stayed cozy even in 0 degree weather. Also, the bath towels are worth a mention, wonderfully luxurious.
If what you are looking for a resort style experience in Steamboat Springs, this is definitely not going be a good fit. If you appreciate experiencing the true feel of being in an historic western Colorado mountain town, then you will find it here."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The crooked house is a cozy, private getaway, we loved it! The pictures are spot on, as is Trudy's attention to detail, open communication, and desire for her guests to enjoy their stay. Word to the wise, if you sleep in late and are light sensitive, don't forget to pack your sleeping mask! The morning sun lights up the bedroom. If you are over 6' 2"", you will need to watch your head in the bedroom, but you'll be fine in all other areas. We would definitely stay again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Wonderful rustic location. Really great host.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For the price, 5 stars. This is an old cabin with some older appliances and no dishwasher. But it had a lot of charm. Quiet neighborhood. Great location. Trudy was very helpful and responsive. Great water pressure in the shower. Firm bed. No a.c., but plenty of fans and being in the mountains, the nights cool off. We live in Denver and just recently discovered Steamboat and live it. We visited in mid-July and the wild flowers were great. We just just finished visiting in September and enjoyed fall colors.. Really enjoyed the Steamboat botanical gardens, Fish Creek Falls hike and Lake Dumont and Rabbit Ears Pass. We went to Wynonas for breakfast and lunch and enjoyed both."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very cozy comfortable cabin. Easy walking distance to town. Trudy is a great host, friendly, responsive and easy to communicate with. There is great space outside as well for relaxing.

Patio and yard are great, especially in summer. Location is wonderful - walk to downtown, riverfront, bike rides and hikes right from your front door. Bed was very comfy, shower great and plenty of hot water, kitchen well stocked and wi-fi worked great to keep up with work for a few hours every day. TV is just basic cable. Bring something if you like to steam your favorite shows. Or don't. We didn't and did not miss it at all. Communication with owner is fast and good. This will be our go-to for future Steamboat trips!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trudy's ""Crooked House"" is the perfect place for a quiet get-away. She is a thoughtful, considerate, and communicative hostess with a clean and comfortable cabin. I would definitely book with her again."

Highly recommended !"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay here and it was just as nice as the first time. Very clean and comfy cabin, really nice decorations, comfortable furniture and bedding.

2020-12-01,4,Stayed over a week,The crooked house is super cozy and a fabulous location. Super clean. I struggled with regulating the heat in the cold. All wheel drive to get to driveway is helpful with snow. Many uneven walkways so be aware if you have any mobility issues.

Plus, her home is within walking distance of Main Street which made it a breeze to enjoy Steamboat’s night life.
We also love that she has a private yard with patio furniture to enjoy during the day. We loved that we had the option of going out and or staying in and making our own meals. Great place and host!!!"

Can't beat having a washer and dryer on site after skiing!"

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay! The description is accurate, it is indeed a ""crooked"" house, with no right angle and floors not entirely level. However, the place is charming, clean, pretty, and a great location. It was nice to have a full house in a very quiet neighborhood in a convenient location away from all the condos and traffic.

2019-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The Crooked House is a very special house in a great location. If you like luxury, level floors, or need a place close to Steamboat Ski area this is not the place for you. If you like authentic, rustic, charming spaces this IS the house for you! It is easy walking distance to downtown, Howelsen Hill, and Colorado Mountain College. This house is cozy and quiet - there is a home run daycare close by so you can hear the children playing outside in the afternoons which is delightful. We were there in winter and a gas fireplace, some baseboard heating, and a couple of space heaters kept the house plenty warm. There are also lots of cozy blankets and fluffy towels to help you feel extra comfy. Very nice shower with plenty of hot water. All of the kitchen appliances, utensils, pots/pans, dishes, etc. you need. Nice laundry room with washer and dyer (soap and dryer sheets included) which is very convenient. The ceilings are low so if you are much taller than 6' you might feel a little cramped.
The host, Trudy, left us some homemade soup and other snacks in the fridge - so nice! Trudy knows SB well so can provide local tips. We really love this little house and hope to stay there on all of our visits to SB!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is in such a good spot. I was there for skiing and a music festival and the bus was really easy to take to the mountain, the music festival was within walking distance. The hot tub was a really nice perk after a day of skiing. The kitchen has everything you need if you wanted to cook for yourself and there’s a cute little coffee shop and market close by. I would recommend this spot if you visit Steamboat!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect stay! It was everything we needed
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable condo conveniently located near the free shuttle to the ski area. Great size for two people. Drew was very responsive to our communications.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, good location, nice cozy spot.
Bring earplugs if noise sensitive - like most wooden condo buildings form the era, you can hear neighbors upstairs walking.
Also lighting is really good for people like bright white lightbulbs / lighting, for mellower light if staying in BYOBulbs lol :)
But the host was responsive and got info back quickly, comfy bed, decent kitchen to cook with - byo oil and condiments etc, it’s more a proper vacation rental condo than someone’s home."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location on two free bus routes to Steamboat Ski Resort or town, about a 10 minute ride to the slopes. The condo had everything we needed for our stay."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay with Drew. The condo is very close to the mountain with a shuttle stop just outside of the condo buildings. It’s also easy to get downtown with the free buses. We loved having the gas fireplace which had a nice ambience. The kitchen was well stocked and it was nice to have a sharp chefs night which made prepping meals easy. Drew was very quick and responsive with communication.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect spot to stay if you're skiing Steamboat. It is very accessible to get around Steamboat without a car. There is a bus stop right in front of the condo - whether you're busing to downtown to visit the shops, and restaurants or taking the bus to the mountain. The condo was very clean and perfect for what we needed. Hot tub was amazing after long days of skiing the mountain. I'd highly recommend this condo to anyone considering."

There’s grocery stores and restaurants nearby as well. The condo was extremely clean and had everything we needed for our stay. Super easy check in and out with the key code on the door and clear instructions from the host. There’s a hot tub right outside the sliding doors, it was super convenient to walk out the back doors and relax in the hot tub at the end of the day. The kitchen had all the kitchenware we needed to cook (pots/pans, dishes, spatula, baking sheet, wine opener, mixing bowls, strainer, etc), cable tv in the living room (the couch has comfy recliners), Wi-Fi, washer and dryer, bathroom was stocked with anything we’d need during our stay (towels, shampoo/conditioner/body wash, hair dryer, etc), keurig for coffee. We slept well and enjoyed our stay! I appreciated the guide from the host with instructions on how to work the appliances and local recommendations."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Sam and Courtney’s condo! We were there for a quick one-night trip but wish we could’ve stayed longer to enjoy the place even more.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Sam and Courtney have a great place! Close to the amenities of the ski resort as well as downtown Steamboat Springs. Sam and Courtney were super flexible and communicative when I requested an early check-in to accommodate some of my plans. It is always great to have hosts who go the extra mile when you’re on the road for a long time.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Convenient location, friendly and responsive hosts, the unit was comfortable and clean. Recommended hosts and property."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great condo, we had a lovely stay."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is a very reasonable 1bed/1bath place to crash while visiting Steamboat. It is a convenient location outside of town on the south side (for a summer stay). The unit is a bit dated, but reasonably appointed with all of the basics. Sam and Courtney were very responsive, and their directions/instructions were very clear and easy to understand. One of the units near to us was going through some repairs or remodeling during our stay, which is obviously outside of Sam and Courtney's control, but it did lessen our ability to enjoy the unit somewhat. No AC, which isn't unusual for the mountains, but it was pretty warm in the evenings."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"It wasn’t anything special, lighting wasn’t great, no AC (however they did provide a fan that did the job), basic amenities but truly it was all we needed for a one night stay. All we needed was a bed and it was extremely comfortable! It was one of the cheaper options and definitely worth it. Sam & Courtney provided great check in and check out instructions, great communication."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Solid spot to stay for a few days in Steamboat. It was easy to find and directions for checkin and checkout were easy to follow.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It kind of felt like a hotel rather than homey and inviting. Hot tub was closed when we were there. Quiet, peaceful area within walking distance of great spots. Very clean. Overall pretty good stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable space with easy access to various places throughout Steamboat. The place was as described and very clean.
Sam and Courtney were extremely responsive and excellent communicators.
Would definitely recommend this place."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Convenient and affordable spot for an impromptu weekend trip. Scrupulously clean. Kinda wish I'd stayed for a few more nights- next time!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Sam and Courtney’s. It was a cute place in a quiet area. We got a deal on the price and we’re very happy and comfortable.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best place to stay in Steamboat for a couple! Super relaxing stay and the best amenities! Great affordable price! Me and my husband were celebrating our one year anniversary, and were looking for an affordable option and close to strawberry spring. This was the perfect home for that and included a jacuzzi 5 steps away! 5 to 10 minute drive to anything and many things to do! Also included laundry and tv! Greatly recommend!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent spot for a quick weekend getaway!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We’ve stayed at a few airbnbs, and this is by far the cleanest one! It was easy to find, super cute, quiet, and there’s a bus stop for the local free bus in the parking lot so being able to go to down town was a breeze! They were super helpful and insightful with their messages that I didn’t need to ask any questions during my stay! It was the best experience I’ve had with airbnb."
2023-05-01,3,Stayed one night,"Great location, thank you!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing

2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Sam and Courtney were great hosts and their place was perfect! They were immediately responsive, place was clean, and a great location for skiing. The only hiccup was that the ski locker was full of stuff so couldn’t be used. I would definitely stay here again but give them a heads up at booking if you need the locker."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sam & Courtney’s listing was cozy, convenient, and very clean. If you are looking for a nice place to rest after a day on the mountain, look no further!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for easy access to the mountains and downtown. Would 100% recommend staying here!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, a convenient location for a ski trip and Courtney and Sam were great hosts and responsive to our messages. We appreciated the coffee in the mornings, the fireplace, & the cozy bed.
A few things were a bit different than we expected. The condo, while renovated, is a bit older, and located on the lowest level (a sort of half-basement space). For anyone out there with a sensitive sense of smell, there were a few things that bothered me a little, but the hosts offered to let us burn a candle to help with the odors.
There was about 5 feet of snow everywhere in Steamboat, so we couldn’t really access the hot tub from the back porch and had to walk a longer way around. Also the hot tub in the photo is the hot tub located near a different condo building closer to the entrance (the one out back is much older, has some cracks and is uncovered).
The melting snow created a lot of ice covering the majority of the parking lot, so be sure to wear appropriate foot-ware for getting around!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Super nice hosts and cute place ! Super clean and cozy :)

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"absolutely perfect for a pair or couple who wants close access to the slopes. used the bus shuttle to get to the mountain so i didn’t have to pay for parking, which was an underrated and amazing thing!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for a couple ski vacation! Comfy bed, well equipped apartment for eating meals at home. Short walk to the bus for easy access to the ski area."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was comfortable, well kept up and our favorite part was how close it is to the ski resort. Thank you for providing such a great place to stay and being such great hosts!!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much!
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place. No kleenex in the condo, not a big deal, but expected there to be some. Hot tub is old and cracked, needs to be replaced.

2022-12-01,3,Stayed one night,"The tacked on expenses were unexpected and disappointing. What was listed as $87 a night ended up totaling over $200. It was as if we were expected to clean after our visit when housekeepers clearly are paid to do so. The blankets on the bed were not clean, as there was clearly stains of bodily fluid, crusty bits, whatever you’d like to call that…..The towels smelled like mildew and were not completely dry. The dishes in the cabinets were not clean. Other than that, it was fine I suppose."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very friendly hosts and an amazing first air bnb. Would highly recommend and come back here again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! 5-min from downtown and 20-min from Strawberry hot springs.

2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great place to crash and it's nice it's only 8 minutes from downtown. Cable was difficult to figure out, couldn't find NBC to watch the football game. Very clean. Comfortable couch. Nice neighborhood. Well functioning Kurig for a good cup of coffee with kcups stocked. Spent the evening at 8th Street Steakhouse with a great crew on a slow night. Ultimately, made me feel at home in Steamboat! Thanks!"
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and well organized.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The condo is as described and was perfect for me. It is very clean and fully furnished. Directions to get into the unit were excellent. A Safeway is about a half mile away (a convenience store is a little closer) and there's a sidewalk to it, but the best feature of this listing to me, by far, is the bus system in Steamboat Springs. Park your car and use the bus, which runs every 20 minutes to downtown. There's a bus stop adjacent to the complex. Everyone uses it and it's free. My compliments to the town on this system. I'm probably an oddity but I love public transit and this is a great system. You don't need to pay a premium to be closer to town unless you're above riding a bus."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little condo that has everything you need for a landing pad for adventures around steamboat. Hosts were super quick with communication, which was great.

2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was nice, over all. You can definitely hear people walking around in the unit above, and it is pretty loud. The pool is right outside the glass door/bed room window of this unit so if anyone is at the pool, you can definitely hear them. It was a fine place to stay for a night or 2. Didn’t blow us away, but it was ok."

2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"lovely location, very clean, equipped with everything you may need during your stay. on the down side you may need a chiropractor after sleeping on that bed, there is no ac so sleeping with the windows open is your only option which only brings in bugs and there is no deadbolt on the door to insure safety other than the keypad lock."

Loved the gas fireplace, big TV and cable services - perfect for apres ski and storm days. The furniture is nice and the bed is super-comfortable! The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and eat our meals in. Plenty of paper and cleaning products, extra towels, blankets, pillows, etc. Lots of storage space for skis and gear. This is a classic high-occupancy ski condo in a high-density complex - Sam and Courtney have added lots of little touches to make it as nice as possible. Unfortunately, the hot tub was closed for maintenance while we were there, but that is beyond their control. Easy check in and good communication with hosts."

It wasn’t close enough to the base of the ski area for us to walk in our ski boots - but the shuttle was right there and easy to use.
Overall a great stay!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for having us!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place is cozy located about 4 miles from Steamboat Springs ski resort and 25 miles from Hayden airport. A car is needed to reach the ski resort. Yellow line bus was not running. The kitchen was well equipped to cook my own meals. Microwave is on top of the fridge which made it difficult to use. The bathroom was clean and nice. All bathroom supplies were included. The bedroom sleeps two. The king bed was firm and uncomfortable. The pillows were clean but uncomfortable. You can hear the upstairs neighbors and next door neighbors. There are many clocks in the condo. The heater worked to keep the place warm. The furniture and rugs felt dated. TV has Netflix and Hulu. The view outside the balcony is beautiful.
The items I feel need attention. The refrigerator makes loud knocking noises. Check in instructions were not provided by 4pm. The microwave is too high to use conveniently."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very cozy condo and such a beautiful view! This place was absolutely darling inside, and the location was perfect for our trip."

The kitchen, living room, and dining room are very spacious and comfortable. The bedroom is small yet efficient. Having a washer and dryer in the unit was a nice convenience. Kitchen and bathroom were well stocked with the essentials. We hope to stay again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was great! Very nice and very cosy. It really felt homey with lots of personal touches and extra things for you to use. I feel like a lot of airbnb is getting very corporate business now and this place did not at all! Great experience great place!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Steamboat Springs, CO, hosted by Kelly and Clyde, was nothing short of wonderful!

Note: if you're planning to get around Steamboat on bike (like I did), the place is at the top of a big hill, so it's a good workout everyday!"

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lively place
No place to put unpacked clothing.
Liked the king size bed"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This a beautifully decorated apartment with great access to downtown Steamboat and local trails. The hosts went to great lengths to include anything you might need for your stay. The only challenge is there is no AC and the unit gets all the afternoon sun. Fans were provided but they are very loud. The unit lighting is all very soft, which feels dark since the shades stay closed because of the sun. It is also the case that every corner is filled so you either move things around or live out of your suitcase. We like to have a few empty drawers when we travel and no luck with this unit. These are very picky comments. Please know that we enjoyed our stay. But if you like a bright, spacious unit with room to sit outside in the afternoon, this may not be your choice."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved the Dreamboat for our little getaway! It was clean, adorably decorated and walkable to all the amazing restaurants and shops! We really enjoyed our time! Thanks again!"

The condo is in a quiet building, away from the fray of downtown or the base of the hill.

We loved staying here, and hope to stay again in the future!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay. Perfect location between the mountain and downtown. Easy to access restaurants and bars downtown and a short drive to the slopes but far enough removed for a peaceful and relaxed stay. Felt like a home from home, Kelly and Clyde were super responsive, friendly and full of local tips. Will be sure to stay again when we next visit Steamboat!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, situated close to downtown and to the ski resort. Unit was as advertised in the listing and pictures and had everything we wanted during our stay. Would recommend to anyone looking for a place in Steamboat!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is welcoming from the moment you walk through the door. The kitchen comes with everything you need and all the things you don't know you need until you look for them. Love the chalk board in the kitchen that gives hints about the town! The sofa is super-comfortable (fell asleep on it once or twice) and the views are just awesome. The bed...super comfortable and feels just like home.
Can't wait to come back in the summer and spend the days hiking!
Thanks Kelly and Clyde!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect rental! Would stay here again!

Hosts were always very responsive/great communication. Great recommendations for meals and things to do. Great value."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Kelly and Clyde’s condo for a long weekend and we absolutely loved the place. Very comfortable bed, well stocked kitchen, and within close distance of everything we wanted to do. Definitely book here, we’d love to return!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was the perfect home base for our fall foliage adventures in Steamboat. It was close enough to walk into town (bring a headlamp!) but still felt like a cozy get-away. Kelly and Clyde were very helpful with their recommendations. Would definitely come back!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient town access & on a bike you or with a car you can reach all the popular trailheads. Older condo/apartment complex, but the unit itself was nicely updated with the essentials needed for a full stay in Steamboat Springs. You can feel like a local without actually being one. Seemed a really good value for what we got."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is THE place to stay for a comfortable, stylish, and relaxing trip to Steamboat. The space was beautifully designed and had every amenity and more! The location is excellent with partial mountain views. A short distance to town, ski are, fish falls, and Buffalo pass. You will not be disappointed in this home!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steamboat is surprisingly hard to find a cool, modern, and stylish place to stay. My wife and I love doing mini-trips around Colorado (our home state), but we always look for really cool and stylish places. I have always loved Steamboat, but never taken my wife there.
When I found Kelly and Clyde’s spot I knew that we had to book it. The spot was awesome and lived up to expectations. Great location, super stylish, and very very comfortable.
Also, they are incredibly nice and helpful hosts. I loved everything about it. We plan to stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Out of all the Air b&bs I’ve stayed in, this one has to be my favorite.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place & location!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing condo that was much larger than what I was expecting from the pictures. The unit was very clean and well decorated. Beautiful remodeled kitchen that was fully stocked if you wanted to cook in. The bed was really comfortable as well. Having a washer and dryer was definitely a plus after a few days of bike riding. Large walk in shower with great water pressure.
The location was perfect for us, close enough to Lincoln Ave to walk but far enough off to get away from car traffic. Dedicated parking on site. The condo property is really easy to find and check in was a breeze.
Great communication from the owners who also provide all the information you need via email as well as hard copies on site. A great location and value. We will definitely stay there again."

It is a 1/2 mile beautiful walk to town so we didnt need a car but there is free rides as well. The decor is perfect and we had everything we needed and more! It was obvious they chose top quality in decor, kitchen appliances, towels and bedding. We even had Netflix for late night winding down! Kelly and Clyde were so great as I had to change my date a couple of times. They responded quickly any time I reached out before and during our stay. Check in and out was so easy. If we come back to Steamboat we will definitely come back “home” to this little Dreamboat!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place with beautiful design! They had everything we could have needed and more
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed stay on the Hilltop. Updated place in an older, well kept building.

Condo is well set-up with great attention to guest details. Well done. Highly recommend."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at this wonderful condo during our recent trip to Steamboat. We had a wonderful time and Kelly and Clyde truly thought of everything. We have never stayed at an Airbnb with more amenities. We will absolutely be back!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is perfect, from decorations to comfort. We felt like we were at home, everything you can think you might need, they have supplied. The condo is well laid out, the furnishings are beautiful and comfortable. The patio is a nice place to sit and relax. The condo is a little walk from town, uphill on way back, but totally doable in great weather. This is an older building so, of course, you can hear some noise from the unit above, but nothing that would make me hesitate to stay here. Communication with Kelly and Clyde was easy and prompt. We will definitely rent this condo again. Thank you for the beautiful stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here! Only a couple minute drive to downtown steamboat, the house was comfortable, clean and updated. Would recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Kelly and Clyde’s place over Memorial Day weekend. They were very helpful - checking in and making sure we had everything we needed. The condo was decorated beautifully. I loved all of the extra touches such as the cookbooks, the chalkboard with suggestions of restaurants and things to do, and the extra toiletries and vanity items in the bathroom. The location was very central to where we wanted to be and loved that you could easily walk into town. Would definitely recommend this place to others!"

2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great and stylish place! The hosts provide everything you need, including extra towels and blankets, toiletries, and all of the cooking and coffee accoutrements you could think of! Mattress feels a little old but still comfortable enough. There was quite a bit of early morning noise from the units above us, but overall a quiet and comfortable stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly & Clyde's place was the perfect spot for our little weekend away in Steamboat for Mother's Day. The space is beautiful, stylish and so comfortable! We had exactly what we needed and then some during our stay. They really thought of everything. Quick drive or 15ish minute walk to downtown. Can't wait to come back during ski season!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home and hosts.
Upstairs a little noisy, but nothing the host can control. Otherwise perfect."

It's located just a few minutes from town, and only about a 15-minute drive from Strawberry Park Hot Springs where we spent the weekend soaking our worries away. The apartment itself is warm, cozy and has all the essentials needed for a getaway trip—from comfy bedding to a fully-stocked kitchen to a luxe shower with extra beauty & skincare products in case you forgot to pack yours. Kelly and Clyde also shared local hotspots with us ahead of our trip, so we could plan out our days. We will 100% be back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Kelly & Clyde’s place! It was cozy, comfortable, well-styled, and equipped with everything we needed. We were able to feel totally at home!

2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little place conveniently located near the mountain and town. Great decoration. Kelly and Clyde also had great communication. However if you are a light sleeper or go to bed early (like I do) beware the noise from above is very loud. Can hear everything. I did make Kelly aware of this and they communicated the issue to the neighbor. One night they were quite, rest not so much."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for a Never Summer backcountry trip. Super easy to find, very clean, and fast communication with hosts. You wont be disappointed!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is lovely, with all kinds of thoughtful amenities and a truly stocked kitchen. We loved staying here. We were conviently located near town and the ski resort. The decor is fun and cozy. After a long day of skiing we enjoyed curling up on the couch and watching some of our favorite TV shows. I highly recommend this place. We hope to be back again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Kelly and Clyde's place was a perfect home base for skiing and experiencing Steamboat. Just a short ride to the mountain and even shorter ride to town. They have clearly put a lot of work into making the place super nice and comfortable with plenty of everything you need.
Although you can get around from this place with public transport, we are definitely glad we rented a car as it just gives you the freedom to get to the mountain and town super fast and on your own time.
Overall great trip and would highly recommend this place to stay!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place for our ski trip. The location is only about 10 minutes from Steamboat Resort and close to all the shops and restaurants that we visited. There is a hot springs right down the road that made a relaxing night after a day of skiing. Defiantly can recommend for anyone wanting to visit Steamboat Springs
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved Kelly and Clyde’s beautiful condo. Everything from the decor to the furniture was very well thought out. I myself am a sucker for interior design and this was by far the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at in regards to that. You could really see the attention to detail they put into the place and the thought that went into everything. We absolutely loved it and felt like we could full unplug and rewind. The sofa was extremely welcoming and we loved coming back to it each day to relax after adventuring around all day. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook delicious meals in. The best part was that we were able to eat most our meals in and not feel like we were missing out on the atmosphere of a nice restaurant. We truly loved everything about the Dreamboat condo and we are already talking about staying again come summer.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay. Would definitely come back

The bed is so comfortable and we loved the decor. It was in the high 80’s low 90’s and having no AC was not an issue. We put the boxed fan near the screen door to let in the cool mountain air at night and closed the shades during the day. We did 6 hikes with most being about 15 min away. We will definitely stay there again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment you walk in, comfort and style surround you! Kelly’s place is chic and updated with great furnishings and yet it is the kind of space that makes you feel like you’re at home.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this Airbnb so much! I surprised my husband with a getaway for his 40th birthday and this spot made it extra perfect. There were so many special details. It had everything we needed and more and was much quieter than we thought it would be being in a condominium complex. The location was great to being so close to downtown and the hot springs.

Plus the bed is enormous and so comfortable. I look forward to staying here again!"

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly's place is beautifully decorated, very comfortable and good location. I wanted to be close to downtown and this was a quick 10 min walk down the hill to the main street. We found the walk enjoyable especially after our dinners in town. We didn't use the bus system for skiing as we found it easier to drive to the free parking. The parking on site was easy and close proximity to Kelly's place. Her condo has great views and we were able to catch the sunset one night. The walls can be thin but we didn't have a problem with noise as it appears that the neighbors are respectful. If you want to be inspired for design choices definitely stay here, every detail is perfection. Kelly is a great host, very quick with responses."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome space in a great location. Well decorated, comfortable, homey & stocked with all of the necessities from shampoo and conditioner to coffee creamer. Hope to be back on our next trip to steamboat!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Oh my gosh! What can I say? A: Kelly is my spirit animal because I loved every inch of the space. Not just that, but it was also comfortable AND overly stocked with more amenities than I am used to in an AirBNB. We caught rainbow trout and only had to buy a bit of fresh produce and voila, dinner was served! The bed was top notch, and my one complaint about most of my stays is lack of pillows, but Kelly and Clyde had like a billion and we were in heaven. Pull out couch was comfy for our son. Entry was super easy, and communication friendly and thorough. It’s absolutely on our list to stay again. I’ve stayed in a lot of places, and this is by far the best stay we’ve ever had."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My traveling companions and I adored staying at Kelly's place. My friends considered staying at another place that was closer to steamboat, but the aesthetics of Kelly's place ultimately won them over. The kitchen was well stocked with gear and spices, which allowed us to use the kitchen as if we were back home. The bed and couch were comfy, so much so that we didn't have to pull out the sofa bed.
The only thing that would've made my stay more enjoyable was more snow at steamboat."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place is incredibly comfortable- I loved the special touches. The view is amazing & location is great. We had a fantastic time and will want to stay again on our next trip to Steamboat.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place for my wife and I (and 1 year old) to get away for our anniversary. Perfectly decorated to make you feel at home to relax and decompress. Views from the dining/bed room are great throughout the day. We ended up cooking most of our meals as the kitchen is fully equipped, ordered pick up twice (downtown steamboat is 7 min away). We ended up staying an additional night last minute we enjoyed our stay so much. Thanks again, will definitely be coming back!"
2020-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and beautiful space! The bed was really comfortable and the place was a perfect size for me and my husband. Only complaint is that the walls are thin and we could hear the neighbors, as well as kids running upstairs which was shaking the apartment."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was wonderful at the condo. Clean, comfy and well decorated. The big soft bed made it hard to leave each morning. Lovely place to stay."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would stay again
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing condo! Right down the street from all the shops and restaurants and only a short drive to the springs and waterfalls!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome and unique experience! Great hosts!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay in Dave and Sandie’s teepee! The bed was very comfortable and we had everything we needed with the use of their kitchen and guest bathroom. They communicated with us ahead of time to arrange an early check-in and orientation to the property. We felt right at home. They are both very friendly and easy-going. We would love to stay there again. It is also easy to walk to town from their place if you want to avoid downtown parking and the hot springs are less than 10 mins up the road. Fantastic location with amazing views!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay at the tipi! It was the perfect blend of comfort and getting to experience the outdoor beauty of Steamboat Springs. The tipi has electricity, wifi, and a fan for hotter days, and there is a space heater and heated blanket for the cool nights. The views from the deck are spectacular! It's a 7-10 minute walk to all of the restaurants and shops. Dave and Sandie were so kind and very welcoming hosts, and their dog is the sweetest pup! I plan to stay here again anytime I visit Steamboat."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unique and unforgettable accommodation! Very comfortable tipi, and with private bathroom in the house. Sandie and Dave are very nice and accommodating hosts. Would love to come back here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as advertised. Teepee Time is very cosy and offers something different! Sandie and David are very cool, and their shared space and view are amaaaaaazing!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,David and Sandie were some lovely and very welcoming hosts who took their time welcoming us and telling us about the area. The place has everything you need and you are close to both city and nature.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandie and Dave’s teepee is the essence of what this platform should be. The accommodations we’re comfortable and hanging out with Sandie and Dave was one of the highlights of the trip. If you’re looking for a true Steamboat experience, this place is a must."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"was skeptical about staying in a teepee. the pictures and reviews were excellent. pre-arrival communication was fantastic. when I arrived S took me all around the property and showed me the how’s and when’s. it was daytime and hot outside and i was still skeptical. then when it grew dark, all my skepticism vanished. i could have stayed in a cookie cutter condo in town. been there done that. i laid on the bed (on top of the heated mattress pad) and gazed at the stars through the opening at the top of the tent. amazing. then, nature called and i stepped out to use the restroom inside the houses (steps away). when i came back out, i was blown away by the stars. billions of them (it seemed). i could have started a fire in the pit already ready to go 10 feet from the teepee. instead i sat on one of the many supplied chairs and star gazed. got a bit cold and went inside and the teepee was just so comfortable. (heater and fan supplied). stay here. you will be very happy."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time at the Tipi. Sandy and Dave treated us like family. They were so kind and lovely with my child and helped us with everything we needed to be comfortable. We will be back.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed glamping and Sandie's recommenations. Rustic charm - lots of shared space with hosts.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Sandie and Dave made us feel right at home. We loved learning about the tepee<3 it was so fun!! Honorable mention to Sandie for helping orchestrate my whole engagement. They go above and beyond!!! We will be seeing you guys again. Tepee will always have a special place in our hearts
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kindest people ever! Dave and Sandie gave us lots of recommendations and opened their home to us. They showed us how to close the top of the tepee if we wanted it to be a little warmer. Their dog was incredibly friendly too! Now we have forever friends; something special about this unique place! We will be back!
We even spent an evening out together listening to music. So much fun and close to everything."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandie and David were so wonderful . the teepee is comfy and the views are amazing. best star gazing!!!
super fun stay in steamboat!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sandi and Dave were outstanding hosts! Although it rained on us and temperatures dropped we didn’t let it get us down! We stayed dry and there were heated mattress covers on our bed in the Teepee that kept us warm in the evening and early mornings. The laundry and ice house restaurants were a great choice for dinner and the Creekside cafe was excellent for breakfast. Don’t miss out on Strawberry Ponds! Gorgeous and the different temps of pools were just what we needed!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife, two dogs and I really enjoyed our stay! Dogs were able to be safely off leash at end of quiet cul de sac. Great access to path across street and quick walk into town. Sandie and Dave both very friendly, accommodating and welcoming. Would stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sandie & David were so sweet-- the perfect hosts. Super accommodating and friendly. The space is beautiful & only a quick walk to town. Highly recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,best hosts ever! cannot recommend any higher!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent three relaxing nights in Sandie and Dave's Teepee. They were superb hosts, giving us great ideas for sight-seeing, hiking, eating, and shopping. We appreciated having our own private bathroom within the house, and room for groceries in the kitchen refrigerator. Truly a rare opportunity... to sleep under a starry night on a comfy bed in a teepee."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will be back! The teepee was so comfortable. Sandie and David are very personable and kind with sharing their home and suggestions of things to do in Steamboat. I loved my stay there.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a fun experience being in the teepee. We had 4 adults and one dog and were very comfortable!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extraordinary
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David and Sandie are great people providing an awesome opportunity to get away, explore and maybe even make some new friends!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such wonderful hosts. The experience is so wonderful and the views are absolutely unmatched. Got some great tips on places to check out and had some great chats with David and Sandie.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Sandie and David are warm and welcoming and their place is comfortable and clean. Staying in a teepee allows you to sleep under the stars and in the fresh mountain air while being protected from the elements. Their teepee is located just next to their home and the home is tucked away at the top of a hill just on the outskirts of Steamboat Springs. Despite being next door to their home, the teepee provides privacy and quiet. This location gives one access to all the town has to offer as well as to the local hiking, biking trails, and hot springs. This was a perfect summer Airbnb for Colorado!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David and Sandie's and the Tepee were great. We stayed two nights and mountain biked around town. We rode to Emerald Mountain from their place and stopped for lunch downtown on our way back to the tepee. The place is close to Town, we walked to town in the mornings for breakfast. David and Sandie provided recommendations for things throughout Town and even took us to a free concert! It was a pleasure staying with Sandie and David, would do it again in a heartbeat. :)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay in the tent! It was perfect for us and our dog — we got out and about during the day and slept nice and cozy at night. We are really glad that we could do this weekend trip with our dog, and it was also an easy distance to walk back and forth from town. Sandie and David were so welcoming — we had a wonderful time!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an awesome, unique experience for our stay in Steamboat. It was super close to all of the fun things in town, Dave and Sandie were incredibly kind and welcoming, and the teepee was warm and comfy. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an adventure! I left my contacts in so I could look up at the stars through the opening in the top of the tepee. If you're worried about being cold, there is an electric mattress pad that warms you up from below the sheets! (Pro Tip - these things are pressure sensitive. If you crank it up to 8 or 9 and spread the pillows around on the bed before leaving for dinner, when you return the bed will be roasty-toasty warm when you climb in. Just be sure to turn it back down to 2-3 or you'll wake up sweating!)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Would absolutely recommend staying at Sandie and Dave’s teepee. We had an amazing time.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Overall a fun experience. David and Sandy were friendly and very social. The teepee is in a small yard right next to their house. We were expecting a bit more space and privacy.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"They were wonderful and treated us like family! We couldn’t have made a better choice, and we were so happy for the amazing conversations, the yummy coffee, and super cool experience of the teepee. We will for sure be back and can’t even begin to express how amazing the entire trip was because of all the cool and helpful tips and ideas they gave us❤️❤️❤️"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect a really unique experience, staying in a large teepee that crosses feels like camping but nicer. The fire pit outside added to the atmosphere, and we were lucky enough to see fireworks on 7/3 that made our stay even more astounding.
David and Sadie likewise are very entertaining and never at a loss for words. Easy going and friendly, they made our stay feel very comfortable and personable."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dave and Sandie are super friendly and kind. Ask them anything, then you will get the answer right away. They know all the places very well not only in Steamboat but even far further. Sleeping in tee-pee is a memorable experience, and do not worry about all the amenities."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A magical experience was had at the teepee & frolicking around Steamboat was made extra special with the incredible hospitality from Sandie, Dave and Chakski. We had the best nights sleep of our lives and we’re still talking about those heated beds under the stars :) Very much looking forward to our next return!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Sandie and Dave are amazing hosts. Awesome view!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really great spot that’s very close to downtown Colorado Springs and the hot springs. Friendly hosts and enjoyed our time!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandie and Dave were wonderful hosts. Sandie really knows her way around Steamboat and gave a great rundown of all the local places to go! Their dog, Chaksi, also made us feel right at home. He took away the ache of not seeing my dogs while I was out if town. Thanks again Sandie and Dave!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A couple of days in David and Sandies tipi is the most relaxing base camp for some great days in Steamboat Springs.
The view to the mountains is great and situated in the quiet part of town just makes it a perfect spot.
We really enjoyed the hospitality and openness at David and Sandie.
We can recommend this to anyone.
Vivi and Lars"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot and Sandie and Dave were super friendly!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed with for the weekend and had a wonderful time. David and Sandie were super cool and extremely friendly. The teepee itself is glamping at its finest.super comfortable and warm because of the electric blanket. 10/10 would recommend and would love to book again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fun “glamping” in Steamboat and far more affordable than anything else in the area. Close to town and David and Sandie were super accommodating. Access to their house/bathroom was a huge plus.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an incredibly unique experience, very comfortable. Felt like camping, but with all the comforts of being inside. And David and Sandie were excellent hosts."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an awesome trip to Steamboat and the teepee was part of that adventure. It rained a lot and we stayed dry and happy in there. The options to share the inside kitchen and bathroom with Dave and Sandie was a great perk. The location/price of this spot is amazing. We hiked the Spring Creek trail leaving right from thier hillside. Downtown was an easy walk or bike ride and there was so much to do in the area. I feel in love with Steamboat Springs on this trip. Trails not to miss = Mad Creek and Uranium (if Fish Creek Falls is too crowded). Taco Cabo, Mountain tap brewery and Yampa Valley Kitchen were great. Sandie knows everything so can help with all kinds of referrals!! xoxox We will be back."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Getting away to Dave & Sandie’s Airbnb was such a remarkable experience. Their hospitality makes you feel right at home. We can’t wait to come back here and enjoy the amazing company/views again. If you’re considering staying… just commit and thank me later!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time! The teepee does get hit during the day, but we were almost always out and about, so not a problem for us. Sandie gives GREAT tips on places to eat, the best hot springs and trails to check out. We really valued her insider knowledge and went to her suggested places and loved them. Close to downtown and the Strawberry Hot Springs (a MUST)."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sandie was amazing with communication when we had a hiccup with our reservation, she made sure everything was taken care of, thank you Sandie. Looking forward to seeing you next year."
2020-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"David and Sandie's teepee is so fun! Much better than camping as you can walk around in the teepee and there is a bed. Also, they provide access to a full bathroom and a kitchen. Most importantly, this option is much cheaper than the less personable, more expensive options that are much further from town. I highly recommend!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"So much fun! You do not want to miss out! Stay here, you will not regret it!!! Sandie is amazing!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Be prepared for a genuine connection to the land and space. For real reviews of places to go and stories of the town. Sandie is a delight to spend time with, yet she knows when it’s time for you to enjoy your vacation. You get what you see here, an authentic teepee with a magnificent view."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place, lovely hosts, and a nice adventure and break from the normal. Great value, and you’ll love your stay. A rare find! Sandie is just wonderful to her guests! Stay here!"

Sandie, Dave, and Chaksi (their cute, adorable dog) provided a warm and welcoming stay. Their place is the best location and a short drive up to Strawberry Park Hot Springs. Coffee in the morning was so nice and thoughtful. Sandie and Dave are such sweet and genuine souls and made me feel comfortable during my stay. I would definitely recommend booking their place if you find yourself in Steamboat."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I just celebrated our first wedding anniversary at David and Sandies teepee. We had an amazing experience, they went above and beyond for us. We were surprised with champagne and flowers to help us celebrate. They also provided us with tubes and a shuttle to float the Yampa River. We had everything there that we could have wanted and more. Not only did we leave with great memories but also new friends! Highly recommend staying here!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We planned our stay at Dave and Sandie's teepee as a much-needed getaway with our two young children, and the place was beyond our expectations. The teepee perfectly combined rustic authenticity with comfort, coziness, and unexpected amenities. We felt immediately welcome upon arrival, and enjoyed our conversations with Dave and Sandie, who kindly offered valuable tips for local activities and dining. Traveling with a toddler and infant is challenging to say the least, but this turned out to be a fun and memorable experience, thanks to the unique space, gorgeous views, and impeccable hospitality of our hosts. Highly recommended!"

I can’t wait to go back 😊"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The teepee is on their property close to the house which was perfect since we had access to the bathroom/shower, kitchen, deck with beautiful views.

Amazing hospitality!"

2019-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Beds were very hard and short. Teepee was on edge of driveway. Not the location we expected.

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic accom. As described if not better. Perfect for our USA mountain biking trip to explore the local area.

2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed with David & Sandie for the Steamboat Marathon. They are absolutely wonderful hosts—would highly recommend to anyone for their warm hospitality, cozy digs, & beautiful porch views!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was absolutely perfect. From the second we arrived, David and Sandie welcomed us into their home and explained the history of their tipi and how it works. The tipi itself is an experience unlike any other. The decor makes it so cozy and with a heated mattress/room heater, we managed to be nice and toasty in the 25 degree weather and snow! Sandie invited us to go to a local event downtown with them, but we already had plans on going to the hot springs (which is right up the street from the tipi location!) Although we didn't go with them because of our other plans, we really appreciated the invite. Additionally, the bathroom was nice and clean with a heated floor and Fresh coffee was ready to be brewed in the kitchen when we woke up! We would stay here again in a heart beat!
P.S. our car battery died in the middle of the night but thankfully Sandie and David responded to our texts quickly even though they weren't home at the moment to help us out. We got our car jumped and went home! Such caring people!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is such an incredible place to stay! A truly unique and fun experience. Sandie and Dave are the best hosts you could ask for. It got quite cold during the night but inside the tipi with the blankets and heater we kept warm and cozy. The view is amazing and the stars at night are spectacular. It is also dog friendly (and they have the cutest dog too)! This is a place you will never forget and will want to come back to again and again!
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was way better than expected. The teepee was amazing, Sandie and David were amazing hosts that helped us have the best vacation we could. 10/10 we will try and use them every time we are in the area"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Teepee is truly one of a kind and such a fun experience!! We saw deer right outside the door and heard elk bugling in the early morning. Sandie and Dave are amazing hosts and we would love to stay with them any time we went back to Steamboat!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Being able to stay is such a rustic and unique space is so cool! The location is convenient for both going to town and to strawberry park. Yet even with the proximity to town it’s nice and quiet. Sandie and David are extremely fun and sweet hosts too.

2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David & Sandie’s teepee was fantastic. My husband and I take an annual trip to Steamboat each year and we’re so glad we connected with this place. The teepee was very a unique experience and David & Sandie were great hosts. The teepee stayed warm even with a slight chill in the air, there was coffee made in the morning and our bathroom was simple to get to right inside the house. We will stay again and definitely bring our two younger boys with us next time!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay in the tepee! Sandie and Dave were great hosts! Extremely hospitable and gave great recommendations. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun and unique place to stay in Steamboat Springs!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband, grown daughter, and I had such a sweet time at David and Sandie's place. When we drove up to their home, we were floored by the view out toward the mountains. While the teepee is in their backyard and in a residential neighborhood, the teepee, itself, looks out over nothing, but beautiful scenery. Sandie met us, welcomed us, and oriented us to their space (since guests have their own bathroom in the main house) and to the teepee (where guests sleep outside under the stars). We drove up to the hot springs after dinner, which was really nice (bring a flashlight!) and thoroughly enjoyed our brief stay in Steamboat."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Dave and Sandi’s space was like the feeling of coming home. Their hospitality and comfort were more than we were expecting in our stay in Steamboat Springs. The tepee is authentic and has native touches which make you feel like you’ve gone back in time. Coffee and conversation with Sandi in the morning was delightful and memorable. Loved every minute.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,David and Sandie are both so welcoming. The teepee is just as advertised and you can't beat the location and price. I will definitely be going back!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one the best times we've had. Sandie and Dave were amazing host and so much fun and laid back. We not only enjoyed the teepee which is beyond awesome but we enjoyed them even more. They provided us with great things to do around town and were BEYOND accommodating with us. They went over and beyond! If you are looking for a unique location and great people stay here. You wont be disappointed!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful undforgetable experience to sleep in a tipi. Sandi and David were buy far the most kind caring fun hosts I’ve ever stayed with. Super cool to sleep in a tipi, it rained during the night which was an amazing experience. At the top around pols is an open area to see the stars at night."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Killer views, amazing host, she has the cutest dog ever. I recommend this Tepee experience 100%"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Get after it! This is one of the coolest, most unique experiences we've had on airbnb. Dave and Sandie are great hosts, have excellent communication and provided us with helpful local tips of where to eat and visit for our stay - they even offered coupons and spoiled us with delicious coffee in the teepee. We loved spending time hanging out on the back deck overlooking downtown with beautiful views. Stay here if you want the inside scoop and a memorable stay in a really cool teepee."

2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location in Steamboat Sprints: walk to downtown while there is also a hiking trail just across the street! Teepee was a great experience (so comfortable!) and we enjoyed ‘glamping’ so close to town - the views are increblie! Dave and Sandie are wonderful hosts, we had our own bathroom (the shower is amazing) and they had coffee ready for us in the morning! They have lived in Steamboat for over 30 years and have a wealth of local knowledge."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Dave and Sandy were wonderful host and it is much better than staying in a hotel. They added personal touches and made our say a wonderful one. they took every bit as much enthusiasm in our vacation as we did. Highly recommended!
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sandie & Dave’s teepee was a great place to stay while in Steamboat Springs. The teepee was well furnished, the bed was very comfortable, and the house was great. Dave and Sandie made us feel extremely welcome from the moment that we arrived and made our stay feel more like a visit with old friends, than just a stop along the way. They are definitely “Super Hosts” and we highly recommend staying with them."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for a couple's getaway! Carri's place was very comfortable and just a short (3-minute) walk to the free bus stop which made getting to and from the ski resort & downtown a breeze. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed, though we ventured out to dinner most evenings (highly recommend burgers at Back Door Grill or a nice date night at Besame!). We did not use the hot tub as we spent most of our days on the go, however, the hot tubs looked very inviting and were less than a minute away. We highly recommend Carri's place and will look to stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Wonderful breakfast place nearby called EGGS. Also close to town, but even closer to the resort. Option to take the bus or drive to the free parking lot. Really appreciated the washer/dryer. Would stay again!"

The bed is clean and comfortable and the bathroom has all the amenities you could ever need. Even though this room is inside the home, it feels very private since it’s lofted above the rest of the house. Because it’s the top floor, it was quite warm at first, but the A/C unit in the bathroom cools down the space quickly.

Heleen was very accomodating and welcoming. During our short stay we enjoyed our conversations.
