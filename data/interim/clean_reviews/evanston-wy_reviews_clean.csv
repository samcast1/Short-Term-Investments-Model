2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean and cozy. Beds were comfortable and the house had everything we needed. Everything was as advertised, and overall happy with the stay. We would definitely stay here again, as it’s nice to have an option in Evanston.
As others have stated, the stairs are steep. We expected this to be the case, but the one thing I do suggest for the owners is to install railing on the top level by the stairs to help reduce fall risk. We have a 2 year old and were nervous about this. With the A-frame, the 2nd floor has limited head space surrounding the stairs so you sort of have to lean as you’re walking across the loft near the stairwell opening, and the floor is narrow right there. A rail up there would be a helpful safety feature for this property."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place was perfect! From the decor to the layout of the place, it was exactly what I needed. The stairs leading upstairs are indeed steep but they do list that in the description prior to booking. I had no issues with the stairs. The house was clean and tidy. Bed was so comfortable! Check-in with the lock box was simple enough to get into for the house.
I would definitely stay here again in I am ever in the area!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"With two adult daughters and three grandkids in tow, we were a big loud group. The space was clean and fit all of the fun perfectly. It was a nice surprise to find a packnplay in the closet in the upstairs room and it came in very handy. Check in was easy peasy and there were clear simple instructions for check out. Thank you for giving us a spot where we could spread out and relax after a long late drive.
Would definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My favorite place I have stayed at so far! So cute and clean. Very cute decor and cozy.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Not a bad place at all, very clean, cute and cozy. Pretty cold, so use the space heaters."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very quaint for a week long work trip with working appliances and all the other amenities of a standard home.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A little noisier than we hoped.
Be advised the stairs are indeed steep as advertised. Not ideal for an older adult.
Otherwise a good value."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! Cute place. Our family had fun ice skating at the bear river gateway, sledding and seeing the bison and elk at bear river state park, and eating out at the hibachi restaurant. Evanston is a really lovely. And the airbnb was perfect! We love this fun little place. The bathroom was pristine. The kitchen was awesome, beds comfy, living room was perfect for our movie night. We had the best time. Thank you! The guest contacts for this property are super responsive and we appreciated them so much. Excellent customer service!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed my stay at this location. Done very well, pristine inside, very clean. Enjoyed how everything is within walking distance (restaurants, bars, small casino) Venture just a little further and you have a Smiths grocery and Wal-Mart. Basic staples within easy driving distance. Only drawback (and it must have just been a bad night) is that the area got quite noisy with traffic, work trucks etc. Momentary nuisance and not a deal breaker though. Overall just a huge comfortable experience."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This Beautiful little A-Frame cottage was peaceful, quiet, comfortable. (after you get the wall heaters and space heaters turned on. the beds upstairs are a bit challenging for me being 6'3"" I had to do a lot of creative movements to land myself on the bed without being pushed down by the ceiling. (My wife and I made a game of it haha) the stairs are depicted in the photos but the photos do not do justice of how STEEP they are. that was my only real complaint. I have an older dog who is still active thank goodness, but these stairs proved to be a challenge for him, and it was scary to watch him climb down. the stairs are more like a ladder. I feel like that needs to be said.
but there is plenty of parking a space on each side of the house. the furniture is comfortable. there's coffee and tea to start your morning right. and it's a beautiful space to spend quality time with friends and family! we loved reading the guest journal and seeing pase renters thoughts and adventures!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"excellent location, very cozy and cute place to stay! as others mentioned, the stairs to the loft are quite steep. it would be quite a hazard for those with mobility issues.
the beds were VERY comfortable and everyone slept great"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Bathroom- having a place to hang wet towels, an adult size commode, and a tp holder somewhere where else so it doesn't poke into your side while you're sitting... would all be a major plus.
Just so everyone knows, the beds are on the floor, and there's not even a privacy curtain for the main room. Best method for getting up (if you're older like me) is rolling onto your stomach and pushing up that way."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay in this little house. It is centrally located allowing us to walk downtown to see the shops in historic downtown Evanston. Check in was so easy!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay was great we had no problems beautiful place
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"loved this place. the stairs are a little steep if not used to that, but the beds were worth the climb!!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fun little house with everything needed for a pleasant stay. Location by some hotels & restaurants in walking distance. Comfortable beds.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful home away from home shared by 3 nursing students that worked at the local hospital for the week. It had everything we needed. Cozy, quiet, clean, and beautiful surroundings of cowboy country in Wyoming. **The loft stairs are steep so elderly or those with mobility issues please caution. But for us, 10/10. Thanks again :)"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little cabin. Decent price. Comfortable and clean. Would not recommend to people with knee and feet problems as the stairs to the bedrooms are really steep.
This warning is Stressed in the description. It is true."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Cute place and very clean. But if you’re one that gets claustrophobic, be prepared that with the triangular shape, it doesn’t have tall ceilings. Some of the shingles needed repair as well. I thought no AC wouldn’t be a huge deal but the way heat rises made the upstairs very warm at night."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We booked this home for a weekend wedding and it was perfect. We didn't cook so can't speak to the kitchen's set up, but a glance through the cabinets showed it was well stocked with the usual kitchen-stuff. I appreciated the very nice coffeemaker and new bag of coffee. Wifi worked really well and we were able to get to and from where we needed to be easily. The interior is clean and nicely decorated. Really charming!
Couple of things for future guests. There's a very loud street a short distance from the home and you can hear it from inside. While the description says 6 guests, I think four max is comfortable. The futon in the living room is really uncomfortable; I don't recommend sleeping on it. There's a queen bed and two twin beds upstairs though. The stairs leading upstairs are really steep, but have motion lighting that helps at night.
Overall, it was a great place to stay. Really unique and a pretty fun experience. I'd stay there again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"good place to stay, everything work perfect"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is a great place to stay. It had everything we needed to cook and was comfortable for us and our dog!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Loved this peaceful location, clean home, and friendly host! It was super helpful that the home was well stocked, as it is in a remote location. Plenty of clean towels and fresh sheets. We will stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Teresa was a great host, beautiful surroundings, everything was clean, had all the things I needed , very comfy and cozy spot."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nice place
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely enjoyed our stay at Teresa’s place! Very relaxing place and environment, beautiful walks around the town with 360 Mountain views. The place itself is cozy, has everything you need, very clean. Teresa sent us some very good local recommendations. We strongly recommend staying at her place if you want to De-stress and relax."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"She was very nice, helpful, and accommodating!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Teresa’s place was incredible! It was exactly like the pictures and so clean! My friend and I hung out there all weekend while our husbands were out hunting, and she made sure there was everything we would need to be comfortable through our stay. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything to cook our dinners, and she went above and beyond in checking in on us, making sure we had everything we needed, and clearing all of the snow on the sidewalks throughout the weekend. Her and her husband were so kind and friendly. I highly recommend booking with her and her husband! We will definitely be staying there again if we find ourselves up that direction!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our experience at Teresa’s home was memorable for all the right reasons. Comfortable beds, clean hot shower, well stocked kitchen and a great location. Close to Park City and only an hour from SLC.
The great holiday decorations really made for a festive experience as well and the fluffy towels were the bomb! We had an exceptional stay. Book with confidence."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re going through Henefer/Coalville, you gotta stay here! Perfect place for a relaxing vacation. Teresa was very helpful & flexible. Will definitely come back & stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little place. Very cutely decorated for the season. Worked great for our family's short stay. We did not need anything but Teresa lives next door if anything was needed.
Highly recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place and great hosts. They'll tell you about the town and its history and help answer any questions that you may have. It's great because it's its own unit. You don't share with anyone. There is plenty of room. The kitchen is a great touch because you can bring your own food and cook if you want to as opposed to eating out. Microwave with bags of popcorn, full sized fridge and freezer, utensils, plates and an oven. Nice sized television. Very clean. The area is beautiful with Echo Canyon east and Weber Canyon west. If you like fishing or rafting, it looks like a great area to visit and this is a great place to stay. I will make this a place that I would visit and stay at again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for my trip!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Teresa is a excellent host always making sure you are comfortable and have everything you need for your stay. Henefer is a nice and quiet place to stay and Ma and Pa's Place is a great place to unwind after a long day of work.
5 Stars all the way!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,It was amazing and it was a great stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at Ma's & Pa's a number of times while working out of town. The location is nice and the area is quiet and kind of ""out of the way"", makes it easy to relax after a long day of work. I will always try to stay there when I'm in the area for work! A++++++++"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved the place. As clean as my house and I’m kind of a clean freak. I hope I left the place as clean as I found it. Thank y’all!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the quaint little place. Teresa had it all decked out in St. Patrick’s day decorations which added a nice homey touch. Would stay again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great, calm and peaceful. Owner was really responsive and helpful, reaching out to us and making sure we were good but still leaving us our privacy. would definitely recommend and come back"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I enjoyed staying here for a weekend after a long trip. We were looking for a quiet and private place to relax and found just that. The environment was true to how it was described on the listing. It was well worth it for our family.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Theresa's place was perfect for our trip. We were visiting our son , daughter in law and granddaughters. The apartment had everything we needed!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow-- this was the CLEANEST AirBNB we have ever stayed at! It was stocked very well with everything needed. Easy drive to ski in park city. Would highly recommend and stay here again in a heartbeat.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place just like the pictures!
Teresa was Very communicative, flexible on my check out time.
the house is very clean, cozy with that home feel to it, super comfortable bed, a complete kitchen and very good shower.
i was looking for a gateway feom the salt lake city pollution and found kusy the perfect spots to go on walk and focus on work.
only problem is I couldn't stay longer.
highly recommend Teresa's place!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place and it’s easy to get to Park City
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The owner of this Airbnb was super helpful and was very quick to answer any questions I had. Made us feel right at home.
2024-05-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb is in serious needs of repairs, and deep cleaning.
1. the front door lock jams and does not lock properly
2. the entire place needs a deep cleaning. the floors to the counter tops were stained
3. there are mice in the house
4. be aware the laindry area is a shared space. after doing some much needed cleaning we headed out to the store and left the door to the laundry area open (thats where the cleaning supplies were kept) we did not realize that was a shared space upon arrival back to the house there was a man inside the laundry room. which meant our belongings were not secure from strangers.
5. there are random holes in the ceiling and around the light fixtures. it honestly feels like someone is watching you.
6. there were soiled blankets left on the bed
7. the restroom is dark and dingy old tissue on the side of the toilet and the rugs hadn't been washed in so long they were stiff.
the only saving grace for this place is its location and beautiful view."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Jhonatan is a good person
2024-03-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The best thing about Jonathan’s Airbnb is it’s close proximity to the Roundhouse where the Celtic Music Festival was held. The bed and bedding was fairly comfortable. But for being listed as a whole unit, it was under furnished and the kitchen wasn’t really stocked with basic staples. We did ok since we ate most of our meals out. The living area was under furnished. The house may sleep 4 but they wouldn’t all have a place to sit down for a chat or watch tv.
We came to attend the festival and since we are musicians, the appeal of staying in an Airbnb is the ability to sit and have a music session before or after the show. Some basic chairs in the unit would have been appreciated.
The house is very old and has clearly been renovated and updated. I hope they go the extra mile and have a deep clean and have a real cook go in to make it a cooks kitchen."
2024-03-01,2,Stayed a few nights,Not a very nice place
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,good place to stay for when you are out and about.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Jonathan’s AirBnb is clean and has a beautiful view of the Evanston Roundhouse and the mountains from his porch. My biggest safety concern as a senior was the bathtub/shower combo. The per night stay is very reasonable and Jonathan replied to my messages quickly. Thank you, Jonathan."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,10x better than a hotel and close to everything
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,God place

I will definitely rent it again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was absolutely AMAZING!! If you’re looking for a stop off of I-80, look no further. The location was incredible, the hosts were so kind and easy to contact, and the space was clean and so cozy. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hannah's place is THE SPOT for a good night's rest, specially after a long day of driving! The studio has everything you need, very comfortable beds and pillows.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great home away from home
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay and Hannah is a wonderful host. The basement apartment was spacious, clean and well stocked. We felt at home and were grateful to find the listing. The kitchen had everything I had hoped for and was organized.
It couldn’t be helped-we didn’t think they were trying to be, but the upstairs guests were loud. Our kids had a hard time sleeping with the moving of chairs and footsteps. However, we would happily stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Easy entry, clean space. Hannah was a very accommodating host and had even set up an extra mattress on the floor of our room for a small child who needed to be in with us."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, this was actually our second time staying here"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hannah was an amazing host. Very responsive to our communications and even allowed us an early check in when we arrived in town before scheduled . 10 out of 10 host.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,We came to Evanston on short notice to a funeral. I went with my full family and unsure of a lot of options for us. she provided great options and great instructions. The house has everything you need and close to everything. I come to Evanston often since my family lives there and usually stay with them because usually it's only my husband and I traveling but we were so impressed. We are willing to rent again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Hannah was very flexible on the date - weather was not great and she worked with us.

2022-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Was a perfect location and met our needs for the stay, although with a full size crew cab truck it was a bit tight. It is a quiet location other with the occasional pitter patter from feet upstairs. We would stay again."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This apartment was so spacious and clean! The check in process was easy.
Only downside for us was that you can hear every step above you and the ceiling creaks. Not a huge deal but might be a consideration if you have kids that go to bed early like us. We would stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time for the night we stayed here. The space was open and welcoming, there was everything we needed, and the view and surrounding area were enjoyable. I’d recommend this stay to everyone!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay at this place as we stopped through on our road trip. Everything was very clean and the place was very spacious. There was a high chair, which was great for our 14 month old. You can hear some children upstairs, but it didn’t bother us. Would definitely recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Came with my family for a softball tournament, the home was very spacious with big comfortable beds. Location was great with a beautiful view, my kids loved waking up and going out the door to see the cows right outside. Hostess was very communicative the whole stay. We thank you! Highly recommended place."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wow! I am very picky and I was super impressed with this place! This house was perfect for our family. It felt very homey and comfortable. Hannah and her husband were so kind and helpful. The living room is big and very comfortable. Everything we needed was there and it was clean and just felt like we were at home.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hannah’s place was perfect, so spacious and it had everything we needed. The beds and bedding were comfy, and the incredible living room rug was so cushy and comfy on my weary feet. The parking behind the house has enough space for several cars, and it is right next to the apartment entrance which made it so nice on a frigid December night. She also let us park our giant Uhaul truck in her driveway in front. Really a great place to stay on our trip, would definitely stay again if I am ever coming this way on a road trip."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was just what we needed. It was clean and comfortable. I would definitely recommend it.
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Hannah’s place was great!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hannah was incredibly accommodating, especially regarding our little one-year-old son. She even set up a crib and offered to bring down a high chair for him.
The place is very spacious and will be absolutely wonderful once the remodel/construction is complete.
The property is so quiet that the silence is deafening if you’re coming from an urban environment.
We woke up to deer grazing in the back yard and grouse flying around in the tall grass. We’d defiantly stay if we pass through again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hannah is awesome! Her description was spot on. Worked well for us traveling through town and needing a place to sleep. She was very accommodating.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed here for an overnighter as we were in Wyoming from salt lake to see the horse races. Was very clean, newly remodeled, and very fair price. Spacious, and you would never know there was a family living upstairs. Very quite! Would definitely use again and recommend to others. Thanks Hannah!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely place but their best asset is their topnotch consideration to costumer’s needs. Very accomodating! Highly Reccommended.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,A nice place to stay!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Our stay was great. We had plenty of space to spread out. Hannah was very transparent about what to expect and she met all of our needs with the apartment! The only reason for 4 stars was the entrance was poorly lit at night and a bit hard to access. Hopefully that is resolved soon!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you!

Thank You Angela!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic setting!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Angela’s was one of our favorites! The cabin was clean, had the essentials, and was a perfect mountain getaway. Our favorite part was sitting on the porch looking over the mountains. Angela was very responsive and helpful with checking in and out. We will definitely be back."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great rustic cabin with modern updates. A wood deck porch providing wonderful sunset views. A kitchen with a variety of appliances for cooking. The washer and dryer come in handy. The location provides access to canyon and mirror lake hiking trails.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was great, we had a very peaceful stay in a beautiful area!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This property is worth the drive. beautiful location with mountain and canyon views. at night and early morning there are many deer and even Moose around. Very quiet and peaceful, sleep with the sliding door cracked and hear the rustling of aspen trees in the breeze. Nights are cool around 50,s and days are warm 80,s for August. Don't pass up staying at a hidden gem like Thunder Hill!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay at the cabin! It has stunning views, a nice deck and an abundance of wild life! We will come back!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Landon is truly such an awesome host, thank you for everything! The property is in excellent condition, beautifully taken care of, and our rental experience was exactly the same. Landon was prompt, communicative, and flexible in helping us with some challenging logistics. We would 100% stay here again, and could not recommend renting with Landon more!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks so much for the amazing place to stay! I would recommend to everyone! Beautiful surroundings and beautiful home!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful location and a great getaway spot

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for peace and beauty, an escape from the hustle and bustle of city life this is your place! The little cabin is situated on a working ranch. The decor was tasteful and charming and the cabin was immaculate. We enjoyed walks along the river. The surrounding mountains and abundant birds made it a perfect retreat! Debbie was a delightful host. We loved our stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Debbie was a wonderful host. She greeted me and made sure everything was set. She had even purchased a special pastry from the local bakery as a welcome gift. The cabin was beautifully decorated and had everything I needed. The area around the cabin was breathtaking and full of wonder. The ranch’s free range cattle greeted me in the morning, then “Whitey” herded them away. I heard many birds on my morning walk. To name a few: Finches, Red-winged Blackbird, Eurasian Collared-Dove, Western Meadowlark, Sandhill Crane, Sparrows, Yellow-headed Blackbird, Yellow Warbler, Eastern Kingbird, House Wren, Bullock’s Oriole, Mourning Dove, Grackles, Hummingbirds, Ducks & Geese .. just to name a few. It was glorious! I will be going back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location and great hosts! A bit off the beaten path, in a good way. We came in late at night and even so had no trouble finding the cabin and getting in. Thanks!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy cabin surpassed our expectations! Meticulously and tastefully decorated, providing a comfortable retreat throughout our stay. The kitchen was well stocked with all the essentials. The coffee bar was amazing, offering many choices of beverages and accessories. Not to mention, the cinnamon buns left for us were delicious. The bedroom and bathroom were immaculate and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Lastly, the outside fire pit provided the perfect way to end the evenings. Communication was seamless, Debbie was responsive and considerate, making sure everything was in order for our arrival. Even texting at 10:30 pm to let us know the yard and front porch was all lit up. Debbie went above and beyond to ensure we had a perfect vacation. We had an absolutely wonderful time and would highly recommend Debbie’s place to anyone looking for a memorable Airbnb experience. We are looking forward to going back in the fall!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Debbie’s place is a great spot for a quick getaway. It is very serene and we had a great time.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a peaceful place to stay! The cabin was cute & cozy but my favorite part was the sitting area outside. Being able to listen to all the birds, cows & horses was very relaxing. Debbie is so kind and left some great cinnamon rolls for us from the local bakery. Would definitely recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Our time there was the perfect getaway…it was so peaceful and quiet…The cabin is such a comfortable place with great energy…beautifully decorated and furnished…Debbie checked on us and ￼was available if we needed anything…I would definitely stay there again when I need a getaway close to home❤️
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Debbie went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay! The atmosphere of the ranch and cabin is already amazing. Paired with a great host I would suggest this place to anyone looking for a peaceful escape.
2024-01-01,3,Stayed one night,"It was a beautiful little cabin located in a peaceful area. The cabin was clean, had a gift when we arrived that had New Year's favors which was very thoughtful. The bed however was very uncomfortable and we slept poorly over it. It was uncomfortable to the point we left early so we could get home and get some sleep."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Seeing the stars without the light pollution was amazing. Debbie also brought over some ibuprofen when we were feeling ill.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome cabin!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Debbie's place is exactly what we were looking for! We were traveling from Jackson to Salt Lake City and needed a peaceful place to stay the night. We booked this the morning of our stay. Debbie was very quick to answer any questions. The place was extremely clean. The cabin was absolutely beautiful and had an amazing view of the ranch. If we are ever back in the area we would definitely stay again. We highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the place. Very comfortable. It is on a working cattle ranch that was really cool. My wife got to give the horses snacks.
The place is a little remote, which adds to the charm. There are very very few amenities in 'town'. A microwave and small fridge, but no stove in cabin. BBQ and fire pit outside. Bring groceries from Evanston if you come in from the south.
If I am anywhere near, I will stay there again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We Loved our 2 nights in this remote cabin, Debbie had our a lot of love and thought into decorating the cabin and it feel’s authentic and unique full of history associated with the ranch. Our daughter loved the horses and we enjoyed BBQing in the garden watching the sunset. Even though it doesn’t have a full kitchen we self catered and had everything we needed. Highly recommend"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is place is a gem! Beautiful small cabin tucked away in a remote area. Debbie was there to greet us, and her hospitality was AMAZING— we will definitely be back!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I loved this private getaway after not seeing each other for 90 days. it's very beautiful and lots of stuff to do and places to eat and shop at nearby towns; not to mention the gorgeous Bear Lake. Debbie is an amazing host and has proactive responses when needed and very quick responses in general. Next time we come we'll just bring everything we need so we wouldn't have to leave the beautiful ranch cabin; would love to experience winter there.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Love to stay here! No matter you are looking for a rest after visiting National parks or an escape in rural area. The garden is beautiful and many birds. Also a good place to take galaxy photo.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to stay in a quiet and peaceful environment
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent place, beautiful country cabin. Thank you for your hospitality."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had an amazing, peaceful stay at the Hatch Ranch. The cabin was so cozy and Debbie left me a surprise: a cinnamon roll from the local bakery! It was delicious! Debbie was quick to respond to messages and she is really sweet. My only regret is that I didn’t book more than one night. I will definitely be back!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,it's a beautiful small cabin out and away from all the hub bub. It's definitely a nice stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was one of our favorite Airbnb’s we’ve ever gotten to stay in. Debbie and Tracy were helpful, friendly, and accommodating. The valley they live in is gorgeous, and it’s just the right amount of “off the beaten path.” They even left us cinnamon rolls for our first breakfast. Definitely would recommend this gem of a cabin!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, amazing views, so peaceful, Debbie’s a great host, as soon we have an other opportunity we’ll stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved it! Super cute little cabin on the outskirts of a tiny Utah town. Enjoyed the clear starry skies and the mellow mooing of the nearby cattle. We walked down the gravel road for a couple of miles and saw three skunk, one HUGE raccoon, and a sleeping garden snake (not poisonous). This is definitely a comfortable and peaceful “away from it all” kind of location — and the cabin itself is comfy and clean and cute. Would stay again for sure!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot- beautiful location, pristine cabin, wonderful hostess.
The cabin was perfect for our trip and would be perfect for anyone in need of couples/small family getaway."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just book this place! ☀️♥️❄️
We arrived in the cold sunshine, with snow on the ground. Debbie was super welcoming and the cabin was warm, cozy, and spotless.
The ranch is a such peaceful spot, the furnishings are comfortable, and the bed is great. And the wifi worked really well, even on a vpn.
We can’t wait to come back. And we’ll recommend it to friends and family! A perfect escape. Thank you!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a wonderful weekend getaway. Very peaceful and relaxing. Debbie was very sweet and polite and even stocked the fridge with a few refreshments for us and even got us a little treat from the local bakery which was delightful. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone looking for a get away
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved the quaint cabin! Loved the history. The owner Debbie was very accommodating! Went above and beyond.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Debbie was such a great host!
We loved our stay and all of the personal touches.
It was the perfect place for some peace and quiet!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn’t have had a better stay and experience than at The Hatch Ranch! Will be going back. Debbie and the entire Hatch family couldn’t have been more friendly and accommodating, best hosts ever. And a once in a lifetime experience to stay in a log cabin on a working cattle ranch with incredible views of The Crawford Mountains. Log cabin was amazing - like new and immaculate."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Crawford Mountain Cabin. Everything was so neat and clean, and we enjoyed all the Western touches that made the cabin so homey. The delicious cranberry muffins were a nice treat. We’ll go back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved my stay here!! The cabin is amazing and the ranch is quiet and gorgeous! It was exactly what I was looking for to get away from the noise and traffic of the cities. Debbie has gone above and beyond to make the cabin cozy, comfortable, and functional. The decor and attention to detail make it an extra special place. I loved the information and pictures about the history of the ranch. The cabin was spotlessly clean and stocked with all the amenities. Debbie is a wonderful host and I really appreciated her kindness and extra goodies! Thanks so much Debbie and best wishes with your lovey airbnb!!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Debbie’s cabin and property are absolutely stunning. Plus she is the nicest host ever! It’s on a historic working cattle ranch with a view of beautiful mountains. I’m a sucker for baby cows, but the real treat was seeing a mama Moose and her twins in the morning wandering around the front of the cabin. The hosts house is within view, but the cabin felt very private and there is plenty of foliage separating the two structures. I just can’t thank them enough for sharing their little slice of heaven with me!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our time at the Crawford Mountain Cabin…so quiet, cozy, comfy and well worth the slight jaunt off the beaten path. The ranch it dwells on is big, beautiful with much to look at. Just learning the history of the property and the family that now owns it has you wanting to come back for more time to learn and explore. The hosts are unbelievably kind, accommodating and in a nut shell,
are great folks! Don’t miss out on this little slice of heaven against the Randolph, Utah Crawford mountains. Ciao!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely stay again, it’s got everything you need."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little cabin and place to stay. Had a great time.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a great price
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great one bedroom cabin! Comfortable bed and Host was very quick to respond. Amenities, fridge and kitchen were a great benefit. Would recommend staying here and price was very reasonable. Close to some of the best fishing spots on earth!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place to stay in Kemmerer. Our family rented three cabins for a weekend of fly fishing and the host was incredibly kind and accommodating. The cabins were private, comfortable, and very clean. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"BB was very responsive to our needs. We had planned on staying 2 days, but only stayed one. The bed was too soft and we both don’t have the best backs. The fridge made a noise that BB said they’d quickly repair. It’s a cute little place and we enjoyed it, just wish the bed was better. BB worked with us on a partial refund that we appreciated."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was disappointed that I could not get wi-fi
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and worked out for the fishing trip. The heat and air worked really well especially after being out in the hot sun all day.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great stay! Great response when needed! Beautiful area
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very happy to find this cabin on AirBNB. Very close to the fossil quarries. Cabin was a perfect fit for our trip. Cute and cozy. Will definitely look to book here again when in the area. Highly recommend.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,location ideal and liked the full refrigerator! Glad the AC worked well.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An awesome cabin in a beautiful area. Bb was extremely responsive to all of my questions. We have already booked another stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice unit clean will use again
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay here! It was just as advertised and just what we needed. My only complaints are that the house isn’t quite airtight and the window screens have a few holes so bugs were able to get in. Other than that, it’s an adorable little home and we loved how private and cozy it was for a quick getaway. Would definitely recommend this place and we’ll likely consider staying there again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was exactly as described. It was on a beautiful piece of land and completely private. It was a nice little getaway that was stocked with everything we needed. We will be booking again with in the future.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful tiny house by the lake! We had a wonderful time boating and relaxing on the porch.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best stays I've had. The place had everything needed, I wanted for nothing. Peaceful and secluded, and ultra clean."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a fun time at this sweet tiny house! We were looking for lots of privacy and relaxation and we found it. We paddled around on the lake, walked the dirt roads, built a campfire…all the things we hoped to do. The bed in the loft was a little too tiny for my husband and me (we’re both around 6’ tall), but no problem! The futon was the better option for sleeping. All in all we had a great time!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Taffy was extremely communicative and available if needed. Taffy was proactive in telling me about the temperature and letting me know where the heater was if I needed it. The home was cozy, clean, and had everything that I needed. I enjoyed watching the sunset and sunrise in the beautiful surroundings. Extremely quiet and comfortable. Slept well. I was a little nervous about the bumpy road in/out to the place but all ended up just fine (I drive a Toyota Corolla), I took it extra slow. Would stay again and recommend to others. Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very peaceful and homey feel. It’s great to have a place to canoe and fish! Very unique experience and would stay again.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed the birds, the cows, the pond, the private, quiet tiny house."
2023-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"The location is great, just be aware the place is very tiny and using the loft bedroom is a challenge. Otherwise, very quiet and secluded."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Taffy’s place was just what we needed after a long day’s drive. It was peaceful and the lake area was lovely!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved the tranquility of Taffy’s place. If you are looking for a peaceful get away and a unique experience, I highly recommend Taffy’s place. As a host as well as a guest, I found everything about Taffy’s place, her instructions, attention to the needs of guests, and her thoughtfulness in every detail to be absolutely perfect."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, 2 dogs and I stayed here on our at to Denver. Great spot! Taffy gave great directions to find it. Very comfortable! Would definitely stay again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Great hosts
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location, great stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little place is great, taffy was a great host who was very responsive! The lake was definitely the highlight of our trip!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a gorgeous hidden gem. We enjoyed the privacy of the hidden lake and the cozy tiny home was perfect. Everything we could’ve asked for and more!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was the perfect getaway! The lake access was amazing and we enjoyed a beautiful sunset by the fire. Taffy is an amazing host and extremely responsive. We had minor issues with the electricity, but Taffy and her husband could not have been more accommodating and helpful to resolve it. We loved our stay here!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful location. Great water access and recreation options. Perfect for weekend fishing, cookouts, and stargazing."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent cozy cabin! Super clean, easy check in/check out, lovely location!"
2023-08-01,3,Stayed with kids,"This tiny home is in a beautiful spot with a private lake. We had an amazing sunset and really enjoyed stargazing at night. The futon isn’t really practical for 2 people as it’s extremely creaky. We finally moved the mattress to the floor to get some sleep. The bed in the loft is great and my kids were comfortable. The ceiling fan and light are on the same switch so we were unable to use the fan at night but an additional plug in fan was available and that worked well. We blew a fuse in the morning running the microwave and coffeemaker which was really inconvenient since the water pump doesn’t work without electricity so we had no water or lights for a bit until the host responded as to where the fuse box was located. I saw this happened to a previous guest as well, so it would be helpful to have this noted in the welcome manual as it was an easy fix once we knew where the box was located. Again, the outdoor setting is amazing and very peaceful."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I had a little trouble finding the place but Taffy answered my call and helped me right away. The seclusion was great. Sadly, the weather did not permit to go out on the lake. Beautiful view of lake and field."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay, super clean, awesome hosts, incredible views. Everything you need for the lake is already available. 100% recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect romantic spot for a quiet and peaceful experience. what an incredible gift to experience this place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a beautiful location. The amenities provided for the lake was great! We had so much fun.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed 2 nights at this amazing tiny lake house during a 2 week road trip. it was the perfect stay! the tiny home is adorable, and I spent the whole day on the lake with the kayak. when people ask me the best part of my road trip, this stay is at the top! I loved the privacy and felt so relaxed the whole time. I highly recommend and will probably come back myself one day!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Exactly as described. The tiny house is clean and functional. The location feels private and secluded. A
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Taffy was always quick to respond & help us when we needed! I absolutely loved the location of this cute place! But I’m used to camping w bare min. so I expected just what was described, which was a BEAUTIFUL, peaceful spot w the amenities we needed! We did have a bit of an issue trying to get in & out of the place due to a very muddy “road” through the cattle field. (poured rain night before we arrived & when we were there). This would not have been a problem if we had an SUV or truck but we had a Prius& did get stuck. Taffy was very quick to respond & had a family member pull us out! Thank you Dan! Other issues we had: not being able to unfold futon & in the am before we left the power went out, (blow dryer & hot water same time. All that aside, I chalk up these events to part of the adventure with humor & will visit again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Most relaxing weekend I have had in a while…thank you for sharing Taffy&family
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very very fun! And worth checking it out!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Yes!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had an amazing stay at the lake house. The amenities are perfect. The fire pit was a perfect. The lake was so nice at sunset and sunrise. Monday morning the cows gave me a very pleasant scare and the babies cow were priceless. I’d definitely would love to visit very soon. The drive from Utah was very pleasant.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing! Beautiful, peaceful, cozy and thoroughly enjoyable. Thank you, Taffy!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute lil cabin! Was exactly what we needed in a pinch. The lake and canoe was a neat feature too. 10/10 would recommend.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gorgeous and peaceful, just as described. The sunsets and sunrises are amazing, and being able to paddle on a lake makes this destination more than worth it. The road is a bit rough to get there, but manageable. It feels serene and remote, but there are restaurants and shops 15 minutes away driving."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such a great time relaxing and enjoying the countryside! Taffy’s place is the perfect spot to make memories and relax! Quiet, peaceful, and definitely one of our new favorite places!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, beautiful scenery"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Taffy was a great host. Super responsive and super easy to work with. The space was as advertised, quiet and peaceful Definitely would stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely amazing stay. We loved everything this cute and cozy place had to offer. The only one teensy tiny thing was that we could have had a few less spiders, but given the location, it is to be expected. We would have loved to watch as the property owner added more fish to the lake, and were sad we missed it. Taffy was great and even reached out to let us know about the fish ahead of time. Having the private lake was just what the doctor ordered. We did it all, even with the rain."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We felt right at home on the tiny lake house. Taffy and her husband were very accommodating, even at night when I couldn’t get the futon to go down."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderfully secluded little house with everything you’d need. I was besides myself paddle boarding on the lake and making a fire once the sun started setting. I’ve never had a “house on a lake” experience and this will sure be hard to beat! I would strongly recommend arriving in the day, because at night it was really hard to find - luckily the house number on the gate was visible :-)"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Taffy has a beautiful place! We had a blast!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the stay. Tons to do and a peaceful getaway for sure. Definitely want to go again
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Our 2nd time back and we will be back again !!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was definitely a little piece of heaven! Pretty views! Very neat being right next to the cows! Definitely would recommend especially if you’re looking for a private place away from a ton of people!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great ‘almost winter’ getaway! Thank you!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"10/10 would stay again. Such a special place with a private lake and everything you need for a cozy stay. The road down was a bit rough with a car weighed down with stuff but we made it through. The sunset over the lake is a must see, locals in town were super friendly, and the decor in the tiny house was cute and cozy. We will be back if we are ever in the area again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect.
There is not more to say, it’s amazing and we will absolutely return."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful views, super easy check in, lovely little home. Perfect for my one night stay. Such a good stay for someone wanting to get away from the bustle, you are secluded and it’s very quiet. The stars were phenomenal. Taffy was very detailed with instructions and directions and I had no problems during my stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place to stay for a getaway, the lake did have a slight smell, but you get used to it and it goes away really quickly. We loved using the fire pit, and sleeping in the loft. It’s very cozy and secluded, and the area has some really good food places around."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place. Road to it bumpier that expected, but i had an Xterra. 😉 Glad there was a fire pit. Cranes, ducks and geese were a bonus."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a cute getaway from the city, we loved with quietness. They had everything we needed. My only slight complain is the sofa and bed are not so comfortable to sleep in but it does the job! Thanks for the great stay"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Could not ask for better. The location and stay was perfect for our quick weekend away!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,A great place for a small family or a couple.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a fun stay here! We loved the private lake and the boats and paddle boards that were provided for us to use. Such a quiet, beautiful location! The tiny house had everything we needed. Would totally recommend staying here!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to stay. Very comfortable and quiet. A nice place to relax and unwind.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is such a great place to get our family away from electronics and out in nature. The sunsets on the lake are amazing and we love to see the geese fly in and land on the water. The fishing is wonderful and it's so quiet and peaceful. Sitting around the fire, roasting marshmallows & looking at the stars is the perfect way to end our day."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful spot! So much fun!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute! Great place to make home base while exploring the area.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is an awesome find. Kid friendly and good location if you want to either hang by the lake, visit Fort Bridger or drive to Fossil Butte Monument. Cabin had excellent little touches such as plates and bug spray! The paddle boat was a lot of fun. Very clean and hostess was very helpful and generous. We will be visiting again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A comfy place to stay. My husband and I used this location as a respite area in the midst of a very active Utah/ Wyoming vacation. It was so nice to be able to just sit on the glider and look out onto the lake. Another bonus was being able to cook our dinner over the fire pit since there is a grate there. I’d highly recommend as a little getaway
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had SO MUCH FUN!
Was able to play in the water for a couple days with my kids, the paddle boards and canoe were a selling point for us, and we found a cute ""waterfall"" where the creek meets the water.
Great selection of family movies for nighttime, and we loved having a chance to warm up in the shower after a day on the water.
Hope to make it back sometime!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, secluded cabin by the lake! It was lovely to go out on the water in the canoe. There were many geese families also going onto the water which was a highlight to see! There were cows in the distance and altogether it was a relaxing time . The communication with Taffy was wonderful and kind and we really appreciated her hospitality."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Taffy is awesome and this place is a great place to stay. Super smooth process, and a really pretty getaway."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"quiet, beautiful, serene space, perfect for a retreat getaway from the city. I loved having time there, watching the sunrise and sunset, walking around. lots of privacy, an all around wonderful place!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely awesome place. Wish it wasn’t raining so we could’ve taken the boat out on the pond. Will definitely return on our next road trip to see the beautiful parks and hikes around during the summer time!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great secluded place to stay which is perfect for us.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolute treasure! We will go back. Great fishing and since we don’t care to eat them the catch and release policy was no problem. The tiny house is rustic enough to feel like you are away from the world but has enough amenities to be comfortable. Quiet, secluded, peaceful and restful."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Very unique spot!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect lil getaway!!! Plenty to do right there at the property or tons of opportunities to go around surrounding areas to explore! Great Host!!!!

2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,A nice little tiny house with a great location. Pond is very clean and fun to play in. We loved the paddle boat.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great location.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great spot to stop and relax along the way. Exactly as described!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was a perfect little getaway!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This little oasis of peace was the perfect stop in our trip! We got to watch the sun go down under the clouds while listening to the water birds welcome us! We played a couple of games of horseshoes to see who had to drive the next day! I got up early to see the sun come up while admiring the wildlife and the scenery! We found the house cozy and secluded while still being just minutes from the freeway! Taffy was wonderful to work with us and communicate!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"We had a fun time at Taffy's place. The place is secluded but still not too far away from civilization. Taffy is quick to respond. Check in and check out is a breeze. Paddle boarding and boating on the lake is a lot of fun. Great views at sunrise and sunset. Dedicated fire pit convenient for making s'mores. All basic provisions are available.
Access road is rocky so a 4x4 helps. Shower force is extremely low and bath times are much longer. The house allows 4 guests, but wouldn't recommend it for 4 adults. 2 adults & 2 kids would be fine. It gets very hot in the afternoon and evening so the lack of air-conditioning makes it unpleasant. There's a ceiling fan & table fan though. It shouldn't be a problem if you're spending most of your time outside."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed this tiny house. It had everything we needed and the kids loved the lake.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Taffy’s place is as charming as they come - it even impressed my teenagers, which is no easy task. We all ohhhed and ahhhed as we pulled up as the sun started to set and they were both flummoxed as to how such a tiny house was able to hold the three of us as comfortably as it did. We enjoyed dinner around the fire ring, watching the sun set over the water, and all the fish and water fowl at the lake. It was the perfect place to get my kids off their screens for a spell. The water pressure in the shower was far from strong, but I didn’t book a tiny house for its water pressure. I booked it for a perfect getaway and that’s exactly what I got."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This tiny home was absolutely spectacular. The home is about 40 yards from a small lake. Paddle boats and life jackets were provided. We used the paddle boat around sunset and it was breathtaking! The home itself is comfortable. Opening all of the windows gave the house a nice breeze at night. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a secluded getaway!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to get away!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow, what a lovely place to relax on our road trip! There was a grate for the fire, which allowed us to cook/eat looking at the gorgeous views. There were roasting sticks as well. The boys had a blast fishing from the paddle boat and sleeping in the loft."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Taffy was super responsive and very helpful! We had some questions on checkin and she responded immediately and was a big help. Place was super pretty and exactly as described, really great area."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Check in was easy and house was beautiful!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I have been to the cabin at least 4 times now and we absolutely love it there. It is a wonderful place to get away, you have the whole lake to yourself, the stars to look at and just a getaway from a busy life."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fun place to go and relax. Lots of big fish in the lake!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, quiet and secluded but not far from interstate. Was hot, but a dip in the lake felt fantastic. Water pressure low, but as expected given location. My 17 year old daughter and friend loved the location,"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great getaway weekend!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to escape and relax! We used it as a ""base camp"" to hike Kings Peak and it was just what we needed. Secluded, peaceful, sunsets over the pond, lawn chairs for the porch, DVDs to watch, plenty of space considering the small home, and everything you need for basic cooking! Highly recommended"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great private tiny house. Loved paddle boarding and watching the sunset.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cool place. Though we only stayed one night en route across the country, we loved the setting. The sunset over the lake was beautiful. Interior was clean and comfortable. Shower was a bit tricky. Would still recommend the tiny house to both cross-country travelers and those looking for a relaxing and secluded getaway."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great cute place. Wish I could have stayed longer. Right by a lake, with a fire pit and near a few good food places."
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I was worried the pictures were too good to be true, but Taffy’s place was even better than the photos! You feel secluded even though you are so close to the town and the freeway. It’s a great weekend getaway."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,What can I say about this tiny home? It was incredible to stay in one and with all the common amenities at the palm of your hand. It was a very comfortable stay. Unfortunately it was too windy the day we arrived so my wife and I couldn’t enjoy a fire while sitting by the lake but regardless it was a beautiful location with incredible views and an amazing sunset. 10/10
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time, the lake house was spotless and comfy
the surrounding area was amazing, definitely a fun spot to get away from it all.
highly recommended!"
2020-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"What a cute spot! We took out the pedal boat, went for a walk around the property, and enjoyed a movie in the cozy tiny house! It was super windy and chilly but we still managed to get a fire going for some s’mores. Thank you for having us!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I know I will be coming back again . This was such a great place to recoup from the hustle and bustle of life . The lake, and beautiful Wyoming sunsets were breathtaking. This is a true retreat where you loose your watch and just enjoy the moment. My life goes 100mph and to just stop and enjoy the beauty of Wyoming was priceless . Taffy was a superhost in my opinion. She has created an oasis to just relax."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little place to stay. Very quiet and peaceful.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was great! The house was exactly as described and the lake and property are gorgeous.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks again for a great weekend!
2020-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was great. I came out for a solo prayer retreat that lasted a few days. I spent most of the time inside and the space was good for me. I had all the necessities I could want. The kitchen was well supplied with cookware. I didn't realize I would be as close as I was to other houses (there are some within eyeshot) and at night the highway is slightly audible. But the stars were perfect and it is a good place if you are looking for something a little away from human interaction, but not too far."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After our original “big anniversary trip” plans changed due to COVID, we decided that a nice get away nearer home would still be nice! Taffy’s place was a perfect getaway for us to spend together celebrating 30 years of marriage! We felt like we were in the middle of know where, and loved having our own little lake (if it was warmer I’d have been out on it the whole time,!). They have a few DVDs, if you want to watch TV. Overall it was an awesome weekend away!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great space to escape to. We stayed at the cabin for a night with our two boys. They loved it and want to return. The pond, boats, fire ring, and cabin made for a great experience."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A couple of friends of mine decided to run King's Peak, and we didn't want to camp out the night before, so Taffy's place was the perfect place to crash before the run. It was super cute and perfect for what we needed. I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the lake and the view. Super private and has everything you need for a relaxing trip! We loved the book about the family farm and the generations that have lived there. Plus, Taffy was super helpful and prompt with communication. Thanks! I plan on coming back with my family!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little place, extremely private and scenic"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful stay on a private lake. I woke up to eagles and antelope while watching the sunrise across the water. The place is small, but you will spend your days outside."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing. Perfect size for 1 or 2 ppl. Pond is beautiful, sunset was killer, insane stars. Temp drops rapidly here at night but I loved that and used the fire pit. Kayak and paddle boards are in great condition. Def a good get away spot without being too remote"
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"What a rustic oasis in the middle of otherwise pretty flat agriculture country. Highly recommend visiting flaming gorge. This place is pretty rustic, so make sure that’s what you’re looking for! Not too many fish, but the ones there are, are lunkers!"
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This tiny house is awesome. I spent a week to go hiking and I loved it. It is out in the middle of nowhere so you can get away for some rest and relaxation. The hosts are great and provide a very clean place. There is an outdoor covered picnic table to keep you out of the heat when eating outside. A great place to stay and thoroughly enjoyed my trip.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place is it! Solitude, Peace, Nature, Private Lake! What more could you ask for??? I stayed here for a month and loved it all. The sunrise from the bedroom window and the sunsets over the private lake were glorious. Surrounded by ducks, birds, cows, it was like I had friends everywhere. The stars and milky way every night, only an hour from great parks and mountains. I got to feed bulls with Tony a few times and join the family for pole vaulting practice. Lyman/Fort Bridger is such a fun area. Got to see a Horse Pull, Lassoing practice, go to parks, cook over a campfire. Truly a special place I am so grateful I got to spend a month there. Thank you Tony and Taffy!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a quiet weekend away!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"You are secluded and that is nice if that is what you want. The last little bit of road is a little rough, but Taffy let us know that. We didn't have any of the kids with us, but I'm sure kids would love the boats. And, except the the lovely morning, the wind was always blowing a bit. I believe that part of Wyoming is usually windy."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was very cool awesome view-very pretty lake with all sorts of boats paddle boards fire pit. Easy to get to - would definitely stay again!!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Do you love the outdoors? Do you love to fish and be on the water? How about wide open spaces with beautiful scenes for days??
If so, you’ll definitely want to stay here! My stay was extremely peaceful and relaxing. It was everything I was hoping for and more. I was driving through on my way to Colorado and I’m definitely sure I’ll have to stop back by and stay again on my way back."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great place to get away. Lake,house,seclusion,activities is all in this package. We had a awesome stay and so will do it again :)"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful pond. Nice little stay that satisfied my needs for the stay.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2019-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Really excellent.
""Pond"" isn't 100% accurate, more like a small lake.
Only downside is that the shower is pretty finnicky, but it's still do worth it"
2019-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It’s a great get away and you do have it to yourself but be aware it is ALWAYS windy up there I’m talking 30 mph winds so you may not even get to fish. We tried and couldn’t even get 10 ft off the bank. Nothing at all wrong with it just always windy.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place! We were visited by a few cows and lots of birds. Very cozy, comfortable, and easy to find with Taffy’s great directions."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved Taffy's cozy tiny house and beautiful fish pond. Expect to enjoy the water, gather around the campfire, and stare at the stars. Hope to stay here again."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute little place in a very peaceful setting.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful sunrises and sunsets! Very peaceful - enjoyed our stay. The paddle boat was awesome.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great place for rest and relaxation!
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the best place we stayed at during a 3-week trip across America. Such a nice little cabin on the lake. Paddle boards and canoe were a lot of fun. And a nice dock out on the water to swim off of. Beds were comfortable, kitchen was stocked with essentials, nice fire area outside, no issues with anything. Easy check in, kind hosts, super private."
2019-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Although we only spent one night here while we were passing through we loved it. There are tons of water activities that were available to use on the water and a great place for a fire pit when it gets dark. We wish we would have stayed an extra nigh to take advantage of this relaxing cabin. Thanks for the great time.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place to get away and enjoy the mountains! Would definitely recommend and can’t wait to go back.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was my second stay at Lida's place and it was just as great as the first. The house is roomy, comfortable and in a beautiful location. The hot tub was a real treat especially given the cold, snowy weather. Finally, you could not ask for a better stocked kitchen. You could make anything your heart desires which is a real plus given that the location doesn't lend itself to dining out.
Lida is a great host. She is very responsive, coaching us through replicating her excellent fire building skills by text for example."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Best stocked kitchen and bathrooms with lots of wood for keeping a warm fire going. We loved it

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful cabin in beautiful setting! This Airbnb was the best for well stocked kitchen, plenty of towels, TP and extras in the bathrooms. Nice bedrooms and comfortable beds with extra bedding if needed.
We loved the hot tub and being able to have our dog on this trip with us. Lida was excellent to communicate with and has done lots of extras to make anyones’s stay super nice.
This was a perfect stay for our large family! We hope to come again!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Lida is amazing host. The house is spectacular.
Please read the house rules thoroughly and keep the place charming ever. We overlooked house rules due to delayed start and partyd hard and left with some chores left.
Lida is super kind and we sorted out the issues.
Thanks Lida, we look forward to at your place next year. You are amazing person."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,You know when you walk in and your kids find one exciting thing after another? When your spouse seems happier and happier about the choice? That is what it was like for us. I was even delighted by how well furnished the kitchen was and I am a pretty picky guy when it comes to kitchen tools. We were all delighted the entire time. Thanks for sharing your place with us.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time spending our Christmas weekend there. Good snow, cony environment, hot tub worked perfectly, and very scenic. It had everything we wanted. Lida was a great host, from prompt and helpful communication to providing assistance when the Highway was closed for a few hours. We really loved our stay and would be happy to spend another weekend there in the future."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great cabin in an beautiful setting with an attentive host.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was the perfect getaway from the city. It’s totally worth making the winter visit because it’s like your own peaceful winter wonderland. The house was extremely clean and well stocked for any occasion. My toddler had multiple toys to play with plus endless hours of fun outside. We appreciate dog friendly options and this one is sure to please any four legged friend.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Mountain House is a wonderful property. If you love rivers, mountains, and farmland, this is the place for you. Lida was extremely responsive to any questions we had. We (my dog included) hope to return soon."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was awesome, so was Lida. However, I recommend taking screen shots of the directions and Wi-Fi password before you get close to the place when you still have solid cell service."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at the Mountain House. It was exactly what my family was looking for. A private cozy cabin vacation. The reservoir nearby was beautiful. Lida was great, very responsive, and helpful. My family would love to stay again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hands down one of the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Such a remote and unique experience. Lida was such a wonderful and thoughtful host and assisted us in every need we had during our stay. We will definitely be returning in the future. Hopefully this place remains a secret 🤫
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a good time on our visit. Everything ran smoothly. This cabin is so homey! Such a beautiful area, we were able to get out for a hike in the Unitas. The stove was amazing and the kitchen was well equipped! The hot tub was a nice bonus. This is a perfect cabin getaway and we didn’t want to leave!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was very cool and well stocked, and in a great location with lots of solitude! It was particularly child-friendly, we enjoyed the toys and books and how there was plenty of space for our toddlers to run around (inside and outside!)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for a week and it was the PERFECT reset. It was quiet, peaceful and felt like home. Lida was always so responsive and helpful. This place was perfect for our family reunion with 8 adults and 3 kids. Lida has thought of EVERYTHING. We would love to go back!! It’s truly a mountain paradise."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location. Host was friendly and attentive. We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend for a mountain setting vacation!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great week! Perfect for our kids to romp around the house and the lake.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a very enjoyable time at ""The Mountain Home"". Lida is a wonderful host, and helped us out with a lot of questions we had about the area. The property is beautiful. The cabin is clean, spacious, and very kid friendly. We will definitely make our way back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin is amazing. The kids were in heaven. The view is amazing, the stars are so bright, and you really get to connect with nature.
Lida is an excellent host. Very responsive and helpful. She is friendly and kind.
We definitely are going to come back to this cabin. It's our new favorite vacation spot."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect, just as listed, very clean, awesome place"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Mountain house was everything we wanted. Big well equipped house very comfortable beds. A perfect home base for exploring all the beauty WY has to offer. It is remote but that is what we wanted. Lida was extremely helpful with suggestions to see and do. Highly recommend her home!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted four things specifically:
-To see the stars
-To be in the mountains
-Have a fire (outside/inside or both)
-A hot tub
This checked every box and then some! Lida was super helpful is providing directions and making sure we were prepared and knew what to expect weather wise, as it had snowed up there. We arrived to a pristinely clean cabin, fire already going and delicious cookies.
The cabin has everything you need to feel cozy and at home. The views are absolutely stunning. Plenty of space. We pretty much stayed on the main floor. There’s 4 rooms upstairs and a bathroom with a tub. Washer and dryer is upstairs as well. Linens are all clean and fresh.
The main level has a bathroom and walk-in shower, huge kitchen with a really nice stove and utensils and/or all the bakeware/cookware you could possibly image, huge living room with wood burning stove, TV, desk, two couches, two recliners and 2 HUGE tables AND the MOST comfortable bed ever (for anyone who might not be able to do the stairs). It’s an excellent cabin for families! We stayed downstairs pretty much the entire time, because we have a blind dog and a paralyzed dog, so it was just easier. And frankly, it was cozy.
Lida was also kind enough to let us do a later check out since we got in a little later on the first day. She was just incredibly friendly and accommodating. I really couldn’t recommend this place more highly. 5 stars all around!! We will DEFINITELY be back again!"
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Great remote cabin! Tranquil and peaceful!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had an awesome time this weekend staying in this beautiful cabin with our Fur babies. It was so quiet and peaceful which was just what we needed to celebrate our 19th anniversary. The Jacuzzi was awesome! We highly recommend this place to stay at!!!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lida's house has everything you need and is incredibly spacious. We were there in the winter so could not take advantage of the warm weather areas (deck, barbecue, etc.) but we absolutely enjoyed watching the evening stars at night from the hot tub. And most of all, Lida is a great host."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Better than the listing describes. We were greeted by a fresh sprinkling of snow and a cozy wood stove warmed space. Lida’s cabin is spacious, has all the practical things you need for cooking group meals, and even had toys for our kids and two indoor tricycles. We were there during a winter storm and it was a cozy spot for our extended family to hang out, play games, make meals, and enjoy lovely views in the hot tub. We were offered sleds and snow shoes to explore. Beautiful area and Lida is very responsive to questions. We’ll be back!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved it! Everything was perfect! Can’t complain!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. So cozy and Lida is awesome. We will be back!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the cleanest, most amazing Airbnb we have ever been too! When we arrived Lida gave us a tour, made sure we didn't have any questions, she was so helpful! The location is awesome, we did some sledding, got to bring our pups, the fireplace was so cozy! We didn't want to go home! The kitchen had everything you could possibly need! We will definitely be returning!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The Mountain House is our favorite AirBnB that we have ever stayed at. It was everything described and more! Lida was an excellent host and we would definitely return to this property. Peaceful, quiet, great views, wildlife, walks in nature, nights by the fireplace…. It doesn’t get better than this, folks. And it was well stocked too! Everything needed to cook full meals, etc."
2021-10-01,2,Group trip,"Very very nice cabin. It was very cozy when we checked in. Only issue with cabin was one of guest bedrooms did not have a real mattress but a topper as a mattress.
Had some major miscommunication between both of us that created a bad experience. I wish we could have worked through the issue. I thought we had, but one of other owners got involved and asked us to leave. We happily left."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This area is secluded and beautiful. The house had all that you need. We enjoyed the craftsmanship and true cabin outing. We will be happy to return another time! It’s well stocked and very comfortable. The kids played and played outside! Great host. Used the greenhouse and cooked up some greens. Hot tub was great. Perfect for families.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, homey feeling getaway that we never wanted to leave. Breathtaking views, amazing wildlife, cozy atmosphere. This is the perfect getaway."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing property!!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This place is beautiful. I loved hearing the wind blowing through the aspens. The house is amazing with wood throughout. There is a nice open area to craft, watch tv, or read in the recliner by the wood stove. The kitchen is nice and roomy with a wide stove and oven. You will have to drive on well maintained dirt roads for about 15 minutes or so. We really enjoyed our stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderfully outfitted family rental - plenty of seating for meals and family time. Kitchen is well equipped. Plenty of linens and comfy beds, with bonus of toddler bed and that suited our family to perfection!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great property with amazing views of the Uinta Mountains! Cozy cabin retreat.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is hands down the best Air BnB we have ever stayed in (and we’ve stayed in so many!!). Lida has thought of everything for her guests comfort and care. The beds are incredibly comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked. The outdoor seating is beautiful and comfortable. The hot tub is a delightful bonus. Watching the hummingbirds on the back porch became our favorite activity! We could not have asked for a better place to stay for two weeks. My kids are already asking when we go back!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is beautiful and Lida was a great host!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Linda was amazing to work with! She met us with freshly baked cookies, answered the million questions we had quickly. The location was beautiful, and well stocked. She was kind to not only the adults but also our young boys. Would highly recommend this location to anyone!"

2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a awesome experience!
A perfect place to relax and rejuvenate in nature. A quiet area.
We enjoyed the cabin, hot tub, firepit, gourmet stove, and proximity to one of our favorite fishing spots.
The cabin was very comfortable and accommodating. The beds
It was fun seeing the greenhouse, and watching the hummingbirds fly around.
We enjoyed touring the property and admired the rock and milled woodwork that went into the cabin and out buildings
Beautiful."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Most excellent!
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,Mountain House was such a fun and perfect place for a weekend getaway with friends. Lida gave us a full tour and made sure we had everything we needed. We loved our stay there!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"What a wonderful, comfortable place! And what a great location from which to explore the surrounding areas.
We have been here for two weeks and often we didn't even see the need to leave the hillside. You can go hiking there, see the birds and wildlife, take a dip in the hot tub and enjoy the view, or go and feed the chickens and make a nice meal with the fresh eggs.
The house was built by Lida herself. Amazing place. Just look at the riverstone foundation. The floor heating is wonderful and a nice wood stove. The house has everything you need and Lida is very responsive if you would have any questions. And any time she would go to the supermarket, she would send me a message to ask if I needed anything. She brought cookies for the kids the neighbors baked, etc etc. She was excellent!
We will most definitely stay in touch with Lida and her family, and hopefully we will come back at some point to enjoy the place."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lida's place was incredible! It's a log cabin located at the base of the Uinta mountain range. The views were amazing and we loved being able to have our dogs, hike, cross country ski and just disconnect for a weekend. We will be back!"
2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Lida’s place was a nice DIY mountain house. I enjoyed the area and the quiet.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lida is incredible. She was very friendly, accommodating and very quick to respond with any questions.
She was flexible with the check-in and check-out process which was extremely helpful.
The home was charming, quaint and more necessities than we needed. We look forward to returning again in the future.
The best part, equipment for outdoor activities like sledding were provided."

Ps. The dog in that ranch is very friendly to people."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was clean the inside looked like the pictures, but much smaller than it looks in pictures, could not get a response about coffee pot: inquiring about what type of coffee pot or if it had one. Very quiet on a ranch."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Could not believe how much we enjoyed staying there!! The friends we were there to visit were amazed at what a nice place it was!! Their going to recommend it to everyone who comes to visit them!! Could not have been happier!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I had a lovely and comfortable stay! Everything was exactly like the photos, and it was easy to find and get in. My only quibble is that I'd wanted to do writing and remote work on the porch, but it immediately faces some industrial farm equipment that made it less relaxing than I'd imagined in advance. Otherwise, we had a lovely stay! Thank you all!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent place to stay. Pictures don’t do it justice. Great rustic aesthetic. Lots of space for our family in a rural area.
Super sweet host family."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here on our road trip and really loved the place There is no AC, however it is NOT necessary. We stayed here in July, middle of summer and it was more than comfortable just opening up the windows! We actually had to close the windows at night because it got chilly. It is quiet and the hosts were extra helpful and kind, would def book again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was great for my family while my parents were in town.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,So peaceful and serene! Beautiful quite home that was so clean. Beds were extremely comfortable. The view was amazing horses were beautiful!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Been here twice and it’s been a good experience both times!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was honestly perfect for me and my guest as we traveled for work. Everything matched the photos and our host and co-host were great! They communicated very well
with us to ensure everything transitioned well to our stay. They made sure that our questions were answered and we had the things we needed. Overall we enjoyed our stay with Evolve would definitely stay here again and I recommend this spot to anyone interested in it."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable place to stay. Had everything we needed and would stay there again.
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"What a beautiful place. Had everything we needed. Clean, quiet, peaceful. It was perfect."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location for our family to have a spot to rest for the late travel nights and especially when the roads were closed to WY.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Let start off with how wonderful this place was. The rustic feeling was fantastic felt just like home being from the country. Jake the caretaker I believe and ranch hand checked in on us because it was a winter advisory storm with multiple road closures making sure we were okay and seeing if we were going to make it in. Then to our surprise we let them know it was for a family get together and dinner for pre Christmas thing for family we haven’t spent holidays with for 7 years and they set up a Christmas tree and decorated it. Don’t know if it’s a normal thing but we absolutely appreciated it. Beds were so comfortable and really nice place even with it being well below 0 we were nice and warm. The kids loved seeing the deer right out the front window. Would highly recommend this and will probably end up booking it for our summer trips to see the family.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay here. Everything was clean, comfortable, and well taken care of. The hosts were very friendly. Our kids loved getting to see the ranch, especially the horses."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and his nephew stayed here while they were hunting in the area, and they absolutely loved it, they were blown away by how nice it was! They felt very spoiled to have such an amazing spot as their home base (you’re welcome, honey)."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place and very helpful hosts. Will definitely be returning to stay here again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute townhouse 🏡 on a ranch…. I definitely recommend staying here! Good for families.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a really nice place. Just off the Interstate enough to be peaceful. I would stay there again. Host was very good at communicating before we got there to make our stay 5 star.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family enjoyed our stay. It was clean, the beds were very comfortable and dog-friendly/ kid-friendly. The house had everything we needed plus a beautiful location."
2024-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The space was perfect for our needs, and we found the beds and furniture to be comfortable. The location is very remote and even several days after a snow storm the route can be treaturous. I was nervous one of my relatives might slide off one of the drop-offs and die in an accident on their way to the house. It is probably very lovely in non-winter months.
Bring Firewood with you. There's a fireplace but the host didn't seem to know about the fire shed that was referenced in the house manual. Also note that the pictures show an air mattress in the loft but there is no air mattress in the place. If you have kids that will want to sleep in the loft be sure to bring something to sleep on.
The kitchen was fully equipped and the pantry even had some extras that we found useful. The host was very accommodating when they were responsive."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Awesome stay. We'll definitely rebook when we visit Evanston again. Simply put, it was home away from home."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beautiful! New, fresh, cozy and comfortable. Everything was as advertised. The host was responsive and the location is convenient. We will be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Friendly hosts, clear instructions, beautiful place!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Barn is next to the owners’ house but still feels private and really safe. Great place for a couple to stay to explore Southwest Wyoming.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed at Amy's rental on a work trip. It is a very cool place with fast internet, it was perfect for my work trip."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The little house had everything we needed including a wonderful kitchen where we prepared our own dinner.
We enjoyed a long walk around the property including watching the horses munch in the nearby fields.
Amy and family were friendly and welcoming.
A great place to stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amy and her boys greeted me enthusiastically and then I had the home to myself. The home was clean, peaceful and quaint. Great host, wonderful place to rest up, off the beaten path. A winner!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,such wonderful people and a beautiful place
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a wonderful place to stay. Very clean and quiet. We will definitely stay again!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,nice and quiet
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"great, very clean and quiet."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of AirBnB's finest!!!  Decided to swing back through for a 2nd night.  Great place, great hosts, great location. Amy and her husband are good people who go out of their way to make you feel right at home and they are more than happy to provide local info, history, contacts and recommendations.  The converted Barn on their ranch is the perfect distance from Lyman and Flaming Gorge, southern Wyoming and northern Utah and is a great way to slow down and disconnect in a very peaceful county setting. Wish we could have stayed longer.  Very highly recommend and we definitely plan to return when we have more time! 10 out of 5 stars! Worthy of a featured Stay/Destination on AirBnB or magazine article.... Thanks so much for everything!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute place Amy was very accommodating and responsive!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A great tiny house type rental. Host is extremely responsive. The unit is very clean with both a bedroom and a loft bedroom. Kitchen is a full kitchen with basic supplies. Bathroom is clean and very functional. Unit is built into a barn. Easy to find on a gravel road. Very easy place to stay while traveling rather than a traditional hotel. Our second stay here and will likely be back next time we are traveling past the area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect for a quick overnight stop on my way from Colorado to Idaho. Amy was super responsive to my questions and even welcomed me when I arrived. Easy to find and in a very quiet/peaceful area. The accommodations were perfect and very clean. Highly recommended, will be staying here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful property, incredible sunrises. Amy was very welcoming and had lovely accommodations. We stayed on our trip to Fort Bridger before heading 3 hours north to Jackson."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of AirBnB's finest!!! Great place, great and helpful host, just wish we could have stayed longer!  Very highly recommend and would book again in an instant! 10 out of 5 stars!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Cuteness overload! We will be back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a great stay at Amy’s barn. Her family was very welcoming and did their best to ensure we had everything we needed. She even had warm zucchini bread ready for us upon arrival. I would highly recommend this as a place to stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"oh my gosh! What a cute place!! Amy's tiny home was so nice. It was far enough outside of town to feel remote, yet only a few minutes drive back to the main road. The pictures do not even do it justice! I could literally just live there. It was very comfortable and homey. There were even snacks. We will definitely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was awesome and clean. Loved the loft and the bathroom/shower was cool. Never seen a shower like that, was really nice"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place. I truly enjoyed my stay. It has everything you need and I would highly recommend it. It is off the beaten path, but that was great also."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amy's always super helpful and kind. Love staying at the Barn!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I don't often give a 5 rating but ""The Barn"" is wonderful. It is just the right size and was delightful. The bed was very comfortable and clean. It also gave a delightful night sky viewing!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My brother and I stayed at the Barn prior to hiking Kings Peak, then the night after.
It's a very cute and cozy place, very clean, the perfect size for the two of us, and we had everything we needed.
Amy was a wonderful host! Thank you again, we hope to return someday!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was very clean and it looked almost new on the inside -- cabinets, countertops, appliances, etc. The ""tiny house"" worked well for me, as I was by myself. It would probably be OK for a couple, but I think it would be cramped for 4 people. One of the ""bedrooms"" is an open loft that you have to climb a ladder to get to.
The place is very nice on the inside, particularly the kitchen area. It is fairly small though.
The owners are very friendly and the ""tiny house"" is next to their house. The place is very peaceful and quiet, which is what I was looking for.
It had 2 TV's -- one upstairs and one in the bedroom -- but I never turned them on. There was a roku remote, so presumably you can use apps through roku. The wifi worked very well for me. The temperatures were such that I did not need to use either the heating or cooling, so I do not know how well they worked.
I enjoyed staying here and I would like to stay here again if I am back in the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved staying here! I was traveling across the country and they were very accommodating, even coming out to meet me as I arrived. The place was beautiful and the area was as well. I would definitely recommend staying here :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great parking, easy to find, super clean, easy to get inside."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Stayed one night while driving across the country. The unit was spotless clean. Bed was very comfortable. Unit was exactly as described and pictured. Very quiet at night. Hosts were very responsive and helpful.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a cozy stay! The space was perfect for an overnight stay. The bed was comfortable and we appreciated the design.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another easy, enjoyable stay here. The place is exactly as described & the host Amy is friendly & very easy to communicate with. Thanks for the muffins - they were delicious!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A nice quiet space with all the necessities to be comfortable.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute place. Not far off highway but very peaceful.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying here!! Wonderful host and perfect stop off before heading out to hike Kings Peak.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place met all our needs perfectly. It was decorated well and very homey. We loved all the snacks and the water, thank you Amy! We will recommend to our friends and family in the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"After driving 1200 miles my band mate and I were looking for something clean, comfortable and not what bigger chain hotels and motels were charging. I found Amy’s place and requested a reservation after 7:30pm on the night we needed it. She responded well within an hour and sent detailed and easy to follow directions. We got to the property at 11 pm with the access code in hand and we’re actually blown away. What you see on the pictures is exactly what this place is modern and rural at the same time with one exception the pics can’t express the actual comfort and charm of not only the barn but the whole property. High end finishes and crisp clean linens make this place instantly feel like a little home. If you pass this place up you really are making a mistake. The Barn is worth every penny and is vastly superior to any overpriced and underwhelming motel or hotel your going to find in the same area. I would go out of my way to stay here again. Thanks Amy for the wonderful experience."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"After a 14 hour drive, The Barn was a wonderful stopping point for us to relax and rest before continuing our trip the next morning. We loved the interior. It was very tastefully decorated and felt like those tiny homes you see on HGTV. The bed was comfortable and snacks were very much appreciated. We wished we could have stayed longer as the views were pretty cool too. The hosts were very responsive and we enjoyed chatting with them."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can't say enough about how much I loved this place. Yes, it's tiny. Yes, it's part of a barn. And it's so brilliantly designed that it has everything you need, crammed into a very small, charismatic space. Amy and Kolby and their kids are wonderful people, and the setting is gorgeous -- a great view of the mountains, plus some lovely horses wandering by.
I'd stay here again in a heartbeat, and Amy and Kolby are the sort of people I'd be thrilled to see on my own doorstep. :)"

The host add a special touches by leaving fresh cookies. That made my daughter so happy! When I asked what she thought of our stay she said, “This place is fun and nice and I hope we stay here again.”
Guests are asked to not wear shoes in the apartment anytime. I appreciated this for keeping the space nicer. Also, it was rainy the second day that we were there and the parking area in front of the apartment was muddy. The tile floors in the kitchen were cold so I would recommend extra socks or slippers. The bedroom and loft are carpeted so they were comfortable.
I would highly recommend staying here."

Their attention to detail is phenomenal. We loved the little lights that adorned the inside of the house, as it contributed to a lovely ambient. We have never stayed at an Airbnb where the interior was similar to one straight out of a magazine. The bed was so cozy & the bathroom had everything you could need. This place in all seriousness felt like home & is in pristine condition. Kristie was extremely prompt with communication & you can tell she cares about ensuring that her guests have a great stay.

It was very comfortable and made a wonderful base camp after hard days hiking in the foothills & mountains. The separate bedrooms ensured a good nights rest and the kitchen was a must as we planned all of our own meals. Teresa was accommodating, friendly, and respectful of our privacy. She did a fantastic job hosting us. We will be back in the future if lucky enough to draw tags again. Highly recommended as a great little hideaway in Henefer. Thank you Teresa and family!!

We were close to lots of different lakes, and the scenery around is so beautiful. It was fun to just drive around & enjoy the red rocks and country lands. We found a cute small petting zoo about 40 min away and went to that with the kids and we had so much fun! We will come back here! The host was so nice as well! Very responsive."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures sincerely do not do this place justice. The view is INCREDIBLE. Absolutely stunning. The house was great and had everything we needed for our long weekend. Thank you, Emily, for letting us rent this place! It was perfect :)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stood here 3 times this winter and loved every moment of it.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"amazing place with an amazing view, spacious and well stocked with things you need. I loved that after a day of snowboarding, we have this nice cozy place to relax."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay. Emily was extremely helpful too.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful scenery, peaceful surroundings, clean, comfortable, spacious, and lots of character. I would describe it as a private studio-ish place. (Meaning, the bedroom does not have privacy doors.)
The pictures need to be updated on the site, as it has been more fully decorated, and the details put into it are just darling. The place is absolutely charming.
It was hard to leave, and go back to city life.
We went to the Thurston family sleigh rides, (year round) and really enjoyed it! A must visit.
Location is amazing! Close to several lakes, Salt Lake City, Ogden, SLC airport, ski resorts etc., most within 20-60 minutes.
Highly recommend staying here. You will not regret it. The price is amazing!! :)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The nicest guest house I’ve ever stayed in. I stayed to work through the week and ski at Snowbasin, a short drive away. Kitchen is fully stocked with appliances and accessories. Plenty of work space, even for two people, and WiFi worked great. Emily was super flexible and responsive my whole stay. Plan to visit again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emily's place was great! The place and the yard were beautiful, and it was bigger than it looked in the pictures. She gave us great directions with pictures to make the place easy to find and get into."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn't recommend this place more if I tried. The chalet is simply enormous, incredibly well-appointed, and really close to the ski slopes. It even comes with an elevator in case of mobility issues! Check-in was easy, the host incredibly responsive, our stay quiet: all in all an amazing experience."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying with Emily, it was just as we remembered with a cute ski theme update. Spacious, quiet spot, great for working while the husband skied Snowbasin. Hope to see you next ski season."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, tastefully decorated and great communication. Had everything needed for a getaway and an amazing space to relax. Highly recommend and hope to stay again in the future!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emily's home is now one of our most favorite airbnbs. We loved the peace and quiet. And, the view was nothing short of fabulous. the only thing I would caution is that this home is not easily accessible for anyone with challenges walking. to enter the home, you do have to leave the walkway and climb a small hill that is not well lit. however, if you don't have any limitations, this home is an absolute treat! Emily's home is now one of our most favorite places to stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emily was such a great hostess, flexible to our stay. We really enjoyed the views to the balcony and the very quiet neighborhood perfect for a weekend gateway."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Relaxing, beautiful & comfortable. A place I'd like to return to again and again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Emily’s place is a wonderful stay. Originally I though it was part of the main house but it is a full separate unit built above a two car garage at the back of the property. The property is immaculate as is the entire neighborhood of gorgeous homes. It is a quiet residential area- so if your looking for a party space- this is not it. The apartment is exactly as pictured and described. It’s an open floor plan with only one bedroom and a trundle bed in the family room. The bedroom is literally open to the kitchen with no door so not a lot of privacy- but for a family with two kids or couple traveling alone it’s perfect! It’s about 20 minutes away from Snowbasin and the main City of Ogden. There’s a little grocery store down the highway with everything you need. Emily was very kind and responsive- great hostess. Would love to come back in the wintertime for some skiing. This place is a wonderful value.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property and pristine living space. Emily was amazing and accommodating. We will definitely be back
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Perfect place
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home is beautiful, and the views are stunning! Mountain View’s out every window and tons of wildlife right in the yard! We felt right at home and loved the easy entry and the upgraded amenities like real feather down pillows and cozy blankets and quality towels. Not to mention tons of coffee and tea options, even some snacks and Utah truffles provided. Emily was super responsive and an excellent communicator. Almost hate to share the review because I’d like to keep it my own little secret escape lol
Definitely would return!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love the space! Love the wildlife around the mountains and easy access to skiing. Emily’s cats are very cute and friendly and one greeted me outside while walking up to my chalet:).

We can't say enough about Emily's place and Emily as a host. We hope to come back as our experience was very positive."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful stay, absolutely great! Here for an incredibly relaxing week. Large Airbnb (bigger than some apartments I’ve had lol), very clean and modern and comfortable. Comfy beds. Most comprehensive kitchen I’ve ever seen in an Airbnb. Super quiet. Super safe. Super private. Great view of the mountains. Tons and tons of thoughtful touches, from the decorations to board games/puzzles to little soaps and fragrances to spices and oils for cooking... really thought of everything. Top tier Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. Excellent location that is in nature but only 20mins from stores and restaurants (and 45 from the airport and downtown SLC, 50mins to Park City).
The host was delightful and extremely responsive. Helped with multiple needs throughout the stay super quickly and graciously. Very nice family and pets as well (not inside the Airbnb, which is separate, but greeting us to and from our car). Check-in and check out were a breeze.
Strongly recommended, great find. Will definitely be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is wonderful. We truly enjoyed our stay… in fact, we didn’t want to leave. The neighborhood is wonderfully quiet, and the views from the guesthouse are outstanding. We especially enjoyed the visits from the family cats, and being greeted by the chickens as we came and went. We slept very well, in the most comfortable bed, pillows, and linens. There were yummy surprises left for us to eat. The kitchen has all the supplies and gadgets, a person would need to cook a nice meal. Emily has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable and lovely."

It is an amazing experience with incredible views and majestic birds chirping. Unbelievably relaxing. Furnished with everything you need. The unit is Clean, roomy and has a lofty style. But most importantly is the views. That’s all we came here for and they were well worth it! Emily was also very accessible and responds fairly quickly. I would definitely stay here again when I return to the area. We loved our stay at Emily’s place! Thank you Emily!"

The kitchen had everything we needed to cook/bake and even had a coffee maker and tea kettle (with a nice assortment of coffee, tea, and snacks as well). The smart TV was great for watching shows/movies and listening to music. There was an awesome selection of books and boardgames - we played a ton of scrabble. Overall, such a pleasant stay and I’d love to do it again:) Thanks Emily!"

The kitchen was stocked with snacks, and if you decided to stay and cook, there are plenty of dishes and pans provided. The living room was also a big bonus as there was a huge flat-screen TV for you to watch Netflixor any other app you have access to.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay. 10/10
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place to stay really nice !
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a few days to myself in relative peace and quiet to do some writing. This place was great for that (except for some work going on in the sub-basement, it didn't last long). Tons of space, gorgeous well-appointed kitchen, super friendly host. This is an over the garage space that feels like a condo. Perfect for one or two people, there is a comfy single in the living room, perfect for watching Netflix or Amazon or Disney+ on a very large screen. The views are awesome out the windows and on the small deck. The whole area is gorgeous. I found hiking trails a mile or two down the road and I jogged them every day. It is ""out there"" a ways, so if that's what you're looking for, this is the place. There's a small market/gas station about a mile away. And a grocery store about five miles away in Morgan. Or you're ten minutes from South Ogden. But the kitchen has a full-size refrigerator, so do some shopping and then use the handy elevator to bring up your bags. Cute place!! Chicken coop right outside the door. Deer wander around at night, and likely other critters. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The views alone are five stars here. The hosts is friendly and accommodating and the place is clean, modern and spacious but still has a warm vibe with the butter yellow tiles and fireplace in the kitchen. Emily even offered fresh eggs (from her chickens) and cream for breakfast. Really great touches on what is a beautiful property."
