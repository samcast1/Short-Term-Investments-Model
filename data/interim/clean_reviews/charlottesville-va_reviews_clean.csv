2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space with lovely hosts! Would definitely stay here again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved Michael and Karen’s property. We were in town for UVA’s graduation and this was a fantastic location within walking distance. The kitchen was perfectly stocked, the bed was extremely comfortable and messages were responded to within a very short time. We had one request and they were very accommodating (thank you). If you are needing a place to stay in Charlottesville this would be a great choice."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re a couple or single person that wants a perfectly located rental in/around downtown Charlottesville, this is the place for you.
Convenient, clean, quiet, older neighborhood. I walked home from downtown twice because the weather was so nice….right at a mile’s distance. Equally close to the UVA campus if you’re visiting for activities there.
Relative new construction and beautifully kept.
Could not have found a better match for my needs. Thankful to the hosts for their hospitality."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check in, all good, great location close to Grounds."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay near many Charlottesville attractions! Perfect for 2 people. Very clean, neat, and well stocked. Would stay again if in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot near campus! I stayed here for five days waiting for my apartment in town to be ready and what a great find! Right on the edge of campus, which was perfect for me to walk to work at the hospital! Michael was very responsive when I messaged him. Everything was very clean and it was a beautiful space! Nice and quiet and parking was convenient! Thanks for a perfect stay, Michael!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great stay located right the heart of Charlottesville! Michael was so responsive and helpful with questions and recommendations.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in Charlottesville. We visit a few times a year as our daughter is a student at UVA. The location was perfect-walkable to the university but peaceful in a small neighborhood. The accommodations were perfect-bed was comfy, very clean and modern apartment over a garage. Loved having off street parking. We will definitely book again when we need to be back in town!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved our one night stay at The Groundskeeper! My husband and I were in town for a concert and wanted something walkable to the John Paul Jones Arena. It was about a 15 minute walk. We felt comfortable and right at home in the guest house! The designated park spot was definitely a plus as well! Would definitely stay again!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was exactly what we needed! It's small but cozy and comfortable. Think a hotel room but a bit bigger, much nicer and with a full kitchen. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked with supplies (we cooked breakfast). The location was right where we needed, so it worked out great for us."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband Mat and I stayed here for our wedding week and it was so perfect for just us two, and even ok for a couple nights with my stepson on a small blowup. It was a little tight with him there, but still just felt cozy and reminded us of old school family vacations when it doesn't matter where or how you sleep!
The owners had a bottle of wine, a welcome note, and flowers waiting for us which was the nicest touch. Everything was just as expected, if not better, and so clean and felt very open and not cluttered at all even for a studio/loft style space.
The price felt like a total steal, and they were so prompt and helpful with any needs we had. They even offered more than we could've asked for or expected!
We highly recommend this place to stay. And plan to utilize them again if ever needed!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was wonderful stay. The room was excellent!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb was perfect for my husband and I when we needed a place to stay after a concert at JPJ. It was within walking distance to the arena and great restaurants. The place was beautiful, clean, and well thought out. We will definitely be back!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"5 stars. If arriving on gameday (Scott Stadium) be sure to tell the traffic control that you are staying on Lewis Mountain Rd. Great hosts, extremely accommodating! Beautiful property, we absolutely recommend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First, you cannot beat the location. You're right on the doorstep of UVA's campus in the most beautiful neighborhood. The Groundskeeper is private and has its own parking space. It has all of the amenities you could ask for and is a very comfortable living space. We really enjoyed our time here and the access and proximity to the city. Michael and Karen are gracious hosts and no doubt will assist their guests with anything they might need."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely Airbnb! We had a great time!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Michael's place was so awsome. We were in town to see a concert at John Paul Jones arena.we arrived a little early and Michael was so nice to let us in. The room is very cozy and just like the pictures. we couldn't have asked for more and will likely come back another time to just explore Charlottesville some more.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Michael and Karen were great hosts. Their Groundskeeper guest house was brand new and just as advertised. The location was near the UVA campus and close to everything in Charlottesville. We would definitely hope to return on a future visit.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beyond our expectations- felt like we were the first people to ever stay there it was clean and had that fresh brand new smell. Tucked in back of property feels private, perfect location near campus"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this place for my parents (both mid-60’s) and it was perfect. I wanted a comfortable, safe, quiet and peaceful space for them. It was their first visit to Charlottesville and they thoroughly enjoyed the place. They had no issues checking in whatsoever and were so excited to show me the place, even though I was already familiar with it based on photos :).
They enjoyed the area and went for morning walks during their stay, enjoying the UVa grounds. Michael was very responsive when they had a question, and the place was just as it was pictured. Thanks Michael for taking good care of my parents!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great overall & wonderful location. Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful time in Charlottesville and loved the proximity of the place to the city.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This comfy and convenient haven ticked all my boxes: close to restaurants, a market, and the downtown mall, plenty of amenities, and ample parking. (Be sure to look for the coffee and tea area outside the bedroom door.) When I needed a break, the beautiful backyard and patio beckoned. I hope to return whenever I’m in the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot and well situated. Left the car behind both nights and walked to town for dinner. Would certainly stay again if we revisit Charlottesville
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"It's a great and cozy little place to spend a few nights. It's quiet and you can hear birds singing in the morning. The owners have the most adorable dog, which you might be lucky enough to glimpse!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Liz’s place is a wonderful place to stay for a quick night in the heart of Charlottesville. It’s really close to the walking mall and there’s an awesome little art park a couple blocks away. We are at brazos tacos there and strolled through all the sculptures and paintings and flowers afterwards. The whole place was clean, well lit to get in and out. It is inside their house, and they were there while we were, but they won’t bother you unless you bother them or initiate it. The laundry room you enter into is theirs, and someone was doing laundry when we got there. But there’s a door between that room and your room so it can be private even so. There’s a nice double door to the back yard with tables and chairs amongst numerous plants. Heated bathroom floor was awesome. There’s a corner store right across the street. Street parking, but didn’t have an issue. Suitable for one person or a couple, but I wouldn’t recommend more than that. Small mini fridge. Would recommend."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Accommodation was lovely, perfect for a weekend getaway. Even a small kitchenette area just outside the private bedroom stocked with the essentials. Loved the location, walking distance to downtown Charlottesville where we saw a show. Overall I would definitely stay again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic little garden hideaway just a few blocks from historic downtown, mall, and great restaurants. Can’t wait to come back!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a sweet spot in a great location. It was an easy walk to the pedestrian mall and there are great eating places within walking distance.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,was all around wonderful
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was a very pretty cozy room. The bed was very comfortable. The water in the water filter needed to be changed and there was no bottled water. Filtered water is recommended for the French press Liz provided for coffee so it would have been helpful to have filtered water. Otherwise, it was a good location and a quiet room."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place if you need an overnight place for an event at John Paul Jones Arena.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Liz’s place was a refuge inside Charlottesville. Her backyard patio was a perfect spot to catch up on some overdue reading and to watch songbirds. The room was comfortable and cozy and close walking distance to the Ix Artpark (7 mins.) & downtown pedestrian zone (14 mins.). I hope to stay here in the future!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,What a lovely room with private bathroom. Fresh flowers welcomed me into the room which was spacious and felt like home. Liz was responsive to my questions and gave clear instructions of how to enter. It was only 5 minutes to a downtown hotel where I attended a conference. I really wished that I could have stayed longer to enjoy the sites in and around Charlottesville and to enjoy this homey room that looked out into a nice patio. I highly recommend this room with Liz as homeowner.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for a little getaway to Charlottesville! Walkable to the downtown mall and the University grounds, but far enough that it’s quiet and parking is easy to find. We loved walking into the Belmont neighborhood for dinner and drinks. Liz and Rachel were so very kind, accommodating, and responsive. Beautiful room! Would definitely book again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great! - clean and comfortable, very nicely furnished and equipped place to stay. The bed was very comfy, the shower was one of the best, the thoughtfully equipped coffee bar had a (rare) electric kettle for making better-than-Keurig coffee or tea (of which there was a nice selection.) The heated bathroom floor was the cherry on the cake since we were there during some chilly weather. We walked to Lampo, the nearby restaurant that Liz recommends, and had a really wonderful meal. Great airbnb.
Thank you Liz!
--Trudi Steigerwald"

I would definitely stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very comfy bed - the suite had everything I needed for a brief stay and it was so nice that she had a pitcher of filtered water, tea, coffee, granola bars and oatmeal available, I love it when Airbnb hosts provide little extras like that."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very responsive host. Easy to find and we were given very clear instructions how to access the private suite. Very comfortable bed, the softest sheets I have ever slept in. Everything was just right. House plants and eclectic decor made me feel right at home!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! It was perfect––Liz's place was so comfortable and convenient for my 11-year-old daughter and me. We visited Charlottesville for a quick overnight trip while we were in MD/DC for the Christmas holiday. We live in Los Angeles, and I always do a side trip when we visit my parents in MD/DC to introduce my LA-raised daughter to East Coast cities. I highly recommend Liz's place, and I would stay there again."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a spur of the moment, decision for us, and we were lucky to find Liz‘s place. It was clean. It was quiet, was private and comfortable. We had a little glitch involving heating our place on a cold evening, and Liz responded promptly and when the heater couldn’t be adjusted, she brought us a space heater right away, and had the HVAC guy out the next day. Also, the bathroom floor is heated. Sounds like a small thing, but I wish we had one at home. We’d be happy to stay with Liz again, especially in the warmer time of the year when we could really enjoy the patio. Thanks for a great stay Liz!,"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Stopped for a very quick visit. We enjoyed our stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Liz and Rachel's airbb was awesome! Easy check in and close to everything with free on street parking. Comfortable bed and nice sheets.

2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"This spot was very functional for what we needed - a quick overnight in Charlottesville to look around the town and visit UVA on the way to the Shenandoah valley. It was clean with a comfortable bed and a functional layout. We liked the separate entrance through the courtyard and the separation from the main house via a shared breezeway. This place does not have a kitchen so it may not be ideal for a longer stay, but has some kitchen amenities like a small refrigerator with filtered water and a coffee maker and other kitchen items in the breezeway. It’s a fairly easy 6-ish block walk to the downtown outdoor mall. Overall, it worked well for our needs. Liz also offered us an early check in, which coincided exactly with our arrival in town so we appreciated that perfect timing!"

Wish we had more time to enjoy the garden area but did enjoy the birds in the morning. As for the room itself, just as described with a wonderfully comfortable bed and cozy space. Extremely clean with linens and clear instructions. Liz was so sweet to reach out and offer her assistance if needed. We will be sure to return when on the area"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here. It’s super close to our favorite taco spot , Brazos, and our favorite breakfast spot Belle. There was plenty of parking and when we didn’t want to drive the 5-10 min the downtown Ubers were easy to get and cheap. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little place for a couple to stay in in Belmont near the downtown mall. Private entrance, well appointed with mini fridge, toaster, microwave, and coffee stuff. The bed/pillows are nicer than a lot of beds you see at air bnbs.
All in all, a perfect spot to stay when in Charlottesville as it is close to highways and downtown stuff."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,cozy spot to spend a business trip. Nice bed with Streaming TV. Convenient for short walk or drive to breweries and restaurants
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice spacious suite, had everything you need & great location very close to UVA."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"10/10 experience! Fantastic for a long or short stay. Great location, very homey, and hosts are super friendly. Wouldn’t change a thing!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pretty, quiet, attractive. I hope to go back some day."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great neighborhood with easy street parking and walking distance from restaurants, breweries, and art. The place was cute and inviting with nice art on the walls, games, and coffee and snacks. Would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved staying here! The room is so pretty and clean. Very walkable
to good restaurants and a wonderful location from which to explore Charlottesville."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the decor. Also, this air BNB is in a walkable safe neighborhood. Liz left plush towels, needed toiletries and great coffee and snacks. Would consider staying there again if in Charlottesville."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Liz’s place is a comfortable, clean and safe spot just off a main road, walkable to downtown Charlottesville. Even though it is close to a larger street, it is very quiet. Very clean, with nice furnishings and easy to find and check in. Liz communicated well. The listing is accurate, a little path takes you to a comfy back yard and the entrance."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, super cute, and very clean!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed both the space, which was perfect for my brief stay, and conversation with the co-hosts Leigh and Nathan. Hope our paths cross again soon!"
2023-06-01,3,Stayed one night,Adequate stay and the suite was clean. We would have enjoyed our stay more if the outdoor space was nicer. The neighborhood was a little sketchy. Inside amenities were as described.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is really nice and extremely well located. Liz and the others were very helpful and responsive. One thing to know, the room is off a shared entryway. You get a key to the entryway and your room and bathroom are your own, but it seemed like you couldn't really lock the room from the outside if you need to leave for part of the day. You can lock it from the inside."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect for a quick trip. Peaceful retreat while being very walkable to lots of restaurants and entertainment options. Will be back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay. Easy check in and check out instructions, very responsive to messages"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Comfiest bed I’ve ever slept on
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, tucked in a sweet backyard of roses & fireflies. Close to everything but still quiet while we were there."
2023-06-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"First, you have to walk through the side of the yard that has overgrown foliage in the way. It is inconvenient. Second, as soon as you open the door there is the horrible stench of pet excrement spilling over from the main house. When checking for bedbugs, I found the mattress littered with huge stains, like it was taken from trash on the side of the road. Also, the plumbing in the bathroom backed up with little use. I usually don’t complain but I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice sunny little place. Not the best neighborhood, but i felt safe enough. Comfy bed, nice decorations"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Liz’s place was perfect for our one night stop we had in Charlottesville. It was an easy walk to local restaurants and shops. The bed was the most comfortable bed of our road trip! The room was very cozy and we felt at home. We enjoyed our quick stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was headed to Charlottesville for a wedding and to celebrate my birthday! Found Liz’s place not far from downtown (an easy 15 minute walk)! Her instructions on how to get into the room were very detailed and made check in a breeze. The co-hosts were ext really friendly and even took the time to wish me happy birthday! Whenever I make it back to Charlottesville, I’ll definitely be checking their place out in the future! Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay! Easy to find with available street parking. Clean space that provided a private get away.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,private and easily accessible entry
2023-05-01,3,Stayed one night,"The room and amenities are exactly as described; however, I didn’t find the place as clean as others described. The shower curtain was stained and there were cobwebs. The washer & dryer, albeit nice that it’s available for use during our stay, was full of pet hair in the washer window and dryer filter was packed with an inch of lint & pet hair. I don’t mind pets by any means but when it comes to sharing a common space (ie laundry room), I would expect it to be cleaner.
Pulling up the to Airbnb left very little to be desired as the place was unkempt, where the grass hasn’t been mowed in weeks and landscaping overgrown. Furthermore, when coming and going from the Airbnb at night (which is located in the back of the house), lighting was minimal which made it hard to see walkways. Windows all around made it feel like someone was always watching when coming and going.
Positives: great communication from all hosts, thoughtful amenities, comfy bed, and heated floors. Worth it? Debatable."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is peaceful and close to UVA!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Liz’s place was the perfect stay in Charlottesville. I wish we were there longer, just a quick trip to break up a drive.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Liz was very responsive, even reaching out to us the day prior to let us know that we could check in early. The stay was as billed, and everything was very smooth with our stay (albeit a brief one)!

Amazing food, cocktails, and people!! Would 100% stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and comfortable stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable space with a beautiful surrounding yard and garden. Liz and roommates are very responsive and helpful and friendly. If you're looking for super super quiet, you can hear some car noise from the nearby busy street (only during rush hours) but the proximity to Central Charlottesville was worth it for me. Lots of extra thoughtful amenities like games and snacks in the room. Very comfortable, very easy and very convenient stay in Charlottesville."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Liz was responsive and helpful. The room was exactly as described and very clean. I appreciate the eco friendly choice in products and the toiletries that were provided!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Liz's twice - one night on our way to and one night on our way home from the OBX. For us it was the perfect mid-way crash pad. The room was clean, comfortable, nicely decorated and the hosts were super nice! Would recommend."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved having the balcony to enjoy our coffee every morning!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great area you can walk to restaurants, breweries(follow the Ale trail if you want), to UVA campus. We parked our car and did not move it. If you are able to take the train the station is across the street. If you can eat at least one dinner at Maya they have a wonderful menu and great food and service. The Blue Moon Diner about 1 block away is an excellent choice for breakfast. Lot of locations you can walk to."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful apartment in an unbeatable location. Access was easy and we had everything we needed. I appreciate a place with comfortable chairs throughout and a full table and nice balcony to the street. I would not plan to actually try sleeping on the hard and pokey couch/futon, but that was not an issue for us."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful location; however, it is very noisy from the street traffic and foot traffic. It is unlikely you will sleep soundly due to the loud cars, screaming patrons on the street, and trash bags of glass bottles being thrown away at 6:30 am. The amenities are as listed and the pictures provided in the listing somewhat match the apartment. The bed and the couch are on the uncomfortable side. There was hair on two of the bathroom towels and on the shower floor. Overall, this was not a great experience."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time in downtown Charlottesville! Apartment is walking distance to so many restaurants/shops/things to do. We had no issues with street parking. Would definitely stay at this location again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great location and a restful sleep. The neighborhood is hopping here, but quiet inside the flat."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Prime location with everything you need inside and more. I forgot my hair dryer but they had one there. Tea and coffee. All the comforts of home. Nice getaway for my finance and I.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed my time at Peter’s place. It’s very central to everything. A 10 min walk from downtown and 15 min walk to the UVA campus. Very spacious living room and very good amenities. Peter was very kind and responsive. My flight landed earlier than expected and Peter was very kind to let me check in 30 min earlier. If you are looking for a spot in the Charlottesville area this is the place to stay! :)
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot that was walkable to downtown! Would stay there again!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location of Peter's place was fantastic! We thoroughly enjoyed the downtown feel were able to walk to many places. The place was clean and well kept. One thing to note is that there is another apartment next to this one, which we didnt realize.
The only downfall was that we were unable to get response back from the host. Fortunately enough it wasnt an emergency, but I always like to be in contact with the host at least once during our visit.
Overall, we had a great trip at this airbnb!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect! The bed was super comfortable, and the bathroom was wonderful! I loved the double showerhead. Getting in and out was a breeze. Even Al, the manager of Maya and the neighbor was great. We definitely recommend eating at Maya if you stay here! The food was incredible."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peter's place was perfect for our two night stay in Charlottesville. Great location right off main street and close to downtown. Peter was very responsive and let us check-in early. We had a great time and we would absolutely stay here again.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Peter's place is super well-located - the street is lively and parking is super easy. Peter is a gracious and hospitable host, the restaurant downstairs that he also owns, Maya, is a gem! The building is at an intersection, so traffic can be a little audible at night. We checked in on Saturday so there was also some music from a nearby establishment at night. Regardless, great value overall!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peter was a remarkably delightful host! I appreciated how flexible and accommodating he was, and he really went above and beyond. There was a slight scheduling mishap (not his fault) and he quickly resolved it; he also made sure I was comfortable at night by installing a curtain over one of the windows. His apartment is in an excellent location above his restaurant and walking distance to shops and downtown. It maintains its historic charm while also being updated in many aspects (tv/kitchen/bathroom). Loved the view and sunlight pouring in! Only thing to note is if you intend on spending time watching a movie or reading on the couch it's not the most comfortable couch to sit on for long periods. But other than that it's a great place to stay! Thanks again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peter was an outstanding host and very responsive. The apartment was perfect: extremely clean; functional; well appointed and stocked; and is in an excellent location. Highly recommend!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at Peter’s place! Excellent communication, clean apartment, and easy to find. Close to a variety of excellent restaurants including Maya. A straight 10-15 minute walk to the Corner and UVA. Highly recommend. We will return!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peter was very helpful during our stay
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peter was communicative. We had a slight scheduling mishap and he jumped right on it and solved the problem.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peter was an excellent host this property is a great centrally located place to stay in downtown Charlottesville. He was extremely communicative and accommodating. His place was clean and private with the great balcony. Check in and check out couldn’t have been simpler. We hope to stay again next time we’re in town!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nothing fancy, but lots of thoughtful amenities and a great location. The kitchen is very small so probably not a good choice if you’re planning to cook a lot, but it was perfect for us. Peter was a great host, very clear and responsive. I would stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved staying at this location! It’s in a perfect part of town with a balcony that’s a dreamy spot for reading a book or having your morning coffee. I’ll definitely come back next time I’m in Charlottesville
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect location- just as Peter described! We walked to the downtown mall each day of our three day stay, sometimes twice- beautiful, safe Main Street. Parking was initially difficult to navigate to as we were unfamiliar with the city layout, but Peter had clear instructions on where to find free parking nearby. Very easy to find a second time.
Very cute historic building apt, with a gorgeous modern bathroom, (with historic proportions. haha) Note: traffic light outside can be noisy at night, but the sound does not reach the bedroom beyond the living room and kitchen.
We enjoyed dinner and drinks at Maya right below, as well as several other local coffeeshops and bakeries. (Get Sal’s pasta and Mariebette’s French breakfast pastries!)
Driving to Shenandoah and Monticello, as well as surrounding antique malls, were all 10-20 minutes away."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended. 5*
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed here multiple times as it's excellent in every way - location, hospitality, venue, etc. Dinner downtown stairs at Maya is icing on the cake!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peter was a super responsive host and went above and beyond to bring a cell phone charger to me when I left mine at home. The restaurant below, Maya, is great as well."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a terrific stay at Peter's place! The location in Charlottesville is excellent - directly across the street from the Amtrak station and right on the free trolley line with a number of excellent restaurants next door. The convenience cannot be beat! We liked the balcony overlooking the street and the place was clean and uncluttered with a great bathroom.
Peter was such a gracious host! Our train was delayed for over 3 hours coming in, and it being a Sunday with all places closing, Peter went above and beyond to help us out and we are so grateful!
We also ate at Maya downstairs, and the food was excellent! They had delicious GF options and everything was perfectly done, superbly seasoned and super fresh! We definitely will be back!"

The apartment is lovely with a comfortable living/dining room area, small kitchen, an updated bathroom and one bedroom. The couch easily converts into a second bed. There is a small porch that overlooks the street.

2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great spot ! More spacious than we expected. Overall worked great for getting to the corner & downtown easily. Laundry machine from neighbor shakes the entire bedroom and makes a loud noise. Also the sound from the trains are fairly loud.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here multiple times now, and I am 100% certain that I will again. I don't think it's possible to find a better location to stay in Charlottesville.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location between downtown and the university. We loved walking most places and the energy of being in town and near restaurants and bars.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peter’s place is in a great location. Easily walkable to so many great restaurants. A quick drive to Monticello and several wineries. It is located along a busy downtown street with a fair amount of noise all night and early morning. Parking is along the street or in the pay lot ($12/day). We never had trouble finding parking. I highly recommend Peter’s place and will likely visit again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! This worked perfectly over a long weekend for my wife and I.

We loved sitting on the balcony at night for an evening beverage, watching the traffic lights change, the trains rumble by and people passing on the street. It's a quick walk to historic downtown with all the food and shops you could ever want, and there are even a few shops and restaurants right next door to the Airbnb location. Parking was easy, and it was only a 10 minute drive up the mountain to Monticello. 10/10 recommend!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great place to stay! For starters, it's one of the shortest trips for one of the best meals we've had. The location is super convenient and parking is easy.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing little spot to walk around the downtown area- highly recommend.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks Peter, for the great stay! Loved the apartment, you thought of everything! Great location too!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peter's spot was awesome - right in the heart of Charlottesville. He was communicative and helpful in the booking process. I would recommend this listing to anyone.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peter's place is a perfect spot in Charlottesville. It is very close to both the Corner and the Downtown Historic Mall. Coupled with bus stops right nearby, we didn't even need to rent a car for our 4 night stay. The A/C was most welcome as we had some hot days during our visit, it was great to come into a nice cool place.
Peter was also super helpful with check-in and worked with our tricky schedule."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peter's home is super convenient to both UVA's campus and the downtown mall - it was incredibly clean and exactly as expected based on the listing. Peter was incredibly responsive and communicative. All in all, would highly recommend Peter's home!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,The apartment is by far the best airbnb I have stayed in. It was so clean and cosy. Very well prepared and had an very comfy bed. The location is ideal for short or long stays. I would really encourage people to visit the restaurant/bar Maya downstairs. The staff their are all friendly and amazing people.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Owner was quick to communicate through the app. and the restaurant below us was top notch. Linens and towels were very nice as was the shower. The bed was very comfortable. Overall, we were very happy with our stay.
This place totally suited our needs, but if you have any difficulty with stairs this might not be the place for you - as the stairs are very steep and the railing is pulling away from the wall.
Also, evening and morning hours were very loud. Lots of traffic and people, in addition to loud clanging of trash bins, etc. The location, in terms of accessing all that Charlottesville has to offer, was great! Every morning we walked less than two blocks for pastries and the best coffee. For us it was definitely worth the noise.
We would like to book again and will recommend to friends and family."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Short walk to downtown, nice restaurants nearby, short drive to UVA. Porch is perfect for relaxing after a day of exploring."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is fantastic spot. It's halfway between the bustling UVA district and the downtown shops. So quiet, but very walkable (parking was very easy btw). The immediate neighborhood has great restaurants, bakeries & shops.
I sat on the porch and cheered a marathon Saturday morning while eating croissants and drinking great coffee. All found at a great bakery across the street.
My only warning is to book this if it's available. I suspect it goes quickly when there's an opening. I would gladly rebook."

The apartment is very conveniently located to delicious restaurants( The Maya), the university, Monticello and hiking. We felt very safe and parking was not an issue at all…. either street or across in the train lot $12/day. The apartment provided a very comfortable bed, large shower, plenty of towels and essentials, great water pressure, and a fantastic balcony. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit .."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unique and very well priced stay, location was perfect and parking was a breeze. The freight (?) train on Sunday ~2am shook the whole apartment- I thought we were in an earthquake! Didn’t bother us any other night though, so don’t let that deter you. Would stay with Peter again!"

We also enjoyed Cake Bloom, Peloton Station, and Quirk Café for a quick breakfast/latte."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot in a great location. Ten minute walk to town, ten minute walk to UVA and a block away from the train station. Peter keeps his place clean and the checkin process couldn’t have been easier. It can get noisy very early in the morning due to freight trains (the apartment literally shakes a little bit) but aside from that small gripe, this is a great spot in a super convenient location."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice clean apartment the bed was very comfortable it had adequate dishes in the kitchen and I loved it

Whether you're visiting UVA, touring Monticello, or looking to a place to get away and relax without being remote, I recommend it.

The kitchen allows for eating in watching TV or enjoying the scenery from the wide balcony."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was just what we were looking for. It is positioned right in between downtown and the UVA campus which made getting everywhere we needed to be really easy. The balcony is a huge bonus and made for some relaxing evenings and people watching. The blinds in the bedroom are more decorative than functional at blocking light, so if you are a light-sensitive sleeper consider bringing an eye mask. We would certainly stay here again!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Easy check-in a check-out. It's a cute little apartment. Nicely decorated. Generally clean but the floors could use a thorough clean. The restaurant downstairs was great!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peter was kind, prompt, and accommodating. Thanks again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check in. Bed was comfy. Nice remodel and they really knocked it out of the park with the bathroom. Love me a good shower! Linens were high end.
Location was convenient but be warned it can be noisy early in the morning. A train passes by, lots of road noise and the trash trucks pick up on Monday AM.
Other than that, comfy little place. We only really hung out a bit on the deck (nice feature) and slept there. Good outpost!
While you are in Charlottesville, highly recommend the Blue Ridge Tunnel. Only about 30 min out of town. Very cool experience!"

We will no doubt be renting this same place, as it was great size and location for a couple who loves to explore!! The Maya restaurant was a great convenience, we loved being just right above the bar! Very walkable distance to the downtown mall, rocket coffee, and many bars/shops. Wishing our stay was longer, but, we will be back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location to the downtown mall as well as the main hospital area. Easy check in process, and the air condition was already running when we got there! Very nice balcony as well."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you, Peter for an amazing stay! The space was immaculate and right in the middle of everything. You are one block away from The Quirk hotel which is super chic and has a nice cafe for a quick bite. Plus great coffee shops. And you are only a few blocks from the UVA campus in the opposite direction.
Peter’s place has everything you need including ample towels and amenities. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was beautifully designed. The balcony is a major highlight. It’s large and a great space to soak in the bustle of being in a college town.
I really appreciate the attention to detail and how accessible Peter is with communication.
Thanks again and if I find myself back in Charlottesville I’ll will ONLY stay here!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place in an ideal location. I loved the spacious balcony, and from inside enjoyed the high ceilings and large windows. The space had everything I needed."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic weekend in Charlottesville with home-base at Peter's apartment. Check-in was easy, Peter responded quickly when we had a question, the apartment is well outfitted and the location is perfect for those who want to explore Charlottesville on foot. The porch was a really nice - we picked up a bottle of wine from the shop across the street and watched a thunderstorm one evening, would absolutely return here :)"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a nice apartment in a very convenient location. Street parking was easily available. There is a narrow stairway to get into the apartment that may be difficult for some. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The kitchen and living space were a good size and well appointed. The shower is nice and large and there were plenty of towels. The air conditioners worked great but were a bit loud but that's not a bad thing because it drowned out some of the street noise. The restaurant downstairs wasn't open so we didn't get to try it but a short walk away was the Blue Moon Café that had great breakfasts and next to that was Rocket Coffee serving really good coffee. We had an overall good experience here.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and Peter was a great communicator
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peter's apartment is in a great location with an easy walk to the mall, Albermarle Baking Company, Oakhart Social, Random Row Brewery, and his own restaurant, Maya. In fact, the apartment is right on top of Maya! The apartment had everything we needed for a comfortable stay and was perfect for a couple. We would happily stay there again."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We only spent a night here and the apartment met our needs. It is walking distance to restaurants but on a quiet street with parking available on the street. Apartment felt spacious for the three of us. It is a nice mix of modern and old world charm inside.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of my favorite places that I’ve stayed on Airbnb. Excellent location. Very walkable to neighborhood restaurants and the Downtown Mall. Very clean. We only stayed one night, but the kitchen would be excellent for longer stays. Katie was excellent with communication and recommendations . I hope to stay again on my next Charlottesville trip."

Will definitely return!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katie was a fantastic host! She communicated very quickly, had her place ready early, and when she found out it was our anniversary, she had a very nice gift waiting for us! We can absolutely recommend her highly!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Katie’s place was wonderful. It was spacious, clean, peaceful, and it felt like a home away from home. Katie gave us a lot of great recommendations for food and activities, and we definitely look forward to coming back for another trip."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our recent stay at Katie's place was nothing short of exceptional, leaving us rejuvenated and eager to return. Nestled in a tranquil neighborhood, this charming abode offered the perfect blend of comfort, convenience, and character.
The host, Katie, had meticulously prepared the space, ensuring every detail was thoughtfully arranged for our comfort. Upon entering, we were immediately struck by the cozy ambiance, with soft lighting and tasteful decor creating an inviting atmosphere."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Katie’s apartment was wonderful. The biggest surprise was the adorable neighborhood with several fun and funky restaurants right around the corner. It’s about a 15 minute walk to the downtown mall and an easy drive to Monticello and many wineries and breweries. The apartment itself is very spacious and well furnished.
I would recommend this place for anyone looking for an affordable one-bedroom apartment in the heart of Charlottesville.
We will be back for quick weekend trips to cville in the future."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space and much larger than it seems in the photos. Pristine, well-appointed and a great location. Quiet Belmont neighborhood close to coffee and established restaurants. Katie was so gracious and welcoming. Will definitely return!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Katie was excellent. Proactive on ensuring our stay was enjoyable and pristine place in a quiet location.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I had a wonderful second stay at Katie's, and I really like having a stay in Charlottsville that I can count on to be safe and well appointed for kids, from the lack of stairs to being able to cook and do wash, and be able to keep a close eye on them in the living room, where there is plenty of floor space for puzzles and games. Katie and Chaz are super responsive, and I had everything that I needed in the kitchen to prepare some wonderful meals, and there were plenty of bedding and towels for everyone.
We had a chance to spend an afternoon on the front porch and take a walk in the neighbhorhood. Katie is right to recommend Belle, which does indeed have the most delivious donuts, and the barista takes care to do a nice design on the top of the hot drinks.
I had to work remotely, and I have never had issues with the internet, and we enjoyed logging into our Prime to watch some movies.
We look forward to coming back again this summer!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was an excellent choice for weekend getaway. A great location that seemed close to everything we wanted to do and see. Very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Their recommendations for sights and food were spot on!!!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a great apartment in a great neighborhood.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was really impressed with Katie's property. I really liked the neighborhood and the ease of parking right in front of the property. While Katie was out of the country during my stay, she made sure that her property manager was on top of any requests and that I had his cell number. He was a fantastic asset to the stay. While previous guests have mentioned lack of cookware & I agree, but upon request Katie made sure these were brought to me so that I could cook for my family. I absolutely loved making use of the kitchen. The value of this property exceeded my expectations. I have stayed in more expensive properties that have offered far less, particularly square footage, and I will stay at Katie's whenever possible, since I come to Cville often. Other things I loved: ample shelves an drawer to unpack, great water pressure, ample towels and toiletries, comfy living room, good wifi, kitchen workspace, cosmetic mirror, large fridge, cute porch, and plenty of accessible outlets. GREAT!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay, book with confidence the property is as advertised."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katie's place was cute, comfortable, and conveniently located. She communicated clearly and promptly. It was a smooth and lovely experience to stay at her home. Would definitely recommend :)"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great, perfect weekend getaway."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katie’s location is wonderful, around the block from several great restaurants and a local coffee shop. The apartment was exactly what we needed for a week, well kept, and the host make it feel like home."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The location is perfect for visiting local wineries
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Katie was very helpful and quick to respond to my questions. There’s plenty of room. We had a great stay for our granddaughter’s wedding. Senior friendly.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katie is a great host and very communicative. The place is lovely and warm, we enjoyed it very much."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, the place was roomy, comfy, and cozy. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was updated, and the living room area was roomy. My wife is in a wheelchair, so it was easy to get her around the place. We made the adjustments where we needed with her walker and portable hand grippers.
We stayed 5 nights at Katie's place, and our overall impression is positive; however, the kitchen was a disappointment. From a roomy standpoint, it was large. The island was very big and the kitchen had all the typical amenities: fridge, microwave, stove/oven, toaster, coffee maker, etc. Given the large size of the kitchen, there were only 3 pans. A small 2 quart pot, 8"" and 12"" frying pans. That was it. The 2 baking pans were very old and cheap. I am not advocating for a chef's or gourmet kitchen, but not everyone wants to eat out at restaurants every night. Regardless of how many nights someone stays, the kitchen should be adequately outfitted. The oven and stovetop hadn't been cleaned in a while."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay: super clean, spacious, nicely decorated and just as advertised in the listing. Belmont Avenue is a very quiet street, but close to restaurants and about a 10 minute walk to the Main Street walking mall. It was ready early, with no problems getting in. Very quiet, no disturbances anytime. Very nice bathroom with a large walk-in shower. Large kitchen with full-sized washer and dryer. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment built in 1900 was full of all of the modern amenities you’d want (clean updated bathroom and kitchen) but had the old world charm of wood floors, crown molding and large baseboards. Great place to stay!!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katie's place is maybe the best airbnb I've ever satyed at, and I've stayed at quite a few between multiple countries. Really comfortable, really nice touches, beautiful kitchen, lovely bathroom, super-responsive and flexible hosts. Left a laptop there and they called me back right away and brought it out to me personally. 10/10 would recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing private apartment in a great location. The place was comfortable, tastefully furnished, and had all the necessary amenities. The host, Katie, was responsive and gracious and provided excellent suggestions on activities and local restaurants. I would definitely recommend and stay there again."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bright, cheerful place in a great location close to all Charlottesville had to offer. Katie even gave me a list of recommendations before I arrived and left some material out about the area. Easy to find and easy to get in. Big space with plenty of room to stretch out. The bathroom fixtures were super nice and the shower had great pressure.
This was the perfect spot to use as a landing pad to go out and explore."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are going to Charlottesville for any reason and need a place to stay and this is available- STOP LOOKING. This is the place! My husband and I stay at Airbnb’s often. This one exceeded our expectations! It’s clean, modern, comfortable. We were surprised at how spacious it was. Katie was incredibly responsive and helpful. We needed an early check in and she was able to accomodate us which was a tremendous help. The apartment is a 15 minute walk from the downtown area which was very safe and clean, as was the apartment neighborhood. And literally 3 blocks from a cluster of incredible little restaurants. BOOK IT! You will not be disappointed!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If this place is available, stop looking and book now! It’s one of the rare homes that’s even better than the pictures—the location is fabulous, the space is clean and comfortable, and for the price I expected a studio and got a full apartment. Great find, thank you Katie!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely location, extremely walkable to restaurant area and shopping. Quite, quaint first floor of home. Most amenities are provided as well! The bed was the best I experienced overall while on vacation to various locations. Would highly recommend!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"My sister and I were in town for a concert at the Ting Pavilion. Katie's place was a short walk to the venue, close to the downtown mall and loads of delightful restaurants. The home was in a quiet neighborhood with ample street parking. The shower was spacious and the water pressure divine. It was a gorgeous, tidy, well appointed space.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great space in a great location. The apartment is bigger than I would have guessed from the photos and it's just a couple blocks from a number of solid upscale dining options. Pretty easily walkable to anywhere in Charlottesville as well. I visit the area semi-regularly because family live nearby and I'll be checking the availability of this apartment when I'm planning future trips.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"First, Katie is a wonderful host! She was immediately responsive with local restaurant recommendations and other places to visit. Anything we needed while staying was provided…need an extra pot for cooking, she’s got it!
Second, the Airbnb is so charming and comfortable. Great kitchen for cooking, which we did for a few meals. It’s easy to unwind in the evening with a nice glass of wine either in the cozy living room or covered porch.
Finally, the area is lovely. Delicious restaurants are in easy walking distance and anything we needed to get to by car was close. Street parking was a breeze.
We will return to Cville and will not hesitate to stay here again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Charlottesville with another couple for a wedding and this was the perfect home base -- comfortable, clean, nice touches throughout (especially appreciated the steamer and hair dryer!).

Little details like cotton swabs and Micellar water put me in a good mood after an active day. And the French-Press made my next day start very positively! This is the first house on AirBnB where I was able to find a French-Press for my favorite morning coffee. The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you need, from selection of tea to scissors. Sharp knives, good dishes and, in general, the impression that the owners did their best to make visitors feel at home. Will definitely come back one day."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first stay at an AirBnB and I think Alex and her management team have set a high bar. They have anticipated guest needs; the toiletries, coffee/tea setup and the very interesting library made for a comfortable visit. We enjoyed watching fireflies from the porch swing in the evenings and conversing with the sparrows on the back deck in the morning."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re thinking about booking this place, do it! Spotless, perfect location, comfy….everything I needed to getaway for a few days and work remotely. Thank you for sharing your home! I’ll be back soon!"

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient location, lacking some touches like kitchen towels, fans in bedrooms, etc. Furniture was not comfortable so it was good for a short stay but not a long one. Overall good value for the price."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was great! Even better than I expected. Everything was so cute, the beds were comfy and the showers were amazing. The home itself was so beautifully redone and the check out process was a breeze. Only thing to know is we couldn’t get in early which was hard for us, but how great the place was made up for it, and the host was nice about it, so not even complaining - just something to know if an early check in might be necessary for your trip."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and location! Highly recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time here, and we liked it just as well as before. Very convenient location for med school, easy parking,no traffic noise, clean and home- like place. The kitchen is nicely equipped if you want to cook, the porch and back deck are nice for sitting outside in good weather. This works well for us when visiting family associates with UVA med. Table in kitchen seats 4 .
Beds have good mattresses and heat and AC work well.
Thanks for another good stay!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at this quaint little cottage!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stylish place with a great book collection. Super comfortable.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a much better option than booking two hotel rooms for our family. We had plenty of space and privacy. We loved hanging out on the front porch with a blanket - at night and also for coffee in the morning. They even had locally roasted beans and a grinder! The TV was great so we could snuggle and watch a show. Beds are comfortable and the common area was well appointed. We walked to campus and to restaurants (15-25 min). We would definitely stay again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful cottage!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came to Charlottesville with my NY cousin to visit 4th year daughter for my birthday. I’m not a girls weekend kind of person, but I had a great time and kended up spending a good portion of the weekend cooking and hanging out at the house as it felt like home. Great memories made just being together. Everything you could possibly need, great renovations and very comfortable (one suggestion is room darkening shades or to future guests, bring an eye mask. Full disclosure, I can be high maintenance about sleep.) Excellent place. And I’m serious about everything you could possible need. Even specific water for a C-pap machine! Thank you to the owners. I had a great birthday weekend."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnb couldn't have been nicer. Comfortable beds, excellent lighting, great kitchen, easy to use temperature control. I just wish the weather was warmer so we could have taken advantage of the back deck and the front porch!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was one of the nicest AirBnBs I've stayed in! Well decorated, very clean (including sheets and towels) comfortable beds--the heated floors were a luxury since we were staying over a very cold weekend. The bathrooms were really nice and well-stocked, as was the kitchen--4 different ways to make coffee! We didn't actually cook anything while there, but the kitchen seemed to have everything you'd need."

2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this airbnb. The location was great for us since it was close to family we were visiting. Blue Ridge's management was quite good and communications before our stay were very responsive and helpful. The only negative was that the heating system was something of a challenge. For folks considering this location in the winter months, they should get some direction before they arrive on how to keep the heat at a reasonably warm and consistent level. We only figured it out one day into our stay which meant we had a very cold first night. Otherwise, we loved the place."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Review for later
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, close to everything! Clean, well stocked with anything you might need, great communication! Would highly recommend this place, so cozy!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is clean and roughly 1 mile from what I consider downtown Charlottesville. It can either be walked or use a ride share service. We went to the uva football game which is also very close. Thomas Jeffersons houseis also close by. We would stay there again
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This AirBnb was fantastic - clean, spacious, well-located. Checking in was super easy and communication with the host team was always quick and helpful. I would definitely stay here in the future!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful stay!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Pros:
Convenient location, about 10 minutes of walking distance to West Main Street where there are many nice restaurants on that street.
The interior decoration is pretty.
The host provides many amenities even the bandages, sewing needles, cotton swabs, cotton pads, and etc.
The host kindly provides coffee, tea, milk and other spices.
Cons:
The master bedroom has a sliding door and there is no lock.
The shade for the window is paper, the window of the 2nd bedroom faces the street and the street light is on all night, so the bedroom is very bright at night, you may want to use a sleep mask to help you sleep.
You have to park your car on the street, but the host provides permit, it’s not difficult to find parking spot.
We tried to use some of the blankets stored in the closet at night, but then found out some of them smell.
The mattress is too soft for my like."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic Airbnb in Charlottesville! It’s close to everything and is adorable! We stayed here for our wedding weekend, and it made the perfect bridal suite."

Beautifully designed, beautifully maintained, immaculately clean, comfortable beds, and lots of little amenities (such a small first aid kit, which I needed). Oh, and the cutest back deck, backyard, and front patio. A++ accommodations!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As advertised!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Blue Ridge BnB is exactly as advertised. It is a super cute place that is really conveniently located. We really appreciated how well stocked the house is. There is everything you could possibly want in the kitchen. We didn't cook on this trip, but the kitchen certainly had everything that you would need. We especially enjoyed the coffee and half and half!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first visit to Charlottesville and I can say for certain it will not be our last! And if at all possible we will definitely stay at this fantastic home. Everything was well thought out in advance for their guest’s comfort. They even provided a basket of personal necessities than someone like myself will forget to pack LOL. And this was in both bathrooms too. My personal favorite was their white wooden rocking swing on the front porch. I enjoyed my coffee out there every morning. The communication was over the top as well! I sent a text the first day asking where I could find the coffee grinder (huge bag of fresh beans in the fridge) and literally 10 minutes later there was a brand new grinder in the box outside on the front porch! Lots of really interesting books to look through but my favorite was a book written by the owners and a little “bird” that was quite fun to read. Poor bird was kidnapped by squirrels for a ransom but later released without payment because the bird annoyed the kidnappers…… these two couples who renovated this house apparently had some fun with the bird! Next time I’m there I will be dressing that bird in a little University of Texas tee shirt!!! But don’t tell the bird because it’s a secret 🤐.
Great area for walking and waving to the friendly neighbors!!! You will not be disappointed staying here."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Blue Ridge BnB was absolutely lovely! So many small, meaningful conveniences and touches made us very comfortable during our stay. The place was clean, beautifully decorated, and very homey. It was a wonderful trip!"

The house is adorable. Kitchen had everything we might need, the bathrooms were clean and nice, and it was more spacious than we even thought it would be."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful home. Just as described. All the amenities made us feel right at home as soon as we arrived.

Gorgeous hardwood floors and comfortable furniture. Check-in/check-out was easy and we knew that Matt was always a phone call or text away.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed in this beautiful and comfortable home for my son's college orientation. It was very close to UVA grounds and restaurants in town. It is as lovely as pictured in the listing and the owners have provided high quality linens and towels. The kitchen is well stocked and has very nice appliances.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is probably the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. A nice quiet location, conveniently situated for town - but most of all a really comfortable and well-designed house with great style. We would thoroughly recommend this property."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little house! Well appointed and great for a little getaway. The location is great and communication was super easy.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a good location for university and downtown. It’s nicely kept and quite comfortable. Would definitely stay here again! Quite liked it. Communication very good with owners who were helpful with some questions we had. Definitely a “winner.” Private too.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and convenient stay, great value."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charming and well appointed cottage, centrally located in Charlottesville on a very quiet street. The house was immaculate and beautiful, and yet had the kind of old house character that is hard to replicate. Gorgeous wood floors, tall ceilings, beautiful natural light in every room, mid century modern furniture, lush beds and linens, interesting books, modern bathrooms, 2 lovely porches - what more could you ask for? Minutes away from UVA, restaurants, and shops."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best AB&B experiences I’ve ever had. Charlottesville is one of the best cities in the country, and you won’t find a better place to stay when visiting than this house. It’s a perfect location, and the host has clearly gone above and beyond to make it feel like home. 11/10!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful place with gorgerous kitchen! Just luv it.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Adorable house in a great location!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Got home last evening from Charlottesville and wanted to promptly write a positive review. Would definitely stay here again. The house is across from a small park which turned out really well for our group. The place was very clean, thoughtful touches were added around the house for the guests comfort, and the neighborhood was quiet. The property is on a corner but the road was not busy. There is a nice deck out back where we enjoyed having a cocktail prior to going to dinner. The house is about a mile from restaurant a""row"". One could walk but we opted to drive.
When scrolling through the pictures of the property, you will note that the primary bedroom has a ""barn door"". The En Suite bathroom does not have a door on it. While the bathroom can not be viewed unless inside the bedroom, one might prefer more privacy. Increased privacy is a personal preference that some may appreciate and doesn't matter to others. The bathroom is very pretty.
Thank you for a lovely weekend!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay here. The place is comfy, very clean, and well-stocked. Matt was great with communication. Parking is available right outside the house in a quiet neighborhood. We would totally stay here again if we visit Charlottesville."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Would definitely stay there again.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely place- beautifully decorated, well appointed, super clean."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a beautiful home, nicely furnished with comfortable upgrades and great amenities. Felt like a home away from home which was a welcome find after just staying at a hotel in a different city. There is also a playground across the street which is great for those with kids. More of a challenge to walk to downtown areas with kids but doable otherwise. Would recommend driving if you have young children. This is a hidden gem in Charlottesville and I would definitely recommend staying here!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Immaculately clean, beautifully furnished, well stocked bungalow minutes from downtown Charlottesville. The home was well stocked with thoughtful amenities. The kitchen, baths, and laundry room all had high end appliances and were newly remodeled. I would highly recommend this rental to anyone looking for a nicely appointed quiet home near downtown!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Yes, we HIGHLY recommend the Yellow House. Location was perfect for visiting the presidential homes - Monticello, Montpelier and Highland. A short drive to the downtown walking street, restaurants and the University.
The home is WELL stocked with anything a guest might need. The hosts have thought of EVERYTHING, (even CPAP water!). We were impressed!
The layout is very comfortable, spacious. The street is quiet. There's a park across the street and a main road nearby for easy access.
Thank you for a delightful stay!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely home. The furnishings were stylish and comfortable. The home was very clean. We only stayed 2 nights so didn't cook therefore not certain how well equipped things were. That being said we had everything we needed. There was coffee pot, tea kettle, wine opened and glasses. Lovely soaps were provided too. Lots of restaurants nearby. Thank you. We look forward to being able to come back."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This Air B&B is perfect for a group or family. It was clean and had all of the amenities listed. We couldn't have asked for an easier stay. We brought our 3yo and were thrilled by the playground/park located directly across the street. We would love to stay here again in the future!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house provides easy living with no steps and convenience to many locations. I appreciated Matt's communication and helpfulness in going the extra mile to help us with a challenge. I enthusiatically recommend it.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time. The house is great - plenty of space for 3-4 people, bathrooms and kitchen are new and fresh, heated floors in the bathrooms and bedroom were such a treat (now I want to redo my whole house at home!). Everything was clean and working well. The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe. I initially hesitated to book this house because I couldn’t tell from photos how the area would be, as I’m not familiar with that part of town. We actually really liked being in the residential area. The only drawback was that we would have wanted to walk to UVA central Grounds and you can’t go there directly on foot because of the train tracks in between. But by car, it was convenient to everything we wanted to do. I would definitely stay here again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! Everything was sparkly clean, freshly updated and very comfy. The owners have been very thoughtful in providing high end toiletries in both bathrooms, plus a selection of teas, coffee filters and basic cooking ingredients in the kitchen. Unfortunately we were only able to stay for 2 nights and I wish it could have been longer. The owner was very communicative. The furnishings were all tasteful and modern, with a fresh European feel. The pictures don’t do it justice. I wish it was warm enough to utilize the porch swing and patio furniture. I’m very fussy and this didn’t disappoint! Very impressed- Thank you"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a beautiful place. Everything was amazing, it was decorated professionally, very nice linens, well stocked kitchen with new appliances, charming outside deck, the list could go on. My children and I loved it. We were there for a UVA tour and it is a 5 minute drive. Great location. I wish every Airbnb I stayed in was this nice. I would stay again without hesitation, I might need an excuse to come back to Charlottesville to stay again. Thank you Matt."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice clean spacious cottage. Great place!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is in a great location and has plenty of space for everything you need. Matt was very communicative and answered my questions before I even had them! The check-in and out processes were seamless and easy to follow. I would highly recommend this home for your next stay in Charlottesville!! My only suggestion would be to bring a sleep mask for those sunny mornings when you want a little more sleep.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Check-in and out were a breeze, house was clean and the location was perfect!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home in Charlottesville. Easy access to everything. Perfect place for two couples visiting for the weekend. Highly recommend!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s so nicely stocked like a real home: flour, sugar, coffee, cooking oil, even hair products.
The spacious shower alone with three heads was worth the price of the rental. The towels were plush. And radiant floor heat!
It was like staying at a friend’s place who really wanted you to feel welcomed."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in Charlottesville! Very clean and has all the comforts! Matt provided suggestions and was very responsive. Perfect place to stay especially if you need to stay overnight for hospital appointments. We were very pleased.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place! Decor was adorable and it was a good size as well. Plenty of towels, toiletries in case, glassware, washer/dryer, etc. Was the perfect hideaway for the weekend and super close to campus. The host was very clear on check in/out and very helpful, even recommended some good food spots. Would stay again!!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay here, in Charlottesville. The house feels very recently renovated and is beautifully appointed with so many stylish touches. A bathroom for each bedroom (one en-suite) makes it perfect. Comfortable and cozy, with easy street parking right outside. We couldn’t have had a better experience."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! So many thoughtful details, comfortable beds, and location is excellent. Communication and check in are simple and hosts are available as needed. Will stay here again!"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a fantastic, beautiful and comfortable house, newly remodeled and set up with super comfy furniture and great decor. The street was quiet, the house was easy to find, and Alex and Matt made the whole process easy. We will definitely be staying here again, next time we're in Charlottesville!"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and very comfortable
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the most well-appointed AirBnBs at which I’ve stayed. Convenient to all things UVA. Especially good for anyone with ambulatory issues or needs proximity to UVA University Hospital. My partner convalesced here after she had fusion surgery.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay here! Close to downtown, great decor, amazing showers, easy and quick communication. We’d definitely stay here again!"
