2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We cannot say enough great things about this cozy little gem in the country! Ruby was instantly welcoming in her online responses and gave us privacy during our time at her place. So many simple, but thoughtful extras to welcome us... fresh apples on the kitchen table, snacks & water in the kitchenette, and bath necessities (soap, shampoo & conditioner, a first aid kit too!). The clip-clop of the Amish neighbors traveling up and down the road was especially sweet! We only stayed one night this time, so we didn't get to spend much time in the beautiful outdoor spaces she's created, but we'll definitely be back! Thank you, Ruby! :)"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place to stay. Very clean and comfortable. Check in was easy. The Wash House is in the middle of Amish farm country, very beautiful. Loved seeing the covered bridges, horse and buggies, rolling hill sides. Very close to Sight & Sound, dining, shopping and exploring. We will definitely be back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent 2 nights here while in the area, and couldn't have been more pleased. The Washhouse is beautiful inside and out, and very comfortable. We were made to feel very welcome.

We travel a lot and we have had some bad pillows, showers, and beds, but not here. Honestly I slept better here than at home and so did my boyfriend. SO comfortable. SO clean. Such friendly, welcoming and inviting hosts. Ruby, John and Bravo (their sweet pup who loves to run around and be happy) have the best spot with the best location. Five plus stars if you are hesitant on booking read my review and book it because you will have the best, relaxing time."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a perfect place for a day or a vacation. Ruby and John are lovely, and beyond helpful. The little space was a wonderful place for two people, and their willingness to share the yard, the firepit, and their kindness will make you want to return.
It is one of the most enjoyable stays I have had anywhere, and I will be back. Thank you to you both for a wonderful evening. We stopped a way to break up a long drive and we found a wonderful place.
Michael"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable, quiet... everything I'd expect from a commercial hotel, plus a few snacks and tasteful Christmas decorations. Ruby's communication was clear, helpful, and timely. The only negative was a bit of cold draft through the rustic door and windows with the December wind, but the heating unit was able to keep up. Would recommend, especially in warmer months when the draft wouldn't matter and the outside patio and fire pit would be more attractive."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved my stay at Ruby’s place! It was a wonderful weekend, hugely due to how cute, cozy, and quaint the property is. I visited in December so the place was decorated with its own Christmas tree and Christmasy bedding - a lovely touch!This place is the perfect size for two people and the space is so well arranged that it feels bigger than it probably is in terms of square feet. The surrounding spaces within the property are great too! There’s a private deck on the backside of the Olde Wash House, fire pit area, and gazebo.
Ruby was a joy and went above and beyond to make my friend and I feel welcome. This is the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had and highly recommend staying here!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this little place so much we have already booked our stay for next December and added an extra night.

Ruby is an amazing host and we are looking forward to next year. Being in the country rather than in town gave us the opportunity to see a lot of Lancaster."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at Ruby’s, there was lots to do and we felt right at home. Ruby’s husband was very kind and started a fire for us and we really enjoyed playing with their adorable dog, Bravo.

The olde wash home is charming clean and surrounded by beautiful amish farm land. And to the very end I realized I left something behind. And Ruby shipped it out to me the next day.

I can't say enough about the lovely little house and all of its personal touch! Ruby has it decorated so nicely. She had snacks, fresh fruit, and water in the fridge. Everything was spotless! The bed was so comfortable, and we slept very well. I wish my mattress at home was as comfy as Ruby's!
Ruby and her husband John are both so friendly too! Their kindness comes straight from the heart, and you can tell that they're so sincere. I honestly have to say that I have never seen two people work so hard, and so continuous in my life! They never stop!
I don't want to omit the lovely yard and grounds, and their Amish neighbors! It was delightful to watch them doing their daily chores. I was truly inspired. I'm running out of space, but I must mention Bravo, their Beautiful Dog! LOVE!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Adorable, quaint and immaculate little cottage with beautiful surroundings. This was just what we needed for a quick dinner out and to relax after moving my son into his apartment on an extremely hot day. The guest cottage looks bigger on the inside than on the outside and had an added feature of a little patio off the back which we enjoyed for a little privacy and star gazing. There was everything we needed including keurig coffee, sweetener and creamer, bottles of water and snacks. I can't say enough great things about this place. If we are ever visiting in the area again, I would definitely stay again. Thank you Ruby and family!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ruby & John were incredibly warm and welcoming - and so was their adorable two-year old dog, Bravo. Sweet Bravo greeted us as soon as we pulled into the driveway with his non-stop wagging tail & huge smile. He's very calm and well-behaved! My sister and I had a wonderful evening and overnight of peace, quiet, and pure rest & relaxation after a long, busy day of visiting friends and family in Wilmington. The Olde Wash House was sooooo comfy!!! It's nestled on John & Ruby's large property of gorgeous trees, shrubs, & blooming flowers. There are many spots here and there to relax outdoors. I enjoyed a cold beer on the west-facing deck behind the Olde Wash House as the sun set behind a huge barn next door. The farm across the road had two or three roan (is that ""blonde"" in horse talk?) horses joyously frolicking in their pasture. The only sound was from merry birds fluttering from tree to tree and the occasional clip-clopping of horses hooves as Amish buggies ambled by. HEAVEN!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved my stay at Ruby's place! She was wonderful, I couldn't ask for a better host, and the guest house was very comfortable. We took her up on one of her recommendations for a local restaurant, which was delicious. The area was beautiful, too. If ever I need a place to stay near there again I would absolutely choose Ruby's."

It's an easy commute to Lancaster and surrounding areas for all the touristy stuff or just spend time at the guest house where you can sit on the deck and enjoy the clippity clop of horse and buggies going by, have a campfire, lounge in Adirondack chairs and watch the neighbor's farm animals graze in the pasture. Ruby is a wonderful host who made us feel right at home."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful place to unwind and relax,we will definitely be going back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I spent 3 nights at Ruby's separate cottage space next to her home. It was cozy, pretty, and welcoming! In addition to the cottage she also has several outdoor seating areas that are lovely. Her husband lit a fire for me one night so I could enjoy the twilight and stars. Amish families live next door and across the street, with an Amish school 2 doors away. It was so pleasant to hear the clip-clopping of the horses pulling buggies. Ruby and her husband were warm, and available for any questions or needs I had. Thanks to you both! I plan to return in the fall to do more family research so I hope I'll find a couple open days again!"

Adjacent to the porch is a beautiful Cabana and a fire pit for your enjoyment .

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment that we arrived we knew that this was going to be a special treat.
Ruby & John have created a perfectly landscaped ""welcome"" to Lancaster County. The Olde Wash House is nestled amongst shade trees, perennial gardens, twinkling lights and historic farm houses. The private entry is lovely and the accommodations fabulous! The rooms are decorated beautifully, the bed - so comfortable, the fixtures all new and fit the space well. It really is a charming mix of old & new.
We woke each morning to cows and horses grazing in the fields nearby, and Amish children making their way to school, all while horses & buggies took families down the road. It was peaceful, lovely, and more than we had hoped for.
Ruby & John are thoughtful and kind hosts. It was a pleasure to meet them. We are so grateful for their hospitality and look forward another stay."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We couldn't have had a nicest visit! The room was beautifully decorated & the surroundings were splendid. We got to see a calf frolicking in the field next door. He was as happy as we were. Jon & Ruby are such friendly, kind folks. We enjoyed visiting with them when we first came. I definitely want to go back! l loved everything about the place. I told my husband it has such wonderful character. He especially liked the laminated instruction sheet that told of nearby restaurants, listed all the amenities the room had to offer & instructions on using the TV. Just perfect! I highly recommend
this air bnb!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at The Washe House for 3 nights as we visited the area and saw Moses at the Sights & Sounds theater. Our stay couldn’t have been more perfect! We had everything that we needed to have a relaxing stay. There had been a thunderstorm the first night and when we got back from the play the electricity was out and we were met in the driveway with a lantern to use until the electricity came back on (which didn’t take very long). The Washe House, yard and amenities such as the fire pit and romantically quaint open outdoor room are top notch. We look forward to coming back to the area for another play and hope that The Old Washe House will be available for us!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely home away from home. It is close to a road so you can definitely hear cars and the occasional horse and buggy. Aside from that, it is so peaceful.

Ruby was always quick to answer any questions, John offered recommendations to my husband for his bike ride, they had the fire pit going for us when we returned in the evening. The space was clean, we had three areas we were able to sit and chill. They had a snack basket, water, coffee and Ruby even made sure to refill the creamer before we checked in. It was neat to watch the buggies drive by and hear the clicking of the horses at night. The farm next door had some cows come along the fence line that came over for a visit. It was very peaceful setting. They have a pup and he was a delight to hang out with, loved his belly rubs. We felt very comfortable and at home during our stay."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melanie is a great host and the bungalow is super comfortable and clean. I was in the area to visit family, but there's lots to do within a 5 to 10 minute drive. While it's close to plenty of restaurants and shopping, it's also off the beaten path in a very quiet neighborhood. It was easy to get in, and instructions on how to find things in the house are very clear. Melanie is also very responsive, which I really appreciated. I would definitely stay here again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Seeing this place in person exceeded my expectations. The decor, the thoughtfulness behind certain details/accommodations just gave you this “feel at home” kind of vibe.
Kitchen was well stocked with equipment if you’re staying for a longer visit. While it was my first time in Pennsylvania, appreciated the maps and brochures left on the front table. Bed was super comfy and there was plenty of storage space for my clothes in the closet nearby. Ceiling fan above the bed was a surprise but a nice touch for I’m sure the hotter days. Bathroom was clean, and the added sanitary napkin dispenser on the wall is a smart idea. If I had to be picky, not a lot of counter top space in the bathroom so ladies that wear a lot of makeup or who have a lot of skin care products, just an fyi.
Can’t forget about having a private garage in the city was a bonus! Walking distance to plenty of restaurants and shops. Felt safe; neighborhood was quiet.
Overall, would definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Five stars across the board. This is a magazine-worthy space in a charming neighborhood. It was immaculately clean and well-appointed. Parking was provided. Numerous restaurants were within a 6 block walk. It was a true respite after a long drive.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my favorite Airbnb I’ve stayed in! We only stayed one night for a concert in the area but I wish we could have stayed for a week.

If you love a rustic/barn feel, this is the place for you. The location was accessible to a lot of things, also no more than 20 minutes to the bigger shops and outlet. Overall, we enjoyed our time here. Will definitely be visiting during the warmer seasons."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely incredible stay! Julia was quick to respond and happy to recommend local restaurants. The space was clean, comfortable, and gorgeous. Reminiscent of a hotel in all the right ways while retaining a curated, cozy feel. Appreciated the well-stocked kitchen and bathroom.

Everything was incredibly clean, aesthetic, and fostered relaxation and rest. Even though it snowed, they kept the walks clear of snow and ice. Plus, the large window afforded breathtaking views of the falling snow all through the afternoon and evening.
We parked once and didn't have to drive anywhere-- everything was within walking distance. We were just a few blocks from Root and Rachels, two must have stops for bites to eat.
We can't wait to return."

We then proceeded to walk around and explore before heading to Julia’s place. It is down a small side street which was no problem for us our car fit perfectly fine. And parking in the garage was amazing we fit great. I loved the fact they offered a washer and dryer. It came in handy when we got soaked in the rain. The main living area is just big enough to including everything we need. It was so cozy to. She had everything you could think off. We were even able to cook a full meal. She even offered to walk over when we couldn’t figure out Netflix. Over all this was the most beautiful place we could’ve stayed at and will definitely be recommending it to everybody and maybe even come back next year for our holiday vaca!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was easily one of the best Airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in! Not only was it absolutely so cozy and beautiful, but Julia had anything you could possibly think of needing. I cannot recommend this stay enough. I wish we could’ve stayed longer!"

Walkable to a lot of great loal restaurants and cafes and an easy drive to local attractions. Julia was easy to communicate with and the place was spotless. Overall a beautiful place to stay, the photos don't do it justice! I do warn that you may want to bring your smaller vehicle, the alley is very tight and we drove in our older dually truck... It did fit, but definitely takes a skilled driver to get a large vehicle in and out!
We loved the place and definitely plan to visit again!"

Both of your properties (Little House on Mary and this property) are spot on for travelers.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I stayed at John’s cabin for a little get away. It was a perfect little place for a short stay.
John had plenty of seasoned firewood and starter there for the fireplace. It helped to crack the window a little until the flue gets hot when using the fireplace in order to keep smoke from coming back in cabin.
Even though you’re not far from other homes, the cabin felt decently private.
The cabin was clean all around. The bed was comfortable, and the hot tub was a nice bonus.
I’d definitely recommend John’s place to others."

Set back off the road for privacy but an easy drive to all the area attractions, the cabin feels like you are stepping back in time but with all the modern goodies (including an amazing coffee maker). The hot tub is incredible, and the fireplace is great for amping up the cozy factor (John even supplies the firewood). All in all, a wonderful stay and can't wait to return."

A great place if you want to explore ""Amish Country"" - close to the old Mill shops, Zook's, and many other things to do. Loved it here...and the bed downstairs was SUPER COMFY!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great Stay! The kids loved it, we felt right at home. Communication was awesome. There’s lots to do in the area it’s a great location. Everything was clean and neat we loved everything about this house."
2024-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"Mostly, stay was nice. Home charming, surprisingly spacious (walls angled-obviously. Careful upstairs if you’re tall). Beds comfy. Key lockbox & parking easy. Nice white towels. Hosts fast to respond to messages re: planning what to bring (coffee/creamer/etc). SURPRISES-strong mildew odor upon entry. I got used to it fairly quickly. If you have an allergy, you should know. I later saw other reviews mentioned it too.
Also framed signs re: rules, procedures. One says no food/drink in living areas. If you like coffee in bed or a drink on the couch to watch tv, it’s a no-no.
Bold, though, is the sign of check out rules-not included on listing. Despite the $75 cleaning fee, guests are TOLD (not asked, no please) to take trash to the outside bin, wash/dry/put away dishes, strip beds, reset thermostats.
I am respectful of others’ property. I tidy up when leaving. But I never experienced this as an Airbnb guest or a guest anywhere. Pretty nervy of ppl profiting from a hospitality service."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute and unique house! We really enjoyed our stay. It is apparent the owners really care about the details and want guests to feel comfortable.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Better than we expected.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time at our concert this weekend and was able to stay at this beautiful home while there.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My bride and I were charmed by Nathan and Becky 's A-Frame home. Located in a
quiet neighborhood with nice privacy. Home is comfortable and had everything we needed. Our stay was a short 3 day visit . Main reason for our visit was sight and sound theater production of Daniel, which was excellent. Theater is very short drive away. In our brief visit we enjoyed a country drive ,shady maple smorgasbord, Tuesday farmers market, bird in hand bakery,and some relaxation.
Looking foward to a visit in the future."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house for a few days doing all things Christmas in Lancaster. Close to everything but quiet too. Very fun place.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So truth be told, we didn't even get to stay as there was a death in our family the day of check-in. That being said we were able to get a partial refund but more than that even, they were so kind and communicative leading up to and after receiving our news of cancelling a mere hour or two before check-in. We fully intend to book this listing again in the future when things have settled down for us. I would recommend this listing/host 10 out of 10 times just based on their warm and helpful service over the phone and especially how thoughtful/sincere they were with us after learning of our loss. Amazing people!!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was very nice although the lean of the A frame walls took a little getting used to. There was a slight musty-type smell but it wasn't terrible. I attributed it to it being winter time and the place was closed up. Oh, the bed in the first floor bedroom is VERY tall, my wife needed a step stool to climb in. The bed was very comfortable."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This A frame is a perfect quaint place for a getaway in Lancaster. Great location

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"wow, wow, wow. Our time in Lancaster ended with an exclamation point and a heart emoji when we walked into this sweet triangle. - what a great place.
clean, safe, relaxing - highly, highly recommended!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The interior of the home was as described and shown in pictures. It was a little compressed with the furniture and narrowing walls so be careful walking around the walls. I may have smacked my head. The outside picture is dated so it’s a little more hidden now by bigger trees, but it didn’t detract from anything. Loved the front porch and the beds were really comfortable. It was the perfect spot for what we needed!"
2023-09-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"This little A frame has a lot going for it with the location, quiet area, and style, but unfortunately, the VERY strong smell of mildew really made my stay not fun. I could smell it on my hair and clothes when I wasn't there and when I got home it took three hair washings to get the smell out. My suitcase, clothes, toiletry bag, etc took more effort to get the smell out. Washing my clothes didn't even work after the first washing. I have put off giving a review, because I don't like to give negative reviews, but I need to tell others. I'm sure the owners have tried to get the smell out because a dehumidifier and air purifier was running constantly. I'm surprised no one else had complained about it until several months prior. 🤔 Sorry, but I could not recommend this place to anyone unless this was resolved."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was cute, close to everything. petfect for a quick get away"

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Becky and Nathan's place is as described.
The house is comfortable for 4 people.
The location was great to get to where we wanted to go.
We recommend the place!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location is in a VERY nice neighborhood and quiet. Just down the street and around the corner is everything you want to see and so. There is nothing missing from the location of the place. If you plan to spend most of your time at the air bnb or out and about, this is the perfect place. Only spoke to the owners twice, but both times they seemed to be very kind people which is a great thing with Airbnb."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and minimalist which I love. The front triangular bay window was cool.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a perfect stay for visiting Lancaster and the surrounding area! Very close to local attractions yet tucked away on a quiet neiborhood road. The Aframe was thoughtfully decorated and felt larger than others I’ve stayed in. The open floor plan concept was great! We would definetly stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you've ever wanted to stay in an A-frame you definitely want to give this guest home a try. This guest house has plenty of room inside and a great porch to sit and drink coffee in the mornings.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and clean. Beds were very comfortable and the layout with the bonus loft was ideal. The only recommendation would be to supply a Keurig coffee machine.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, cozy and clean home in a quiet neighborhood - minutes away from Dutch Wonderland, Tanger Outlets, Amish community, Strasburg railway and other attractions. My 5 and 7 year old boys LOVED the house and dearly call is the ""Triangle House"". The host was prompt when we had questions via email as well as text messages from the house.
We would love to go back and will definitely check out other properties listed by them."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay. This place is as advertised, clean, private, and we’ll equipped. We’d consider staying here again when we return to the Lancaster area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful! It was in a lovely neighborhood. It was quiet, and you felt secluded, yet it was super convenient to all the local shopping and restaurants. It’s in such a great location, and absolutely adorable! Nathan and Becky styled this A-frame so well, and it manicured inside and out! The landscape is beautiful, and decor is fantastic! It is kept immaculately, and our stay here was outstanding! Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan and Becky were very helpful and responded quickly to any questions.
We would definitely stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Truly wonderful cottage in Lancaster. Such a lovely place for a long weekend with our toddler. We loved it and would love to return someday!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The B&B was great! Fit our group of 4 very comfortably. The table was perfect to play a few card games and the couch downstairs was very comfortable. The loft was great and bed was comfortable.
The host always responded to our inquiries in a timely manner and very friendly. We would stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Came to visit for the 1st time to see a show at Sight & Sound Theatre. Perfect location! Will stay again if we come back for another show. Very cozy and everything we needed was provided. Spent the day in Lititz and highly recommend if you like quaint places and one of a kind shopping and food. Worth the 25 minute drive.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was absolutely beautiful, warm, and welcoming. I will be booking again to visit the Dutch Wonderland."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Quaint and comfortable A frame house, set in a quiet and pristine setting. One of our best Airbnb stays that we can remember. Hosts are accommodating and instructions are clear. Overall a wonderful experience, highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy stay in a nice neighborhood for a few days!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,If we were ever to visit that area again we would hands down stay with one of their locations. Wonderful hosts.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very clean and had everything we needed. The location was wonderful; very close to the heart of the countryside plus only a few minutes from shopping outlets. Would highly recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The A frame was such a cute house that Nathan and Becky have decorated nicely. My son and I enjoyed our stay. Quiet neighborhood, and was a close drive to everywhere we wanted to go."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was fun to stay in an A-frame! We promptly came in and hit our heads a few times then figured it out. It was perfectly located- close to all the shopping but away from the busy-ness of Lancaster. We love Lancaster and will have fond memories of this cute place!
2023-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The home was very nicely decorated, but reeks of mold. Instructions for check out said to wash/put away dishes, but no sponge to wash. They were very responsive when I reached out about mold smell and sponge. They offered to refund us if we wanted to leave, but we were only there for two nights. They also told us to leave any dishes in the sink for the cleaners. I feel like they knew about the smell since there were two dehumidifiers already set up. They did not help and were very noisy. Also, there was Christian literature everywhere."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay! They house was very clean and beautifully decorated, but had a strong mildew smell to it. Hosts were very responsive and friendly. Great location in Lancaster."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very beautiful A-Frame. Very clean and a perfect spot for a getaway. Nathan and Becky made the stay easy and welcoming, went above and beyond with anything we needed. I highly recommend to book this spot, 5/5 stars!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriends and I took a trip to Lancaster, PA for a weekend getaway. We loved the exterior design of the A-Frame home. The property is located in a suburban neighborhood about 10 minutes from the city center of Lancaster. We appreciated the large comfy couch for us to relax on. The home comfortably fit all four adult women. We had a wonderful, relaxing time in Nathan and Becky's home."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,we enjoyed our stay very much
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a perfect place. Small but had enough room for everything we needed. After a long day of local activities like farmers markets, museums, and restaurants, we were able to come back to a comfortable spot and play some family games or cuddle up and watch a movie on the couch together."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect for all of the activities we had planned. Close to both the country and the city. If we are ever in this area again, we would consider staying here."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second visit at this A-frame house, or as our kids call it “the triangle house”. The house is clean and has all the amenities you’d need. The property is close to any of the local attractions. It was a perfect weekend getaway, and we’ll be back again next year."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little getaway spot! The space was clean and designed with a modern touch. Location was great. 10 minutes or less to downtown Lancaster and 5-6 minutes from one of the best breakfast restaurants I’ve ever had (Agape Cafe & Grille).
The hosts were detailed in their directions and had great communication! Would definitely recommend a stay here."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"place was incredibly clean and cozy, everything was well taken care of and help make the whole trip the best it could be"

Definitely recommend this place!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A cute and comfy house, we really enjoyed our stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was soo cute, charming, clean and modern. We drove in at night and the chandelier porch light lit up the front of the house. It was very warm and inviting. Beds were comfortable. We love how the house was decorated. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay in the A-frame. We have never been inside one, and my daughter thought it was amazing! She loved the loft area and spiral stairs. Everything was clean and so nicely decorated. We enjoyed making breakfast, watching Christmas movies, and sitting in the lounge areas hanging out. The bedroom was very spacious. The location was close to many things we enjoyed. The owners were super responsive.
A few issues/suggestions:
-There was a musty smell on entry but we either got used to it or the dehumidifier took care of it.
-The house felt drafty in some areas so socks or slippers are a good idea for guests to bring.
-I felt that over $100 in fees at the end of checking out was very excessive. I had spent a lot of time researching places and comparing prices and settled on this one. It ended up being TWICE as much as the listing advertised. I was so tired of searching by that point that I booked it anyways, but those cleaning fees should just be included in the cost."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family used the location as a local, short get away over thanksgiving week. It was exactly what we needed to rest, reflect, and restore. Nathan and Becky were accommodating and responsive. The home was lovely and comfortable. We quickly nestled in for some quality time together."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Air Bnb lived up to the reviews and our expectations! It was so cute and comfortable. We felt like we were at home!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My (now!) husband and I stayed here for our wedding weekend and we had such a wonderful time. The house is absolutely adorable and in a perfect location.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place, cozy and homey. Perfect for a solo getaway or couples weekend. Close enough to shops and restaurants but still removed enough for a quiet space."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a unique place to stay! It was very clean, beautifully decorated, safe neighborhood, and central location to main tourist spots."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for a wedding and extremely thankful that we were only 15 minutes away from the venue. The home is wonderful and in a very quiet location. It had just enough space for 4 adults. We also appreciated that the check-in and check-out process was easy and seamless.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This adorable A-frame cottage was easy to find had comfy beds and clean rooms kitchen and bathroom and beautifully decorated!! Would recommend to stay again near the Site and sound theater which is why we came!!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Home was super cute and peaceful. We really enjoyed our stay. Stairs up to loft are a little steep, but we got used to them quickly. Really appreciated that there was a small desk to work from. We would stay here again. It was close to most of the places we wanted to go."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for a wonderful stay! The location is very convenient to shopping, and restaurants and matched the listing’s description accurately. The property is a cozy chalet style cottage in a residential setting with lots of privacy. I would stay at the home again. The property is older but has been renovated and update nicely. The beds are super comfortable! We did notice an odd, damp odor when we first arrived but after emptying the dehumidifier the odor resolved itself. Thank you again for the wonderful stay - we look forward to visiting again in the future."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nathan and Beckys house was very welcoming! Everything was as advertised and very clean! In a great location for many neighboring activity’s.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family loved this adorable little home! My girls called it their “triangle apartment”. They had a blast staying here. It was 7 mins from Dutch Wonderland and accessible to all other Lancaster activities. The neighborhood is very nice and we felt very safe. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to our family/friends!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful place and a great value!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,There were a few small things that made it inconvenient. The water pressure in the shower is bad and the hand railing on the steps are not fully secure in a few spots. 2 very easy fixes . Overall the place was so cute and perfect for two couples in Lancaster for the weekend.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"No complaints at all, 10/10 experience. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,beautiful home in a very nice area. plenty to do. very relaxing.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was very nice. It was perfect for our family getaway. It was close to most of the attractions in Lancaster. The neighbor was very quiet and the yard space was really big. We would definitely recommend this place!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This a really cute place in a great location, with lots of nice amenities like a fire pit and grill. About seven minutes to Dutch Wonderland, which is great when your kids need a nap break in the middle of the day. And easy access to downtown Lancaster and other attractions in the area.
The master bedroom is modern and large, complementing an upstairs loft. Given the design of the house, the loft room gets a lot of light in the morning when the sun comes up. So if you’re sensitive to light, the master bedroom downstairs is better for shutting out light. The kitchen is sensibly stocked with the essentials, though it doesn’t have more specialized items like muffin pans (we ended up making muffins in a casserole dish). The washer/dryer is very handy, as were the dehumidifier and extra air conditioning (it was 90+ every day we were there). We would definitely stay again!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb was beautiful and had a very elegant layout! The only downside was the heat. If you are visiting in the summer, you may want to bring a couple extra fans. We tried turning down the AC to 60 and it did not work effectively. The couple nights me and my wife stayed we did not get very good rest unfortunately, but it was still a very nice place to stay aside from this and we enjoyed the time we spent during the day! I assume this would be a perfect location in the fall and spring."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great indoor and outside spaces. Roomy bathroom and bedrooms for our long term stay. Becky and Nathan responded immediately to our questions and concerns!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place - such a unique little house. Close to everything but in a nice quiet neighborhood. Would definitely stay again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect for my daughters wedding night.
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Good location and comfortable beds, however the house has a musty odor and a dehumidifier that needs to run continuously.
The hosts suggest that guests eat out which is a good idea-the kitchen works best for simple meals only. (Bring your own coffee and coffee filters.)
We had a wonderful not-too-expensive family meal at the Restaurant at Oregon Dairy."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cutest place! We loved this a-frame house that was close to all the places we were visiting. We will definitely look for this home specifically the next time we want to stay in the Lancaster area!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is clean and in a quiet neighborhood! Very close drive to all Lancaster attractions. You will not be disappointed.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time staying at this house, it’s perfectly located near all the things we wanted to explore. It’s on a quiet street, the neighbours were super friendly and the thing we loved most was building a fire on the side of the house. The toproom gets hot easily, that was the only thing we didn’t enjoy. The kitchen was very comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had such a lovely time! Close to many attractions! The home was nice and clean - perfect for my family and I!
Best,
Taryn B"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house in a quiet neighborhood, absolutely nothing to complain about. Nathan and Becky were also very responsive and helpful."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay! Close enough to the Amish that when you go to explore their culture you really don’t have to drive far. All of the main attractions are 10-25 minutes away. Tanger outlets are literally 4 minutes away. Hershey park 35-45 mins away. Downtown is close. Its in a great, well off neighborhood. Seems like it’s not alot of crime in the area at all. Had extra toilet paper and trash bags easily accessible. Lots of towels and wash cloths. Pans, and dishes and appliances readily available. Very clean house. The bed room upstairs may be hard to get to if it’s an older person, or heavy set person. Upstairs probably better for children.
This stay was very enjoyable! Thank you Nathan and Becky!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderfully appointed house - all the right upgrades, plenty of linens, blankets and pillows. Cleanliness five stars for sure.
The listing photos conveyed a much more secluded area than where the house is located. It was a very quiet street and there was nothing concerning but we expected a much more wooded, secluded area. That could have been remedied by my looking up the address but alas…
Great driving distance to all the good stuff. We’d certainly visit again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is gorgeous! It’s in a quiet neighborhood in a perfect spot near lots of restaurants and things to do. The house is very clean, comfy beds, and kitchen is stocked with pots and pans. I would recommend this place to anyone!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan and Becky’s air bnb is a cute little hideaway in Lancaster. We loved the house and location! It was the perfect place to stay as it was close to Sight and Sound theatre and all of the other local attractions. The house was so clean, and it felt like a home away from home. It is also in a nice neighborhood, so we felt very safe. We can’t wait to stay here again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was so charming and perfect for our getaway. It had so many little things that made the place a gem. Great stay! Can’t wait to come back.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay! Hosts gave a lot of suggestions of things to do. The place was clean and organized. The location was great, near a lot of things to do and restaurants. The description of it being in a quit neighborhood is very accurate, however, based on the photos I thought it was a little more secluded, but we were totally fine with it."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house and location on a quiet street!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan and Becky's place is well-located and well-cared for. A short drive to downtown Lancaster, it's on a quiet street but near enough to everything you might want to do. It's stylish and spacious, with plenty of room to stretch out, while the A-Frame of it all means it's still cozy and cabin-like. A great find!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we love coming to Lancaster and have stayed in a few different spots throughout the years. Martha's place was a fun little spot and easy to get to. we are looking forward to coming back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was absolutely delighted to return to Martha's for the second time, and I must say, this charming residence truly feels like a home away from home. Its prime location, just a 5-minute stroll from school, makes it an ideal haven for students seeking convenience and comfort. Plus, a bowling alley with a restaurant serving exquisite sangria is just around the corner, providing the perfect spot to unwind with friends. And, if you're fortunate, you'll be greeted by the welcoming committee: a playful and affectionate puppy who loves attention and playtime. This cozy retreat offers everything you need to feel relaxed and at ease, complete with soft linens, plush furnishings, and a well-equipped kitchen that makes cooking a breeze. During our stay, we took full advantage of the beautiful weather and spent some quality time lounging in the patio chairs, soaking up the sun. I've already booked my next stay in a couple of weeks and am eager to make use of the grill and enjoy soaking in the sun!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for seeing Sight and Sound with the wife. Very clean and just the right amount of space. The Mrs. loved your lil dog! Just a short distance to the main strip of shops, outlets and restaurants.. Would stay again for the next Sight and Sound."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can think of only two items I'd add, if I were making suggestions. I'd add more, but I can't, because Martha's cottage had everything else we needed!
For a smaller cottage, the space was laid out to make use of just about every inch, so it didn't have a small-space feel to it. It was the perfect space for my husband and I to get a much needed break. We both slept like babies in the cozy bed, did NOT want to get out of the FABULOUS shower (I almost made us late checking out because it felt so good), and rather than eat in the living room to watch tv, we just turned it a little and it was perfect for viewing while we enjoyed our dinner at the kitchen counter.
Probably the only down-side was that it was chilly and windy, so it wasn't the best weather to walk across their foot bridge and sit by the stream. We're very much looking forward to another stay so we can do that, as well as enjoying cooking outside on the grill. Loved this place!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely little place. We stayed for one night and enjoyed the comfy bed and a quiet place to rest for the night after a busy night in of dinner and a concert!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic place for a stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Martha's place was great for myself, daughter and our dog. We needed a small space to rent while our home had some renovations done and this was perfect for us. The place had everything you would need for a few days stay. We appreciated the outlets in the end tables/nightstand for our electronics. The outside space had a small deck that was nice for sitting and a grill if you needed to grill! The road is busy and can be loud at night at times, but it wasn't a deal breaker and the host's fault. We will be recommending this place to our friends and family when they are visiting us!"

Everything you could need or want is there. We loved the deck lights and appreciated the private parking spot. We also loved being in our own spot and the location is amazing. Martha’s communication was wonderful as we were coming from Canada and had all the information we needed before we checked in. We would HIGHLY recommend Martha’s cottage and we will be returning next time we are in town.
Thank you so much Martha!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was good for what we needed and better than a hotel. Martha made sure there was a iron at the location after I asked which was great. Few thing off- like the handheld show spout (which we are pretty sure was broken) didn’t work, the bed was below average in comfort, the whole place was cooled by a single window ac unit and no fans, and both my wife and me woke up with scratching throats and runny noses like our allergies were irritated. The only other complaint we had was there was no full length mirror which when you are in town for a wedding is a small thing worth noting. It was overall really clean, the back deck was a nice touch and I would definitely stay there again over a hotel especially at the price."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We found the little house to be so nice, very comfortable and we totally enjoyed our selves. It was close to everything that we had planned to do there. Which included the sight and sound theater. I would recommend this lovely rental to any couple or single person that was coming out of the area."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Martha’s place was the perfect getaway for our first family vacation! Our toddler loved walking around from room to room and snuggling on the couch, and our dog loved roaming for bunnies in the backyard. He even took a quick dip in the creek!
The kitchen was perfect to prepare quick meals in when we didn’t feel like going out, as well as to just sit at the bar and enjoy some snacks!
My husband and I really enjoyed sitting outside on the deck in the evening, sharing in a little quiet and relaxation. The string lights set the best mood!
This was a cozy home away from home. Would recommend to anyone looking to getaway for a few days!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Martha’s place was absolutely wonderful! It was the perfect landing pad for my crew in the middle of a long road trip. The house was spotless and well appointed. Martha was very responsive to any requests. Being pet-friendly was a huge bonus to us— we brought a long 50 foot leash for our dog and he loved romping around in the field behind the creek after a day in the car. Lancaster is wonderful- highly recommend the downtown area, tons of restaurants and shops, and a very nice dog park as well. My only note just to be aware of us that there is no AC unit in the bedroom (it’s in the main living area), which is totally fine if you keep the door open at night. If you close the door, however, the room gets a little stuffy. We would absolutely stay again!"

Plus… her little dog came and greeted us and was SO friendly and cute!"

Martha was very nice and available if we needed anything and the place was in a great location, close to great food, shopping, and fun. There was also a great doggie daycare not too far away that our dog loved, which was a huge plus. Definitely looking forward to going back again soon."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a darling little find this was! We loved our stay at Martha's and Ben's cottage, if even for just one night. We got the chance to meet our hosts and enjoyed our conversation with them. Their tiny, adorable pup greeted us when we first arrived and she was the cutest little thing! All looked the same as in the photos, so pretty, new looking, and spotless. The bed was very comfortable and the shower just perfect. We enjoyed our morning coffee on the little deck out back and even took a walk across their small bridge to check it out. My husband and I felt right at home in this cottage and are happy we found a place we can book for future visits to Lancaster. Oh...did I mention that they are in a great location too? So close to restaurants and all the major attractions to be seen in Lancaster!"

i love south central PA!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and quiet
Really enjoyed our stay"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Martha’s Airbnb was the perfect place for a one night stop in a road trip. Right down the road from a main shopping center with lots of food options! Also right off the high way so was very easy to get to! We were very grateful Martha allowed dogs, the back yard was perfect for our pup to stretch his legs. Very comfortable bed, and the place was spotless! Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in PA."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great place to stay! House was nicely decorated, spotless, and comfortable for myself and my friend who were in Lancaster for girls night out. Close to the outlets for shopping. Martha and Ben were very friendly and responsive hosts. We would definitely come back!"

The guest book was a nice touch and the coffee (Monk’s Blend) was delicious. There’s a 1-cup coffee maker, works well. I’d definitely stay there again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Martha’s cottage was exactly as described. It was the perfect hub for shopping and our subsequent wedding. 10/10 would stay again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is very spacious for 2 people and was very clean. Even though it's off a busy road, it still feels private because it's its own cottage and there's a lot of land in the back. We had our own parking space and had no problems checking in. Martha was very responsive and provided clear instructions before check-in and check-out. The place was very clean and had everything we needed. We were there for less than 24 hours as it was a really quick trip, but we enjoyed our stay. We were even greeted walking out our door in the morning by their absolutely adorable pup. She made our morning...she's the sweetest and friendliest little thing! We only crossed paths briefly with Martha and her husband while leaving and they were very kind."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friend and I stopped here on the way back home for one night. It was such a cute and homey place to stay! Martha was very responsive, she made checkin and checkout very easy. It was also a really nice location."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, lovely, well-appointed place and with a really comfy bed!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Terrific spot w/yard, deck, grill, clothesline. Heard the bubbling creek out back. Sunrise over the creek; enjoy outside w/java &/or your dog. Close to attractions like Central Market, Shady Maple, Dutch Wonderland & nature/walking trails.
Looks like a stackable washer/dryer will be set up soon (hopefully by swimmers season)! If you plan on night arrival, have them leave a porch light on; the driveway area is a little dark. HVAC quick to heat; water pressure great. Will recommend to family."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved Martha’s place. It was so clean and fit us perfect. The location was great for our plans. Martha responded promptly when contacted. We look forward to our next stay.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Martha’s listing is super Priceless. This Oasis is 10x better in person. It felt right at home in their cottage, everything was so clean, so organized and you felt like never leaving. Martha responds very quickly and such an easy check in process and they are always available if you need them. You will not regret staying here because they are right next to Sight and sound and wonderful close by restaurants. Will definitely rebook sometime in the future again! Thank you. Highly recommend"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We were honored to be Martha & Ben's first renters. The place was above & beyond. Martha thought of everything and the comfort and cleanliness were impeccable. The backyard with the bamboo growing next to the creek was other wordly. What a special treat to have so much field and beauty to walk my dog. The communication was perfect & the location could NOT get any better.

It was a great location and within minutes of everything we wanted to do downtown! We did not have any trouble finding parking, and it was free the whole weekend. We would love come here again in the future. Thank you both for a wonderful stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I were scrambling to make last minute plans for our anniversary weekend. When we decided to check out Lancaster as an option, we were thrilled when this space popped up!
It had the exact aesthetic I was hoping for, and actually met our budget for a two night stay (plus no outrageous fees) - which seemed like a steal considering how beautifully this space was renovated and styled.
Everything was super clean and looked exactly like the photos.
We were about a 10-15 minute walk (or less) from most spaces and had a lovely time!"

The hosts are always responsive and helpful! We will certainly be back again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I wish we had had more time to enjoy this absolutely gorgeous room. We loved the decor and the layout was sensible and liveable. It is about a 12-minute brisk walk into the center of Lancaster—a must-visit town with so much to offer. A privilege to stay in this beautiful Victorian home in Lancaster :)

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic Airbnb! One of our favorites in all of the places we've stayed. The unit is gorgeous, extremely clean, and had everything we needed for our stay. The hosts went above and beyond to stock the unit--there was a Brita pitcher in the fridge (something I often wish for in Airbnbs), a white noise machine (though we didn't need it). And everything worked well--great water pressure in the shower, for example. We were very comfortable here and enjoyed exploring all that Lancaster has to offer in easy walking distance."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely amazing stay at Rich and Shannon’s place. The space was so clean, the balcony was a great spot for a drink. Downtown was easily walkable. Overall a really enjoyable stay."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic hosts - very responsive and provided lots of local recommendations. The space is very special! Beautifully styled with lots of thoughtful touches. (We watched a thunderstorm from the balcony!) Perfect location…~15 min drive to the heart of beautiful Amish country and walking distance to so many breweries, shops and restaurants. HIGHLY recommend!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is convenient to the convention center and other downtown attractions. Street parking was easy and better yet, free during the time we were there. We parked the car when we arrived and walked everywhere during our stay.
Tried, and enjoyed, several of the host-recommended businesses."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing, beautiful, and open space. Your renovations to this historic building are very impressive! We adored your giant and healthy monstera, the building was very easy to get into, and we loved your guestbook. Great touch on having a blow dryer with a diffuser, as well as different kitchen things. Thanks for everything, we hope to stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at The Fahnestock. The house was beautiful, with a perfect mix of historic and updated features, thoughtfully decorated, and comfortable. Check-in was flexible and easy, and all instructions were clear. We loved reading on the quiet, private deck as part of the Matilda Suite, and the location was walkable to everywhere we wanted to go in Lancaster. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a lovely few nights here everything is so romantically done, it was cozy and so close to walk to coffee shops and restaurants!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely studio space. Plenty of room, natural light and everything I needed for a week-long stay on a work trip. So much better than a hotel!! The location is also a very easy walk to offices downtown (or the Central Market)."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rich and Shannon's Apartment is absolutely beautiful. My wife and I stayed here for our Wedding in Lancaster and it was absolutely perfect.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am from NYC. I had a 4 day stay in Schaefferstown Heidelberg Hall, but I didn't want to leave PA quite yet. This home here is the best place to stay in Lancaster, PA. right in the middle of the historical district. You can stay there and do everything. The hosts are so kind. I am so sad to have left."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another wonderful stay at Rich and Shannon’s beautiful apartment… I’ve loved staying there… hope to be back soon.
Thank you!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great price, clean, beautiful and comfortable!! We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an awesome place to stay in Lancaster. We loved it!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was able to find a place to park a couple doors up from the property so that was a great start. The street is busy but the Matilda suite is on the backside of the building and aside from a very occasional ambulance (due to the proximity of the property), it was extremely quiet and peaceful. There is an abundance of natural light from morning to sunset which was absolutely therapeutic. It is roughly a half mile walk to the Central Market, I didn't plan well and there were so many options, so carrying my goods back was a bit of a bear so if you plan to go to the market, bring a back back or cart - it will make things easier. The kitchen had exactly what I needed to make meals and they left some farm fresh eggs and a couple of micro brews as an added treat. Great coffee shops and unique retail shops were an easy 10-20 minute walk depending on where you want to go. The Belvedere Inn was about around the corner and had delicious food and drinks with friendly bartenders. I'll be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emily and I stayed over the extended Easter weekend…the suite was wonderful, kitchen was updated, clean and looked great! Same for the bathroom! An added benefit was the little porch! We will most def return and let our friends and family know where to stay on their next visit in Lancaster!
Thank you again for sharing your beautiful home!
Francois"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the most beautiful places we've stayed. The home did a great job of mixing historic charm with modern touches that didn't feel out of place. The area was very walkable to all the downtown attractions and they provided some excellent recommendations. We're recommending this place to all our friends and family that visit Lancaster!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Rich and Shannon's place. Check-in and check-out was very easy and communication was very good. The information about parking permits was much appreciated. The apartment was clean and well appointed. The location is great, just a short walk from the heart of downtown, and yet the apartment is very quiet. The bed was very comfortable but the pillows were a little flat. The shower water pressure was good with plenty of hot water."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was fantastic!! Had everything we needed and more. The area was nice and has everything you need. Will definitely stay again!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! The suite was exactly as pictured and so beautifully decorated, and equipped with everything we needed for a very comfortable stay. And a great location as well."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very fun cute studio. I was worried about parking but always found a spot almost right in front of the building. Great location. Doors very heavy to get into building but in keeping with the style! Well-stocked and perfect for a one person multiple day stay. Will look forward to staying again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rich and Shannon’s Matilda Suite was just perfect. Cozy, clean, with charm, and walking distance to restaurants, coffee and market. Would stay here next time I am in town."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient location, Be sure to get the parking pass, easy checkin- everything was is great condition- bed was super comfortable. It was also quieter in the room than I expected being a city location-"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in awe of the space when I first arrived - so beautiful with natural light and perfectly decorated! The setup of the bed, kitchen, and bathroom made for a comfortable stay with everything I needed. Everywhere I went during my stay was within a 10-minute walk of the apartment, I did not move my car from where I parked it when I arrived until I was heading out of the city. Truly, this Airbnb has made me want to come back to Lancaster asap!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,The pictures on this listing does not do this place justice. There is so much natural light! I feel like I was finding new things that I love about the decor everyday. And the shower! 10/10! The best shower pressure I have experienced so far. It felt like a waterfall. The place is cute but practical. The bed is comfortable and sturdy. There is also a small deck!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A well laid out beautiful apartment!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely charming! The accommodations were very cozy and the perfect mix of antiques with modern amenities.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a romantic mini getaway thanks to Rich and Shannon and their impeccable attention to detail. Every bit of their space is thoughtfully well designed. Perfectly comfy and clean! Pictures can’t possibly do this space justice. Well done! See you again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of my favorite Airbnb stays ever. The photos of the space don’t do it justice. There’s an incredible attention to detail and care taken here and you can feel it the moment you walk in. Centrally located near everything you need- we went for 3 of the restaurant recommendations given (Luca, On Orange, and Belvedere Inn). The guidebook was spot on. We rode bikes around town to some quick shops and food and it was so fun! Sparkling clean and comfortable space that was equipped with everything you need. Would love to return."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I recently stayed here while attending some jewelry courses Beadfest in Lancaster and I have to say we couldn’t have chosen a better spot! Check-in was a breeze and any questions we had were promptly answered. And the apartment! Even more beautiful in person. Perfect location (we easily walked to where our classes were, restaurants, bars, shopping, etc) . It was quiet and clean and the shower pressure was top notch. Highly recommend. Thank you so much Rich & Shannon!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space is even more beautiful than the pictures show. Shannon and Rich are super responsive. And it could not be more comfortable.
There are a lot of stairs, fyi. They're well maintained and railings everywhere, and frankly they give the space a lot of its charm. Just a thing to know in advance."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place. A beautiful older house with all the modern conveniences. Very nice.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Matilda Suite is so lovely. The decor is comfortable and timeless. The hosts provided nice amenities and it was very clean. The neighborhood is nice and within walking distance of local restaurants and other attractions. We were able to find street parking in front of the home during our stay. We will definitely stay here again if in the Lancaster area.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend & I had a great stay at their place! Rich and Shannon mentioned that the cast iron door at the entrance was heavy, but I just want to confirm it’s INSANELY heavy, I had to put all my weight on it when I was attempting to open it. Other than that we had a great stay, it was a clean and cozy place! We did end up staying on a night when they were doing street cleaning so we had to park on lime street, it was an okay walk. We did checkout a couple of cafes in the area for breakfast both days. Definitely would recommend going to Max’s eatery & Cafe one eight & Lancaster cupcakes!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location. Super quiet. The Matilda room was perfect. We stay at a lot of Airbnb's. This one was scores high on our list. Central location.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location and apartment were great. We had no complaints and it was both nicer and more affordable than the other alternatives.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Mathilda Suite was nice and clean. The bed was small for two people but we managed. Parking can be a problem in the daytime but if you find a spot in front of the house by 6:00 p.m. it is free until 8:00 a.m. The house is located on a busy street, however, since the Mathilda Suite is in the back, we could cover the noise by using a fan. The shower is very nice with good water pressure. We enjoyed our time in Lancaster, especially touring the Amish Farms and Country."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It felt like home as soon as we entered. It was super clean and cozy. They have a helpful guide but I had one little question and they were so quick to respond. We plan on returning!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute MUST visit.
This listing is everything it looks to be and more. Before travelling, our expectations were set high based on the description and the photos that are provided - but wow were they ever exceeded.
The location proved to be optimal during our stay as well. We were walking distance from most shops / restaurants that we planned to enjoy, and had no issues finding parking when we needed to drive. A few highlights from our trip were Decades for games / dinner, Sight and Sound theatres, Taylor Chip Cookies, and Landis Family Farm for some fresh cut flowers.
We are confident that this listing will exceed your expectations as well, and serve you wonderfully throughout your stay. It is very clear that the hosts have put significant time and energy into making every aspect of this stay intentional and relaxing."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Clean, amazing location, quick responses, great hosts. 13/10 would recommend"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gracious hosts, easy check in, beautiful accommodations in an elegant house. We loved having coffee on the balcony in the morning and found the bed to be extremely comfortable. The decor of the suite was exactly to our taste and the house has been lovingly renovated, with attention to retaining period detail. Beware the industrious parking authority of Lancaster and follow their rules!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was gorgeous. Amazing location and great hosts. We would absolutely stay again. Highly recommended.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as pictured if not better.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a delightful property! The original architecture is amazing (I’m in love with the stairs). Shannon and Rich have created a quiet and cozy getaway that I would recommend in a heartbeat to friends & family.
As others mentioned, there were lots of thoughtful touches, from the bathrobes to the two local beers & small container of eggs in the fridge. It was nice and cool (central AC for the win!) and I loved all of the natural light through the windows. While I didn’t use it, the fact that there was laundry in the basement was huge plus. Everything was incredibly clean, the bed was very comfortable, and the shower is truly the BEST. Seriously.
Shannon & Rich are very responsive, friendly, and helpful (and the welcome guide they created was fantastic!). You can tell they’ve put a lot of time and care into their properties, and I’m very excited to come back and stay again sometime.
Also, I grew up in the country and have lived in many cities (including Lancaster) and this was one of the quietest places I’ve stayed in. There were maybe a few times I heard a car, but it was very rare! I was so happy to come back after a busy day and be in complete silence.
Don’t miss out on this stay—it will be one of your favorites!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"coolest, loveliest spot with perfect mix of comfort, charm and character! Would recommend to any + all :)"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charming! Loved the decor. Well appointed.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place. My husband and I are definitely country people so the traffic and parking were a bit alarming but that’s just a personal thing. The room was awesome.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay. It was so refreshing staying somewhere with so so much natural light and plants. The mattress was the comfiest of any Airbnb we've stayed in. The kitchen had everything we needed. We enjoyed reading on the balcony. We hope to be returning next year! It was the perfect place for us to rejuvenate and also celebrate our 2nd anniversary. (And it was nice staying somewhere we could take our baby with us)
P. S. The Matilda suite was inspirational for my future hopes of decorating when we have a place of our own. So lovely!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredibly clean, very easy to communicate, everything you would need for your stay! I don’t have enough nice things."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was gorgeous and I loved the suite. It was charming and comfortable. Perfect amount of light because of the many windows. The space was the perfect size to work and live in. Loved the way the kitchen was divided from the sleeping area. And the location was so convenient. Was able to explore the local cafes and food spots by foot. Will def be coming back.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the Matilda suite! It was very clean and nicely decorated. Convenient location in a historical building!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful weekend stay. We tried some of their suggestions and everything was too notch. Close to downtown and all that Lancaster and surrounding area has to offer.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! The home is absolutely beautiful, and the renovations were brilliantly done! I would go back just to use the incredible shower. After trying to explain how extraordinary the experience was to my husband and encountering skepticism, I was chuffed to hear cries of “ohh wow!” and “my goodness! This conditioner” coming from the bathroom the next morning. This is the perfect retreat and a luxurious experience."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a beautiful space! The house is absolutely beautiful and positioned well in a very walkable downtown Lancaster. The hosts are very kind and professional. We will absolutely be returning to the Matilda in the future.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gorgeous space which incorporates history and character with functionality and charm. Everything that you could possibly need is provided including a couple of cold sider/ lager drinks in the fridge which were MOST appreciated after driving all day. Everything was pretty over the top all the way to the sweeping stairs to the beautiful trim through out, If you love beautiful, historic buildings I highly recommend staying here."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall a wonderful getaway experience. The place was historically beautiful.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! The location is perfect, the hosts are super communicative, and the space is gorgeous. Comfortable, cozy, and bright. We hope to return!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an all around 5-star stay and a wonderful experience. I am recommending this airbnb to all of my friends/family and so they can enjoy this just as much as we did! Looking forward to our next stay in Lancaster!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this space! Rich and Shannon got every detail right! The best, relaxing little getaway we’ve had in a while! Thank you! We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here!! The place looked just like the pictures, it was so beautiful! The location was amazing as well, easy walking to shops, restaurants and great coffee. The challenges were that the internet was spotty. There were a couple of times we had work meetings and the internet was not reliable. The second was that we got a parking ticket the first night we were there. There is plenty of street parking that normally it is fine to use but look out for street cleaning days! They’ll ticket in the middle of the night on those days.
Overall an amazing experience, definitely recommend!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Key placement in lobby easy to follow directions. Was all pretty smooth.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a beautiful airbnb, exactly as described and probably even better than photos. We appreciated that the room had a box fan and a noise machine for all sleeping comfort levels. Its also at a great location for exploring Lancaster on foot!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Matilda was so beautiful, cozy & bright. The building was surprisingly so quiet nestled in the city in a great location. I can’t recommend a stay here enough! Thank you Rich and Shannon!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rich and Shannons Place was beautiful in a great location. Everything was so warm and cozy. Would definitely stay here again.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, immaculate home, wonderful stay!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous apartment in a centrally located part of town. I walked easily to shops, restaurants, and the Central Market. The spacious studio apartment itself is even better in person than in the photos—loads of sunlight, stylish renovations and furnishings, and a well-stocked kitchen. The historical nature of this building adds to its charm, and I would happily book this flat again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and so cute for a weekend away. Very easy to get to anywhere in Lancaster.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay. The morning walk around the cornfield was so beautiful! Thank you.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay was exceptional and walking distance to downtown. Highly recommend.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time being hosted by Rich and Shannon and just like the 1st time everything was exactly as expected and described. Beautifully decorated space, comfy bed, great location, great value, and clear communication with the host. Will definitely recommend to family and friends looking for a stay in Lancaster."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute gem. Gorgeous little studio in an incredible old Victorian that’s super clean, very well-appointed, and a short walk from downtown. The hosts were very communicative and helpful. I stayed here for a mini-writing retreat, and loved it so much I’m going back next month!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay in a rear-facing apartment in an amazing historic house! The location is great - very short walk to shops and restaurants downtown. Be aware of the on-street parking restrictions near the apartment. The apartment is very well appointed, and the apartment and porch are full of plants, which was a really nice touch. Lancaster has a lot going for it and it was nice to spend a weekend there. Would definitely stay again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed in many Airbnb’s all over the world and this was one of our favorites. The fixtures and decor are high quality, well thought out and gorgeous. This is also an incredible historic house. The hosts also went above and beyond to make our special circumstances work, which was so sweet. The bed was comfortable, the shower was fantastic and the apartment was sparkling clean.
We hope to stay here anytime we are in Lancaster!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rich and Shannon have done an absolutely stunning job restoring this old Victorian home. It is conveniently located on Duke Street, one of the main thoroughfares of the city, and this unit is located in the back of the home away from any street noise, and surrounded by greenery. Quick 10 minute walk to Lemon Street Market for groceries, or to other shops in downtown. The balcony is lovely for having morning coffee and breakfast, or an evening meal. The interior is spotlessly clean (I am a tough judge of cleanliness), with all the comforts of home provided and then some! There are so many thoughtful touches (well tended to plants, extra blankets, plush robes, etc.) that truly made our stay more than just another airbnb. The shower head/water pressure is amazing and spa-like. Check-in was easy, and communication with Rich and Shannon was always timely and helpful. For parking, another review suggested trying over by the nearby cemetery, and this worked perfectly for us as well (no permit required, and no time limit). I would without hesitation recommend"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rich and Shannon were awesome hosts! They always replied very quickly when communicating with them and their guestbook was very informative. I wouldn’t hesitate to book with them again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the Fahnestock House was absolutely lovely! My boyfriend and I rented this space for a little romantic getaway, and it was perfect. The private balcony, bathrobes, and other little touches made this stay exactly what we were looking for. It was also a great location - Rich and Shannon provided a lovely little guidebook showing off all the local hot spots within walking distance to help make our stay in Lancaster really easy to plan. The best part is that all of this came with an affordable price tag, which you don't see often in AirBnB's. This place is truly a gem and I would definitely book here again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying in the Matilda Flat. The space is absolutely stunning and cozy. The bed is VERY comfortable and the kitchen is equipped with everything you could need! The location is very nice, an EASY walk into center city for any outings, shopping, or activities!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and a beautiful historic house! The Matilda Suite is very tastefully decorated and cozy. A very enjoyable and relaxing stay.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and amazing decor. Great apartment if you are looking to get away for a few days. Very cute space with a nice kitchen, bathroom and balcony!
If you park a few streets away at the cemetery, you don’t have to pay for street parking which made the trip a bit less hectic with remembering parking meter limits."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Fahnestock house. It's gorgeous and centrally located. Walking distance from downtown restaurants, the central market, and clipper magazine stadium. The apartment was comfortable and we enjoyed the patio. Would stay again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved this place and without a doubt will be back in the near future. It was a perfect little getaway.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning space. Immaculately clean. Great location to walk to coffee shops and restaurants. I would recommend to park in one of the nearby parking garages, as street parking can be a little confusing."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay is absolutely dreamy. Rich and Shannon have thought of everything to make your stay comfortable and inviting. The home is within walking distance to all the good shops and restaurants in town. We had such a relaxing time and left inspired by the design of the suite which is just as nice in person as in the photos.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location and perfect for a couple’s weekend getaway.
Perfect mix of updated plus historic charm.
Outside terrace was a great bonus!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Matilda Suite was just what I needed! Not only did it have my two favorite colors, but I’ve been craving to go to Italy this past year and this was the next best thing. Super safe and quaint neighborhood. Gorgeous decor with a mixture of European design, and updated appliances. I’ll be recommending this place to everyone and will totally be back if they’ll have me!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shannon was quick to respond to all of our inquiries and requests, and together they provided a beautiful home (and experience) that I imagine is unparalleled."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rich and Shannon's place, The Matilda, was a wonderful weekend retreat for my wife and I. Rich and Shannon offered a very clean and well put together place that we'd highly recommend if your looking for a place to stay in Lancaster, Pa. The Matilda is in a perfect location to walk to many attractions and points of interest in the area. We found our stay there very peaceful and quiet. The building itself is full of charm, while The Matilda has a way of making you feel like you're walking into your home. If you're looking for a long weekend stay or even longer, we highly recommend you giving The Matilda a try."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an experience! Absolutely beautiful home. Had everything we needed and more. Will definitely be telling everyone about it!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful space with great tips about local spots!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved everything about our second stay at this lovely mansion! From the dresser full of games to the thoughtful decorations and the crazy high ceilings everything was beyond our expectations! The local beers in the fridge were a nice touch as well! Thanks again for having us, we are already talking about our next visit to Lancaster and the Fahnestock House!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Rich and Shannon's place. We were just stopping through for one night, at the last minute, and they were vey accommodating! The space was drenched in light, which was very enjoyable, especially during this winter when we are forced to spend way more time indoors. The kitchen is well-equipped, with dishwasher and everything you need to prepare simple meals at home. There is only one TV, in the bedroom, but this was fine for us as we just watched it for a bit before bed. The apartment is in a wonderful location, right in the downtown. There's an organic grocery store a few blocks away to pick up whatever you may need food-wise, and an adorable Swedish candy shop right around the corner. Most things were not open, because it was a Sunday and of course, Covid, but we still enjoyed wandering around the cute town. Parking is a bit complicated, as much of the street parking requires a permit, so make sure to read the instructions provided by Rich and Shannon for where/when you can park safely to avoid getting ticketed. You could hear the other people in the building above you and when guests were coming up or down the stairs, but it was very quiet at night. Overall, we had a great stay and would stay again."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. It was nice to be close enough to walk to local shops and the market place. Guidebook and easy directions from the hosts were a plus.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a warm + inviting space. The windows were a big seller for my partner and I when deciding on a place in Lancaster and the way they welcomed the sun did not disappoint. Good location and perfect for a local lil weekend ""getaway"" during covid."
2021-01-01,4,Stayed over a week,"It's a beautiful apartment and the hosts are super great but... it has a couple of things that
we didn't like. First of all since it's on a second floor we were told that we may be able to hear footsteps above us, but that was far from true. Not only you can listen to everything other guests do above you, but we had people walking with heels and even 2 kids jumping up and down and galloping above our bedroom when we were trying to sleep. it's not the hosts fault, but I did find this kind of disappointing considering we asked them about the noise. Second thing is since it's located in the city, you can hear cars.That wouldn't be terrible if only people didn't blast their speakers all the time. And there's (Im guessing a neighbor?) a person that plays the LOUDEST music at 8:30 am every.single.day. we stayed for 14 days and that was enough, because it's super super loud. so if you're Looking for an extremely quiet place, this is not it.
Apart from that, the place is cool. Stylish and comfortable, it just wasn't what we were expecting. Most of the problems are NOT the hosts fault, but it did kind of ruined the experience for us."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is beautiful! We definitely enjoyed our stay! Everything was very clean and stylish.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,excelente lugar
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect (and covid-friendly) getaway for me and my partner. Beautiful apartment in a beautiful house in a beautiful city surrounded by a beautiful countryside is all we wanted.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place in an ideal location! Walkable to soooo many things and Rich and Shannon had a binder full of places they recommended. 10/10 you should stay here!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, amazing, amazing! Book this space for a perfect place to stay while you are in Lancaster. Close to everything and the house is awesome too!
They have done an amazing job with the building and it surely made our stay better than we could’ve expected!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was truly beautiful stay and my boys (5 and 3 years old) loved the space as well. Rich and Shannon kindly let us use pack and play for our infant too. All furnitures were practically necessary and serving their purpose without taking space in vain. All the decors look blend in to the interior and were arrayed and arranged so well that the original architect if he were alive would’ve complimented Rich and Shannon for their quality renovation/decoration work as well. It was such memorable and comfortable stay that my family wants to visit this place every year to rest.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great and hospitable service
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Fahnestock house was a great accommodation for our short stay in Lancaster. The place itself was very stylish and beautiful, and conveniently located within short walking distance of several stops downtown. Everything was clean and comfortable, would be happy to stay again on another trip in the future! I will definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice stay in Lancaster."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was beyond satisfied with this stay! Perfect location close to a lot of local spots! Lovely strolling distance from the Amish Market. I will definitely keep this location in mind when I visit again!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed our long weekend at the Matilda flat. The space was cozy and inviting, just like the photos indicate. The bed was super comfortable as well. The kitchen is well stocked with everything one could need to enjoy some takeout and/or heat up leftovers. Great value and would happily stay again!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay in this BEAUTIFUL home! It was within walking distance to a lot of great restaurants and we enjoyed driving around the surrounding streets to admire all the lovely architecture. The flat was clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend staying here!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! The building itself is beautiful, our room was clean, and filled with essentials. Walking distance from some great restaurants and coffee shops."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here while visiting Lancaster and loved everything about it! The space was so, so beautiful - it was the perfect place to unwind and recharge. We loved that Rich and Shannon put a couple of cans of local beer in the fridge for us to try. Their recommendations of places to check out is extensive, everything we tried from their list was great. The house is within walking distance of so much, you can easily explore the city and never need to get in your car. We'll be back for sure!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!! Really enjoyed my stay.
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Matilda Flat is in a big old house that has all its original details. The ceilings are high and windows large, making the space feel nice and airy. The place is on the back of the building up a flight of stairs, so it’s nice and quiet. The kitchen and bath are recently updated, and the kitchen is fully equipped with pans, utensils, etc. Street parking was pretty easy, but for convenience I bought a week pass to the hospital parking garage around the corner (be aware that it closes at 8pm). Rich and Shannon provided a very thorough guide to the house and the city. Note: If you are physically challenged, you might have difficulty with the building’s beautiful but VERY heavy front door. All in all, a pleasant stay."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This spot is perfect for location, and the house is just as described—just beautiful and historic. We enjoyed the layout, with a very comfortable bedroom and television. We brought our two tween/teen girls and they made themselves right at home. Perfect spot to walk to many different restaurants and sights. We loved it. Rich and Shannon were quick to respond to questions and left simple to follow instructions and advice. Thank you!!"
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Matilda Flat was a wonderful place to relax while on a weekend getaway! Close to cute restaurants and attractions.
Parking was a bit stressful, however."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space for a couple. Very spacious and bright with high ceilings, large windows, and lots of character. And within walking distance of many great restaurants/ clubs/ coffee shops."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rich and Shannon’s home was very charming, spacious, well kept, and central to Lancaster’s nearby great attractions. Highly recommend their home!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Rich and Shannon are incredible hosts, the apartment is top notch, and is located centrally in Lancaster with lots of options to experience the town. A wonderful example of how Airbnb can open up a city and make travel an experience. Would definitely recommend and visit again!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had a wonderful stay and would love to give the Matilda flat 10+ stars if we could. The high ceilings and natural light that came from the windows enabled us to relax and take in the peacefulness of Lancaster. The location was amazing - there was a lot you can walk to and when it was too hot to stroll, it was easy to find parking and take off in your car 5 minutes away to the shopping areas and mainstream restaurants. We were 10 min walking distance to Central Market and would often duck out during lunch hours (since we went here to just have a quick getaway from the city!) and pick up local coffee, fresh bread, and lunch meals to take back to the apartment. Rich + Shannon's recommendations outside of the area were also spot on. We had a great time driving to Lancaster's Central Park + enjoyed Pine View Dairy for fresh goods off the farm. Everything was neat, tidy, and thoughtful and Rich + Shannon were always extremely responsive - we're looking forward to another opportunity to stay here again and can't thank the hosts enough for making this such a warm and welcoming experience."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, full kitchen was a big plus. Perfect size for a couple."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment, beautiful building, food location, great host"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really beautiful and great location— not on the main strip so quiet yet walking distance to shops and restaurants. Comfortable bed, high ceilings, great style."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! The apartment is very spacious and incredibly cute! We also enjoyed how clean it was. We would absolutely stay again!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Apartment is really cute and spacious with great natural lighting. Super easy instructions to check-in and out easily. Location cannot be beat - about a 10 min walk from main central market and just a couple minute walk from other surrounding markets and restaurants. The place was clean and homey, great for a weekend getaway!"
2020-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! The house is incredibly beautiful and the work that they’ve done to restore it is admirable. The Matilda flat is delightful, with very thoughtful touches. The location is also wonderful for exploring Lancaster – I really can’t recommend it highly enough and will definitely be back."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and great stay! It could not have been cozier for my wife and me.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is full of character, while being very clean and functional. This was our second stay there and this time we were in the Matilda apartment - which was new for us. The back dining/living room had windows on three sides and we were worried that it might be cold in February. However, the heater worked perfectly and we were warm throughout - especially when the sun shone in. The kitchen was very new, functional and everything worked. The queen bed was comfortable and the bedroom very quiet. The bedroom had artistic finishes, gloriously high-ceilings and architectural surprises that made it fun. Shower was powerful and there was a luxurious sink in the bathroom. This apartment does have five stairs leading from the bedroom area to the bathroom floor and then the kitchen so one has to be careful. It was a delightful place to stay - a great experience. We hope to be back!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An exceptional home-away-from-home. Rich and Shannon are Airbnb pros, quick to message back and answer any Qs. It's a quick walk/trip downtown or to the F&M campus, lots of great food spots nearby. (Their local suggestions are superb!) Comfortable bed, bathtub, and a overall charming, well thought-out space.
I've stayed in the upstairs Elizabeth Flat too, and you can't go wrong with either. I'd say this space is a little roomier.
Would stay again."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Matilda Flat was a great little nook in Lancaster City, the space was very clean with nice antique touches. Wish I could have spent more time walking around and getting to really know the area."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay. The location was perfect for walking thru Lancaster- we walked everywhere. The flat is a stunning remodel with old beautiful features. It's definitely as described. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. Rich & Shannon were responsive. I'd definitely stay here again.
2019-11-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Nice Victorian flat in a good area of the city. Flat itself was fine, but it could use some upgrades. Heating in the kitchen is a portable heater that should be replaced. The TV is in the bedroom and bathroom, while clean and functional, was just ok. Parking is metered on-street."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was potentially the best air bnb I've stayed in. Everything was considered, I only had to wonder if there was an extra towel or cleaning products to find every single thing was available. Even some tampons in the bathroom! The soap in the shower is Devine, as is the amazingly comfortable bed. I'm stayed here while moving to Lancaster and this location was walkable to the main restaurants and tourist spots even at below zero. The back apartment I was in was so quiet I felt bad ruining the peace with my sneezes! My friend stayed one night and found the pull out to be more comfortable then her own home. I have no feedback other than be nice and water the plants for the owners when you stay! I will visit again but I think I'll try one of the other apartments in the building to see what beautiful arrangements and decor are inside them too!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rich and Shannon's place was perfect for a weekend in Lancaster. We truly enjoyed the thoughtful touches and the beautiful house. It was close to everything and was just perfect. We would highly recommend staying here!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful old house, wonderful location and wonderful host. My wife and I traveled to Lancaster for a wedding and were fortunate enough to make a weekend out of it. The house is close enough to walk to all the downtown Lancaster locations and at the same time we were also very content to just stay in and get food delivered. We would not hesitate to stay here again should we find our way back to Lancaster."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful building with a great location!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect - the apartment was clean and comfortable, and Rich and Shannon's guide for the area was extremely helpful (and led us to the best pancakes we've ever had!). Communication was great and checking in & out was quick and seamless. We would definitely recommend. Thank you."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful apartment and space. Super easy check-in and excellent location. Would stay again!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,It’s an incredible house with outstanding architecture. Our apartment was spacious and had everything we needed for the weekend. It was also very clean and an easy walk to all of downtown. Couldn’t ask for anything more.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely space! The entire house is gorgeous. The Matilda room is no exception. Lovely high ceilings, minimalist and open layout, very comfortable to lounge, make dinner, and relax! We are Lancaster locals, and the place really made us feel like we were out of town and living it up! That being said, the host had an excellent guide to the city for things to do and places to eat. I have to say as a local, they did an excellent job!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying in the apartment, and it was just as lovely and comfortable as we'd remembered! We found parking right in front of the house, and then didn't really need the car for the rest of our visit. The location is great, and there are so many restaurants and things to do within walking distance. We enjoyed our stay and hope to stay again when we're next in town!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Superb location with a great amount of space! The hosts were wonderfully accommodating, and were able to help us out when we found ourselves in a last minute pinch to find housing for an extra night. It’s just a couple blocks away from wonderful food and great coffee shops as well. Will definitely recommend to anyone coming into town looking for a place to stay!"

Check in is very easy. Shannon is kind, professional and very responsive.
The home was sparkling clean and spacious. The shower and bathroom were great too. The bed was “to die for” comfortable, I loved it and slept well.
The little things matter so much, Rich and Shannon’s binder of Lancaster recommendations is pure gold!!! Because of their recs, I took my colleagues to the Belvedere Inn and Luca for dinner, both hits! I also got takeout at Sa La Thai and saw a documentary at the funky Zoetropolis. Their recs filled my whole trip and I didn’t even get to go to the Axe Throwing bar (!!) and the Lord of the Rings coffee and book shop (!). Pro Tip: Read their binder :)
Rich and Shannon have also put loads of fun books all over the apartment, books that are actually fun to pick up and read for a bit. I read many thoughtful interviews with famous women and enjoyed flipping through 1000 places to see before you die ;)
If you need a nice, quiet, comfortable apartment during your stay in Lancaster, you cannot go wrong with the Matilda apartment. You’ll have a peaceful happy stay with tons of fun places all within walking distance.
Thank you Rich and Shannon!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first experience with an AirBnB and we are now sold on this concept! Renew on Walnut exceeded our expectations. Our host thought of everything to make us feel welcome and comfortable. We knew ahead of time about the parking situation (maximum 2 hours on the street), so we planned accordingly and used the nearby lot ($15/day) when necessary. The location is close to great restaurants, the Central market and the welcome center and the area is very walkable in a lovely neighborhood. We will certainly consider an AirBnB the next time we travel!"

I was a little nervous about the parking, but the garage is half a block away and had plenty of space. Plus, everything is within close walking distance, so we didn't even use the car until we left. Every restaurant we went to had fantastic food, great service and very good prices. The shops were beautiful and welcoming.
However, the house was the best part. The decor is beautiful! We had everything we needed and easily relaxed in the luxurious surroundings. It's going to be very difficult to find a nicer home for next year. We should probably just stay at Renew, again! Thank you, so much, Sarah!"

If we make it back to this area we will definitely book with Sarah!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Downtown was easily walkable from the house. There are several great restaurants close by.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an outstanding weekend! Plenty of room for four adults, and such a fun/trendy house! Looks exactly like the pictures, even better if that’s possible. Great restaurants and local shopping nearby. The street is super quiet and the neighbors are incredibly friendly. Cannot recommend enough!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very comfortable and clean, located in a nice neighborhood. Parking was the only hiccup, as the garage located directly behind the unit was not accepting cars so we had to park a few blocks away at a different garage. Even with that, we had a great experience."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super easy the whole way through. Highly recommend
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The host did amazing job and the cleaning crew did great! The decore was gorgeous and the remodeling of this place has a boho vibe. The location was great overall. There is a parking garage in the back not far from the property but parking out front was no issue. As morning hits you may get woken up by dump trucks or traffic. The master bed has a slight dip in it but it was comfortable. Both larger beds were comfy. The showers has great water pressure and plenty of towels. The main thing that I Would suggest for people who are effected by the heat (like MS or other diseases) be sure to bring extra fans. There is one fan at the house. There are air conditioner units. However, we turned them too 64 and it was still rough. The fan and cooler air at night did help. Master bedroom is on the top floor and harder to cool. Just FYI. otherwise, everything was amazing. I would stay here again and suggest cooler air upstairs and maybe at some point...do decor outback. That would be super cute."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sarah’s place is great! We love staying at Renew on Walnut!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful building. spaciousand the original plank floors to the exposed brick shows so much character. close to hospital and a really nice market. definately recommend it.

The space was in the center of town which made it super easy to walk wherever we needed to go.
The home was beautifully decorated and super clean."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Renew is a charming, convenient, clean, and cozy place to stay while visiting Lancaster. We did not even need to drive to shop or go out to dinner, just parked in the nearby garage and walked around town. Would stay again! Guests, be aware that the stairs are steep, and it’s three levels. My friend had an injured knee and it was a little challenge. However, a fabulous master suite awaits you on the top floor."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect jumping off point for exploring Lancaster. It’s so cute and we felt right at home. Lots of great restaurants and shops within walking distance.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great location. There are several restaurants that are walking distance, two of which were across the street. There is a CVS only a block away from which you can quickly pick up any snacks or other things you may need.
Parking is easy. I was always able to find a spot on the same block as the apartment so I never had to park in the lot.
The smart TV's had all of the popular streaming services installed. I just had to log in and I was able to watch all of my shows, just as if I were at home.
There were plenty of lights and light switches in the home, which is important to me.
I had a great and comfortable time and would definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"LOVED Renew on Walnut. Such an adorable home & in a perfect location.

Thanks so much Sarah!"

I wish we could have stayed for longer - but we will definitely be back!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Friendly and responsive host. Place was exactly what we needed
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"One of the best Airbnb’s I have ever stayed at! Very clean and so cute inside and out! Absolutely wonderful location in walking distance to so many great restaurants and shops. We had 6 guests and were all very comfortable with the amount of space. The parking garage was very easy to find and a quick walk away. One thing to note is the stairs are quite steep and a bit slippery to go down, myself and another guest both slipped on them even while holding the railing. It would be helpful if there were some grippers on them. Otherwise everything is absolutely wonderful! Would definitely stay again if visiting the area!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had the best time at Sarah’s place. The third floor bedroom took us by surprise, and we loved it. The house matched the description perfectly. There are so many great local spots by the house, especially Rachel’s Cafe!! Parking is not the easiest to find, but the parking lot right down the block is perfect!! Definitely would book again!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,Place was very well located - was a little unkept at check in otherwise solid

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at the Renew on Walnut was everything as advertised. The host, Sarah was extremely punctual in her responses to my questions and requests. She was kind and went out of her way to make sure my timeline for arrival and departure could be accommodated. Everything was pristine inside the listing. The internet worked fast and was easy to access. The bonus is that Rachel’s Creperie is located right across the street! Good drinks and food all within a short walking distance in such a historic town! Do yourselves a favor and book this listing, if you are debating with yourself about it."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house, convenient location, and very communicative host. We had no issues finding street parking, and there were tons of places to walk to nearby. We would definitely stay here again if we come back to visit Lancaster."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Sarah’s place is awesome! It has everything you need along with extras. Her personable touch with drinks in the refrigerator, snacks on the table, and a handwritten welcome note show that she wants to make sure your stay is comfortable. Sarah’s place was spotless, included everything listed on her site, and was just as welcoming and homey as shown in the pictures. She was quick to respond when we had a question. All of the bedrooms are comfortable, but I especially enjoyed the third floor bedroom with a full bath. It had such a cool vibe. We had a great stay. Thank you Sarah!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great hosts that made the stay extremely easy and comfortable. Beautiful house in a great location. Walkable to everything in downtown Lancaster. Highly recommend.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was perfect for a very relaxing mother-and-daughter getaway. We stayed for three nights and didn't move our car once we arrived. We cooked meals and walked around the great neighborhood to nearby restaurants, shops, and of course the Central Market. The home was sweetly decorated and squeaky clean. Everything was very comfortable, and Sarah made herself easily available for questions. We would definitely return!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Our second time staying at Sarah’s place and once again loved it! Definitely one of our top stays in Lancaster!

Sarah was a great host, too - she communicated clearly and she even provided a few nice extras (snacks, drinks, free coffee at the cafe across the street). Highly recommended!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Sarah’s place is awesome! It’s decorated beautifully and it was a great place to stay. It was very warm when we checked in and turning down the thermostats didn’t really seem to help but other than that is was perfect. Definitely recommend!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Renew on Walnut is a gorgeous home that is close to many great parts of downtown Lancaster. Sarah was wonderful, and I highly recommend staying here - the third floor master bedroom is beautiful!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"You can tell when the hosts are really thoughtful, & this is one of those places. Everything is newly renovated–as nice as a 100+ year old space can be. Street pkg is limited to 2 hrs, but not metered. So u just need to find a spot, which we did within a block or 2 each time. If pkg for > 2 hrs during biz hrs, use the nearby garage or move your car. We just parked on the street. For unloading, we briefly “created” a spot out front, out of the way of traffic, so no one cared. Regarding the stairs, we were a bit concerned by other reviews. But they were “fine”. Would I recommend them to someone with bad knees? No. Were they ok for a couple of days? Yes. Each stair is a little taller, and a little less deep, than a modern stair step, especially to the top floor. We wanted multiple bedrooms and bathrooms, a full kitchen, and a full table, and this place had all those. We had 1 little problem w/ the heat & the host was very responsive, which is all you can ask for. Definitely recommend!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place, parking was not difficult either."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is just what we need for a short stay in Lancaster. Its a beautiful space, clean and and well stocked. Shopping and restaurants are short walking distance. We would love to stay here again."

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great location for a girls weekend. The house was beautifully decorated, and since we were there in December, the Christmas tree was a lovely and festive touch. It had everything we needed, and was in a great location, walkable to lots of restaurants and shops. The street parking signs were a little confusing, but we were able to park on the street just outside of the house since we were only there for the weekend. We had a great weekend!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property is BEAUTIFUL and in the perfect downtown location. Every detail was better than the next and we couldn't have asked for a better 24 hours in Lancaster.

She was the best host we've had in all of our Airbnb experiences."

2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved Renew at Walnut! The house was immaculate, the beds were super comfortable and the place was well stocked. It’s super close to lots of great places as well. Sarah was great with communication, and there were lots of helpful tip lists throughout the house, which was appreciated.
Our only complaints were the road noise at all hours of the night- motorcycles and loud cars revving, and garbage trucks at 5am. If you’re used to living in a city, I imagine it may not be a problem. A sound machine also helped tremendously. We stayed at a place just a street over a few years ago and had no problem with street noise, so perhaps it’s a temporary issue.
We didn’t realize there was no off-street parking, which was a bit inconvenient with three young kids. However, you can occasionally snag a spot out front, or on the side, which is metered. Otherwise the parking garage is super close and it wasn’t a huge issue!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Everything in the write up is true! Lots of decent restaurants in walking distance.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time here with our toddler. Everything you could possibly need was readily available and Sarah was very responsive to questions.

It had everything I needed, was comfortable (great mattresses!), and quiet. The location was perfect, too. I loved being across the street from Rachel’s, one of Lancaster best breakfast places AND a few steps from Our Town brewery. Will def stay here again if the opportunity arises."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our family came into town to see a show at the Fulton. This property was perfect, as it was walking distance to places we wanted to go, including the market. I was worried about the parking, but the garage was super close and super easy. Absolutely plan to return!"

2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice location and comfortable space
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay. We were in town for our daughter’s graduation from F&M. The house is lovely, and the location can’t be beat. We had three people 75+ in age in our group, and we worried about the stairs in this place, particularly since there are no bathrooms on the first floor and all the bedrooms are upstairs. But they did fine with the steep stairs. We helped them, and they took it slow. Overall, this place is wonderful. I’d just be careful with older parents/grandparents that are staying here. But like I said, we managed. We were very happy with our stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home in Lancaster! Walking distance to all the cute shops, cafes, markets and nightlife!
Sarah was accommodating and super flexible and just a lovely host overall! I highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We rented the house for a “moms night out” and we were blown away by every little magical detail in this home. Everything was so beautiful! The location is also PERFECT. So close to everything! We will be back!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was just as described! Perfect location for walking distance into town.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, can walk to a lot of restaurants and is a very nice and safe area. House is very clean and beautiful. Host communicates very well and makes your stay easy.
Only negatives - 1. it's a renovated old row home so the stairs are narrow and steep, bot a big deal but just need to be careful not to trip. 2. No driveway and street parking is permit only, but there is a parking garage very close. For a location in the center of downtown, you can't beat it!"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Sarah is a wonderful host! Communication was great and always prompt. Nice place and location to enjoy some time in the city.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Definitely recommend it!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I found Stephanie's listing while wedding planning since I was getting married at the Barn at Silverstone and I'm so happy I did. There is ample parking for us to have a few cars to load/unload our belongings and prepare for the big say. Stephanie was responsive and proactive before our visit. Not only was she so welcoming and helpful, she keeps a beautiful home and the level of cleanliness is up to my standards. The bed was comfortable, the linens were smooth and clean, the space smelled fresh and fragrant, the AC was on yet well insulated & the amentities were updated. The roomes were dust free and had no odor or mold, which is something I find in airbnbs. It had all of the things I needed to prepare a snack or drink coffee, even providing a whoopie pie for us! The design is also calming and stylish, without being over the top. It felt right at home to refresh myself and have quiet time with my husband amidst the busy weekend. If I want a Lancaster getaway, Stephanie's will be my go!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Cornerstone Cottage was lovely! Stephanie gets a 5-star rating from me! The cottage is fully stocked with everything needed to make it feel like a home away from home. It is immaculate, organized, and tastefully decorated—the welcome tray, linens, instructions, toiletries, etc., reflect all of the thought and care that Stephanie puts into the Cottage for her guests. I would recommend staying at the Cornerstone Cottage for your Lancaster get-away. I know that I'll be back in the future!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cornerstone cottage was the best stay! It was very close to the areas we were visiting and was absolutely perfect for our trip. The place was beautiful, smelled great when you walked in, and had such cute decorations that tied it all together. There was a lovely back patio that was perfect for watching the horses and listening to birds chirp all day long. The host left a smores kit and popcorn as well which tied the whole trip together. Cant wait to stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful little cottage, it was a great stay and we are already planning to come back next year for another stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely adorned Cornerstone Cottage! It’s so very cozy & it had everything we needed plus added extras. We loved the decor. My favorite area was the coffee nook, just perfect & Irv loved the fireplace. It was so peaceful sitting outside in the evening on the back patio, we didn’t want to leave! We will definitely stay here again in future trips to Lancaster, the proximity to every place we were going was great.
Suzi & Irv"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,my wife and our 1.5 year old son had a wonderful few days here. I would recommend this stay for anyone looking for a homely place to enjoy a few days to relax and take in the small towns nearby.

Everything about Cornerstone Cottage from the charming decor to nicely sized bathroom to comfortable king bed was so ideal for a couple's getaway! Everything is exactly as pictured, but better. Stephanie had whoopie pies waiting and some drinks in the fridge as well as other snacks and well stocked coffee supplies. The thoughtfulness in having everything ready for her guests is incredible, including detailed kitchen instructions and luggage racks. The location is fantastic. The backyard setup is cute, too. Although we were familiar with the Bird-in-Hand and Strasburg areas, it was great to be able to ask for recommendations for Lancaster City. Chatting with Stephanie when we checked out was delightful and my husband and I definitely look forward to another stay!"

We fell in love with it the minute we walked in the front door…it looks like it’s straight out of a magazine! Not only is it styled beautifully, it is so well appointed with absolutely everything you could possibly want during your stay. Was so good to be able to cook meals and do some laundry while we were there as well.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first visit to Lancaster and I came to visit my mom who was down from Canada on a church trip. I prefer an Airbnb over a hotel and places like this beautiful spot are why. This location is perfect to get to many local attractions. Bird in Hand is literally just down the road and you are also close to many restaurants. The home is perfection. I told my mom is was like a Chip and Joanna type home with all the lovely details, they even left a whoopie pie to snack on. Everything was clean and super comfy. I felt very at home and relaxed. As a busy nurse practitioner I needed this atmosphere. I could even often hear the clip clop of horse and buggies go by and see them from the bedroom window. The owners are super receptive and answer questions quickly, always wonderful!! Another 5/5 location found and when I return I will stay again."

It is super clean with modern architecture and decor. It is organized and spacious, and contains many charming details to make it feel like home. It is perfectly located in the center of Amish country, and is close to many restaurants and attractions. Although it is on a somewhat busy street it is still very quiet. It is in a nice residential neighborhood, and I was able to safely exercise outside. The private back porch was an especially nice place to enjoy my cup of coffee in the morning. The porch included a view of an Amish home and farm. Check in was very easy, and Stephanie was an attentive host who responded quickly to my inquiries. It is a gem, and I would definitely stay there again."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at David's Airbnb made our trip extra special and memorable. We were the first to stay in his newly renovated house. The moment we stepped in, my friends and I gasped at how BEAUTIFUL, clean and welcoming the house was. We couldn't stop admiring every room in the house and it's tastefully decorated details. Apart from the exquisite and cosy house, David was a great host and so was Jim! Jim came over to help right away when I had a request. He made us feel extra special when he came over one morning with a box of strawberries. I've stayed in many Airbnbs in the past but this was the best experience yet. Thank you, David and Jim!"
