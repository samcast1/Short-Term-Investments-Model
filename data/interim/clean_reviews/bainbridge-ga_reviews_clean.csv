2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"This house was perfect! We rented it so we would have a place to stay and private parking for our boat while visiting for a fishing tournament! We honestly felt like we were at home! Big yard, shelter for boat, private location outside of the city… but minutes from the boat ramp. Definitely recommend!"

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Although we had a little hiccup in the beginning everything turned out great. Lee Ann’s place was perfect for our group of six. The beds were especially comfortable and the home was not far from downtown. Most importantly, the photos were an exact representation of her home and when talking to Lee Ann she was extremely friendly and helpful.
Even with the hiccup, I would stay there again and recommend this spot to my friends and family.
Levette"

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Lee Ann’s house is decorated tastefully and has everything to make you feel right at home. The beds are SUPER comfy and the work space was a perfect area that could be closed off from the rest of the house so you’re not disturbed. We were in town for a fishing tournament on Lake Seminole and this house is only about 10 min from the boat ramp and the same to downtown.
Lee Ann also left very thoughtful gifts at check in…a goodie bag with some necessities and sweets, makeup remover in the bathrooms, etc.

The beds were very comfortable and the house was spacious enough room for us and we even got to cook breakfast. It was just like being at home. Everything that we needed was there and we love the swing. On Saturday we sat out all day Enjoy the weather and took lots of pictures.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is so well maintained and immaculately clean. The owner is very responsive to any needs (we did not have any).

2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,We arrived at night and had difficulty finding the house. Entry is from the rear which was not lighted. The keycode lock was difficult to operate but Michele was very responsive with assistance. The house was convenient to town and restaurants and shopping but there are no sidewalks so not walkable. The location was two houses from a major intersection and on a main road and we were able to hear a lot of road noise. The house was immaculate and minimally furnished. One of the bedrooms did not have a nightstand or lamp and in another the bed was against the wall and difficult to access for two people. The mattresses were on the soft side for our particular liking. We did run out of toilet paper and garbage bags and could not find any extra in the house but did not bother Michele with this. There are two tvs but we could not access regular tv channels. There are brick steps and walkway to enter the house and these are uneven and slippery in the rain.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Celebrating a graduation from FSU and this was a wonderful place to stay for the price! Quiet surroundings and easy to get to Tally. My parents found it easy to access the house and bathrooms. Had everything we needed.. and more!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was really pretty; loved the sun porch. We visited Bainbridge for a cousin's wedding; the house was spacious and nicely decorated...looks just like the photos. The downtown square was adorable, and we enjoyed shopping in the quaint shops and eating in the local restaurants. Michele was very responsive and friendly. I would happily stay at her place again."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful house with close proximity to the downtown area which has some cute shops and a really good restaurant. It was a great place for us to stay for our niece’s wedding at Southwind Plantation.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,THE PLACE WAS VERY CLEAN AND NICE EVERYTHING WORKED🥰🥰
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very inviting home that seems newly renovated. nice landscape. could use a coffee table but perfect other than that.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,We spent 10 days in this super cute house and felt right at home. Convenient location made it easy to visit with family and friends and we enjoyed starting our mornings in the sunroom. Michele was thoughtful and easy to communicate with- we'd definitely stay here again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"2nd time staying here, great house!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Michelle was a great host as usual. This was my second stay at her home. My first day was during Christmas to spend time with my sister that passed away after Christmas and Michelle allowed us to stay at her beautiful home again I wanna thank you so much for the hospitality and the opportunity to stay in your home.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The home was perfect for our family of five. We were only there for one night, but my girls enjoyed the layout of the home. The master bedroom has minimal furniture, but that was fine. The home fit our needs for our short visit to Bainbridge. My family also enjoyed relaxing at the main square in Bainbridge. Thanks for letting us stay at your place!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house with everything we needed. Super clean, great kitchen. Perfect for our work trip, we’ve already booked again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Michele’s House was the perfect little getaway spot, that was cozy and had us feeling right at home. We really appreciated the holiday decorations to make it feel more festive. We will definitely be staying here again in the months to come."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Michelle was a great host and I enjoyed the comfort of her home. We recommend her home whenever you visit Bainbridge.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful stay in Bainbridge, GA. It was updated beautifully and decorated perfectly for the Christmas holiday. The property was easy to find and close to a major retail shopping area with great food options as well. The host was very understanding and helpful with my reservation flub and it made all the difference for my family. We will always look for this property to book again when we visit family in Bainbridge."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Home was impeccably clean. Very roomy and well maintained. Beautifully accented and private. Instantly feels like you’re at home. We’ll being staying here every trip to Tallahassee. Can’t wait to come back, many thanks!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I have NEVER stayed anywhere away from home that was so immaculately clean and fresh! We loved the house! A gorgeously renovated home with the charm of original woods floors and I think the cabinets were probably original too. The modern touches to update were spot on. Everything was super comfortable and everyone had their own space (family of 5).
A great pizza restaurant was less than a mile away and lots of other places to eat, shop as well. We will definitely be looking to stay here next time we’re down south for an FSU game!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We visited Bainbridge for a memorial service, a somber occasion that made the warm energy of Bainbridge Beauty all the more precious to us. From the moment we arrived, the property offered a sanctuary of peace and comfort.
Location is everything, and here, you’re perfectly situated in a tranquil area yet accessible to local spots. Cleanliness was impeccable, setting a welcoming atmosphere from the get-go. Check-in was effortless, guided by comprehensive instructions provided in advance.
The comfortable king-sized bed was a haven for restful sleep, and the fully stocked kitchen met nearly all our culinary needs, missing only wine glasses. But the true gem was the sunroom—its stunning views and abundant natural light served as a soothing backdrop for reflection during our stay.
Overlooking this spot would be a missed opportunity of the highest order; your soul will haunt you for bypassing such an experience."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was Beautiful. Truly a hidden gem in a quiet town. We will definitely be staying here again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home. Everything was amazing and if I’m ever back visit Bainbridge Ga again I would definitely book your house. So beautiful
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family and I enjoyed Michelle’s place. It looked exactly like the photos. It was the only Airbnb in town that stood out with modern features and elegance. Well worth the stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at the Bainbridge beauty. The home was exactly as advertised, very clean and spacious. There was even a coffee bar area to enjoy. We will be back next time we are in the area to visit family."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My stay was PERFECT!!! Everything advertised exceeded expectations. Very clean!!! Master bedroom and bathroom was my favorite part of the house. Kitchen well stocked. Peaceful surroundings!!! Communication was top tier. I definitely recommend you guys book this house!!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I cannot express the anticipation and the happiness that followed. My mother could not stop raving about this JEWEL that we found.
We have officially deemed this our vacay spot. Michelle and her associate were awesome. She extended hour check out time, possessed understanding towards my OCD. She would not allow me to clean up…she insisted on us enjoying our time.
We will be staying as often as we can. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!!!!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! The host is very kind and would definitely stay again
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful, clean and comfortable experience. This place feels like an oasis in the middle of town. Will definitely stay again"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home is so large and spacious. Absolutely perfect for family traveling. The bathrooms were remodeled and felt like a spa. My mom enjoyed the sunroom for her reading as well as cooking in the massive kitchen with a stunning island for food prep. What a surprise to be so close to town and other amenities in Bainbridge. We will be back!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This space was exactly as described and perfect for our family. Michele was the most gracious and accommodating host we’ve ever encountered and we highly recommend this space if ever in the area.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time, place was awesome. Hope to revisit :)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Came into town for a fishing trip! Driveway had a full turn around / pull through for boat parking.
TONS of room and many bedrooms / bathrooms though we only came with 3 people. Right on the water, great place!
Exactly what you think of when you think “lake house”. Neat family history here."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thanks for a great stay. The home and area are extremely peaceful.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved staying at Williams place. Cant wait to visit again. Plenty of parking for our truck and boat. Awesome boat dock and back deck on the house. This is one of our favorite stays ever and look forward to a return visit.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was nice and worked well for us. The deck and lake are great!

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The check in was nice and easy
The house matched the description"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very comfortable place.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had to attend a funeral and it was just what we needed with our large family and a peaceful surroundings
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and dock for the boat.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome place to take a family vacation with lots of room!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Cove was just what my family needed. We had plenty of space for parking, sleeping, and relaxing on a long weekend. We enjoyed time together on the large dock, several meals cooked in the kitchen, and quality time sitting around talking or watching a family movie. The location was just as described, and William was always quick to respond to any messages sent."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for our first time in Bainbridge. Clean, quiet and spacious."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is full of family history and it’s probably as close to its original state as it can be; well taken care of. The screened in porch was a family favorite! Neighbors are also nice and full of knowledge about the area. The house has plenty of room for families.
The only downfall for us wasn’t about the house but fishing from the dock was not successful at all in our 6night stay; which was the main reason for booking a lakefront property. Locals say a boat is needed for good fishing. I think we missed the spawning as this is the area gosh come to spawn March-April (we found out later).
We did enjoy early mornings watching the wildlife; geese, ducks, gators, herons, squirrels, and cardinals. This is such a peaceful area and we will be back…with a boat!
There is a marina right around the corner if you do bring a boat!
We only ate out once during our stay&can 100% recommend Bonnie Blue House in Bainbridge!
Meat House for your meats, their smoked pork chops are delicious!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay very much. This is the third time we've stayed at the Cove.
Feel right at home there."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay as a bass fisherman. The home is cozy and exactly as it is listed. We absolutely loved the large dock space, twin porch swings (screened in to keep those bugs out) and the cleanliness inside and out. A couple things we found to be a little unfortunate were the lack of cupboard space due to how much unnecessary kitchenware etc is stored. Not really an issue for a short term stay but it was a struggle for us when staying about a month to find places to store our food other than on the counter. The only other issue was the size of the covered bays on the dock. There are two covered bays to park a boat both with working lifts which is great however they are too small to fit mostly any bass boat. We have a 2019 triton 20’ and it only got about 1/3 of the way under before being stuck in between the sides of the dock. This is not a deal breaker by any means as you can still park alongside the dock perfectly fine just uncovered. Overall very nice place and will return."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Rolled into town for the Bassmaster elite series. Williams place is by far the best place to stay on lake Seminole with lake front view and ample space to view park a handful of trucks and boats with ease.
Whenever we roll back into town we will for sure be booking again"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit to the Cove, and we plan to return. It's a comfortable, large lake house."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed at The Cove twice now, and will definitely use it again. We typically have 3 families. Plenty of room for everyone. Ample parking. Peaceful neighborhood. Always clean. Lovely lake themed decor. A great place to stay!."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Was a great place to stay had everything we needed first air bnb I've stayed at that didn't have shampoo and conditioner other then that it was awesome
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to be with friends and family, great house. Has everything you need to be confortable. Fully recommend this place."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family stayed here for a Christmas get together and everything was absolutely amazing! The house is well taken care of and absolutely stunning and time out on the lake was like a dream come true!
We also appreciated that William checked up on us multiple times to make sure everything was alright!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"William was a wonderful host.
The home was just perfect for our family.
Many wonderful memories to last a lifetime.
Thank you William and family for sharing your wonderful getaway!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at The Cove.
William was a great host &
always available for any
questions. You can really feel
the love and warmth that was
put into this home. It had
everything you could possibly
need for your stay. The dock
was great for fishing and
docking your boat. At Ease
Campground & Marina is a 5 min
drive to launch your boat.
Fishing was good considering
we had a tropical storm during
our stay. This is a big home, so it
would be great for family get
togethers. We would definitely

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place with boat dock access. Nothing beats listening to the noises of nature and waking up to fish! Would 10 out of 10 recommend this place.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I took my mom and little sister to the lake for Mothers day weekend and stayed in Williams house on the cove. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to stay. The home was big enough and had enough room where each one had our own space and bathroom, it was quiet and private, had a beautiful dock for fishing, was right around the corner from a boat ramp to launch the boat and was stocked with everything we could have needed from plenty of linens to any thing you might need to cook in the kitchen... We enjoyed the swings on the screened in back porch and the rocking chairs on the dock with a beautiful view of the peaceful little cove.... We visited the antique shops and a couple of parks in Bainbridge, cooked dinner on the charcoal grill that was provided, and fished from the dock when he wasn't out on the lake in the boat. It was a very peaceful and relaxing time at the lake and my mom loved it, and communication with William was great. He is even mailing my husbands fishing hat to us that he forgot.. I can't say enough about how perfect this place was for our needs for a weekend get away and how much we appreciate William allowing us the use of his beautiful home... We hope to return again one day...."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A buddy and I stayed here for a week of fishing! We had a great time and the house was very nice. A bit big for the two of us but location was perfect. We caught some good fish too! Would recommend!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was perfect for my family! We were able to use the dock for our boat. It was nice and convenient to have power to plug in the batteries over night in the boat slip. We hope to return soon for another adventure!

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Cove is the perfect Lake House. If you are looking for a laid-back relaxing getaway for a large group this is the house for you. The porch and deck are perfect for drinking coffee and watching the breathtaking sunsets. Our kids enjoyed fishing off the dock and playing in the large yard. Also there is a nice lakeside firepit. We can't wait to return.
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Everything was just perfect for our family!! Coming to Bainbridge for a wedding from Fort Walton Bch, Bradenton, Palatka, FL & Dothan, AL there was room for all 10, with each having their own private space.
And three bathrooms helped, LOL. Firepit on Friday night just when the cold front came in was so much fun! Fully equipped kitchen (might take out a few of the colanders & put in another larger cast iron skillet :) If we needed anything all we had to do was look around and we found it.
Was reassuring when William called me the night before to see if we needed anything. Highly recommend!!!! Would be excellent choice for a fishing weekend or week!! We caught a couple off the dock, but this one was all about the wedding."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,William is very kind and accommodating and his home is breath-taking. Perfect place to just get away and relax!

We definitely plan staying there again if available during our next vacation!
Thank you very much William!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at the Cove. It was very comfortable and peaceful. The house is well stocked and had more than enough room for our party of six. William is a great host and responded to all questions in under 2 minutes. The yard was cut the day of arrival and the house was spotless. Plenty of room to park vehicles and trailers. We really enjoyed fishing off your dock and watching the alligators and turtles. Lots of chairs available to relax. We caught bass, bluegill, crappie, channel catfish, gar and a shad right off the large dock. Having the opportunity to use two boat lifts is above and beyond. Access to the big water is only a couple minutes away by boat. Mac's Point boat launch and restaurant is right around the corner. Great food! Lots of weed in September, but the fishing is good. I saw a couple of huge bass, but they weren't interested in my offering. To many bluegill around for them to snack on. Highly recommend staying at the Cove if your looking to relax in a peaceful neighborhood and enjoying Lake Seminole."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Place was great, well stocked, clean, good communication with William. Thanks again"

Do your self a favor and take your family here for some peace and quiet. Davey and family."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was perfect for a relaxing weekend getaway. It was clean and cozy. Had a table with hand sanitizer as soon as you walked in. Being lake front with a private dock made it even better. Communication from host was timely. Would definitely stay here again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Cove, south of Bainbridge. The home is in a peaceful spot on the lake, and provided a comfortable experience for our large family (7 adults and 3 children). We were all very pleased with the accommodations."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,The Cove was a perfect get away. The house is right on the water. There house had everything we needed to enjoy our vacation.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Cove was everything we had hoped for.

We hope to come back soon (and hopefully our fishing skills will have improved then)."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I rented this location and speechless when we arrived. The location is great and quite. The view is amazing of the pond waking up every morning to it was amazing. Being able to fish out on the dock was incredible. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a place to rent with family with a great view. Better than what I expected we can’t wait to rent again for when they come down again to visit. They responded right away and kept in touch to make sure I didn’t have any questions AMAZING! Thank you so much great Mother’s Day weekend!
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"Such a lovely place! Really relaxing being able to make a cup of coffee and sit on the back porch swings or even the rocking chairs out on the dock. There is plenty of space in this house, not that we were inside all that much! Very cozy lake house which was great for our small group of friends."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Doug's place! It was very comfortable! Doug provided easy directions and a very secure feeling environment which was important for us since we had 2 bass boats loaded with gear. We closed the gate on the fence every night and were able to leave our rods on the deck of the boats. Plenty of room to park 2 boats under the carport. If you're coming to fish the lake, this is a great choice. We would like to stay at Doug's place again in the future."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay, 6 full size beds. Large living & dining area."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay on the lake! I highly recommend this home.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,A lot of the rental places I went to they bring all their old stuff to the rental place for you to have to use this place is first class.

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Great house with everything we needed!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Doug's place was as described, and more! Even with neighbors, it's peacefully quiet. It isn't a huge house, but so spacious. Our group of 12 didn't feel crowded at all, & enjoyed watching a family movie in the evening or playing various games Doug has available. We were in the area to visit family, but they wound up not being available last minute. So we enjoyed fishing from the dock & feeding the ducks, playing all kinds of games on hand in the house, and taking drives to visit local state parks & scenic drives. I can't say enough about our stay. As far as vacations rentals go, Doug has more incidentals from the get go that usually aren't there. We only had to make one store run.
Doug was very communicative with any issues, concerns, or questions. He was preemptive with clear & detailed check-in instructions.
The house itself is very neat, clean, spacious, & comfortable. All of the beds were comfortable, and despite being there for a chilly dip in the weather, we were warm & comfy."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house. Well stocked and clean. Best rental house we’ve seen at Lake Seminole
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent Thanksgiving at Fisherman's Lodge with our adult kids and grandchildren.

I especially loved the decor and welcoming kitchen/family room space where we all gathered. Great value, highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,I recommend this place to anybody coming through from business to family gatherings. Had great communication with host on anything I needed.

Doug was a great host"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you're looking for a quiet and peaceful getaway, stay here. The street is quiet. The lake in the back is stunning. The mornings on the back patio with the sunrise and birds chirping, chef's kiss 🤌.
Doug was a great host. Responsive and friendly. This house was perfect for our family of 10. Lots of space for everyone. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best place to stay of the options available hands down. Would stay here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Doug is a great host - this is my second stay at the Fishermans Lodge and definitely will not be my last. We are already looking at dates to book again for our next fishing trip
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great space - pictures do not do it justice. We will be booking here again with our families.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay!! We loved every minute we were here from the fishing to the scenery! Cold a/c, gas stove, plenty of amenities, and tons of towels! Will stay again if we are in the neighborhood, just an incredible airbnb, best one yet!😊"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Exceptional place. We had to reach out to Doug during our stay and he was very responsive and helpful. We really love this house on the lake, the views and the house in general. Great place to stay with great hosts!!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house for our family’s time in Bainbridge. We walked downtown several times—the brewery, coffee shop, ice cream shop, and Chason Park are all so convenient. House has a well-stocked kitchen and spacious bathrooms. Will consider staying here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Natalie was a great host! So quick to respond whenever I had concerns and even helped me with questions unrelated to the airbnb (questions about the city or how to take care of logistics). I was here for 5 weeks and I felt very taken care of.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really enjoyed my stay. Location was perfect everything was just like it was described on the listing. I had a fishing tournament and was only 6 minutes from landing. I would highly recommend this place to anyone
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Location was perfect being close to downtown, as well as less than a 5 min drive to Walmart and other places to eat. Very unique place to stay. Decorated well and had an old charm to it. Bathrooms were clean and great. I’d recommend sleeping downstairs for a bit softer sleep and upstairs for a more firm sleep. Kitchen had mostly what you would need to cook basic meals. While the living room furniture matches the style of the cottage, it isn’t very comfortable to sit on for longer periods. Especially, if you were planning to spend a length of time to watch a movie. The Host was very helpful and seems to care very much about making your stay a good one. Cleaning fee seems a bit steep at $150 given the amount of prep cleaning you are requested to do before checking out. Would recommend as a place to stay in Bainbridge for a private getaway."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a great stay. Loved the downtown area!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was very clean with great attention to detail. It was a very nice stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"From the moment we arrived at the cottage we were impressed! Everything was immaculate from the kitchen to the bedrooms to the bath, both upstairs and downstairs.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Natalie's place with VERY CLEAN and the beds were comfy. There were plenty of towels and it was in very good condition with the old house charm.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying in the Cobblers Cottage. Such a beautiful street and an easy walk to downtown. Natalie was so responsive and lovely.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our favorite place to stay while in Bainbridge.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Natalie was amazing from start to finish. Her place is absolutely perfect and located in the quaintest town. My pup and I walked into downtown several times a day. The shops are perfect, the food was great and the people are even better. We will definitely stay again"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home. I travel for work and stay in Airbnb’s often in the Bainbrdge area. Nicest and most comfortable home I’ve stayed in yet in the area. Thank you.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cobbler’s cottage was idyllic, pristine and relaxing almost in walking distance to the quaint town of Bainbridge. The town Square offered places to eat and shops to visit in a lovely park area in the center. Our host, Natalie, was professional, efficient in communication with quick response time and helpful. Beautiful place to visit."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! Easy walk to downtown restaurants. House was spotless and there were nice touches everywhere. Beds were very comfortable and bathrooms had everything you could need. We will definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was so cute, exactly like the photos. The back door that you enter through is original and tough to turn/open at times. The downtown area is so cute as well. The host was responsive, gave us recommendations and thought of just about everything."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,House was very nice and comfortable
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the “down home country feel” and being located a few blocks from the Town Square.
More specifically, we enjoyed the spacious bathrooms, comfortable beds, and abundance of great lighting throughout the home.
The 60yr. old magazines were a nice touch and fun to look through.
The home has an “old time feel” but with all the modern conveniences. Wonderful experience."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved this place! We looked it so much we booked it again before we even checked out. The place was so clean and a great location. Walkable to downtown with great food and shopping.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Natalie is a great host. She was very responsive and helpful. Her place is beautiful. You can tell they put a lot of money into fixing it up and making it what it is today. It’s comfortable and the town is very cute.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! I booked it last minute for my son and I. We were finally able to get a good night sleep!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my absolute favorite Airbnb stay. Natalie responded quickly when I needed to adjust my stay for my toy poodle “Bear”. The place was impeccably clean. Plenty of towels, really nice walk in showers. All of the appliances appeared brand new: Refrigerator, Range, washer and dryer, microwave. The lighting is perfect for each room and really accentuates the ambience whether it’s a bedroom, bathroom, den or dining room. The finished interior walls add to the charm. There is an amazing porch area in the back that is air conditioned. Great for coffee in the mornings. The front porch was well lit and the front porch swing was calling my name.
This was an excellent choice and I will definitely stay again.
Thanks Natalie"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Natalie was a gracious host and very accommodating since we were last minute making reservations. I will definitely recommend this destination to my family and friends. Worth every penny.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is weird and wonderful--many of the original features of the synagogue were left in place. It's within walking distance of Bainbridge's best restaurants, shops, and watering holes."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love staying in downtown Bainbridge when we’re visiting family. This is a great space and location.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great location & surroundings. Hospitable host!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tremendous historical building beautifully remodeled. Convenient to downtown and restaurants. Only issue was a lack of hot water on the second night. Thanks for saving a remarkable building.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall a nice spot, great location! Accommodating to families which was appreciated!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unique, pretty place! So glad to see this historic building preserved and enjoyed as a rental."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at the temple for the Thanksgiving holiday. We were thrilled with our stay in such a beautiful historic location. Mark was a responsive host to any issues that arose. The kitchen was perfect for preparing holiday meals. Definitely one of my favorite Airbnb stays to date!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We went for our 40th Wedding Anniversary. Host very thoughtfully left us a beautiful flower arrangement.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place REALLY is a former Jewish Synagogue. Everything about it is cool. The space that was once a large rectangular worship space with beautiful stamped tin ceilings is now a 2 bedroom AirB&B. The new owners closed in 2 corners, creating a bedroom and bath in each corner. a kitchen with a beautiful timber countertop takes up one side and a living area takes up the other side - - with a huge open area in the middle that our 7 month old cruised around in his walker. The raised pulpit area now has a dining table with pipe organ pipes serving as a backdrop. The Torah cabinet is still there (empty now). Such a grand idea! Hats off to the city of Brunswick for relaxing CRAZY modern building codes and allowing this 3 dimensional work of art 👍"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was such a unique stay with very comfortable bed and wonderful kitchen.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The perfect mix of small town, urban loft, and charming history. The space is truly a sight to behold. We felt privileged to be staying in this amazing property. The windows are stunning, and use of space is quiet clever. There is a kcup coffee maker and the kitchen is very well equipped. Wish I could have moved in!
Parking is onstreet unfortunately. Also some of the construction isn’t quite done. Didn’t bother us since we are DIYers but something to be aware of.
There is an amazing restaurant and brewery within walking distance. Plan to spend some time in the park in time square. So perfect you feel like you have walked into a movie. And the gazebo even has some outdoor games you can play.
Definitely will be back!"
2023-09-01,4,Group trip,"If you like historic stays, this is a great place! We were the second people to book it. Therefore there were still some things they were working on and looking to finish up, but it was still a great stay. The first three bookings got discounts. So, our rate was a little cheaper than what it is now. Mark was very responsive when we had questions or suggestions."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mark was a wonderful host. He was very understanding and accommodating, as we needed a place to stay due to last minute mandatory evacuation from our home in Florida. He personally welcomed our family to one of the most unique Airbnbs we’ve stayed at.
The newly renovated home was breath taking from the moment we walked in. It was spacious and beautifully decorated, with lots of attention to detail, including many original items from the former synagogue. The original organ pipes and stunning chandelier were the centerpieces of this space. This is one of those places that have to be experienced to really appreciate its beauty.
Each room had very comfortable beds, clean, soft bedding, and cozy sitting areas.
Kitchen and bathrooms were also spotless.
It is located within a 5 min walk to downtown area to shops, cafes and restaurants. Mark was very kind and treated us to delicious donuts from The Donut Shop. We feel honored to have been his first guests, and highly recommend a stay here"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ideal location. Easy walking distance to all downtown shops and restaurants!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My Husband Phillip and I could not have been blessed with a better location! We highly recommend this location if you want clean, peaceful and a home warming experience! The location was more than convenient for our visit! Melinda’s hospitality is God sent!

Dining table was huge but we sure needed a couch for family seating. The electric fireplace was a nice touch. The twin mattresses were super comfy and the AC worked very well. Being close to Tallahassee fit our need to get to the game etc. There were some minor details that would’ve made it more comfy and easier to feed/host a family but it had most of the basics.

2023-10-01,3,Group trip,"Sitting out on the huge porch was the highlight of our stay. The beds were comfortable as well. Plenty of space and clean. Some very minor issues like only two hand towels and one sink that drained slowly, but overall we were happy and comfortable. The reason we can only give three stars is that when we arrived around 10pm, the water to the house was off. America was very quick to respond, provide as much assistance as she could, and make sure the water got turned on the next morning. Once we got past the first water-less night, we had a good experience staying at Service."

I reached out to America and she apologized and reached out to the appropriate peoole. If you want a great hostess, cleanliness. convience, affordable and peaceful ; you definitely dont want to miss out on tgis gem."

2022-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Nice house, close to eating/Walmart. Listing was a little inaccurate/misleading on fenced yard.

America was very quick to respond to everything, from our request to book her home to questions on changing a setting on the security system. The house was very cozy. We really enjoyed the covered back porch with the rocking chairs, swing and decorative patio lights. We even had a little fun on the trampoline (I am 53 but felt like a kid again jumping on the trampoline). The kitchen was large with lots of counter space. Plenty of driveway space (loved the half-circle driveway). The beds were very comfortable; it was nice after a long day working to come home and relax in bed while watching the large-screen televisions that were in two of the bedrooms (plus one in the living room).

A few things to note, but had nothing to do with the host: the house next door is undergoing renovations, so there’s construction noise.

I was expecting this adorable and immaculate shotgun to have a small bathroom; but boy was I wrong-- it's a glorious, light-filled, spa-like room with beautiful blue and white tile and a claw-foot tub like grandma's. The house is a quick, easy walk to the many charms of historic Bainbridge, a great spot for those heading south to the Panhandle and beyond. Natalie is a wonderful host who LOVES to promote her town. Need anything? Just ask! A+++"

If you need some relaxation, stress relief, and enjoy the little things in life — this is a must visit. Having a morning cup of coffee on the swinging porch bench and getting waves from friendly neighbors…. to enjoying a chilly night under string lights on the porch. Our stay was top notch. It has it all and we highly recommend it! Thank you Natalie!! We will surely be back"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a charming little gem of a rental! The restored home is unique and perfectly blends the vintage and the new with the decor and overall feel of the place.

The location is great, just a few short blocks to the main square of the historic downtown area, and the walk down Broughton is lined with historic homes in the process of being restored. So much history. Truly beautiful, old homes. We loved Southern Philosophy Brewing and The Bean, and strolling around the downtown area was just as charming as the Little House. Book this place, you won't regret it!"

Bainbridge is an old southern town with a real town square that is being revitalized and this little country shotgun style house is a few minutes walk from the town square. Natalie is a dream hostess —who lives close by—- and she has thought of everything for the safety and comfort of her guests. Directions to get in and get out are clear and easy to understand. The house itself is perfect with an antique bed covered in crisp white cotton sheets, fluffy pillows and antique furniture. The bathroom has an adorable claw foot tub (painted pale haint blue on the outside and trimmed out with special claw feet) and finished off with lovely soft towels. The doors are all sunflower yellow. Everything is sparkling clean!!! The front porch is outfitted with an old fashioned porch swing and on the side yard there is a little patio complemented by Edison string lights hanging from a magnolia tree dripping with Spanish moss. It was the most perfect place to stay, eat, and shop. If you have a chance, walk to The American or the Bean Cafe to eat and do a little shopping at Flint River Outfitters or antique shops on the square."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute little house! I loved staying here & will definitely be back! Make sure you check out downtown Bainbridge too!

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful little house and a beautiful town. I wish we could have been there on a busy Friday/Saturday! It was a great layoff for the beach. Thank you for making our first Airbnb rental a great one.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful! We had a fantastic stay. The host was so accommodating, since we booked last minute.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Little House on Broughton is perfect for anyone wanting to spend a few days in Bainbridge. It is charming, and its location is ideal.

I highly recommend this property and host."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place, close to square. If someone is sleeping on pull-out, they will need to walk through bedroom to access bathroom."

Just a note for future vacationers that the location does not have a microwave if you intend to bring meals to heat up, just prepare ahead. There is a very neat two eyed table-top stove with crockpot and air-fryer type oven though, along with many other cooking needs!
Thank you again!"

Thanks for a great stay!!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"I can’t say I’ve ever had a host that cared as much as Debra. Not that the rest didn’t care, but she went the extra mile.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed staying in this AirBnB in Bainbridge. The house was in a nice neighborhood which was walking distance from the town square and restaurants. It was spotlessly clean and comfortable. Communication with the owner was outstanding. We initially had challenges with the WiFi but Banks was very responsive in fixing that problem so the issue was quickly resolved. You won’t be disappointed if you stay here.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The host wws very friendly.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed about a week,beautiful place to stay. my only issue was that the showers didn't have any water pressure. the inside of the house was immaculate and we had plenty of room for the boat and our trucks. if the showers were better I would give her 10 stars on such a beautiful place

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful stay! Plenty to do and loved the home.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place. Pretty clean and some of the decorations weren’t things you’d usually see in a place like Bainbridge, but that’s what made it cool for us. Will probably make it our main Airbnb for the few times a year we visit."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stay at Airbnb’s often, and I felt very comfortable here. It was conveniently located to everything in Bainbridge."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very accommodating as we had to extend our stay

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great, and we would stay at one of Debra's places again. Debra was very responsive, kind, and willing to help us in any way that we needed. The place we rented was centrally located and very close to the boat ramp where my son had a fishing tournament that weekend."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Last minute find for Christmas Eve. I definitely didn’t want to stay in a hotel with my 90 year old father- in - law. It was perfect for our group of 6 especially with the additional upstairs apartment that is so cute. Didn’t have a chance to check Bainbridge but did get to see the Christmas lights down by the river. It was a great stay! Thank you Debra
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy place, great for a weekend stay to check out the town in Bainbridge or to be close to Tallahassee!"
2022-11-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Good people, good stay!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Firstly, we would stay here again, which I think speaks volumes about the worth of a house/home. Debra is an amazingly thoughtful and thorough host, who anticipated our needs and even asked for our opinion about how to improve the property. And the house was IMMACULATELY clean. She truly went above and beyond!
We didn’t spend much time in the house, since we only came for ~24 hours, but it had all of the standard tech amenities like TV and WiFi. Beds were very comfortable to sleep in, and living room furniture was also nice for sitting!
I would like to point out that there isn’t a stove, which isn’t likely to be a deal-breaker for anyone, but it made boiling water for our baby’s formula difficult, since we had to do it in the microwave a little at a time.
Secondly, there are some windows and doors which are not covered by curtains or shades (and there are some blinds that don’t quite block out light nor the ability of outsiders to look in), all of which was a little disconcerting given that there is some foot traffic on a sidewalk in front of the house. I feel certain, though, that Debra will probably take care of that before the next family arrives!
But again, the house was a great place to stay, and Debra is THE reason we will return, if we have a chance in the future. Debra, thank you so much for your hospitality!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,It’s a nice house (stayed in lower main part) with an interesting history and the house has anything you might need and located close to stores. Debra was easy to communicate with and helpful.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house boat was a lovely and unique sanctuary during our trip. Beautiful relaxing views of the river from the deck.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was wonderful and we enjoyed our stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our anniversary trip to Desta’s Boathouse was JUST what the doctor ordered!!! This momma and daddy of four LOVE to spend our little getaways at exotic places. One year we drove to key west in a convertible. The older our kids get…and the older they make US…the less we want to spend our time away constantly moving. We arrived without any problems, unloaded at the boathouse. The next door neighbor was incredibly friendly and suggested we try Bonnie Blue House for dinner. Get the Redfish!! We spent the whole next day, fishing off the porch (I caught a 12 pound catfish 😊, hubs caught a few too…mine was bigger) and just relaxing. We explored the park across the river, it was so beautiful! This was the most relaxing trip we have ever taken. The quietness of the marina was something we both needed desperately!! We met some geese, and a few alligators, it was a wonderful vacation and we can not wait until next year! This will be our new anniversary tradition!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The houseboat was clean and so peaceful, we had everything we needed in kitchen to cook and if we had any questions she responded quickly. We loved it, will be back"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay on the houseboat. It was relaxing and had a pretty view. It felt far away but was still a close drive to downtown restaurants and boutiques. We would definitely stay again!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very quiet nice stay and the host was excellent to do business with.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Desta was great to work with. The boat house was a fun alternative to a hotel room for about the same cost. My family that stayed there really liked it.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very relaxing clean and well stocked boat house. The host is easy to communicate with and responds quickly. It’s quiet at night and the beds are comfortable. We have nothing but good things to say about our stay at the boat house.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great little place on the flint river. Would definitely recommend!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful relaxing few nights here. The boathouse is adorable and I loved having the screened in room for sitting while we had our afternoon rain. I brought so many supplies with me but should have limited it, not realizing that almost everything you could want is already there just waiting to be used.
I did go up to the campground shower to shower and that was a nice option to have. I'd love to return when we have more time available."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome area, great house!! Has everything needed!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,What an amazing place. The screened in deck was our favorite place to be.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyable stay on a floating house! Definitely a different experience! Loved the patio on the back directly facing the water. If you bring a boat, you can put in the water right here with plenty of space to park it. I can see this would be a fisherman's paradise!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very convenient location, next to Curly’s, a great restaurant. Host is very communicative and accommodating."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very peaceful. I loved sitting on the back porch and relaxing. They had string lights and it was beautiful. The shower at the marina is open all night if you want to use it after hours. Don’t rely on WiFi in the home, it’s too far from the source."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,We had a good time.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!! Awesome river with a awesome view!!

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Relaxing.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing house boat! Good location that is close to town but quiet. Waking up to the wildlife was pleasant every morning. Clean and cozy. We had plenty of room as a family of four. Would be perfect place to bring a kayak or boat for the river.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed for 2 nights with my husband for a relaxing vacation for my birthday in November. This little boathouse is so cute and relaxing. It is nicely decorated has everyting you need and more. Thre is coffee tea, condaments, games, plenty of exra blankets, and space heaters and airconditioners to supplement the the centeral air/heat unit. The master bed is soft and comfy, but if you don't like being wakened by the sun in the morning, bring a sleep mask. I made due by tieing a scarf arond my eyes after being awakened early the fist morning. There is a window near the cealing without a curtin and the curtain on the sliding glass door lets in alot of light. The bunk room is darker with one small window with wood blinds. The bottom bunk is very firm. The living room is very comfortable, there is cable TV, but I don't like TV. I connected my roku but the wifi signal was to week to stream on roku. But I was happy streaming on my phone using my data. Next time I will bring a cable to connect my phone to the TV. I spent most my time on the back porch doing embordiey and watching the ducks, fish jumping, and boats passing by. The space heaters and extra blakents came in handy on the back porch in the chilly November mornings and nighs. We did not leave, as I read there us not much to do in town but a couple of parks. I have chronic fatigue and pain, so I was satisified just staying at the boathouse. The houseboat is somewhat accesiable for people with mobility issues. There are no steps leading to the boat house. I had no problems geting there with my power wheelchair. The is one big step down from the dock to the boathouse entrance about 1 ft. I used my 4ft long ramp and cane to get down the step. I did not feel safe with my heavy power wheelchair on the ramp. Although a lightweight wheelchair or walker would probaly be fine on a ramp. However the doorways are much to small for any wheelchair or walker, you can only use a cane. There are no steps inside the boathouse and a very low threshold for the shower, about 4in. I would recomend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing vacation."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Desta is great to work with!
2021-11-01,2,Stayed over a week,Staying on the river is good
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. There were three of us that traveled to this area for the Swamp Gravy play in Colquitt GA. Our friends that stayed in hotels could only complain about their hotel rooms. It was so nice having two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a separate living area, full kitchen and a screen porch overlooking the Flint River. We will definitely rent this place in the future."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful quiet spot. Perfect for a weekend of fishing.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. Wish we could've stayed longer!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Definitely plan on making another trip ❤️ Desta has this little houseboat decorated so cute and has everything you need to unwind and enjoy your weekend. I was up at sunrise drinking my coffee with an awesome view of the river. Everyone was so friendly. My granddaughter waved to every boat that passed by. If you are looking for a relaxing atmosphere I highly recommend this boathouse for your next getaway.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is a perfect place to getaway for the city. It was quite, relaxing and comfortable."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My mini-vacation on Desta's houseboat was amazing! So peaceful and the views are beautiful. The king bed is really comfortable. The living room is set up so well and all the furniture is comfortable as well. I cooked most of my meals while I was there and the kitchen was stocked with everything I needed. I will absolutely come back again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice and quiet. Friendly neighbors. It was pretty cool seeing gators swim right by the back porch

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"no complaints and this is my first time renting a boat house!! This is nice place for a peaceful getaway. the boat house is nice setup will all required space, appliances, furniture and kitchen. the open space facing water has great view with some patio furniture it makes a special place to have brunch, dinner!!
I missed a pool around in the area or a jacuzzi. there is lots of water with river and lakes around in the city and people either fishing or boating but did not see anybody swimming and not sure if swimming is advised!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to get away and unwind! Comfy, cozy, clean, well-equipped—and right on the river. We definitely will return. It’s a gem."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful houseboat!!!
Great location!!!
Awesome view of the river!!!
Host was quick to respond to questions.
Highly recommend Desta’s place to anyone who wants to “escape” to a peaceful place in order to unwind from a busy week / hang out with family & friends / or just enjoying some beautiful scenery. Watching the wildlife and the slow, steady flow of the river was both relaxing and therapeutic. Definitely going to do this again!!!!!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I enjoyed this place so much!! The location is perfect and the boathouse met every one of our needs. We all didn't want to leave 😊
2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our mini weekend vacation here. It was a quiet spot and the fishing was great. The only thing the Marina needed was a fish cleaning area, other than that it was in close proximity to restaurants and WalMart. Just know most things close early and the better eating locations around 9pm."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I enjoyed our stay! Desta’s place is a great spot to relax. I loved sitting on the porch while drinking my coffee every morning. The views were great. We would definitely book again.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back. It was clean, quiet and a great place to go and relax for a few days. All dishes and linens were provided and we did not really need anything besides our personal items and food. Desta was very generous with her time in answering my random questions throughout the weekend. We did not bring our boat this time, but plan to bring it next time."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great area and awesoem place. We will stay there again in the future.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely houseboat. We would definitely stay again.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place for some rest and relaxation! It’s just as advertised and even better in person! We loved every minute and will be back. From fishing off the dock, to yoga on the back porch, to enjoying a late night game of checkers! A perfect place to slow down and and enjoy family/spouse or friends and make some good memories!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent place to stay! Really quiet and relaxing!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A really good experience! Felt like a home away from home!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Place!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a unique place to get-away and unplug, this is it! The property is off the beaten path yet in a secure gated area. It is so peaceful and relaxing and the screen porch that sits directly over the water is heaven! We had coffee in the morning, simple lunches, chilled in the afternoon, read books & magazines, played cards and ended the day with a good dinner and lots of wine! Desta is an awesome host and she has made sure that everything you need is right there on the boathouse! She is extremely responsive and accommodating! All you have to do is pack some comfy clothes and stop by the grocery store and then you're all set for a fabulous, relaxing stay!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful ❤️
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you are looking for a nice remote location in a nice place this is it. The marina is quiet and everyone was very friendly. Plenty of room for two or a small family. The bunk room is the cutest! Open living with relaxing screened porch on the water. Expect cracks in the tile floor due to movement of the home on the water. Hime do not move a lot just sme movement from waves that come off the river. Clean and exactly as pictured. You will need to creative on where to put your clothes. Plenty of hanging space no dressers. Loved the USB charging ports in the kitchen!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed on the boathouse for 4 day family trip and we had the best time! Relaxing, great views and cozy. Host communication was quick and friendly. We did see alligators in the water which was cool and scary at the same time lol. Very cool experience all around. Great space! We definitely would book again. You will be happy!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"During this pandemic, my family and I opted to avoid staying in hotels when possible and Desta's Boathouse in Bainbridge was perfect for that while we were in town for a weekend. The listing was clean and tidy upon our arrival and offered all of the basics you'd expect. Bedrooms are small but cozy and the additional half bath is a great advantage when visiting with a family. If you happen visit during the hotter months, definitely utilize the additional AC units that are provided as the Central AC does need some initial help when outside temperatures are hovering around 100 degrees.
In a city where listings on Airbnb are already incredibly sparse, The Boathouse offers a cozy space where you have the whole home to yourself while enjoying a scenic space just off the Flint River."
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location for spending time on the Flint River. Bainbridge Park is nearby and a very nice place for walking and boating.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you are wanting a nice and quiet get away and you love the great outdoors this place would be the ideal place to go! Really enjoyed it and everything was up to par!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved every minute - great location and great host! Thank you! We will be back!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay, especially if you enjoy being on the water."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Just as advertised and we plan to return!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time. The marina was nice and we felt secure. The area is fairly isolated, but we found a beautiful nature trail close by. We ate in downtown Bainbridge at The American. (You should get the steak!). The houseboat was clean and well stocked. I’m guessing the several broken floor tiles are from slight movement being on the water? We had always wanted to try a stay on a houseboat, and now we can say we did! I would recommend."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Totally EXCELLENT not-so-tiny house on water!!! Spacious, well-appointed, Uno and Yahtzee in the closet, 2 (TWO!) bathrooms on either side of the shower room, comfy master bed and super-cool bunk beds, 2 TVs, enclosed back porch right on the water, and open porch on opposite side. Lots of cleaning supplies—-yay! Close to everything in town (quick drive). Lots of towels and toilet paper (so appreciated bc I have 2 kids!), ACs cooled entire house beautifully, and there were even popsicles and cans of water in the fridge—-very thoughtful! I could smell a grey-water-type smell in the bathrooms when running the shower and for some time afterward, but my kids didn’t smell it...and I did become nose blind to it after a few hours. I recommend to other visitors that keeping the 2 bathroom doors closed to contain the heat of the dehumidifier in the 2nd bathroom seems to help the ACs to not work too hard. I booked this houseboat bc I mistakenly thought we could swim off it—lol—but as the kids were changing into swimsuits I spotted a gator about 10 feet from the back porch...so I don’t recommend that, but still loved this houseboat and recommend it!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we really enjoyed our stay at The Boathouse Desta place and we are looking forward to staying there again in the very near future the place was decorated beautifully and was very clean and the location of the cabin was the greatest
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to relax, fish and watch the boaters enjoying the Flint River. Wonderful and responsive hostess. Houseboat clean and cozy."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect little spot. Peaceful everyone was friendly and any kind of inconvenience was handled above and beyond what I would have expected. Thank You for hosting me.
2020-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a quick getaway!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very relaxing!! Neat experience!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The boathouse is exactly as pictured. Sitting on the enclosed porch and floating in the marina was a real highlight. I wouldn’t hesitate to book this place. We had some rainy weather but it didn’t stop our fun on the water.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Boathouse was a very relaxing spot for my coworker and myself while we worked in the area.
It would be perfect for a family to visit and has some great fishing spots.
Definitely a place I would consider for a vacation!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you need a place to just relax or get out on the river to do some fishing this is a great place to stay. It’s comfortable and a short drive if you want to explore the town and parks.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,2nd time staying and will be back more!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was beautiful, clean, and peaceful! Desta was great at answering questions extremely quickly! We will definitely be coming back as soon as we can!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful and relaxing. The other people at the marina were welcoming and helpful. Great getaway!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great get away! Four adults were very comfortable in this charming boat house. Very quiet and peaceful. No problem social distancing here! I highly recommend it!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was extremely clean and well taken care of. The recliners, couch, outside furniture and beds were all very comfortable. The marina on the Flint River has a boat ramp, fuel dock and a little store that carries essential items and snacks. The response time as well as the arrival exit instructions from the owner were top notch. There is a really nice city park within 2 miles that has great amenities that include a 3.4 mile walking trail and boat launch. Downtown Bainbridge has some really great architecture and the local shop owners are extremely friendly. The square downtown has several different types of shops and restaurants as well as a local brewery. You cannot go wrong with Desta’s place if you are looking for a nice quiet relaxing get away!"
2020-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great view from the marina over the water
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love the Flint River and we love Desta's Place! Nothing better then a day on the water, docking and enjoying dinner on the screen porch. Very comfortable with all needed amenities. We'll be back!"
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private, clean, and comfortable!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the boathouse for my 21st birthday during the COVID-19 quarantine....floating on the water with a drink in hand was the best I could have asked for! Desta's place is super cute and cozy, and impeccably clean. Staying right on the water was such a unique experience. The marina is so peaceful, except for the occasional puppy dog or the adorable geese who love to check you out on the porch!! My only downside was the area...don't expect to do too much in the Bainbridge neighborhood! 😂"
2020-03-01,4,Stayed over a week,"I visited under the worst possible circumstances you could imagine. I was in the area to teach a 2 week hazmat class for a local industrial plant. My stay was during the time the Flint River was flooding and coincided with the nationwide coronavirus outbreak. The marina docks were essentially made an island by the flood waters with no walkway access to them. Our hosts informed me of this in advance & offered a refund to stay elsewhere. I declined the refund & they rigged up a Jon boat ferry system from the shore to the dock. I’m glad I stuck with them because the boathouse is amazing. It is Wonderfully decorated, had Comfortable furniture & all comforts of home. It’s truly a place you could picture yourself living full time, or at least as a vacation home. Unfortunately, my stay was cut short a week by the corona virus outbreak just as the flood waters were receding. When I informed Travis & Desta of the situation, they offered to block out a week for me when the class is rescheduled. With luck, the next trip won’t involve flood waters and a national emergency. Either way, my experience was great & an adventure to say the least. It may have even turned Bainbridge into a vacation destination. Final note: Stay here. You’ll love it!!"

The beds were very comfortable and we enjoyed the enclosed porch area.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed 4 days and 3 nights for a family reunion and niece’s wedding in Tallahasee. The house was spotless and seemed freshly painted. We home cooked most of our meals and the kitchen was spacious and well equipped. Beds were comfortable, plenty of towels, private bathrooms in 3 of the rooms and shared bathroom for the 4th and 5th. All light fixtures and appliances worked well. Barbecue seemed new with full tank. We had a celebration for our son’s 11th wedding anniversary on the back deck and it was perfect. Enjoyed the back deck with a beautiful view of the Flint River for most of our meals. Nearby, brand new, Chason Park was a blast for the kiddos, ages 2 to 8."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Good place for 2 families to stay before watching an FSU victory!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,The view was beautiful. I wish the fridge had more room for our groceries. Access to the home was very easy. I will suggest don't go to Georgia during a heat advisory. Georgia heat hits different😂

2022-11-01,4,Group trip,"The River House is a delightful place to stay. Very quiet, spacious and relaxing. I wish we had had time to fish and boat.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our short stay to the fullest with a night by the firepit, kayaking, and hot coffee on the porch. The media room is comfortable for indoor football watching, and the kitchen has all the tools needed for family meal prep. It’s incredibly quiet and peaceful on the Flint River."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Mark is great to work with and very quick to respond to messages. His place is fun and the location is great! My family had a great time.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Our family of 10 enjoyed the ample size of the home along with the views of the water from the porch. Everything was very comfortable and we loved having our coffee overlooking the water.
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great time at Mark's place. The house is directly on the river. Mark offers water skiing in all variants We were with the kids Tontau shooting, quad biking and fishing. It's a great opportunity to get to know the Southern atmosphere. We flew over Tallahassee and from there it is still 1.5 hours. Highly recommended if you want to do something off the beaten path.
Mark is an excellent host. We went fishing, skeet-shooting and quad driving with him. He also offers waterskiing. We highly recommend this AirBnB!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"""We enjoyed staying at the Corona house . We brought our pontoon and my sister and her husband brought their bass boat .We were able to ride all around the flint river . We hit our favorite sandbar and the guys did a lot of fishing . The kitchen was very well stocked with all equipment needed too cook. It was very easy to get ahold of the property manager and they were very helpful. We would stay here again."""
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Everything was exactly as it was presented. The only heads-up would be to bring your own grill if you want to grill. Other than that, it was all great. Had a wonderful experience with Mark."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing! If you’re looking for peace and quiet I highly recommend. Lots of space, huge house and we fit 9 people comfortably.

Thank you for having us we would love to come back in the future!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to celebrate the end of life for a family member. It was an incredibly difficult weekend but the stay at Mark's place was incredibly healing. We took walks, sat by the lake and on the back porch. It was so peaceful and quiet."

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,This was a great visit!
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,We stayed here for a girls’ weekend and I must say that it was a welcoming atmosphere from the very beginning. The house is beautiful and very clean. Mark and his family was extremely helpful with recommendations for food and entertainment suggestions. They invited us out for a boat ride and it really made our trip. I highly recommend staying in this lovely home. Five stars all the way!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. We were in Bainbridge for business and after working in the GA heat all day. Sitting on the porch overlooking the river w/ the ceiling fans cooling us and cold drinks in our hands was great.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and beautiful!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family was in search of a home to house 10 of us for a family wedding in a nearby town. We were more concerned about size rather than amenities. My daughter-in-law found Mark’s place and thought it would be perfect. As soon as the men heard “home on the river” they were all in!
We arrived and the home was just how it it is described in the post. It had everything we needed for the weekend and plenty of room to relax or have fun. We were all thrilled to see the beauty of River and listen to wildlife calling from the other bank.
Our weekend was busy with wedding events, but the men were able to squeeze in a little time for fishing. Also, my 4 year old grandson was able to see his first catfish up close. Some of our avid fisherman have already decided they would like to return so they can spend all day on the river.
This is a wonderful place that I would recommend to anyone who asks."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything about our stay was spectacular! Mark really went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. I requested a lot of things that were out of the ordinary and he seemed more than happy to oblige. We will definitely be returning to stay with Mark at the best Airbnb I’ve ever been to! Which is saying a lot, we travel and utilize Airbnb often. Thanks so much for everything Mark!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful riverfront home with lots of room. Kids had a blast fishing and parents have a great time relaxing and enjoying the peace and quiet. Set up great for large families or multiple families.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best getaway! Mark’s home was everything we needed! The house was spacious & clean & so peaceful! Mark was the most wonderful host! Mark gave us a bunch of suggestions for daytime activities (we went hiking at Providence Canyon just under 2 hours away—very cool!) & he gave us the best restaurant recommendation for my husband’s birthday (The American, which was 5 min from his house & was absolutely incredible!) Mark took us on an awesome sunset river cruise, and was able to get us some insanely delicious steaks to grill one night. The view of the river from Mark’s back deck was beautiful! Homemade pancakes & coffee on that deck was absolute perfection! This escape was exactly what my husband & I needed! No work, no kids, peace & quiet, and pure relaxation! What a wonderful place to re-charge! We can’t wait to come back!!! Thanks again!"
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"We used the property during a week long fishing trip. Six men stayed in the property and all of them raved about the property, the comfort and the location. Mark (the owner) made check in and check out extremely easy. 10 out of 10 for every aspect of our stay."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the best time on the Flint!!! Can’t wait to come back!
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"The Corona Escape is an awesome place! The dock overlooking the river is gorgeous, and the house is bright, clean and spacious.

2020-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Secluded home on the water. Thanks for having us!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful house on the river. Mark was a great host who gave my husband the full fishing experience. The house was super clean. If you are in for a rural, peace and quiet god’s country experience, this is it."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mark was a great host. Very welcoming and kind. Even the neighbors and their dogs came over to say hello! He also took us on his boat to try wake boarding and let the boys use the kayaks.
Mark and his family were always on the property or available by text if we needed anything.
I was hesitant at first to stay an Airbnb where it’s the host’s primary resident. I’ve stayed in many Airbnbs all over the world and that was a first. It was awkward seeing so many of their personal items, but we eventually relaxed and made ourselves at home. There were 7 of us and we had plenty of room.
We were in town for a fishing tournament and had our boat. The circular drive around the home was perfect for the boat. It was easy in/out.
Gnats are bad in Georgia this time of year, so we couldn’t sit outside much, but the view was great!
We were able to use the WiFi downstairs and it worked best in the living room. We didn’t have much service upstairs. We had to work, so WiFi was necessary!
Easy check in/out"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you're looking to get away and enjoy some outdoor activity this is the perfect place. Wonderful host, spacious and cozy house. Mark took us out on a boat ride, taught us the basics on fishing and even chopped some wood so we could roast marshmallows with the kids. We had the perfect weekend."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot on the river. Mark is a great host. I would highly recommend to anyone.

2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved Mark's place! It had a fun lodge feel and great amenities. The yard is beautiful and our favorite part was sitting on the lounges on the back porch in the morning drinking coffee. We will be back!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful family home on the river! We only stayed one night, but will be back, thank you!"
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"This house is right on the river and it has lots of room in common areas. Great outside seating area with largeTV and a dock you can fish from.
Mark was quick to respond and provided all that we asked! His home reflects the love he has for the outdoors. It is appointed with many hunting gems and has a rustic cabin feel to it. Very close to town and to the venue we needed! Love the barn doors!!!"
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"Mark is a great host - responsive, friendly, honest and kind. He provided his personal home to us which was ideal for our three couples meeting from various parts of the country to visit and do some fishing on Lake Seminole (4 bedrooms, 3 1/2 bathrooms and a large den with plenty of comfortable furniture). His property description is accurate. Also, Pond House Restaurant was excellent."
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,Mark was an amazing host. Far above and beyond expectations. Thanks for the hospitality Mark!
2019-03-01,5,Group trip,"This property was above our expectations. We were there for a wedding with my son (groom) and some of his groomsmen. We had a wonderful week with a lot of time spent outside and fun times at night around the fire. Great, clean accommodations! Exactly what we needed. Within 15 minutes of all of our places we needed to be! Thank you!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at the River House. The view was amazing and Mark the host went out of his way to accommodate us as well as Barbecuing us a meal. We were there for our sons FLW Tour fishing event. And we had 3 Pros staying at his house. There was plenty of room for the 3 trucks and boats as well as all of our cars and trucks with room to spare. Any fishermen if you have a group that travels together you can circle the house on the drive with 4 or 5 boats and trucks so don’t hesitate to book this house.
2019-03-01,4,Stayed over a week,The house was a beautiful location.
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Mark was very responsive and very accommodating!
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we came into Bainbridge to fish an FLW Bass Tournament on Lake Seminole and we were having trouble finding space for our 4 boats and trucks. Mark and Jenny's house was perfect for us as we had ample amount of space with their wrap around driveway, which made parking a breeze! There was plenty of space inside, as well as some great views from the back porch of the River. Mark was always there when we needed something and was a great host!"
2019-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Would recommend it !!

2018-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed being on the water and watching birds and other wild life.
2018-11-01,4,Group trip,If you like a roomy rustic no frills hunting cabin style home with a great view this is the perfect place for you.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spacious home on the river just a few minutes from Bainbridge. Mark was very responsive and accommodating. We were working hurricane response so we didn’t get a chance to enjoy the area. Would definitely return with the family.
2018-10-01,5,Group trip,Mark was an amazing hostess! My crew was down working disaster relief after Hurricane Michael and Mark was able to accommodate them last minute. Not only that the house was above par and my guys were very happy to have a place to sleep that was not a hotel room! Definitely will be back!
2018-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent, private, and relaxing experience"
2018-09-01,5,Group trip,"Mark's house was amazing. Its location is removed from the main road enough to have some peace and quiet, but close enough that you can order pizza. The back yard is right on the river and Mark was generous enough to let us use the kayaks to go paddle around and fish. We did catch some fish right off the dock! Highly recommended. I definitely will be staying here again if Im ever in the area."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark is a first class host! Very friendly, and excellent communication. Amazing stay in a beautiful large home on a private wooded lot on a river.

Simply incredible. I'll be back! Thank you for letting me stay at your charming home."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is weird and wonderful--many of the original features of the synagogue were left in place. It's within walking distance of Bainbridge's best restaurants, shops, and watering holes."
