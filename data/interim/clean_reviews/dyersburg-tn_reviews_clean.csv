2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful experience. This was my family Christmas. Shannon had a tree decorated and the place just felt warm. We invited my dad and stepmom and they were just blown away at how beautiful the place was. We all had a bed room to sleep in with comfy beds. We totally enjoyed our stay. One of best Christmases ever. We will probably be doing this again next year. Thank you Shannon for being a wonderful host. Merry Christmas!

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is the first time my family went through Airbnb for a place to stay, when traveling and Bryan made the process very easy for us. When there was a scheduling issue, he upgraded us to another property nearby that was actually bigger and more private for no additional cost. The place was beautiful inside and out and was the perfect accommodation for my family as we attended a family reunion in the area. We would definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Just as pictured and on a nice, quiet street with a pretty backyard view. Couch and beds were comfortable. Streaming TVs in each room were a nice amenity and wi-fi had high speeds and bandwidth for streaming and working remotely. Kitchen and laundry appliances, water heater, and HVAC all worked great. (Be aware that a toaster is not included in the kitchen amenities, but it has pretty much everything else you would need!) We had a couple things come up and Bryan was always very quick to respond - super helpful and accommodating!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is very nice and clean. We will stay here again! The only problem was the beds.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Bryan went above & beyond for our stay! We were in town to arrange and host our father‚Äôs funeral. We reached out last minute (same day) hoping that we would get a response because he was the only AirBNB in the area! Within just moments he responded! Once we arrived, we were completely blown away by the kindness from a ‚Äúcomplete stranger‚Äù who went above and beyond to express condolences for our loss! I reached out to Bryan for assistance with the Wifi password & an issue with the Hot Water; he walked me through the Wi-Fi and literally within 30 minutes had the hot water issue fixed. (It was simply a safety feature that needed adjusting!)
We were so beyond grateful for our stay in this house & will ensure that any area we travel, we will check to see if he has an available home before booking anywhere else! Thank you, Bryan!"

If you ever get to Virginia Beach Bill, look us up we would love to show you around!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a solo trip for me, just to get away for a night. I was going to arrive a little later than I had originally planned but I communicated that before my trip. Mr. Bill had already sent me instructions on how to get inside, but I caught him before he left for the evening. He took the time to show me around and make sure I was set for the night. It was so nice to be in the country and see some of God's beauty. I walked the vineyard and watched the sunset since it was such a beautiful night. The next morning, Mr. Bill had a delicious breakfast waiting for me: blueberry pancakes, eggs, bacon and some of the best strawberries Ive ever had. He and I had good conversation and I learned new things in the process. Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with my stay and will for sure be back for another visit."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bill met us with haste and was overly (not in a bad way) hospitable to be in his place.

Would gladly recommend or go back anytime

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have visited White Squirrel Winery five times now, and each time is more and more enjoyable! It is always a pleasure to stop in on our winter trip south and visit with Bill Sanderson, owner. He is a superb host, and his wine is awesome. We purchased five different types of wine to take with us, including his 2023 new award-winning Chardonel. In addition, we stocked up on Marjie‚Äôs exclusive, homemade soaps.
The sunset and sunrise over this beautiful Tennessee winery are breathtaking from the cozy loft suite that has always been comfortable and clean. Bill is a true, southern host, great breakfast chef, and good teacher of his grapes and wine making. We consider him a friend and feel almost as if we are ‚Äúcoming home‚Äú each time we arrive. We are considering a fall trip this year just to visit WSW and take in the countryside.
If you were looking for a unique place to stay and love, Wine, we highly recommend WSW and their sweet barn loft suite."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bill was wonderful and we very much enjoyed the trip.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft is a great place to stay. Bill and Marjie are wonderful host. They were extremely welcoming and accommodating.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great spot, with excellent wine choices. Bill was great on his suggestion for dinner. Since my wife and I are at different spectrums for wine, Bill offered 2 types with our stay. Awesome breakfast!. Thanks Bill!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time here! The winery is beautiful, the loft is cozy, and the wine is amazing!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay with Bill and Marjie was wonderful The pictures are great, but the actual loft was more enchanting being decorated for the holiday season. The wine was amazing. During the tasting Bill answered all of our questions and taught us the history behind some of the wines and the meanings of their names. Every morning we were greeted with a conversation and some of the best homemade food we could ask for. The fresh blueberry pancakes were top of the list with the homemade hashbrowns taking a close second. Bill's knowledge of the area and where the best restaurants and activities were made our planning for the day really simple."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our stay and breakfast was amazing. Bill also gave excellent recommendations on places to eat dinner. We look forward to coming back.

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Bill & Marjie's place is exactly as described. My wife and I very much enjoyed the location and the loft. The bed was very comfortable and we both enjoyed the large bath.
The only negative feedback I would give is that we were unaware there would be an event going on into the evening. We understand this was an active winery that hosts events but we weren't notified of there being an event until we showed up.
All in all it was still a great stay, we would just recommend notifying guests ahead of time."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great little trip! We stayed for one night. Bill was out of town for breakfast, but baked blueberry muffins and prepared a continental breakfast for us. It was a great little getaway and very peaceful. The wifi was great also!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a very sweet romantic getaway at the vineyard. Our host made check in easy and responded quickly when communicating. We even had a lovely bottle of wine waiting for us when we arrived. The view from the room was beautiful, many great photo opportunities. We were fortunate to awake to breakfast waiting for us. Be warned their wine is so good you may have to buy a bottle or two."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"White Squirrel Winery and Vineyard is a genuine jewel hidden in the little town of Kenton. Being there was like inhaling a peace and beauty we longed for.
Bill greeted us with a warm smile and took us to our immaculately charming loft.
Hours after we arrived we had a couples massage that was the epitome of relaxation.
We decided to sleep late and skip breakfast.But Bill being an impeccable host, still left us breakfast on the patio.
Most people would have left us a continental breakfast but that‚Äôs most people.
We sat down to fluffy blueberry pancakes, seasoned eggs, crispy bacon and melon. It was delicious!
Oh!! Did I tell you what I woke up to? When I opened my window to take in the view I heard the melodious voice of Nat King Cole singing‚ÄùWhen I Fall in Love‚Äù. I was done for the day!!!
Bill also told us earlier there were apple trees so we could pick a bag if we liked. Can you say romance????
Chuck and I had a romantic anniversary that we will remember for years to come !"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So peaceful and welcoming at The White Squirrel. Check it out!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Would rate the ""Romantic Winery Loft Suite"" with more than 5-stars and as one of the nicest, quiet and relaxing places we have been in TN. Definitely what we were looking for to recharge. The place was very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home. This lovely space was beautiful (lots of lovely touches).
We had a great time at Bills And Marjie's place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. Bill was such a great host. We had wine tasting experience. Had a wonderful breakfast in the morning. Also, took some fresh apples from the farm back home. The wine was amazing, we had to take 1/2 a case on the go. We are looking forward to staying here again one day."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"AMAZING Place and Hosts! Bill & Marjie's place is the perfect get-away and much more. Words cannot say how perfectly wonderful, gracious and welcoming our stay was. You can see through all of the special touches and details the love that has been poured in this beautiful place. Our stay at the Romantic White Squirrel Winery far exceeded our expectations.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This isn‚Äôt just a place to stay, but an entire experience. If you want a retreat away from busy life, choose this place. From picking apples at sunset to taking a crisp morning walk before breakfast, everything was perfect. My husband and I enjoyed all the quality time we were able to spend here.

I hope to visit again and will recommend White Squirrel Winery to anyone needing a nice getaway."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marjie, greets us at the front door of the Winery had freshly cut flowers in our loft. Bill recommend a fabulous restaurant in Obion TN.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Where to begin... The room was beautiful overlooking the actual indoor winery. The outside was awesome. We were right on the property with all the grapes. Bill and Marjie were great hosts. We learned a lot about grapes and making of wine as well as what to do in the area. Bill can be your best friend instantly. He is so friendly and made us feel at home. Marjie makes candles and soaps so in addition to buying wine we also bought her products. We will definitely will be back for a visit and looking forward to staying longer. Thanks for a wonderful time.

The owner, Bill, did an amazing job making us feel welcome and part of the family. The room is very quaint and we really enjoyed waking up with the large window overlooking the vineyard. You start the day with a homemade breakfast that is second to none made by Bill. The location is great and there are several attractions close by. Would highly recommend. Thanks so much Bill and Sanderson family for a memory that my wife and I will always cherish."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was truly a romantic getaway. From checking in, wine tasting, romantic walk through the vineyard‚Ä¶ which lead to my boyfriend proposing to me‚Ä¶ I said YES! Marjie was there to capture our special moment. The suite is exactly as described and is as beautiful as the photos. We saw a squirrel and a bunny playing together from our window. Also saw a eagle flying on the property. Bill cooked us an amazing breakfast‚Ä¶ and we enjoyed our morning talk with him. Make sure that you pick up some of Marjie‚Äôs soap and candles along with wine before you head out! This place will always hold a special piece of my heart. We will definitely come back :)"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Not just a place to stay, but a relaxing and memorable experience. Relaxing and restful, quiet and peaceful. Our visit started with a welcome from the host and a tour of the winery, bottle of wine included. Bill recommended local places to eat for dinner and filled us in on the history of the winery. Later that evening, we enjoyed an amazing firefly show over the vineyard from the room!
The next morning, right on our agreed upon time, Bill arrived at the winery and turned on the 1920s jazz music welcoming us to our homemade breakfast, complete with blueberry pancakes and local fresh strawberries. Afterward, we enjoyed a stroll through the vineyard.
We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and plan to return in the future. If you're looking for an experience to remember, this is worth the drive for sure!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying at White Squirrel, and we loved it as much this time as the last. It is the most peaceful setting and a truly unique experience for wine lovers. Bill is an incredible host and the homemade breakfast he delivers in the morning is just one example of the many thoughtful touches you‚Äôll experience throughout your stay. To us, the BNB at White Squirrel is the best kept secret in Western Tennessee - we will definitely return!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a great short trip to the vineyard for our 10 year anniversary. Bill was great his knowledge and experience in the wine making business was a treat to listen to. He gave several recommendations for things to do nearby which did not disappoint. Bill has a nice slice of heaven on earth at his vineyard property, do yourself a favor if you ever get a chance to stop by or stay in the loft do so as you‚Äôll be glad you did. Also his blueberry pancake breakfast is a great addition to the stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! That‚Äôs all I can say, me and my girlfriend had an amazing two night stay. Bill and Marjie are some of the nicest and most welcoming people I have ever met, the loft was very peaceful and quite, bill made an excellent breakfast both mornings.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great getaway! Enjoyed every second! Will definitely go back for some great wine and conversation!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our night's stay at the White Squirrel Winery was a perfect getaway from the city. Bill & Marjie were wonderful hosts. There was an outdoor event going on as we arrived with draft beer, live music, and a food truck. The crowd was very friendly, and the vibe was relaxed. It wrapped up on the early side so we had a very peaceful evening. The room was cozy, the bed was comfortable, and the large claw-foot tub was great for relaxing.
We were given a free bottle of wine with our stay, and were treated to a delicious home-cooked breakfast. We lean toward drier wines, and the Rose and Cab were both very good, and we took a bottle of the Norton and Chambourcin home with us to try. We were free to walk the grounds, but it was a little early in the season for vine growth, so we will definitely be coming back when the vineyard is on full display."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bill was a fantastic host. He made my wife and I feel right at home from the moment we walked in until checkout. He was more than happy to chat with us about the history of the winery as well as elaborate on his extensive knowledge in wine tasting and wine making. Yes, his pancakes are phenomenal, which added to the spectacular stay! I definitely would recommend this quiet, peaceful, romantic little getaway to anyone!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bill was a wealth of knowledge and was eager to share the local ‚Äúmust see‚Äù places. Our 19th wedding anniversary was quiet and peaceful. We enjoyed delicious homemade breakfasts and great conversation! We hope to be back this fall.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Booked for a special occasion and had a wonderful time! Bill was delightful and a perfect host. Bathtub was divine. It was chilly but the property was so cool. Already planning a return trip for when the grapes are on the vine.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The White Squirrel Winery is a fun winery to visit in northwest Tennessee. This was our third visit! They have a great selection of wines ranging from the dry reds to the sweeter whites. This year‚Äôs Cabernet is excellent! Bill produces the grapes on-site in a beautifully manicured 90 acre vineyard. The barnloft Airbnb provides the perfect place for a romantic getaway. The breakfast that Bill cooks up each morning is second to none. The most memorable part of the experience is the fun conversations provided by Bill and Marjie along with the local friends that stop by. When we arrive, we feel welcomed by good friends. We look forward to our next visit. Thank you Bill and Marjie for helping us celebrate our birthdays!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in this part of Tennessee. Bill and Marjie are great at what they do. Bill is very informative on the wine production and Marjie produces many of the products for sale in the tasting room. Breakfast included was a plus and it was very good. We had fun tasting wines with Bill and he made it memorable. Bill‚Äôs restaurant recommendations were good and Discovery Park was a good outing.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bill was an incredible host! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back soon! Bill‚Äôs blueberry pancakes stack up with the best Gatlinburg pancakes any day of the week! I highly suggest staying if you never have!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We are in awe of how wonderful WS Winery is. It is owned by the kindest people. Bill is a wonderful host. Not only is he kind & thoughtful he is funny too! We enjoyed his company. The wine is also amazing. We highly recommend Jive!
The walls of the stairs leading up to the loft were lined with WSW history. We enjoyed reading those & seeing how far it‚Äôs come. The place is decorated beautifully. It‚Äôs not too much and there are little treasures all through out that allow you to get to know your hosts more. My husband & I spent a good chunk of time smelling all of the candles & soaps. Marjie does a great job. We couldn‚Äôt wait to enjoy the new soap we purchased so we took a nice long bath in the claw foot tub.
The view from the room is breathtaking. We had the big window open anytime we could. We enjoyed a fire under the pavilion with its beautifully hung lights. We had a great tasting breakfast when we woke up. The table was set beautifully. The food was seasoned just right. All of it was so dreamy & romantic.
We adored WSW & can not wait to be back. We created so many memories in such a short amount of time. We are very thankful for this space."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bill and Marjie accomodated all our extra requests and helped in making this a fantastic anniversary stay.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an adorable place to stay. The view in the morning is breathe taking. The loft itself is so cute, very clean, and cozy. Perfect for a romantic weekend"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a cool place to stay with a lot of varied opportunities near by, then this is one of the best AIRBNB locations that we have stayed at to date. The loft is really nice and cozy, with amazing views of the vineyard and the winery. The drive to get there was amazing, and we came from almost all the possible directions, due to our Geocaching trip. You are close to Reelfoot Lake, The Mississippi River, Discovery Park, the B17 crash site and Memorial, Rural King and Trimble TN. If you don't know what is in Trimble, you need to go there on one of your day trips from the White Squirrel, they have moonshine and beer. The host was amazing and told us about several of the locations and about his farm and the grapes and wine. We enjoyed our complimentary bottle of wine and slept like a baby. We woke the next morning to a great breakfast that was impossible to consume due to the size of the portion. The eggs and Blueberry pancakes were perfect. My only regret was that we had to leave."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This unique experience is perfect for any occasion. The vineyard is lovely and being the only guests allows Bill and Marjie to give you a special one of a kind stay. The loft above the winery is perfect for two and has a beautiful view of the vineyard. It was nice to sit on the patio with a bottle of wine and take in the scenery. Breakfast made by Bill and Marjie was a nice touch to our stay. The wine was wonderful and the restaurant recommended by Bill for dinner was phenomenal. We will definitely return in the future.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a getaway! Bill and Marjie are great hosts! Both make amazing breakfast. We enjoyed the wine and conversations and also appreciated the suggestions on things to do! The vineyard is so pretty! It was such a relaxing and enjoyable weekend! Highly recommend!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Third stay is the charm! This is our annual go to spot to celebrate our anniversary. It‚Äôs always amazing and this stay was no different!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The stay in the air bnb was everything we expected EXCELLENT!!!!!The hospitality that Bill and Marjie gives their guest and customers is second to none. Not to mention the breakfast the next morning was amazing.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The best of both worlds!
Wine and lodging in a beautiful location.
Your host Bill is warm and friendly, and loves his work/destiny, and is very knowledgeable. His wife Marjie is a wonderful creative artist and makes most all the gifts in the tasting room.
I had a wonderful experience there and am so glad I found his loft on Air bnb.
His Jive Muscadine wine is mouth watering, and I'm more of a red drinler but love love love the nutty smel and divine taste!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great experience for the wife and me! Great experience and host! Wine is the best and view is just gorgeous from the room! Thanks to the Sanderson‚Äôs for a great experience we will be back!!

They are both very friendly and have great recommendations on local place to eat. The room is very nice with wonderful view of the vineyard. Enjoyed getting to show up and getting to try all the wonderful wines they offer. Would highly recommend to anyone!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Incredible view, and a warm welcome. The room was fantastic and Bill and Marjie created a wonderful experience. Cannot wait to come back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at the vineyard. Bill was a wonderful host and very helpful with dinner suggestions. Stay over on a Friday and Saturday, there is more going on at the winery during those days than during the week. Only drawback is there is only a bathtub in the room, no shower. The breakfast was amazing both mornings."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"5 star Tennessee Hospitality!!! White Squirrel Winery & airbnb was the perfect location for us to celebrate our 45th romantic anniversary getaway. Bill was so welcoming & helpful. With amazing suggestions/recommendations on surrounding activities & venues to explore to assisting us in locating a restaurant just right for our dinner Friday night (even providing us with a coupon).
Wine is incredible not to mention the gorgeous tranquil setting of the venue & grounds. The airbnb is absolutely charming! From the lovely comfortable murphy bed to the super relaxing clawfoot tub, we felt pampered to the max. They even provided a complimentary bottle of wine with our stay. Being allowed to explore the vineyard/grounds & enjoying a private evening on the patio with views of the ponds under a star filled nighttime sky was so special.
Breakfast the next morning was delicious, served to us in the winery. Bacon, eggs, fresh blueberry pancakes, honeydew melon served with coffee & grape juice made directly on the premises was to die for. Can't say thank you enough for everything. Anyone wanting to just have a peaceful, relaxing rest should put this location on their wishlist. We will definitely return.
BTW: Margie, Bill's wife, makes the most wonderful soaps. Be sure to treat yourself with a bar when you sink into that glorious clawfoot tub.
Also a special shoutout to Tina for an incredible wine tasting on Sat."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bill is such a great host and cook! The loft was adorable and had an amazing view to the vineyard. He even brought us fresh strawberries to enjoy.
I would 100% recommend."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was for sure the best experience I‚Äôve ever had with Airbnb. Bill is the best host and his place is just impeccable!
Since there is only one bedroom, this is an exclusive experience which makes it even more special. My husband and I arrived mid afternoon and since minute one, Bill was very warm and welcoming.
Since it‚Äôs my husband‚Äôs birthday weekend, Bill helped me to arrange a massage in our room for my husband. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about anything.
We tasted his wine, which is for sure one of the best I‚Äôve ever had in my life - my husband agrees with me. The views of his farm are beautiful. It‚Äôs such a peaceful place. We enjoyed very much to taste some delicious wine just sitting outside with those views and the fresh breeze.
The bedroom suite is so adorable and cozy! The views are also beautiful (including at night, when you can see the moon from one of the windows).
The bathtub is another great and romantic detail that we loved!
Bill took us on a tour through his property and explained a lot to us, it was amazing to learn more about farming and the amazing work he does in his farm.
The breakfast cooked by Bill was another big hit! Everything so fresh and delicious! His grape juice is the best I‚Äôve ever had. The pancakes with blueberries from his plantation are spectacular!
I have literally zero complaints! It‚Äôs the type of experience that recharges your energy and fulfills the soul.
We left his property with lots of delicious wines, looking forward to be part of his wine club and we will definitely go back soon!"

Already looking forward to our next visit."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hands down our best bed and breakfast experience ever. The room and the winery atmosphere are amazing.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"White Squirrel Winery is by far our favorite airbnb and we highly recommend it. This was our second visit there and we hope for several more opportunities to stay there. Bill's blueberry pancakes for breakfast rival any we eaten before. Upon entry into the winery, it felt like we were visiting old friends. Bill & Marjie obviously provide and foster a relaxing place in the community where folks enjoy the fellowship and comradery. And the bonus? The wine selection is great!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a wonderful place! The host was so very sweet! Breakfast was phenomenal and the wine was so good we had to grab a bottle for home! Everything was perfect for our stay and can not wait to return again!

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great weekend getaway! How many people can say they‚Äôve stayed the night in a winery? The room is a super cute loft with a big tub (no standing shower, but the tub has a sprayer!) with a view of the winery from above. Breakfast was amazing, the wine is awesome, and the host was great! We will definitely be returning during the summer when the vineyard is in full swing!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic place to stay. The hosts are very accommodating and friendly. They immediately made us feel at home. For those that want to be in the middle of the action, this location may not be for you. There is a good amount to see and do in the area, but you will have a 30+ minute drive to get to most things. This did not take away at all from our experience. We knew it was a more rural area, which was what we were looking for in a long weekend. They have some really good selections at the winery (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). Breakfast was very, very good, too. We highly recommend you look up Bill and Marjie for your next West Tennessee adventure!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This might just be the best Airbnb experience I've had. It's not just a stay... it's a whole weekend itinerary packed in one. Bill was such a gracious hosts greeting us with a hot and delicious breakfast each morning and loads of recommendations for sights to see and excellent food choices to try. We were a little wary of spending our fall break in a small town that we had never heard of before. If you're thinking the same, then you have nothing to worry about. The vineyard is located a nice drive from all sorts of different activities. We enjoyed the nearby lake, biking and hiking trails, Discovery Park, plus the vineyard itself and wine tasting! Overall, wonderful stay and would gladly recommend to others!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far, my favorite AirBnb stay - this is not just a cozy and clean accommodation but an entire unforgettable experience.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay. The property is serene, quiet, and gorgeous. Bill was very welcoming and generous.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The property was beautiful and Bill was a friendly and gracious host. My husband and I stayed on a week night as we were passing through the area, but I imagine it is fun to stay on a weekend when the tasting room is open. We enjoyed walking around the vineyard to appreciate the scenery and the occasional hopping Tennessee vineyard toad. Breakfast was provided which was convenient as the area is rural and Bill was great for conversation and a wealth of information of grapes! We would recommend staying at White Squirrel Winery if you‚Äôre in West Tennessee!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The location, view, and host did not disappoint. If you are thinking about staying here, DO IT. the breakfast was fantastic, the bed was comfortable, and the view is the best part.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If southern hospitality is what you are looking for, then a stay at The White Squirrel Winery is just what you need. The Sandersons' pay close attention to the little details and make you feel right at home. We started each morning with a fantastic breakfast prepared by Bill with good conversation. Then, we enjoyed strolling through the vineyard and sampling wines. The loft was clean, relaxing, and offered beautiful views. We will be visiting them again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is our second stay, and White Squirrel has become our happy place. We enjoy the atmosphere and company each time we are there whether it‚Äôs for an overnight stay or just an hour. You‚Äôll fall in love with it, too. It‚Äôs a wonderful and delightful experience!"

Fresh flowers, a delightful loft with natural light, and views that overlook the vineyard. Let‚Äôs not forget Bill‚Äôs breakfast! Yummy! We stayed on a Friday night, and we sat outside drinking a complimentary bottle of wine while enjoying the sunset and soaking up the vineyard views. The winery was closed for the evening, so it was just my husband and me. Talk about a peaceful and romantic getaway! Bill and Margie are such gracious hosts! We will be back on the fall!

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"White Squirrel Winery was the best find we have experienced in a while. My husband and I travel a lot, not only out of the country, but to small towns in our great state of Tennessee. Bill started us off with a wine tasting; he has a wealth of knowledge about growing the grapes as well as all that goes in to bottling the wine. The wine is by far the best I have ever had from a small winery, with a wide variety to choose from.
The room we rented was cozy, clean and up to date; the view from the window was beautiful. Along with the rental you will receive a scrumptious breakfast made farm fresh. We even mentioned to Bill he made the best eggs we've ever eaten! The conversation flows naturally with Bill and Marjie as their hospitality is second to none.
We cannot wait to return in September to see the orchard full of grapes!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easily the most fun I‚Äôve had at an airbnb. Bill was an amazing host to me and his customers as they visited. I‚Äôd recommend his place to anybody.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for our daughter‚Äôs graduation in Martin. Initially we had booked a room at the Hampton, until I happened upon this place on Airbnb. Wow!!!! Am I glad we changed our reservation! This is such a unique rental and the hosts Bill & Marjie are so welcoming & friendly. The loft was very clean and the big barn style windows open to the vineyard (& the winery) which makes a spectacular view. The breakfast was fabulous!! Overall we‚Äôre so happy with our choice & our time at the winery made for a very memorable weekend."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a beautiful location with AMAZING hosts - this is definitely the place for you. Your stay will be very comfortable & your hosts are outstanding , thoughtful, and they make great breakfast & wine üòÄ"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bill & Marjie were incredibly hospitable. my wife and I truly felt like we were taken in as family. The suite was private and cozy. Truly a unique experience.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Choosing to stay at the Romantic Winery Loft over the White Squirrel Winery was the best choice we made during our winter get-a-way. Not only was the loft over the winery creative and unique, it was very comfy and clean. Bill & Marjie made sure we had more than just what was needed for a relaxing stay. They thought of everything and then some. Breakfast, made by Bill, the following morning was absolutely delicious. However, I have to say that the thing we enjoyed most was tasting the great dry wines from the winery and visiting with the local neighbors and friends. This is obviously a popular place for the locals, who were very friendly and welcomed passersbys. We had a terrific time and look forward to going back for more than one night. If you have the opportunity to stay in the loft, or just stop for wine, you will not be disappointed."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It is a very elegant and peaceful setting. It was great that the winery is so close for us for a good quick visit. Bill and Marnie put so much into making sure your stay will be amazing. We highly recommend it to everyone we talk to who are looking for getaways.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I could write for days about my stay at White Squirrel Winery with Bill and Marjie. We became fast friends and I felt right at home.
I booked the place for the tub (which is as amazing as it looks) and I got the best surprise of home cooked breakfasts, wine tastings, homemade soaps and candles and the best part... amazing new friends. I feel like I‚Äôve known them all my life.
Bill really educated me on grapes and wines and the care they put into them shows in the quality. The wines are fantastic! Marjie makes all the soaps and candles and I brought several home for myself and gifts.
Booking with them is a guaranteed win and the promise of an exceptional experience!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Totally recommend booking here. We received the best hospitality and enjoyed the wine tasting experience. 10/10 recommend!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the best Airbnbs me & my boyfriend have been too, and we‚Äôve been to a lot. Bill and Marjie are two of the kindest people. They were so welcoming when we got there, bill showed us around told us about the area and gave us some suggestions on where to eat. The winery was open on our first day there so we sat downstairs and tried the Jive wine which we FELL in love with, and enjoyed the atmosphere. The loft is the cutest place, you get a wonderful view of the winery and outside. Bed was great, TV was nice since we were there on New Year‚Äôs Eve we watched the ball drop and drank our complementary wine! Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better way to start 2021. If you are even thinking about staying here do it, bill will even make you breakfast which is so sweet. These are real people running a wonderful place. I can‚Äôt wait to visit again."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Airbnb was great. Super comfortable and would love to stay here again. The host was very quick to respond and very helpful.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The stay was great. Extremely quiet, comfy beds and a nice play to stay"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,very nice !
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"we had a wonderful family gathering at this place. the fire pit was frequently used, the very long table in the dining room was great for games and meals together. kitchen was large and well stocked. Game room was a good time as well, large enough for us all to congregate and play darts.
Thought the house was a little closer to the lake, ended up being 30 min drive. However, the drive was pretty and we had no big issues navigating there and back for dinner and hikes or fishing.
There was a washer and dryer, though we could not find the laundry soap, and so any messes or child accidents were hand washed. minor setback, nothing major.
house was clean, lots of towels and utensils, and we had plenty of space.
thank you!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Price was just too high but it was great otherwise
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at Mary Jo‚Äôs! Everything was very clean and the property was lovely! The house is spacious and perfect for a small group. The yard has a great area for a bonfire and bags. We didn‚Äôt use the game room but based on everything else I‚Äôm sure it was nice as well. I would definitely recommend this home!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,great place to stay
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this place! Hosts were great. Area is beautiful. You will be in country, which I love."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is gorgeous! It is very private and quiet. My husband and I wanted a relaxing weekend to get away from it all and this was perfect! The cabin is super cozy and newly remodeled. 2 full bathrooms and plenty of room for a bigger family/group. Beds were neatly made and sheets super soft and clean! Kitchen has everything u might need to cook i.e- spices,pots,pans,casserole dishes,cast iron skillets,silverware,steak knives,etc. For the coffee lovers,they have a Bunn restaurant style coffee maker! IYKYK! The cabin has a brand new dishwasher as well if u want to go that route. We had such an amazing peaceful time. The fire pit was a great place to relax,star gaze and watch lightening bugs. They have lights streamed along the back tree line for subtle light which was perfect. Plenty of firewood to keep the fire going for days! There is a nice big game room in one of the buildings on the property. Would be great for family time. We only stayed 2 nights and didn‚Äôt get to enjoy it ourselves,so we will do that next time! This cabin has a 2 car garage as well if u wanted to park inside. We didn‚Äôt use it for that as we felt it wasn‚Äôt necessary. This cabin is out by itself (except for the nice owners out back on their own property) so it‚Äôs very safe and no neighbors to worry about. Streaming the TV was great and we had no issues. Kroger in Dyersburg is 15 mins the back roads. So if ur coming there and don‚Äôt want to have to run back out,stop by the grocery store before hand and grab ur goodies! S‚Äômores will be on my next list on the next trip there. Washer/dryer was a blessing! So if ur wanting peace and quiet and to have a blast with ur friends or family,then book this cabin now! U won‚Äôt be disappointed!! 10/10"

2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Mary Jo's and Jessie's treasure is just that- awesome. We had a large group coming from all directions for a funeral and we couldn't have picked a more perfect place. I need to take up duck hunting this winter just to find a reason to return! Everything has been remodeled up to modern standards and very clean. Great job, you two!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We will 100% be booking again!! The stay was one of the best places we have stayed in a long time. Thank you for having us!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Dan and Lane are excellent hosts. Quiet and Easy place to stay for a month while on Clinical rotation. Very comfortable and beautiful surrounding.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very peaceful rural area host is very welcoming and close by
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had such a lovely time staying here, it couldn‚Äôt have been any better. It‚Äôs simply beautiful where it is, and it made me feel at home."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and would stay again. Dan and Lane were wonderful hosts.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were excited to return to their place on our visit to family in a nearby town. Their home's kitchen setup is perfect for a foodie yearning to hole up and cook, stocked with cookware, bakeware, kitchen utensils, and small electric appliances.
Then a weather emergency came up. We were so worried as we'd lost a car 6 months ago to a Texas hail storm. But soon as Dan and Lane got our call, they didn‚Äôt hesitate to rescue us, going above and beyond to shelter our car from looming hail. We are so very grateful to them. Can't adequately express my gratitude for their willingness to help us."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,When work calls me to the area I always try and stay at Dan and Lane's. So peaceful and roomy. Large covered back patio is the best to sit in the morning to have coffee or evening to relax and enjoy a beverage. I have never seen them and they have never seen me but I feel like I have known them for years. : )
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Excellent place to stay. Would stay again.
Very surprised to find all manner of pots, pans, small appliances, plates, cups, regular and specialty utensils. Basically anything I could have wanted to feed myself or 4 was all there.
Cast Iron for blackened steak and burgers. Aluminum pans for eggs and grilling buns. Bread knife, chefs knife, steel and like 10 other knives for food prep.
Stayed for 2 weeks with almost all meals prepared there. Warm and comfortable. Clean and spacious as described.
5 star experience!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Dan And Lane's place is a great little gem in the country. Don't come here for the nightlife haha! Come here to have a peaceful, quiet, spacious, comfortable, well furnished retreat. The interior is beautiful and very roomy. The bed is so comfy. Highly recommended for a private get-away."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for me. I hope Dans place is available when I'm back in the area, I would definitely stay here again."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Loved my stay! I‚Äôm a student in my clinical year and it was perfect place to study when not in clinic. I had no issues and Dan & Lane were super nice and accommodating! I would highly recommend this place if staying in the area. It‚Äôs about a 25 minute drive to Martin where there is plenty of places to eat!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Felt extremely fortunate to find Dale and Lane's place which was perfect for us being between Humboldt and Greenfield. We have family and friends in both places and on this trip some business to tend to in Humboldt as well. While out and about, we ran into Dan and Lane in a restaurant and got to have a friendly visit while eating dinner. Even with our business concluded on this trip we plan to to visit perhaps in the spring - it will be so lovely and feel like we've come HOME to TN again. Thank you Dan and Lane!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Stay was great. It's so much better than a hotel. Great kitchen and spacious. It makes a week of work fly by. So quiet and star gazing opportunity beats city living. I hope work has me in the area again soon.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is an absolute gem. AMAZING!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The farmhouse was quiet and in a great location.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful rural location was a great place to breathe fresh country air and listen to summer sounds. Cooking in the well stocked kitchen while looking out the sink window was relaxing. The wooden floors throughout add charming warmth. The king sized bed was comfortable. The full sized washer and dryer were clean and well functioning. A well organized notebook contained answers to almost any question you might have from WIFI passwords to operational manuals for all appliances to items of local interest and local history. The whole property was clean and well cared for both inside and out. The vast display of stars at night kept you staring up long into the night. Dan and Lane are excellent hosts and their property is a real treasure. I hope there‚Äôs an opening the next time we come through western TN, because we will want to stay there again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I worked remotely and a week here and enjoyed everything!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous stay at Dan and Lane‚Äôs. It was very comfortable and worked out super well for us as we visited family. The house has a lot of character and is very comfortable. We felt like Dan and Lane were very friendly and welcoming, and the location was peaceful. We‚Äôd definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Nice clean place that was what we needed for a working vacation.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the most serene places I have ever stayed. I would have never thought that I could find a place like this to stay in such a humble community as Braford Tennessee, but wonders never cease. I definitely am looking forward to visiting my family and staying in this wonderful little place again. It was so refreshing sitting on the porch listening to the many birds singing and watching the rabbits chase each other around the yard. Dan was so accommodating and gracious. He went out of his way to make us feel at home. The place had everything you could possibly need and then some."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We so very much enjoyed staying there! The stay happened when we were visiting children and a grandson in a nearby town but the airbnb there was booked. Turns out we very much preferred staying 20 minutes away in Dan and Lane's house in the country. The kitchen is equipped the best I‚Äôve seen in an airbnb. The house is spacious and decor is modern a nd updated. Loved the wood flooring, the bathrooms, the breakfast table, the comfortable TV chairs in the living room, the bar where we put the computer and were able to carry on with stuff waiting for us to do once we got home. Will gladly stay there again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We normally stay at a hotel when we visit. We are so happy we discovered this airbnb. It was quiet, cozy, and the bed was very comfortable. And it was conveniently located to my family. We will definitely be back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was my second stay, absolutely love the house and quiet surroundings!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have lost count of the times that I have stayed at this beautiful property but it never disappoints! It was perfect in every way. The hosts are beyond accommodating and you absolutely want for nothing here! I will come back again and again! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Nice and peaceful. Hope to be back next spring if work takes me there!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Only thing I can think of that would be helpful is a couple of power strips in the living room area for computer and such would be helpful as plugs are limited, have them in bedrooms next to beds but one by the desk would be great!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice cozy place in the country, we had a great time!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Dan and Lane were absolutely amazing hosts! Their cabin has everything you need for a long or short term stay and is very spacious. I stayed for almost 3 months for my school rotations and had a great stay. The location is remote, quiet, and safe. Dan and Lane checked in frequently and made our stay a comfortable one. I would definitely recommend this place over and over!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Not only is this house gorgeous, Dan and Lane make it feel like home. They were always so kind and accommodating, and always made sure to check in. This was a wonderful stay, beautiful property. With neighbors being far away and behind lots of trees, this property allows much needed privacy to just enjoy the gorgeous land surrounding. Definitely recommend this stay, wish I could have stayed longer myself!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this B & B! It was very relaxing and very unique. It was hard to get my phone to work in this area of Tennessee but everything else was perfect!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place feels like home! I love coming here. I will be back again soon. Dan and Lane make sure that you want for nothing. There is coffee and flavored creamer for the morning. Fancy water in the refrigerator with a few other staples you may have forgotten. The washer and dryer are a huge bonus with detergent and fabric softener. There are extra toothbrushes too.
The land that this house is built on is lush and beautiful! There is an amazing patio to hang and grill out some burgers if you want. I miss it already!! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for your thoughtfulness.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great place to spend a week, fantastic accommodations remote yet close enough to convenience !"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My stay in Bradford was full of fun twist and turns that we‚Äôre made into great memories. I stayed there as a student for 12 weeks while on a rotation for school in Martin, which is about 30 min away. Bradford is small, but you are 45min from Jackson and 30 minutes from a great winery in Humbolt. You are also only 10 min from Greenfield which has some super cute local restaurants. Living alone in this cabin I felt extremely safe and enjoyed the beauty and peace and quiet of the West Tennessee country life. The cabin has a wide variety of cooking tools, spices, and pretty much everything you need for a stay. Dan and Lane are close if you need anything and they are great about responding. They made sure I was always taken care of. If I needed anything at all they were always there to help. I would recommend this place for a student or even just a weekend escape to the country side."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Terrific place! Just as advertised and then some. Owners are attentive but far from intrusive. Charming older farmhouse with modern amenities. Peaceful, quiet area. Everything you need for a great getaway!"
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice clean place. Would stay again
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My wife and I needed to live in the area for several months due to schooling. Dan and Lane were amazing hosts and their farmhouse was exactly what we needed for the trip! The farmhouse is situated in a quiet part of the countryside and has a large porch with a beautiful backyard. The area feels safe and the surrounding outdoors are very peaceful! The farmhouse itself was the perfect size and Dan and Lane have it stocked to the gills with amenities. The internet works great if you need it for school or work! Dan and Lane are extremely fast to respond to any needs or questions you might have! Driving to Milan, TN was a fun and daily adventure for us (about 15 minutes away) where there is a beautiful park, a Walmart, and some great food options. I can‚Äôt recommend this Air BnB location enough! If you book with Dan and Lane you will NOT regret it!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Amazing place to stay! Plenty of privacy and very accommodating!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice place
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house! Very clean and in a quiet area
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay here! The house is perfect! Dan and Lane were tremendous hosts. They left a nice bottle of wine and card for me upon arrival. The refrigerator was stocked with waters and sodas. They had coffee, cream, spices, dishes, bath products, even extra toothbrushes, to name a few! Seriously, these guys are amazing! The property is beautiful!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Dan and Lane are great and helpful hosts. They‚Äôve provided just about everything you would need for long trips. The place is clean and well maintained
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Dan and Lane‚Äôs place is a great space to stay for a short or long term stay. The two bedrooms are spacious, as is the living room and kitchen. The kitchen is fully stocked from your regular appliances, cutlery, pots and pans, to a crockpot. I stayed by myself for 6 weeks while in the area for school. Dan and Lane were extremely nice and very attentive. They checked in on me and made sure I was doing well and that I was never in need of anything. They live near by and if you ever need them to come by to check on something, they are able to do so quickly. Great place, great hosts. If I am ever in the area again, would stay here."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay when visiting Bradford and surrounding areas.
We visit family in Gibson and will stay
Again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan & Lane place offers a peaceful respite for uneasy times. Quiet mornings or early evenings spent on the back porch listening to the birds chirp and the bugs hum are the very definition of Tennessee tranquility. They have gone to great lengths to provide southern hospitality, with many thoughtful touches throughout their cozy home - especially in the kitchen with more than the basic essentials like oil, pans, spices, etc."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dan and Lane's place was great and was exactly as described and as pictured. It is very spacious and has everything you could possibly need for your getaway. The kitchen is fully stocked with cookware and utensils, including an electric skillet, and there is a propane grill for your cookouts. The bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable, and the wi-fi worked perfectly for my remote work during our stay, as well as to stream some TV shows at night. Dan and Lane are wonderful hosts; they are extremely kind, welcoming and hospitable. They graciously agreed to let us check in early after we drove overnight. They also allowed us to use the above-ground pool on their property, which our 22-month-old daughter loved. They were also very quick to answer any questions or assist with any issues, and they were kind enough to sit and have a conversation with us. Dan and Lane have thought of every detail in their house, including k-cups for the Keurig, bottles of water in the fridge upon our arrival, and extra toothbrushes and toothpaste should you forget yours.
The location, while rural and somewhat remote, is within easy driving distance of a couple of different Wal-Marts, and Jackson, TN, is only about 40 minutes away and has most of the major stores and fast food restaurants. The location was also very much a plus for us, as we were looking to get away from the hustle and bustle and enjoy some peace and quiet. The area around the house is very quiet, and when we went out on the deck at night, all we could hear were the crickets.
I honestly can't recommend Dan and Lane's place enough, whether you are just looking for a quiet, socially distanced getaway during COVID or looking for a place to stay for work, you really can't go wrong. We are already planning our return visit."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Dan and Lane were so accommodating and checked in with me to make sure all was good. I stayed for an extended time period and they made it feel like a home away from home. The house was stocked with anything you could think of.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Is exactly what title says spacious house in the country. Nice,clean, great home feeling."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were very nice and made us feel very welcome. The place was clean and well supplied with kitchen staples. A nice quiet getaway in the country.

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super nice house! Sparkling clean. Everything you would need to feel right at home. We loved it!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful stay.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was very spacious. Everyone was impressed. I got to meet the owner, very kind. Accommodated an hour late checkout. Checked on me regularly. Outside woods was peaceful."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is fantastic! Quiet and located within a 20 minute drive to Martin Tn. Great hosts and spotless place. We will definitely stay there again.
2019-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is exactly as shown in the picture. The cabin is very clean and has everything you need for overnight stay. The internet through Verizon doesn‚Äôt really work well enough to stream anything so if there is something you don‚Äôt want to miss be aware. The setting is very quiet with nice outside deck space as well.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place!!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Plenty of space in cozy decorated farm house with beautiful yard and privacy. Full of amenities! Great communication and hospitality. Would totally recommend to anyone staying in the area!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful old farmhouse! It has plenty of room and offers peaceful nights on the deck! There are tons of really neat design features and plenty of amenities to make you comfortable. The bed was super comfy and the kitchen was stocked well enough for me to make zucchini bread and dinner for our family to gather for game night! This is a great place and you will be glad you visited. The hosts are quick to respond and super helpful!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A bit tucked away in the country for some peace and quiet and relaxation. The house was very beautiful and Open and out can tell alit if thought went into it. When you are setting outside you can see lots of stars and the sounds of country living.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Beautiful old home in a very quiet location! Dan and Lane were wonderful hosts who respected our privacy! Will definitely be returning the next time we are in the area!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is set in the quiet countryside. They all the amenities of being in your home & were great hosts!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wonderful host! Dan met with us on arrival and showed us around. He checked in occasionally to make sure everything was ok or if we needed anything. Very clean house with everything you need. We enjoyed sittin on the porch in the evenings.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great little cozy, secluded, quiet, clean place to stay! Dan was absolutely amazing during the booking and the stay. Highly recommended if you are in the Bradford area!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Dan was a great Host. Everything was as advertised. Dan was very responsive when we had questions and did not disturb us. We had a wonderful stay and all of our needs were met. The place is in a quiet area with lots of beautiful trees around. The host was there to welcome us and show us around the place when we arrived, making check-in a breeze. Definitely recommend this home! It was perfect."
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan is an amazing host. I had to arrange a visit in Bradford from Phoenix AZ within a couple hours for less than ideal reasons. Dan was on top of it making sure we had everything we possibly could need for our arrival. His farm house was perfect. All the amenities that we needed for a week long stay and checked in with us through the week to make sure everything was just right.
Thanks Dan for helping us out and making sure our stay was the best it could be. - David & Diana"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was beyond beautiful, the pictures didn‚Äôt do it justice! He also stocked us up with a variety of beverages as well as continental breakfast items which was greatly appreciated! The grill and all the appliances were a very nice luxury to have as well! Overall it is such an amazing home and Dan was very thorough in making sure we had everything we needed. Hoping to go back again for another secluded getaway!"
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Dan was an attentive and friendly host. Everything was as listed.
2017-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan was a good communicator and made the check-in process easy.
However, the sleeping arrangements should have been more accurately described -- if you're a couple sharing a bed, it's fine, but the second bed is virtually a cot and not appropriate or comfortable for another adult. Also, there was a distinct, prevalent sewer smell that did not dissipate by opening windows. The two guests were both licensed plumbers and knew what needed to be done to remedy the problem, but the only advice forthcoming was to open the windows. We felt that the photos and description were misleading. Dan agreed to alter them after I brought them to his attention. We would not return."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect for our stay.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The house was as pictured, if not even cuter in person. Fridge was even stocked with some essentials. Beds are very comfortable. Just a heads up.. We have t-mobile and barely had signal and there is no wifi. We knew it was a secluded area but it's still well worth staying here. About 20 min to Martin, easy drive, but cops on every street so watch for the fluctuations in speed limits they all over the place. Dan and Lane are amazing hosts!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would highly recommend this very clean cute charming house. Perfect for UTM visitors. The owner Dan was very attentive. Making sure I was comfortable and had every thing I needed.
2017-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a good place if you are visiting your child at UT Martin. Was an easy 30 min. drive and much less than a hotel. Dan was very attentive and checked in on us. Thank you
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After a really bad experience with Airbnb, we are absolutely blown away by Dan and his home. My reservation was originally for his guest home next door but since there is a long-term guest staying there he kindly offered to host us at his home. Upon checking in, Dan showed us around his house which is gorgeous and has a wrap-around veranda. In the morning, we enjoyed our coffee and watched the hummingbirds on the porch. Dan even made us breakfast on the last morning of our stay. If you are ever in the Bradford area, you should definitely stay here."
2024-06-01,4.0,Group trip,This place was super cute!. Be aware the stairs are a bit steep (not an issue for us as we are pretty active but would have been difficult for our grandmother). Loved having the floor fans since there weren‚Äôt ceiling fans. Overall really loved it and would stay here again if we come back to town.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Stephanie was very responsive after we loss power during a severe weather event. My family enjoyed the uniqueness of the A frame home.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful property and a very peaceful country location. Basic kitchen supplies were provided though you will want to bring additional supplies such as cooking oil, cooking spray or spices beyond salt and pepper. We wish we had not been there while it was raining so that we could enjoy the lovely fire pit and swings in the backyard! This was a business trip which had to be rescheduled multiple times over many months. Shannon was very gracious and flexible when we would need to reschedule. The road to the property is narrow and curvy, so go slow! But it is well worth the experience. We highly recommend this host and their properties"

Although we didn't use the screened-in porch, it would provide plenty of seating for a large group to hang out.
A nice Chrstimas tree and a few decorations were present to remind us of the upcoming Christmas holiday.
We look forward to another adventure next year. Father, sons and friends trip to the MO Bootheel."

The mattresses weren't great, but they sufficed. There was a covered parking space; a big, well-equipped kitchen; a comfortable eating area; and a spacious living room. There were laundry facilities available, and there was a deck for summertime use. The decor was very 'thematic' (LOL): perfect for avid hunters and fishermen. We have no complaints at all about our stay, and appreciated Joseph's courtesy and quick answers to our questions.

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"There were pros and cons to our stay- pros were house was super clean and very tidy. The backyard had amazing sunset views. The master bed was firm and comfortable. We did not use the other bedrooms. Kitchen had plenty of room to cook and plenty of plates,glasses,and silverware. Having the washer and dryer was a huge plus!
Cons- 2 neighbors had very loud vehicles which they started quite frequently during our stay. The front of the house is right at the road (master bedroom and living room side) so if ur a light sleeper this could be an issue. Both showers had mold coming out of the surround walls where the seam meets the tub. The shower floor in the main bathroom was super soft and squishy. The pillows in the master bedroom are thin,and stained. I am not sure the owners are aware of these things,but if they were addressed this would be a super great place to stay. I still gave 4 stars bcuz it so cosmetically clean!"

Two points to the potential guest - there is no door on the bedroom, and the door to the bathroom (sliding) doesn't totally cover the opening. My kids would yell, ""I'm going to the bathroom, no one go to the hallway"" to make sure they had privacy."

We‚Äôre from Massachusetts but all of our relatives were with the army of Tennessee and we spent the week exploring the battlefields that my ancestors fought on. There are a number of old family cemeteries that I visited in this area, and this was the perfect location for my adventures. When we weren‚Äôt out exploring, we enjoyed driving around the farm in the golf cart, this was a huge hit with my daughter!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miss Martha‚Äôs is one of the best supplied Airbnb‚Äôs I have stayed in. Communication was great and everything was very comfortable. A peaceful stay on a farm with many amenities might be just what you need!

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ms. Martha‚Äôs house in the country was a perfect place for us to stay to visit with family in the area. Being in the country was so relaxing and beautiful. We especially enjoyed the fishing pond, the long country roads, the sound of crickets, bright starlit nights, and a cozy home filled with things that reminded us of our own Mama."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jan and Bill maintained excellent communication from the time the property was booked until checkout. The property was clean and just as described!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love staying here. Our home away from home!
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This was more cost effective for our family of six than renting two hotel rooms close to Discovery Park. It‚Äôs a good 20-30 minutes away but it was beautiful countryside to see.
The house is like stepping back into a time warp and the golf cart made this such a fun place for our kids (and husband). Bring bug spray!
Pros: communication with Jan via text was easy and quick, full kitchen to cook breakfast, stocked bathrooms, welcome info book was very helpful and thorough, washer/dryer worked well and came with detergent, one of the fuses blew after I tried to blow dry my hair but Bill came over and fixed it quickly, kids enjoyed the swing outside
Cons: one bedroom for our kids felt very far away from the master and it was on the front of the house so we double checked the front door was bolted, recommend white noise or a fan because there was a rhythmic thumping sound at night (might have been nuts hitting the roof but it sounded more like pipes to me), had trouble streaming Netflix on the tv but got Disney Plus to work - it is nice to unplug but an option to watch a movie at night is what we needed after a full day, maybe add DVD player? Like all old houses, lighting was dim.
Definitely plan for 2 days at Discovery Park and check out the drive thru Safari while you‚Äôre near! Central location and good place to stay for a quick visit."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very nice cozy place. We would love to return when back in the area
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,friendly and personable. great place and good price. plenty of room for your family
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a hidden gem! Miss Martha‚Äôs was the perfect place for our Labor Day get away. We enjoyed taking the golf cart out to explore. My grandson had fun hunting for the hidden garden gnomes around the property. I enjoyed trail running through the corn fields and forest trails. The house is spacious, warm and inviting. It has everything you need in a home away from home. Ms. Jan is precious and brought us a sweet gift to remember our trip by. Communication was quick and easy. We will be back soon to this special place! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Jan & Bills! We actually ended up forfeiting the activities we had planned for when we were there and just explored the property, fished and relaxed. Our kids loved exploring , finding new creatures, fishing and riding the golf carts. It was actually just what our family needed after having a wild and crazy year.
If you like quiet, great hospitality and the out doors stay at Miss Martha‚Äôs."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miss. Martha‚Äôs home is so nice! Its nostalgic atmosphere and design reminds us so much of our grandparent‚Äôs house and brings back many great memories! While the home is older and hearkens back to yesteryear, it is none the less equipped with all the modern conveniences and niceties. We were immediately struck by the quietness, peacefulness and serenity of the property‚Ä¶we immediately felt at home. When not indoors, the patio offers a very nice place to sit out and visit, while enjoying the outdoors and listening to all the sounds of nature. We also enjoyed the gnome trail while out riding the golf cart, which was a fun and interesting touch to enjoy while touring the property. Additionally, we picked a few of the pears off the tree to eat right there, while sitting on the bench by the pond‚Ä¶wow, talk about being inundated by childhood memories!
Even though we only live about 2.5 hours away, this little piece of Heaven is a world of difference!
Thanks Jan and Bill! You guys are great hosts!

We loved that our family of 5 had plenty of space to stretch out, but also plenty of room to be together as well. My girls adored the swing in the back and my son loved driving the golf cart. My husband and I loved that it was a working farm! The property is beyond belief! It is absolutely beautiful. it is close enough to various towns, if you need anything. There were plenty of towels and plenty amenities. We didn't need to ask for anything, because it was already there and labeled. We hope to return soon to see family again, and when we do we want to stay at Miss Martha's again."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bill‚Äôs. It was close enough to attractions, yet far enough away from it all.
Morning rides on the golf cart with coffee was just like being at home! Our daughter and her friend loved LuLu and had plenty of space to explore inside and outdoors.
What a quaint, beautiful home.
Wish we could have stayed longer and grilled out dinner together.

Now, Bill, he was absolutely amazing! He gave us great welcome. He helped us fishing and getting the Golf cart going.
This was just the beginning of the great experience we had have.
Kids loved the house that offered endless possibilities to hide and play at. There was ample amount of space to accommodate another whole family. We are 2+3.

We counted deer and doves around the farm each trip out and back. The location was good because we were far enough out to be country, but near town with everything we might need. Jan was there to answer all questions and make sure we were set. This was my first Air BnB and I'm looking like a genius with my buddies..."

2018-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Miss Martha's is so much larger than the pictures show. Once you walk in the door you feel right at home. Jan and Bill are available should you need anything, but they try to make sure all you need is there. Water is in the refrigerator, popcorn, games and cards. The beds are very comfortable and clean. There were 5 of us girlfriends that stayed and we didn't think twice about wondering if the bed linens were clean as you do in a hotel. They have a beautiful pond, barn and flowers out back. If you are looking for a great place to stay in the country at a great value, Miss Martha's is it. Oh and we loved all the pictures on the walls!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was an awesome place to unplug and get away from it all. We were visiting friends outside of Jackson and were looking for an inexpensive place to sleep at night. The property and hosts were so nice, that we spent most of our visit there. It was awesome playing the games with the kids, and they had a great time playing outside. The barn made for some wonderful pictures. It was definitely a trip to remember. Jan and Bill are very hospitable. We really enjoyed our stay."

Most importantly it felt like a home. Nicest people you'll meet. Thanks!
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to get away, enjoy some beautiful Tennessee scenery and meet a couple of kind, extraordinary hosts -- then this could be the place for you. Miss Martha's is off-the-beaten-path, but it is an easy drive on paved roads. Miss Martha's is so very comfortable and I immediately felt at home.
The hosts are extremely thoughtful & very attentive to the small details. Miss Martha's is well-stocked with coffee, bottled water & wonderful English muffins for breakfast. The home was extremely clean and ready for my arrival.
Regular communications were initiated by the hosts prior to arrival to assist in my travels and locating the home. Check-in information and assistance was provided ahead of time to accommodate easy access/check-in.
Jan, Bill & Lulu (their sweet Corgie) stopped by to welcome me to Miss Martha's and assure that I had everything needed. I shared with them that I was in the area to work on some of my family genealogy research. They were able to provide information, stories and resource suggestions. We figured out that we share some family-lines (through marriage). As a genealogist -- this was so very exciting and a highlight of my time in Tennessee.
Miss Martha's is a perfect place to find peace, rest, and quiet time. You can hear the wind blow and the many voices of the small birds that sing. There is no wi-fi, but phone service was strong (I have AT&T) -- if you have a need to connect.
At Miss Martha's you will definitely meet new friends -- and who knows -- maybe you'll even find a new family connection like me.
I highly recommend this wonderful home. I do hope to return and stay longer!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing place and such sweet hosts! We celebrated our son's 11th bday at Miss Martha's and Discovery Park over 4 days and could not have picked a better place! The rolling hills of wheat and corn along with the gorgeous fishing pond, various trees, and barn were breath taking. We took a nightly ride on the golf cart across the property and caught 10 nice size fish (bass and blue gill...we threw back). The house is so cozy...love the sunroom and all the nostalgic decorations. So much love put into this home. We saw deer, rabbits, hummingbirds...even from the back porch one morning! We enjoyed the coloring books, games and piano...I was able to dust off my old piano skills and teach the kids some songs. Just a perfect place to unwind and reconnect with family and nature. We came for Discovery Park, but the sweetest memories were from Miss Martha's. Jan and Bill are fabulous...Jan even made a cookie cake for our son's bday! And there was snacks and water too. We can't wait to return!"

2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Miss Martha's exceeded our expectations on every level. We enjoyed getting away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

The house was very spacious. You could tell right away that that it's decor and upkeep was a labor of love. The beds and linens were very comfortable. We brought our children with and they didn't want to leave!
Bill and Jan were awesome hosts. They live just North of the property. They were very kind, gracious, and accommodating. Jan did a great job communicating before and after our trip. We'll definitely be back!"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miss Martha's is the perfect place to enjoy life at a slower pace. The house is beautiful with lot's of personal touches and quirky antiques. It is located away from everything urban which gives it a perfect country charm. If you are looking to get away from the world for a few days this is the place! For those who need a bit of the ""city life,"" you are less than an hour from Union City, Dyersburg, and Jackson where you can enjoy restaurants, shopping, and even some tourist destinations (Discovery Park of America, Reelfoot Lake, and others). Jan is also a super hostess who is intent on making sure you enjoy a comfortable stay!"

,,,"The house is adorable and decoreated very cute but the moment I walked in, I could smell mold. I didnt get much sleep because the smell was that bad to me....I hate to give a bad review but I think others should know, because its not healthy to breath mold...
Its a shame because it is such a cute adorable house, but I could never stay there again due to the unhealthy environment. Im not sure if these types of rentals are inspected but they sure need to be before they are allowed to be rented."
