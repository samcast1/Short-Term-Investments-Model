It's always a huge perk when you're traveling to be able to pull up right next to your front door for quick easy access to all your belongings.
The space is very clean and Chelsea really puts her heart into her Airbnb with extremely thoughtful amenities. I was even stoked to find an air filter as the tree pollen can get intense in Chico! The bed was extremely plush and comfortable.
The home is in very close proximity to several parks. Two blocks east is the Community Park with areas open to off leash dogs at certain hours. A quick walk north is Bidwell park and the swimming pool, along the way you'll pass a local favorite coffee shop.
Next time I'm traveling through Chico I will definitely keep an eye out for Chelsea's spot to be available. Even my elderly dog felt right at home."

SO much better than a hotel and the price was exceptional. The neighborhood was a little wonky, but I did feel safe. Cafe close by called Has Beans that looked darling but Chelsea had an awesome coffee set up!
Very cute place-loved the decor, fully equipped kitchen (I cooked), great coffee set up, comfy bed and pillows. It was raining all weekend so couldn't use the backyard, but it was spacious and private.

The decor had the cutest theme with cozy linens and pillows. The kitchen was the most well-stocked I've seen at an airbnb. It was really thoughtful having small snacks available. There were various office supplies, games, bathroom supplies, brand new towels, pet supplies (we did not have a pet) and more. You name it, it's probably somewhere. Chelsea has an eye for decorating and was friendly and helpful in all our interactions. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of good lighting and seating options. I would stay here again without hesitation. You would need a car as it's hidden in a small work-a-day neighborhood. Thank you for for a delightful stay!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chelsea was a wonderful host! We arrived in Chico at the beginning of an awful wind storm, within 5 minutes of getting there, the power went out. It was only out for a minute but Chelsea was quick to respond and let us know where to find flashlights, candles and lighters if the power went out again. Thankfully it did not.
The home was very clean and attention to detail was not missed. There is everything you need for a home away from home! The bed and bedding is very comfortable and smells so good.
If I had to pick something for improvement, it would just be brighter front porch light. I think there was a solar lantern but when there is no sun, it doesn‚Äôt get very bright or light up at all. It didn‚Äôt bother us much but wanted to make sure to leave an all around review.
Thanks for the great stay Chelsea!"

Chelsea was very nice and responsive to any questions. I will return here every time I visit my daughter."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stephanie and Hobie's home was an excellent choice for our stay over CSU Chico's graduation weekend. It was spotlessly clean, well equipped, and convenient to the college. The beds were quite comfortable, and the spaces worked well for our party of four. They also generously extended our check out to 1 pm, so we had time to come back to the rental to organize our exit after the graduation ceremony. We definitely recommended their home to prospective renters."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent the weekend at this adorable place and it was great! It had everything we needed and more.

The beds were comfy and the kitchen was well equipped. Lastly, their informational binder was very detailed and super helpful. I would definitely recommend this place for your future stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am Chico from the Bay Area quite often to care for and visit a family member and have stayed in so many Airbnb I‚Äôve lost track. I have my favorites and after spending only one night here, I‚Äôm happy to say I have added another one to my list!
The house was absolutely spotless, beautifully decorated, and had all the comforts that we needed. We weren‚Äôt there with much downtime other than to sleep, but the beds were each comfortable and we had all the linens that we needed. I would most definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband & I travel often for both leisure & business. With the addition of our tiny human, we wanted to phase out hotel stays in favor of a more suitable toddler space-- our stay at the Bungalow, hosted by Stephanie & Hobie was a great debut into the airbnb world. Super cute space, exactly as photographed & described, incredibly responsive host, lovely space, beautiful area. Zero complaints."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Stephanie and Hobie‚Äôs bungalow was just as described. It was in a great location - close to downtown and Bidwell park. The hosts were very responsive to our questions. The house was clean and had all the amenities you need. Fall is a great time of year to visit with all the beautiful and colorful trees. Our visit was short but we really enjoyed our time.

The location is close enough to quickly drive over to downtown, but far enough away to be quiet and peaceful, which allowed for a great nights sleep. They were super responsive and easy to get a hold of if we needed anything during our stay. Would definitely stay again when I‚Äôm back in the area!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place in a quiet neighborhood in Chico. Sleep quality is really important to us and the beds were super comfortable, the sheets really soft, and the pillows just right. Also, they are on a very quiet street. So bonus points for sleep quality!
The bathroom is spacious and the water pressure in the shower is fantastic. We didn‚Äôt use the kitchen much, but appreciated the cold Brita pitcher of water in the refrigerator for us when we got there.
Finally the two days we were there the temperature reached over 108 degrees on each day and the AC was a life saver!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was visiting family in Chico with my husband and seven year old daughter, and spent four nights at the Bungalow. It was perfect for our needs. It features a full kitchen with dishes/utensils for those who need to cook for picky eaters. The wide-screen TV features a ton of streaming options, but for those who are more old school, there is also a large collection of traditional board games. For those planning a more extended stay, it should be noted that there is no access to laundry facilities, but for us it was perfect. The Bungalow is located on a quiet street, yet still close to downtown. It's very close to Starbucks and Big Al's Burgers (a Chico institution!). Before moving out of state, I lived in the avenues for several years, so it was really cool being back in my old neighborhood for a while. Thank you Stephanie and Hobie for a great stay! We will definitely keep the Bungalow in mind for our next family trip to Chico!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place in the Avenues. Small and quaint, it was perfect for us.

Great place for couples visiting students at Chico state, or in our case visiting family from out of town. Would highly recommend staying here!"

Perfectly clean and tidy  The neighborhood is really quiet and still easily walkable to downtown Chico, restaurants, and tea/coffee. After a day, it really felt like we were ""returning home"" each time we got back to the house. Check-in and check-out were really easy. We'll definitely rebook next time we are in Chico."

The house was the perfect size for 2 adults plus one young adult child of ours to hang out while we were in town visiting.

This sweet Bungalow has been our cozy home away from home, each time we come to Chico (for at least 2 weeks at a time!) The Hosts always go above and beyond; the best ever! They knew we were flying in from Hawaii, so had the cutest little Christmas tree with Hawaiian themed ornaments, set up for us upon our arrival! They're always thoughtful, quick to respond, and ensure our stays are comfortable. Perfect location for any temp. health workers since Enloe hospital is within walking distance. The Bungalow is also an easy short drive to downtown Chico's shops, restaurants, grocery stores, and year-round Farmer's Market.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A clean, charming, quiet, residence. Loved staying there. Even though located near a major road it was mostly quiet. It was a convenient walk to Dutch Brothers or Starbucks which I appreciated in the mornings when family members were sleeping in the morning. The neighborhood itself feels safe and I would see dog walkers about but not too much activity when I was out.
We had no special needs from the hosts. The hosts had sent us a message that work was being done in a unit that was behind us but we were not inconvenienced or disturbed at all."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at ""The Bungalow"" which is very conveniently located near CSU-Chico and the downtown. We have visited Chico many times over the last 3-4 years to visit our daughter during the school year. This was by far the best AirBnB and location we have stayed at. We walked into a spotless, updated, tasteful house where we could spread out comfortably. We like to make our own breakfasts and occasionally lunch; the kitchen had everything we needed. Stephanie & Hobie left us a detailed manual on everything in the house and all the light switches were labelled to keep us from guessing. We arrived a few minutes early and Stephanie accommodated us quickly and cordially. We couldn't have been more comfortable and pleased with a visit."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures and the description tell a true story! This is an old Chico Charmer that has been brought back to life with plenty of ""sweat equity"" by the owners. We stayed there while my husband was a patient at Enloe Hospital and my step daughter and I felt safe and comfortable
The kitchen is VERY well stocked, the house is quiet, in an old family neighborhood , and I did not feel at all unsafe as I walked my mile in the neighborhood daily. Comfy beds, good sheets, excellent shower, pleasant and peaceful front porch, as well as the back yard, easy entry access, great old squeaky hard wood floors, all in all a pleasant stay considering the reason for it. I will stay here again."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you know anything about Chico, you know that neighborhoods really vary. Let me tell you: this is a darling house in a wonderful, safe part of town. It is across the street from Enloe Hospital and walking distance to campus. The home itself is clean and the hosts have outdone themselves with small touches. You cannot beat a better location. The best part of the experience though was the host. Hobie and Stephanie reply right away to messages and go out of their way to make sure everything is perfect. I really enjoyed talking to them and appreciate everything they did to make it such a great trip. I highly recommend this house & the hosts. We would love to return & would highly recommend to others. Hobie & Stephanie are local realtors who really understand the community & area. They are a wealth of knowledge. New to the area visitors & old alum alike will enjoy staying at their home. This has been the best air bnb experience we have had to date!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This little bungalow is very welcoming and cozy. They had lots of extra little things that made our stay special. We were visiting our college student and she loves a take and bake pizza from our hometown. We forgot to bring a pizza cutter, but they had one! We used a fold up table that they had for an intense game of Monopoly (we brought out own game board, but they had one too.) It was just like hanging out at home. We had a great stay!"

The bungalow has been tastefully updated, has convenient amenities and thoughtful touches, (a fresh dish sponge ‚Äî little things like that make a big impact; nothing‚Äôs worse than getting a raggedy, used, musty sponge!). The bathroom sink/vanity was beautiful, as was the kitchen. While we didn‚Äôt get a chance to partake in them, there were lots of games available in the hall shelving; great for longer stays! We accidentally left our nightlight/emergency charger at the house, and when I informed Stephanie as soon as we noticed, she confirmed and was so kind to hold onto it until we could stop back on our way home from our road trip.

2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Overall we enjoyed the stay. It was clean, and suited our needs. I only have 1 qualm. My fianc√© and I came in on a motorcycle and had planned to basically leave the bike at the air bnb and Uber around Chico to be safe. Being in an area neither of us have been too, she told us to park on the street, would‚Äôve been totally okay if we had come in a car. We asked if we could park under a tree near by just so our motorcycle wasn‚Äôt clear as day parked out where it could be stolen while we were out, we understood that it may not be something the home owner wanted so at the end of our question about parking under the tree more hidden we said ‚Äúif not that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù Instead of responding with a simple yes/no or literally anything, the host simply just read it and didn‚Äôt reply. At check out the host requested to be informed of checking out early. We did that and again never got a response. Aside from the communication, everything else was great. We‚Äôd stay again but w/ a car for obvious reasons. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved cooling off in the pool as it was particularly hot. It was very quiet at night and the room was easy to cool. Susan and I had a nice visit because we had similar interests but she was not overbearing. She made us feel at home and offered suggestions of thing to do. Chico has a lot to offer and if we visit again, we'd book here."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great stay, nice bed. Susan is awesome."
2022-10-01,3,Stayed one night,"A perfectly fine place with good instructions for entry. But I would say somewhat poorly advertised. ‚ÄòEntire Unit‚Äô is giving it too much credit, as you can hear people in the house through a locked door that is on one end of the bedroom. Basically, it is a very similar experience to staying in a bedroom in a house but for the price of an entire unit. Only one towel upon arrival even though there were two guests marked. Code not provided until requested. Also the demands of an Airbnb guest taking out the trash and tidying up when charging a cleaning fee is completely abnormal nowadays, maybe normal 7 or 8 years ago when cleaning fees weren‚Äôt tacked onto nightly fees."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, comfortable room. Easy access, easy parking."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,A very nice room on a lovely property. It has a great backyard patio with plenty of seating to enjoy whatever weather you are having. Highly recommend.

2022-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice space but our experience was not. Credit where it is due: the shower, is excellent and the pool area is beautiful! There is a very nicely lit pathway through the backyard to the door which was super helpful for late arrivals. The cons were to be expected, this is a room in a house with a private entrance so you have to be quiet. The host also expects you to do a lot of the cleanup (in addition to paying the cleaning fee). These are all well and good, no issues there. Our issue was the host's behavior at checkout. To be fair we were late checking out, we had just gotten out of the shower at 11 and while getting dress the host banged on the door and exclaimed that we needed to leave. (banged not knocked). When we apologized and rushed to get ready she knocked several more times in 10 minutes and complained that she was on her lunch break and needed to turn the space over. This is all understandable and I learned my lesson about late checkout. However, if she truly was on her lunch break it makes sense why you are expected to do most of the cleaning yourself. Because she could not possibly have the time to properly clean and sanitize the space between guests. We apologized profusely and did our best to straighten and clean up but were met with passive aggression and rudeness."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Susan is a fantastic host! Easy to communicate and BOTH of her spaces are clean and comfortable.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's place was perfect for a short term stay. The bed was very comfy and check-in was easy. Susan was very communicative and made me feel very comfortable.

2021-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"This was my first experience with AirBnB. Registration was a mess. I discovered several errors with the web server scripts. These caused delays of 8 hours. NONE of that was Susan's fault. Susan's communication was quick, thoughtful, and considerate. Initially I had a problem with the heater. Susan offered me another room that she had available, and THEN the heater started working. It was probably a programming ""feature"" in the remote. I would use AirBnB again."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"A nice, quiet, and cheerful place with a convenient location near Chico State. Microwave. mini-fridge, keurig-mini, and teapot allow for basic food storage and prep. The suite has a strong shower, wonderful down quilt, K-pods, teabags, and yummy cookies, and though we didn't use the pool, there it is, probably a great pleasure on a hot day. Susan, the host, is most welcoming but not intrusive. We had a chalk welcome sign with my name waiting for us. A nice home away from home for a traveler."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There are detailed instructions, just follow them and you won't have any trouble."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I absolutely love to

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very pleasant and comfortable. Just as advertised.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Susan‚Äôs home was a wonderful retreat in Chico. I only had one night in town which was a bummer because I didn‚Äôt get to enjoy the wonderful pool and backyard gardens. The room was comfortable and clean with a very comfy bed. The place was quiet. Susan was easy to communicate with and timely with her responses. I would definitely come again for a longer stay.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,nice spot
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Susan‚Äôs place is great! Perfect spot to relax in Chico. The pool was great, especially for how hot it is out! Susan was very nice, I‚Äôd recommend!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was my first Airbnb experience. Susan was very accommodating and quick to respond when I had a question. Thank you for a very good first experience
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay. So very clean and comfortable. It was easy to find not to far off the freeway which has easy on/off ramps to Susan's place. Hostess is the greatest and so very friendly.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Susan was great, I had reverted the place for my Dad while he stayed here for a few days. She was very communicative, patient and understanding.
She made my Dad feel right at home and meet his every need."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"They had it all!! I forgot a few things, but the super hosts had thought of everything!! Thank you."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at James & Nickie‚Äôs place. The checkin and checkout process was clear, simple, and quick. The place had everything we needed and our dog really liked the small fenced backyard. There‚Äôs a lot of space for parking our car in front of the house. The neighborhood is pretty quiet and I didn‚Äôt see a lot of traffic at night or in the morning while I was at the place. There are a lot of restaurants and shops that are about 5-10 minutes away. It‚Äôs pretty close to Bidwell park, and about 1.5 hours from Lassen Volcanic NP. James and Nickie were very friendly and responsive. Overall, I‚Äôd recommend this place for people visiting Chico and nearby areas."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The most beautiful cottage! James and Nickie have put so much care into making the cottage a home away from home. Fabulous private patio overlooking a peaceful creek. The fully fenced back yard was a haven for our puppy. We loved our stay and would love to come back. Thank you so much for hosting us.!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The Cottage was the perfect place to stay for a shorter/weekend trip. I was pleasantly surprised to discover The Cottage had its own backyard! I also appreciated the place‚Äôs privacy as well as how close it was to the campus and downtown.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is adorable and just like the photos. The little patio next to the stream was lovely and we had our morning coffee here every day.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great value. Beautiful shared backyard with outdoor table and fire pit. Private backyard overlooking the creek. Good price/performance. Definitely a ""garage turned into a cottage"" feeling for better or worse. Imagine that your uncle remodeled your mom's basement and added a bath conversion -- you're in the right space. I only mention this ""rustic"" nature as there are multiple spots where the floor has a 3"" to 6"" unexpected step. Bed was comfortable but one side is against wall -- perfect for one person but two will feel like they are in an RV. Clean, quiet, solid wifi, and walkable to downtown or breweries. Ample street parking. I would stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a special place. They created this little cottage with care. They should be a super host!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is lovely, peaceful, clean and a short walk to beautiful Chico. We also loved the little coffee shop nearby. We‚Äôd happily stay here again when exploring all that this incredible area has to offer."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nickie & James are ideal AirBnB hosts. Proactive and friendly. Perfect spot for peaceful getaway. Comforts from home including coffee, fridge, snacks, etc. This is the 2nd time I‚Äôve stayed at the Cottage - top 3 AirBnBs ever for beauty, comfort, value, and just making you feel at home. Hope to see you again next year! 5 stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è"

2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The Cottage was a great option for me and my dogs while visiting Chico. The place was very easy to find and the cottage has a great little private backyard overlooking the creek. It's a small space but laid out well. It may not be comfortable for everyone if travelling with a partner as there are only curtains separating the bedroom from bathroom area. If travelling alone or with someone you're comfortable with, it is a fine option. There were plenty of amenities available, especially personal care/toiletry items that not a lot of places make available anymore. Really nice touch.
Reasonably priced and close enough to downtown, while still feeling private and safe. I will definitely look for this place to be an option again when travelling back to Chico."

James and Nickie's place is a mile or so down the road from Sierra Nevada which is why we booked it. We liked the coziness of their little guest home in the back. It's very small, but the photos show that. The air conditioning was great in the Chico humidity. There's also a nice little back area with a stream. Definitely a nice place to stay.

Dan & Shannon Licon"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a sweet, well thought out and cared about small cottage.
The back yard space along the creek makes it magical. Bring your morning drink and sit with Little Chico Creek.
It‚Äôs an enchanting one room space with ‚Äòkitchen‚Äô and bathroom separated by nice curtains. Double bed, comfy sheets and pillows. Close to town and safe. We will return. Thank you."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The host welcomed us with his big smile while he was trying to vacuuming the yard (though it was nice and clean enough)
Easy to drive to downtown.
The bed is a bit smaller for two of us just because we like turning around.
There‚Äôs no door but curtains for bathroom and bedroom.
What I live the most is the creek right next to the yard.
It‚Äôs so considerate that the host got filtered water in the fridge. The fridge can be a little bit loud because it‚Äôs a quite town but if you unplugged it, it‚Äôs fine.
Super nice experience overall!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was a welcome sanctuary for me and my pup (and adult son during the day) over the weekend. The space was clean, comfy/cozy, well designed, had all the amenities that one can be grateful for. We loved the creek and outdoor space for my little pup. The area is also cooler than I thought - good restaurants, coffee shops, and hip locals. I would absolutely book this place again when I‚Äôm in the area. It checked all the boxes. Thanks!"

There isn't a TV so bring a book which was fine with me. I highly recommend."

Plates, mugs, cups, silverware, fridge, coffee supplies and creamer, keurig and microwave. You guys had it all in there! We really appreciated the doggy bags you provided, as well as a place for the pups to relieve themselves in the back of the cottage so we could just open the door in the morning and let them out to do their thing.
Your place balances privacy while sharing an area with others very well. Cottage access was easy, straightforward and felt very secure. I loved how close your place was to downtown too. Very walkable. Would stay here again. 100%. And the recommendation to Stoble was thoroughly enjoyed.
Thanks!
Sam, Jackson and the pups."

Super thoughtful with everything - they provide just about anything you could think of. The BEST part for us, was having a little backyard space for ourselves and an area for our dogs to pee/poop. It was super convenient to let them out to use it without having to put their harness/leash back on. They also provide waste bags for your dogs which is really convenient.
James and Nickie made sure we were okay and we truly enjoyed our stay in their cottage.
The ONLY thing we needed but they didn‚Äôt have was sugar for coffee, but quite honestly it was no big deal. We would 1000% come back."

The space is quite stylish and comfortable. We were pleased by the comfort of the bed, the availability of strong AC, the charging ports, the private space to sit in the backyard. The kitchen was well-stocked. The bathroom, while small, had everything we needed and the shower in particular was spacious and had great water pressure and heat.
Nikole was super helpful and responsive!
These are guest FYIs and not complaints, because we were VERY happy here:
--check the instructions closely! There are two units! Look at the picture to make sure you're at the correct door (red or blue)
--the LED bulb above the table is attached by magnets, and if not working may need to be charged (the charging cable was in the unit). There's a small remote."

And the drive downtown was easy and just about 10 minutes. The space was larger than I thought, and so clean and lots of light due to the many windows. I was so impressed with the extra touches like coffee, tea and snacks, and high quality towels and linens. The bed is so comfortable and the kitchen had all we needed. The area is so quiet which we appreciate. Thanks Katie!!"

My husband and I stayed there with our two daughters (3 and 1 years of age). Katie offered to set up the pullout couch for us but we decided to do it ourselves. It was super easy and very comfortable to sleep in. The neighborhood is beautiful and very peaceful.
We previously lived in Chico so we are familiar with the area but Katie had a binder with some amazing recommendations.
After we checked out Katie informed us that we forgot two of our daughter‚Äôs blankets and was kind enough to allow my friend pick them up.
We highly recommend staying here anytime you are visiting Chico. It is a short drive to Bidwell Park and Chico State (Go Wildcats!)"

The bed was so comfortable, the drive back to San Diego we may have mentioned the great sleep and that comfortable bed at least 100 times. The neighborhood is peaceful, and our place was private and perfect for us. We parked in our designated space, and keeping in mind the neighbor needs to park next to us, we have a large car ,and there was plenty of room to stay within our parking spot.We were centrally close to every place we love, and family who we love. We arrived 15 minutes early, Katie was kind to let us check in a tad early, she is so friendly and warm. We truly appreciate you Katie , and your beautiful home.

Katie gives exact directions on how to get there and where to park, so easy. There is a binder in the cottage with lots of helpful tips. One of which we loved, the Camp Coffee shop is about a mile away, and worth it.

The living space is beautifully decorated and sparkling clean. It is large and open with the kitchen, couch and TV, and bed each in its own area. Being on the second floor added to the bright natural light coming from all the windows. The heater was efficient, even with the cold evening temperatures the space heated up quickly after we were gone all day.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cutest, coziest little place!!! Everything i needed for an impromptu night stay w the pups. The yard dedicated to the unit was very small. Might not due if u have a medium or larger dog but it was fine for the night. The garden on the rest of the property was amazing!!! No tv but the hot tub was an amenity i didn‚Äôt know i needed! Bed was comfy and unit was clean. Chocolate upon arrival was much appreciated after hours of driving. GREAT value!! Would definitely stay again. Thank You!!!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, great amenities. Responsive host. Highly recommend"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect studio for a one night stay with our little dog. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the sheets were super soft. We didn‚Äôt get to use much of the other amenities, but everything is there if you need it. We really appreciated the chocolates left on the table and the big comfortable dog blanket, which my dog chose to sleep on instead of his bed‚Ä¶ Ha, ha ha.
The unit was very clean, which was important as even though we own a dog, my husband is allergic and had no problems in the unit.
The only negative, which has been mentioned in other reviews, is the train noise at night. We had five or six trains come through, which made it harder to sleep through the night.
But all in all this was a great place for us to stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at at this modern & cozy little cottage where we were warmly greeted. The surrounding gardens to the main house and around the cottage were lovely. There are many old growth trees all around the property & there was bird song galore in the morning. It was very pleasant to sit outside on the little patio in the morning. As I am a coffee drinker, I was very impressed with the coffee on hand for us to use - & a grinder - & the choice of a French Press (my chosen brew!) or a drip maker. There was a nice new fridge there for our milk & vino. We did not do any cooking there, but noted that the kitchen was very nicely outfitted. Fab bathroom! Comfy full-sized bed (we are not large people) with extra blankets if needed. If sensitive to noise, note that while not on a busy road, it is adjacent to one, though it is not terribly loud. (I always travel with ear plugs.) I would definitely stay in this charming & pristine cottage again. Thank you, Elizabeth!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Elizabeth's guest cottage was perfect for our needs. Everything was clean, well appointed, and we felt very welcome with our little dog during our stay (even though we arrived late at night around 9pm :)). She even went as far as to have toys and treats there for him to make him feel right at home :) Additionally, we loved all the little touches and accommodations and didn't want for anything. Thank you for everything and we'd recommend Elizabeth's place to anyone."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place to stay, close to all things Chico but tucked away on a quiet street. Everything was beautifully clean and perfect. Towels and linens smelled fresh and countertops were spotless. My only critique was I wish there were more cooking items like a saut√© pan or veggie peeler but we feel we were lucky to get any sort of kitchen at all for this price- just an easy fix. There were ample pots, dishes and silverware and a cute little stove/fridge. Everything looked brand new and newly remodeled. We enjoyed getting to pet the kitties and lounging in the hot tub. Communicative and friendly hosts. We highly, highly recommend!!!!"

2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I loved staying here. The bed and the shower are great. I wish I could have them in my own house. My only complaint is the check in process was not smooth and the code given didn‚Äôt work. I had to have someone come and reset it.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth is a wonderful host who is friendly and helpful in suggesting places to go to. She has a thoroughly prepped binder on all the local eateries and places to check out, as well as helpful information for your stay.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The little guest house was very nice, cute, and clean. The heater could have worked a little better, we were freezing most of our stay but made good use of blankets that were provided. The hot tub hours were pretty limiting so we unfortunately weren't able to use it which is one the main reasons we chose this spot. Overall a very lovely place to stay."

I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a charming stay for even just one day."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay in Chico! Elizabeth's place was cute, clean and had everything I needed.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great little place if you're heading to Chico! Easy to check-in, find, and has everything needed. I was also thrilled to find an open-minded host who welcomes travelers with CATS. We've traveled with our senior kitty for years and this was a good opportunity to take our new, younger cat along and see how she did. Elizabeth had made sure to buy a mat for under the litter box and left out little Churu treats. Plus the goodies for our dog. It was traveling with pets perfection!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Merry Christmas to us! Stayed at Elizabeth‚Äôs while visiting family in Chico and the studio was absolutely perfect.

As others have noted, the shower was amazing and the hot tub was lovely too."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a really nice stay!!! And since my car was full of belongings (since I am moving) , the host gave me exclusive use of the driveway and closed the gate for me.

2023-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Overall my stay was ok. I didn't it find it to be extremely dog friendly. Location wasn't ideal. The dog next door barked.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful accomodations.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was great - it was very welcoming, clean, and comfortable. It has everything I needed stopping by for one night and was easy to check in.

The only thing was my dog wanted to go look for the cats outside so it took a little bit for her to settle in, but that‚Äôs to be expected with my dog!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"There are not enough superlatives to describe Elizabeth‚Äôs gorgeous studio! If you own your own house, you would want it built and decorated like this! It is stunningly done! Though the Check un was not that easy for us, I blame it on our own exhaustion and age. Elizabeth was ready very quickly to rectify the issue for us. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for parent‚Äôs weekend and really liked how close it was to my son‚Äôs apartment! Elizabeth is a very responsive host and her place was even better than the description. It was a cozy place to stay for the weekend and perfectly fit my needs.

Rain shower and star gazing from hottub for the win"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Elizabeth‚Äôs place was perfect for our quick stop in Chico. She was extremely flexible with our check in time as we had to arrive after midnight. There were so many thoughtful touches for us and our pups, like coffee, pup blankets, and pup treats! We‚Äôre actually going to stay at Elizabeth‚Äôs one more time on our way back to southern CA and couldn‚Äôt think of a more ideal location for us. Spotless, peaceful, private, and well-decorated. Thanks for everything Elizabeth! See you soon."

Elizabeth was so thoughtful and brought us bagels for breakfast in the morning. We will definitely stay again next time we come to Chico.
2023-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"Beautiful studio, not set up for seniors. I am in good shape but the bed was low to the floor and furniture as well. Bathroom was outstanding."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth was responsive and nice.
The rainfall shower is cool. The studio is spacious and was stocked with coffee for the duration of my stay. I drink a lot of coffee so that was great.
My only complaint is that the studio was a bit unclean. If that weren‚Äôt so, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good coffee and a kind host."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great and friendly host. Room separate from house, nice hot tub!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"My rating said that Elizabeth's place was hard to get into but I blame the Airbnb company and the instructions sent to me. Only being able to communicate with the host through the company was very tedious but the issue was finally resolved. Elizabeth was very responsive when we finally arrived and made sure we were able to access the place which was a delightful room, and the bathroom was just superior. She also was very quick to respond with concern when a loud local band began to play just at dusk and offered to call the police if it didn't stop soon, which fortunately it did."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Elizabeth's place is beautiful. It's comfortable, stylish, and very clean. It worked out perfectly for me for my overnight stay in Chico."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice stay at Elizabeth's Studio. It is quiet, clean and nicely appointed. The entire space is well-thought-out and attractive. Really nice shower in the bathroom. Air conditioner and ceiling fan kept us quite comfortable in mid-90s ambient temp, even tho aircon was only set down to 80F. If you intend to use the kitchen, it is furnished with basics but don't expect to get too fancy. We had a little difficulty finding it because the search engine behmoth's navigation thought we could turn onto the street from Walnut. That may have been the case at one time, but no longer. Some people mention that the train is loud, but I found it to be much more tolerable than the noise the excursion train in our town makes. All considered, this is a terrific place to stay and a good value to boot."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Elizabeth is so friendly! The space was beautiful and incredibly clean. There is a mini fridge, kitchen sink and mini stove, I would love to stay here again. Amazing value!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Easy check-in and very nice accommodations. Space is like new and the shower was particularly cool.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is one of the best places I‚Äôve seen and stayed in. It is thoughtfully designed and set up with anything you may need for a quick stay during a long road trip. From plates and pots to fresh coffee with a grinder! Also wonderful to find a place that allows dogs and is far from over priced! (I feel it was almost underpriced.) I‚Äôm a vacation rental property manager so I‚Äôve seen a few and this is gem! The backyard is a little oasis, so happy to have this place to come back to!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you love cats this is a great place! Lots of kitties roaming around and three black ones that might let you pet them!
Such a cute little secluded area in Chico! Comfy bed and great bathroom! Only downside is the train tracks are super close and you can clearly hear them, but if you have ear plugs or a sound going it drowns it out!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The casita was very clean and comfortable. Just a few minutes from old downtown Chico with nice restaurants. It was very hot the day we were there but the casita's AC worked great. Peaceful, except there were about 5 trains during the night. The tracks are a couple of blocks away so the train horn woke us up, though we went right back to sleep because the bed was comfortable. The house rules did not mention not leaving a dog alone, but there was an info sheet in the unit that did (just to be aware and plan ahead if doggie can't go along somewhere). The bathroom was great and the kitchen decently equipped. Delicious coffee provided :) We enjoyed our short stay. Briefly met Elizabeth in the morning, very nice. Nice to be able to park the car near the unit. We had a delicious dinner at Red Bar and cooked breakfast in the unit in the morning. We did have our own small fry pan."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a great time. Cute place.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Elizabeth was a kind and generous host. She came over and introduced herself and gave us some of her delicious homemade cookies.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,you will love this little studio!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I stayed here for the holiday weekend. The place was incredibly clean and felt homey. Elizabeth was very kind and even brought us some homemade muffins. Our only complaint was the dog policy, we may have missed it in the house rules prior to booking, but when we got there she had an additional rule printed on a price of paper that stated dogs aren‚Äôt allowed to be left alone in the property. We ended up booking a rover sitter last minute which probably was for the better anyways, we just wish we would have been aware of this rule before. Other than that the stay was flawless. The host was very nice, the place was secure and very clean. I would definitely recommend it for anyone else!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This studio was Adorable‚Ä¶ yes it deserves the capital A! It is well designed and the hosts were friendly, responsive, and super accommodating. My dog enjoyed walking the neighborhood and I enjoyed how peaceful it was in the morning. I appreciated how the guest gets to use the driveway‚Ä¶ so thoughtful.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I spent the night on our way back home to the Seattle area. Elizabeth couldn‚Äôt have been more hospitable. We had been camping for 10 days, so the use of the washer and dryer was great. We ordered food to be delivered and Elizabeth was kind enough to bring it back to the studio. The studio was adorable. The kitchen and bathroom were nicely designed. We were quite comfortable and enjoyed our stay. Note that there is some road and train noise, but it didn‚Äôt bother us, and it was quiet at night when we were sleeping."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Went visit my son at Chico State. Very convenient location close to my son. Really love the bathroom, I had a broken ankle and taking a shower was a breeze while using a knee scooter. The bathroom floor is therapeutic for your feet. Studio set up nicely and very detailed.
Hope to bring my wife next time when we visit our son next.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Delicious coffee and I loved the wet bath! Reminded me of traveling in Japan. I loved that they offered a completely private little side yard space in addition to allowing access to the main yard. It was so cozy!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Elizabeth's studio is a really nice place to stay when visiting Chico. It is clear that a lot of thought and money went into making the space comfortable and classy. The outside was beautiful and inviting with varieties of flowers in bloom. Inside is well designed with colorful cabinetry, contrasting white appliances, and granite counter tops. There is a sleeping area with the bed and nearby sitting area with a comfortable sofa. The studio feels spacious enough for two people to share comfortably. The bathroom is elegant and charming. Also there is plenty of room in your personal driveway for 2 vehicles. I have a full size pick up truck and there was room to spare. I highly recommend staying when."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing host who went above and beyond for us. We stayed there while attending a wedding and asked if they had a steamer available for use and since there wasn‚Äôt, she went out and bought a QUALITY one for use in the studio. That‚Äôs first class service and hospitality!
The studio is modern and a very serene place to relax in Chico. We really felt like we had a private space to ourselves. Would definitely stay there again if in Chico."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was just the place I was wanting-- comfy bed, luxurious shower, private, cozy. The ultra bonus that I allowed myself to thoroughly enjoy was the outdoor hot tub. I had an interview in Chico the following morning and was really wanting to relax, and the hot tub and super comfy bed made that possible. Will definitely stay again when I need a perfect night in Chico!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a fabulous place to stay! The bathroom is so cool with such an amazing shower. The rest of the studio is a great place to hangout and the jacuzzi is a really nice treat at the end of the day. I‚Äôm looking forward to hopefully staying there again the next time I‚Äôm in Chico!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute space, friendly and helpful host!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was perfect! The guesthouse is a cozy studio with a very well thought out layout. It was cozy but not cramped. The bed was super comfy and the black out blinds allowed us to sleep in. Communication with Elizabeth was A+. If ever in town again, we would love to come back. Thank you for your hospitality!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, cozy, comfortable. Wish I would have found this place sooner! Excellent hosts!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The studio is a nice quiet place to stay. I had someone coming to town for the night and the studio was the perfect solution. The host was accommodating to my situation and extremely helpful. It was a wonderful experience.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was as promised, immaculate, cozy, comfortable, bright and airy space. Great communication, flexible accommodations and an amazing value. Did I mention the hot tub?? AMAZING! And after that you go into the incredible walk-in, pebble floored, rain showerhead bathroom, and you melt even more! I could live at this place; it was everything I could ask for. Love the kitchen, the color, the amenities, and the tall cabinets for a tall person. What also makes this place awesome is that they allow well-mannered pets, which I didn't have, but my sister does and can never find a nice place where they allow her companion dog, so that's a really great option they provide. They even offer dog treats and toys! Bed was comfy, seating area was nice, kitchen nook was quaint and did the job. I really enjoyed the private patio, while small, it had ambiance and gave us a look at the stars and some fresh air. Overall we had an amazing time, wish it was longer, and I can't wait to visit again and tell my friends and family to stay here when possible when they visit. Thank you for everything, we had a lovely stay!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely stay - highly recommended!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This studio is very clean and comfortable. It is likely the cleanest airbnb that I have stayed in.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute place! Elizabeth was easy to deal with and the place was very clean.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Adorable studio with an excellent kitchen setup. The shower also has a really neat faucet set up with both a rain feature as well as an removable wand with adjustable height bar. We were warned to watch out for cats in the driveway and sure enough one was always laying there to great us. üòÇ It‚Äôs a really cute place to stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stylish place with an excellent guide to the surrounding area!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Elizabeth's studio has the perfect balance between the aesthetic of the spare/ contemporary/ minimal and the personal /cozy. Sometimes places seem too cold, too minimal and spare and sometimes, overwhelming with too many personal possessions. We both felt, immediately when walking in, that this is about the perfect airbnb studio and we have stayed in dozens if not hundreds. Will definitely come back when we are in Chico again! Loved the ease of the entry code! She seems to have thought out everything to make the stay efficient, easy to access, and enjoy."

2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Really beautiful little studio! I am somewhat allergic to cats and knew there would be cats around the place which I expected to be fine but I did have a little problem with allergies during our stay. Just something to note of you are allergic to cats! Otherwise, lovely stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely little place to stay! Very comfortable with everything you need. :)
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very quiet, very cute, very comfortable. Loved meeting all the cat friends outside when we arrived ü•∞"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Well located, clean and comfortable space. Communication with Elizabeth was excellent. Thank you!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Serenity Studio is cozy and comfortable with everything you may need for a short or longer stay. It has a kitchen with the basic essentials, a nice bathroom, and a comfy bed. The check-in and check-out process is very easy. Elizabeth is a wonderful and responsive host who will answer your questions quickly. She also left a personalized list of recommendations for Chico, which I thought was a wonderful touch.
Location-wise, it is a short (5 minute) drive to downtown, and about a 20-minute walk if you don't have a car. It is in a relatively quiet neighborhood, but you may hear a train pass by once in a while (this didn't bother me at all, but if you're sensitive to sound, it is something to consider). There are also a lot of cute cats on the property, but they mostly keep to themselves. There is plenty of room to park your car.
Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the Serenity Studio, and would highly recommend it to anyone who is stopping by for a few days or even for an extended amount of time."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The home was so peaceful, in a calm neighborhood. We loved the cute home design, the privacy, the air conditioning, the hot tub, the comfortable bed, the outside areas, the little kitchen space for dinner and breakfast, and the lovely overhead (rainfall?) shower. It was so well-designed and clean. And especially, Beth was so kind and helpful. She checked in and it was nice to chat for a few minutes and get some recommendations like where to grab breakfast on our way out to finish our road trip. This home was exactly what we needed in the middle of our long road trip. We would love to stay here again :) Thank you, Beth!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Elizabeth‚Äôs space was large, clean and comfortable. It has a ‚Äúfun‚Äù refrigerator and stove and a fabulous new bathroom!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Elizabeth is a great host. Very responsive and considerate. We had a wonderful and restful night on our way to Downieville and Elizabeth accommodated all of our needs without question. Highly recommend staying here, super cozy and comfortable."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Probably one of the most beautiful Airbnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever stayed at. I absolutely loved the aesthetic and the cleanliness of this place. It was equipped with everything you could need & was peaceful and spacious. Super pet friendly and easy to find. I wish the hot tub was working when I was there, but I still enjoyed my stay. The host even gave me a couple of eggs which was really cool! Definitely recommend."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"For those folks who are planning to visit and stay in Chico and would enjoy a tremendous high-quality value in lodging, look no further than Serenity Place. The time & effort that Elizabeth has put in to make her studio place a very welcome and clean environment is quite evident. I especially appreciated the nice touch with the colors throughout...the kitchen area is gorgeous! The other aspect of the studio that was excellent is the bathroom & shower. A wonderful way to soothe the soul after a long journey for sure! Last but not least, the mattress on the bed was very comfortable with a nice variety of pillows.
Thanks Elizabeth for making me feel so welcome!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great little place, really enjoyed the hot tub :)"
