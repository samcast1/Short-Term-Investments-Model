2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful little home. Perfect for a nice little get away. Love the private, gated yard. The bed is very comfy and Denisse had the A/c on upon arrival which was very nice since it’s blazing hot already. This home is located in a quiet neighborhood and not far from stores and restaurants which was very convenient. Would definitely recommend to anyone :)"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean stay
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I was visiting because of family health issues. It was a great little sanctuary and getaway for both my dog and I. She had a private little yard to run in and bark at all the birds. I had a place to unwind from a stressful situation. Denisse set this place up perfectly. It is clean, well equipped, and comfortable. The private little yard and gated parking were a great touch. Well stocked with cooking and eating equipment. The bed is one of those adjustable beds which I’m considering buying now and it was much homier than a hotel room. Nice quiet neighborhood in what seems to be a safe area. Denisse was very responsive and nice. She really pays attention to the little things.Had a small cut on my finger that was bleeding everywhere. Med kit I have in my truck is good for patching bullet holes or missing limbs but I didn’t have a small bandage. Looked under the sink for something to clean up blood and found a first aid kit. Saved me a trip to the pharmacy. Won’t find that at a hotel!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved my stay here! Denisse was so kind, and it felt like home away from home. I can’t wait to come back, my boyfriend and I loved it!"

We rented for a month and found it a bit small for that length of time. But for a weekend or even a week, it would be great!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I stayed here for 6 days and everything was perfect for us we had a full kitchen so we could just cook there instead of just eating out the whole time.

Perfect❤️"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very private, well constructed and decorated and sparkling clean. Very small space. Just an FYI if you drive a 19' van like I do - turning into and out of the gated entry through the narrow alley entrance is a bit tricky. Also, bring your own shampoo, conditioner and body wash; there was none."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I visited Yuma for close access to Los Algodoñes. Denisse's home was a 20 minute drive away, which was incredibly convenient. The home was intimate, and perfect for a short stay. The bed is adjustable, which was helpful for when my husband needed to keep his head elevated. The home had everything we needed, a clean bathroom, nice shower, big closet, comfortable bed, and kitchen full of amenities. This home has an automatic gate to close off the front porch for added privacy and security as well. It was located in the nice part of town, right down the street from coffee and grocery stores. I would highly recommend this home for your trip to Yuma."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an absolutely wonderful stay at this charming and peaceful guest house! From the moment I arrived until the day I left, the host was incredibly responsive and friendly, making me feel right at home. The guest house itself was a hidden gem, offering a private and serene space where I could relax and unwind. It was evident that the space was meticulously maintained, as it was spotlessly clean and well-kept. The overall ambiance of the home was simply delightful, and I couldn't have asked for a more tranquil retreat. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone seeking a truly serene and enjoyable experience."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sometimes it's how hosts deal with a problem that tells you a lot. There was a leak with the air-conditioning and Denisse dealt with it well and equitably. A responsive host!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Can’t say enough about this charming small home. Denisse has created such a lovely refuge. Thoughtful touches throughout. Pristine, spotless and beautifully decorated. I felt so at home here and Denisse’s flexibility around early check in and late check out only added to the quality of my stay. Outstanding location; market and Starbucks minutes away. Woke up early enough to enjoy coffee on the tiny patio before the heat descended. Just a lovely spot. Highly recommend."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Accurate to the photos and descriptions. The space is well equipped and cozy. The space is small but has everything you need. It is a guest house but very private with a fence that separates the guest house from the main house and a completely separate entrance and parking. The host had good communication and was responsive to messages. The location is central, easy to get around town from here."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Denisse’s guest home was perfect for us! My wife and I were traveling with our 6mos old daughter. The studio apartment was perfect and she had a pack and play available for our use! The home is located next to great local spots to eat (Jector’s, MarAzul, Dutch Bros, and Sprouts Supermarket). We loved having a space to come back to to escape the heat. There was a private gate and parking which was awesome. Denisse was very responsive and helpful—Definitely recommend staying at Denisse’s!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Denisse's place is perfect. It's quiet and clean; well-decorated and the kitchen is well-stocked as well. It's location makes it super easy to get around Yuma easily. -lot's of thoughtful details at the Airbnb.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down nicest place to stay in Yuma! Denisse has thought of everything a guest would need. The newly built guest unit is well designed with great lighting, quality fixtures, a well stocked kitchen, and soft linens. Much nicer than comparably priced hotels in the area. Also centrally located and a Sprouts market a few streets away. Highly recommend it!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was in excellent condition.
Very well located with great restaurants and parks close by.
It was comfortable, clean and very well kept."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here 4 nights for work, and I really enjoyed it! It's super cute: nice lighting options both on the outside and inside of the place, and loved the color scheme of the kitchen and bathroom. Super close to Sprout's and Starbucks. (If you're looking for a local coffee shop, you have to check out Cafecito, located in historic downtown.)
Pro tip: When using the remote for the AC system, click on ""turbo"" to get the place cooled down quickly, and click the LED button to turn the light on the AC off so you can sleep at night."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely loved this little Airbnb and will plan on staying here next time we’re in town!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful experience!
2022-12-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"The photos and descriptions of this modern and clean guest house were beautiful and reviews were good also. We were surprised that the sofa is a sofa bed and missed that in the description but our host was kind to explain that they soon will replace this with a queen bed. All the appliances, television, wi fi and shower were clean and the house is welcoming. The host is awesome with communication also. We did not like the sofa bed with the thin mattress and it was extremely uncomfortable but they will soon replace it. I’m sure the neighborhood is safe enough and I liked that we had a gate ….we are not familiar with Yuma and the sirens and beware of dog signs were a bit concerning but this property was well lit and good gates and lighting. Also, good locks and felt safe within the guest house. Overall, a quaint place with good decor, nice appliances and wonderful host."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, easy check-in, everything provided as listed. 5 star stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Check in was exactly as described. The place is clean and feels safe. Denisse responds very quickly to messages. And went above and beyond to mail back some things I had left there accidentally.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a pleasant stay in this Casita! the neighborhood was nice and quiet, very close to a Starbucks, Dutch Bros, Sprouts, and many other restaurants and shops. Denisse was great at providing instructions to get in, check out, and would check in with us throughout our stay. We took our pup with us and they loved the little yard and would go out and sun bath and with the gate it was nice to let her be outside without her running off. The place was well lit at night making it super easy to get in and out. We will definitely be coming back to stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great find! My husband and I stayed here during our annual family trip to the sand dunes which we drove to 30 min there and back each day. We have 2 kiddos under two and one slept in a pack n play in a closet, and the other in a pack n play in the kitchen. It was a quaint, small, and gorgeous place. The hosts were amazing. They got us one pack n play so we only had to bring one, and at one point during the trip the electric gate opener ran out of batteries so they drive right over to give us another one. I love how much privacy there was and it even had a little grass lawn which was great for our toddler to run around in. 10/10 place, you won’t regret staying here!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tucked away in the heart of Yuma is this stylish, modern and exceptionally clean and comfortable guest house.

This quiet, comfortable and secluded little house with private gated parking makes this an ideal place to relax at the end of a long day.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay while visiting family. Everything about Cathy’s Air B&B exceeded our expectations.
The park next door provided trails and beauty we enjoyed as a start to our mornings. The hummingbird garden in the park was exquisite. And, if we had children with us, they would have been delighted with the amazing children’s section.
The bed!! So comfortable. At the end of the day, that’s what we needed most of all.
This ranks in our top five Air B&Bs."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our 3 day stay. Cathy was super. Took advantage of the fishing pond nearby. Kitchen was nicely stocked. We had everything we needed.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,It was an absolute joy to stay here. Cathy is a great host and would always respond in a timely manner. Would love to stay here again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good spot near park and swimming
2023-04-01,4,Stayed over a week,Place needs some TLC.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean and friendly. Easy walk to West Wetland and large park. Moo's Ice Cream is a high recommendation. Love the ability to cook with full kitchen. Love the sitting area outside and Cathy is super quick to respond, fair and friendly. Large closet and wonderful bedroom."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All went smoothly here. I was attending an event at Wetlands park. .And it is the closest house.. Walking over there was perfect.. Avoided the crowded parking etc..
Place was clean and relatively quiet. Dog on adjoining property was a pain once or twice, but really no big deal. .I live out in the country with no noise at all, so maybe I am more sensitive to it.. But as I said. Not really a big deal.
Good communication, she checked in once or twice to make sure all was good.
Hope to be back nest year!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very nice place
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place near the West Wetland Park and freeway

2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Loved the location, the included bike made shopping and seeing the neighborhood easy. The bike trail along the canal is right outside the door and delightful.
It's a great value: larger, quieter, and more comfortable than you'll get at any of the hotels. Overall a great experience."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice little apartment with a large kitchen equipped with all the necessities for an extended stay. The location was easy to find and simple to get back to the interstate to get to my dental appointments in Los Algodones.! Wonderful people to work with and reasonable price! Well worth the convenience!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks for everything, Cathy!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place and the host was awesome! I highly recommend staying here for the value it’s was great!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was above 110 degress the entire week I was there, but it was always cool and comfortable inside Cathy's small apartment. The pool was nice and if it had not been so hot, I'm sure I would have spent more time at the park a block away. Since I was there for dental work in Los Algodones, the location was perfect, taking me 15 minutes to get from the apartment to border parking and the short walk over to my dentist's office. Though the decor was not really my style, the place was clean and I was 100% happy there during my week stay. Thanks, Cathy!"

The place comes completely stocked with the essentials such as bath linens, bath soap, shampoo, and even laundry supplies as there is a washer and dryer available.

The location near the lovely West Wetlands park and also near to the closest freeway access heading to Los Algodones, Mexico from the Yuma area made this spot Perfect for my needs. The super bonus for me was the nice rural neighborhood where birds singing in the morning greeted me on the outside sitting area while having coffee, and the occasional welcoming call of peacocks was heard. Cathy has seen to every possible necessity a traveler might need and if you want to cook, there are stores very close by and she has provided the cookware and even the Spices!
ThankYou for providing a spotlessly clean and very welcoming place to stay."

Location was great of you want to do a river float, walking distance! And very close to downtown. Just a heads up though, while I always leave air bnb's clean after my stay, part of the check out process includes stripping the bed and collecting towels to put in wash, as well as taking out the trash, putting dishes away, etc. I've never had an air bnb ask me to do this (I've stayed in many) and they do charge a cleaning fee. I didn't mind, but would have liked to know ahead of time."

Unfortunately, it was too windy to use the pool but would have been wonderful to have if it had been hot! All the essentials were there and it was quite cozy. I would recommend this home. It was so much better than staying in a hotel! We were never able to figure out live tv, but we weren’t around enough to really need it. Maria was very easy to communicate with and helpful. We will hopefully be able to stay again on our next trip to Yuma."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Maria was very responsive and accommodating with our requests. The pool and the place were so enjoyable and we loved being able to have a place to ourselves while we visited Yuma!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely night at Maria's place. I was driving with parents from LA to Tucson, and this was a perfect midway stop. The bedrooms were comfortable, the kitchen excellently equipped, and we loved the pool for evening and morning dips and the covered terrace for meals. The property was cosy and the surroundings quiet, and Maria was helpful throughout. Thoroughly recommended if you want a peaceful retreat in this area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would stay here again
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a private getaway while you’re in Yuma, this is your spot.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Maria’s place was a perfect place for my family and I to stay for the night! Definitely recommend!
2024-03-01,3,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I stayed here for a week beginning March 14th, we had communicated to Maria about not using any scents in the home prior to our stay due to allergies. This was not done and therefore were quite sick from it. Upon arrival the washing machine was broken and never replaced. There was no kettle when we arrived as requested prior to arrival.
The home was recently renovated beautifully and the privacy was great."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As described. Very clean and comfortable
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Maria’s. It was well equipped and very comfortable. Does have swimming pool that would be great in the summer but the weather was too cold for us to use the pool.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed being close to the Wetlands and the bike path. Great for walking and biking. Also thought it was great to use the huge garage.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Place was as described, however there were a couple of issues. I was not given the key to the back door only the front and when you are coming in from the garage (that to get in you have to go through an alley) we had to go all around through the side door to go in through the front door. The back door was very hard to open, the door kept getting stuck. The grill was not cleaned."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Enjoyed our stay. Everything was as described. The host was very responsive to our questions. I will note that the pool was not heated, so we were not able to use it. Stayed for a month and we were very comfortable."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I kept coming back to this listing and it was for a reason! I was meant to stay at this house in this neighborhood! We came to Yuma to visit where my grandmothers family was from and staying here was so important as our family’s land is less than half a mile away! Maybe even right here! Everything was perfect once we walked in and we immediately felt right at home! I already want to come back during the summer to swim in the beautiful pool! I sat out in the yard at night and enjoyed the peace and quiet. My service dog Cleo came with me and we walked the neighborhood at 2am when she was restless and it was safe, quiet and peaceful! Being it was Christmas time I enjoyed that the houses still had their lights on that late for us to enjoy as we passed by. We had a small issue and within minutes of contacting Maria, someone was there to help us out!!! We will be back again! Thank you thank you so much for your help and your beautiful home!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,We arrived late so it was hard to find the house with such little lighting. But overall very comfortable.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved these little house. Very nicely decorated and Maria was very accommodating with our checking in. We want to come back in January.

We will definitely stay here again in the future."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Maria's place was the best part of my recent trip to Yuma, AZ. Everything was beautiful and super clean.

5 Star plus. I highly recommend you stay here is it is available. You will not be disappointed."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Matias place was very comfortable. Shes a great host and the pool felt amazing
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a quiet neighborhood. Not far from Sprouts. Loved floating in the pool. Bed was great!! Didn’t use the grill but was nice to have one. The absolute best part was the homing pigeons that fly in a group formation, in a big circle over the house in the morning time. They roost across the street in the back yard!!!! We watched as we ate breakfast!!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice, clean, around lots of things. Definitely would stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Maria's place was really serene. She was prompt to respond when we had questions. Especially when we needed assistance adding another night. The pictures posted don't do it justice.. it was spotless and had everything we needed. We enjoyed visiting the Colorado (which was only minutes away) and returning to a cool inviting pool. Downtown was also minutes away and a great place to explore in the evening. We will definitely be back to Maria's place.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed staying here. So quiet and peaceful considering it’s in the heart of Yuma downtown. It’s an older neighborhood with character and the pool was very enjoyable. Maria always responded immediately if we had questions.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was super clean and pretty and the private pool was amazing! Everything was just as described. We enjoyed our time in Yuma exploring the sights, cool restaurants and all the thrift stores. Maria was a wonderful host. We will be back!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, perfectly fit myself and my friends. Big driveway with street parking. Close by to everything there is to do in Yuma. And at an unbeatable price.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyed our stay, very private and clean."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home located right in the heart of Yuma
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable place and beautiful. Loved the pool, but didn't use. Not for disabled people. No handles to hold on to.
Their was one thing, the front door was stuck. Hard to open. Told Maria hopefully it was easy to fix."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What can I say? It’s exactly how the pictures looked and how the description is put. Maria was so responsive to us for even the littlest of things, she even put us up in one of her other spots on the last night because the power had went out in the area due to the storm. You have to share the driveway but it’s manageable there’s more than enough space for 2-3 cars on your side (there is a huge garage in the back). The A/C was super cold which is awesome in that Arizona heat and humidity. The pool which didn’t look to be too big (on the pictures) turned out to be a whopping 9 feet! And was more than enough swimming room. Ohh yea Remember that garage? Well inside is a refrigerator and a full bathroom. The grill was also clean but we didn’t get to use it due to the storm. The inside was immaculate the kitchen was squeaky clean the thing is maybe the bathroom not having a lock 🫣 but that’s were manners come into play, other than that we had an amazing stay and will be back 😊 Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really good no complaints
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was wonderful, I couldn’t ask for more, very relaxing and peaceful. Quiet neighborhood and private backyard. The pool was beautiful. Overall I had an amazing time, I would definitely stay again, thank you Maria!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maria’s place was off the hook perfect. Not only was Maria nice and friendly she also went above and beyond and let me sneak in a little early since I was on the road all day. The home was cute and extremely clean , ice cold AC, comfortable with all amenities and also had the nicest pool this side of the Yuma Heights!! Maria was extremely fast on communicating back and was helpful in every way. She most definitely isn’t charging enough !!! If I could give 50 stars I would!! Highly recommend, I’ll definitely stay here again and Maria was hands down a gangster and she deserves the Yuma Air BnB of the year award!!"

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"This Airbnb was affordable, clean, well furnished and had all the necessities we needed for our stay (including extra towels, blankets, even pool noodles). You can tell the inside had been remodeled and was very well maintained. The pool was huge and they also provided a grill which was nice for us to use. The location was very close to the downtown area which had restaurants, bars and shops nearby. Overall, I would stay here again!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This airbnb is un“bee”lievable if you are in Yuma look no further!
Amanda goes above and beyond and thought of everything! It was decorated so cute and I felt right at home. It had a couch that pulled out to be a full size bed. There was a large smart TV and tons of games to play. The Wi-Fi was super fast and never cut out. The dining area didn’t feel cramped there was a four person dining set and two additional bar seatings. The kitchen had everything I could think of everything nice pots /pans, kitchen appliances. She even had bottled water and ice in the fridge ready to go. I really liked the touch of the gourmet kcups and teas with to go cups. The washer and dryer were fast and super easy to use. She has a cute little spot for dogs that has a water bowl pee-pee pads and poo poo bags. The bed was really comfortable with hotel quality linens. The bathroom had jack n Jill doors which was perfect for us! Outside had accommodations for RVS and a nice patio to sit on. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Bee House was the perfect ending to my 40th birthday celebration. AND my pups got to enjoy it with me!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were so happy to find a place to stay in east Yuma where we could bring our dog. The water in the bathroom was hot with no wait for hot water. The WiFi worked well. We are not familiar with the area, so a few recommendations on ""healthy food"" restaurants or good restaurants not too far away would have been helpful. We just ate food we brought with us, as it was hard to find a restaurant or farmer's market with vegan and gluten-free options that was open for the summer season. We would stay here again when visiting Yuma! Usually, our dog stays at home at ""Gramma spa."""
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really liked Amanda's place. It was very clean, cozy and we will stay there again if down in the Yuma area. She also arranged for us to check in early which was nice."

Sometimes we need something affordable for short stay and this was perfect and the location was great - right off of interstate 8 going into Yuma. We would stay here again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So lucky to have found this rare diamond. The neighborhood was quiet and the location was central to local restaurants, malls, stores, gas stations, historic sites and family that we saw daily during our week-long stay. Plenty of parking, easy key code, immaculate accommodations. Will definitely recommend to others seeking a peaceful stay in Yuma, AZ."

You can tell Amanda takes pride in her home and goes the extra mile to make sure guests feel welcome and at home. Loved the above and beyond touches and seasonal decor! Easy to find, so close to our family we were visiting. Comfy bed, hot shower, fluffy towels. Great communication with a friendly host, so many nice amenities, my only disappointment was that my flight was delayed and it cut into our stay. I will definitely bookmark this as my first choice the next time we come back. Fingers crossed it will be available!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I want to start off by thanking our host for having such a well kept home. She was very easy to communicate with and was very friendly. The home was clean and pristine and exactly as described. Parking and access is top notch. All furnishings and appliances were in great condition and worked as expected. We enjoyed the layout and felt comfortable during our stay.
We had an issue with the climate control and had to reach out, but our host was very responsive and addressed it immediately.
The internet speed was mostly consistent, but did occasionally lag. Though that is in no way the host’s fault, I think it’s important to know if internet is needed for anything like work video meetings.
Overall it was a great experience. We would refer our friends and family, and we would stay here again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean, neat and nice location. The Host has gone above and beyond to make the home very comfortable. Definitely one on the best we have stayed at. We’ll be back."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and clean place. Highly recommend.
Note: internet is very slow; not suitable for working at home.
TV operation instruction would be helpful. Difficult to operate TV.
Entrance key pad instructions only require code; not home + code.
Plastic wrap or baggies in kitchen would be helpful.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay while visiting friends."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home that was perfect for our 5 day trip! Host is super responsive and helpful with any and all questions. Home is very clean, well maintained, and plenty of amenities provided. Overall, would recommend and will stay here again!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,was a great place to stay .would absolutely stay again
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice little place. Denisse was very quick to respond with any questions I had prior to my stay. Check in and out were simple, the beds and linens were great quality and clean, beds were very comfortable, the house was super clean. The top reason for this choice was that my vehicle was parked inside the property behind a closed and locked gate. We were in town for a car show and I enjoyed the peace of mind knowing my car was secure overnight. Much better than being parked in a hotel parking lot over night."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Denisse is an excellent host. The property was immaculate and tastefully decorated. There is off road parking, a little private seating area and the property made us feel at home. We visited Yuma for work and I was waiting for a FedEx parcel to arrive. Dennise knew it was important and stayed in contact with me regarding the parcel and dropped it off to us at nearly 9pm so we had it for first thing in the morning. She is extremely responsive. I would not hesitate to stay here again."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The casita was beautiful and upgraded. check in was quick and easy, with parking inside the gate. Everything was super clean, bed was comfortable, and area was quiet and peaceful. Communication with Denisse was great and she promptly amswered my questions. We look forward to staying again!

The bath has all new update fixtures. It is just beautiful. The beds are super comfortable (which is very important to me). It is so very roomy and comfortable, you just want to stay in and do nothing.. Honestly it looks larger on the inside than the outside. It has everything you need for a relaxed and enjoyable stay. Also Denisse is the perfect host. If you text her she responds right away. When I go back to Yuma this is where I want to stay."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was great and we would stay again!!
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,We had a very nice time! The home was very unique. Correspondence was amazing and the group of ladies and I will look to rent this property again if we are there for another bowling tournament…
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Was a wonderful castle experience. Very wonderful hosts responded to messages in a timely manner. A few things were broken and un-useable but nothing that made it inconvenient for us to use the home still. Has the best hiding places!
2024-03-01,3,Stayed with kids,"In pictures it does look amazing. However, the customer service was not so much.
They did not care about my concerns of having a beehive and a swarm of bees that my family had to deal with - my daughter being allergic to bees. They felt the need to use my dogs as leverage as reasons to make their issue not so big however they were aware of all my dogs coming to the trip and they did say it was OK to do so months ago. When I mentioned this issue, they acted surprise and they said that they had walk through the property hours before I had shown up and that everything was fine, which was clearly a lie because there’s no way that the beehive happened within a few hours. When I had a chance to speak with the host, she was very rude and would not let me speak. I was at her mercy to be able to make my trip work out I let her know that since she does not care to assist me with my concerns that I would reach out to Airbnb directly in regards to any feedback going forward."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love staying in there homes. Alex is always just a text away. We had a problem with the.kitchen light staying on. They sent maintance over right away and we were able to fix it. I love there communication they are always willing to help.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home.
Quick and very accommodating responses to any requests regarding our stay.
Very peaceful outdoors.
Thank you Alex and Montse for a great home away from home stay.
Only drawback to the entire stay was not being able to flushing the toilet paper as we just are not accustom to this. But they get full 5 stars as they made this very clear right from initial booking that this was a requirement for the home.
Thank you again Alex and Montse!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The sand castle was amazing and very clean had all the amenities we needed beds are very confortable host are responsive and friendly I would definitely recommend booking it definitely 5 stars ⭐️ !

2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay for our family especially with having 3 young boys. Only thing was location a little far but that was on me should have done more research on location.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"After a little difficulty locating a missing key, our stay was quite nice. The owners responded quickly to our requests."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is now in my must stay at list for yuma.. beautiful place. the outside is gorgeous and great for pictures. very clean . by far the best air b n b I have ever stayed at. I hate to leave. but got to get back to home.

2024-01-01,3,Group trip,Great location for a little getaway.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Military friendly. On behalf of my wife and the rest of my family, I wanted thank you so much for all of your help and the support that you gave to us as we mourned our son’s passing. You made this process so much easier for us. For that we are very grateful."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Pretty house
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"This was the right place at the right time, and we had an enjoyable night at the Sand Castle. The host allowed us an early check-in, which was super helpful. Definitely recommend. We loved the grounds and the atmosphere of the house."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay at Alex and Montes’s place - there was room for everyone. The beds were incredible and everyone got a great nights sleep before heading back onto the Peace Trail. I brought crowns for everyone to wear as we sat around the table for dinner and got some great photos- we all wished we would have been able to spend a few nights there and really enjoy the house and pool but we was on a time schedule. We felt very secure in the location and wasn’t worried about anything- had a great time .
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying at the Sand Castle as our daughter lives right up the street which means less travel time between visits.
We especially appreciate how accommodating Alex and Montse are to us and how quickly they handle communication!!
We hope to always be able to book this place when we come to Yuma."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Unique experience about 20 min outside of Yuma. Quirky ambiance but not overwhelming. Date trees.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Great beds, great space for our large group. Wish the pool was heated, a large hot tub would be regal."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,The house was a great place to stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place is just as pictured/described. It has a large entertainment space and 4 bedrooms. It's clean and stocked with toiletries. The hosts were quick to answer any questions. My only negatives are the only two full bathrooms are en suites. Also the pool was freezing, which made no one want to use it. We really only needed the house to sleep, shower, and eat breakfast. It served it's purpose."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place never stayed in a castle which for the first time was awesome.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Over all a great experience 👏
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were very nice and accommodating to our needs.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,.
2023-09-01,2,Group trip,Very bad experience
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"It was great that our group could relax, eat, and sleep in one structure! Usually we get three separate rooms. It was a memorable trip!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay at for the price. You’re getting a massive castle for an amazing price. They communicated well and every response was super fast. We ran out of trash bags and I let them know, not 15 min later they came with trash bags. Great place, great visit and great people."
2023-08-01,4,Group trip,"it’s a good place for pictures, great for hanging out outside weather permitting, beds are comfortable."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This was a fun staycation during the hurricane. The pool was a little small, someone else was renting part of the house at the same time."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,The Castle pictures showed you everything you need to know! It’s a fun place to stay and Alex and Montse were very responsive!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place I would be coming back soon
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Alex & Montse's AirBnB was amazing and spectacular the main house was everything we expected. It was very spacious and had more than enough room for me and my family. The pièce de résistance was the backyard and pool. We spent most of the time in the pool. Overall we gave their place a 10/10 and definitely wouldn't hesitate to stay there again when in Yuma.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Firstly what a wonderful property. The arrival was very straight forward and no issues at all. The road leading to the property is a little bumpy but worth the drive down.
We stayed in the main castle house. The house was as described and we had concerns about there being 3 listings on the same property but it was quiet and you felt very much secluded. The house came with 4 bedrooms, 2 having en-suites and there being one other toilet, we did expect more bathrooms however there was no issues with sharing.
The property was clean and came with everything that was needed. Also it took us around a day to work out the fridge had fresh cold water so that was a plus.
Everything was very clean and lots of extra towels.
The outside area was lovely. We unfortunately had come at the time of a bad sand storm and the owner luckily did give us warning but we decided to still come. There was a lot of sand in the pool and outside sitting area but the owner was in contact and"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay and would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location of the sand castle is about 20-25 minutes away from any stores, restaurants, shops. It’s pretty secluded which was also nice because it was quiet. Very spacious and relaxing. The grounds are so beautiful and unique. Great for all the cute pics. Check in was super easy as well as checkout.
Hosts are very responsive. I did have an issue with the alarm going off early morning they tried to handle it quickly and swiftly and stated they never had an issue like that before. Also had some concerns about recoding devices but they quickly assured us it was not recording. Overall the stay was good and very comfortable."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a cool house and the kids just loved it. Would love to stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Even better than the photos. This place is beautiful, well kept, and the hosts are amazing. Truly exceeded our expectations. The castle looks even better in person and super spacious. Every detail of the interior and exterior are thoughtfully crafted and make the experience much more than just an Air B&B stay. You can tell the hosts really care about making sure the guests have a comfortable and enjoyable stay. A full kitchen with every appliance you can imagine. the beds are comfortable, clean and tons of extra blankets, towels, and quality hair products. the pool is awesome and was better than we expected. Hosts were very responsive and timely. No bugs were in the house and the yard is nicely maintained. I cannot say enough good things about this place and we hope to return again. excellent place, highly recommend!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful house and hosts. Hope to stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We rented the main house when family came in town to visit; the house was awesome and neatly decorated, the outdoor area was a hit with both the adults and kids, and Alex & Montse were incredibly friendly and responsive, quickly taking care of an issue we had with one of the doors.
5 stars across the board!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Nice place to stay in Yuma
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a cute gem. Was like being in a private oasis.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time and my kids loved the “castle”. Would stay again!
2023-04-01,3,Group trip,"Kooky and fun, great value."
2023-04-01,4,Group trip,"Castle house is neat, only big negative was the amount of bugs inside. A ton of dead flies on the floors and biting gnats.
Other than that, house was as described!"
2023-04-01,3,Group trip,.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Thank You!
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very unique experience. The kids felt like royalty for a week and that is priceless. Besides a couple issues we loved our stay. Beds were amazing. I would definitely rent again
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best Vacation! I hav a large family and there was plenty of space! Not crowded at all! My grandson loved the sand Castle it’s was perfect!
The beautiful La Jolla coves were only a few hour drive and worth the trip! Beautiful Sea Lions just a few feet away! We also went to the Santa Monica pier.
There’s also things to do right in Yuma… we visited the Yuma Territorial Prison. Nice piece of history and a cute gift shop for some souvenirs!
We will be visiting again over the Summer.
Thank you Alex & Montse for such a wonderful experience! 😊"
2023-03-01,3,Group trip,"It was a fun place to stay with the concept of the ""sand castle,"" and Alex and Montse were very communicative. However, we were disappointed with the pool being unavailable during our stay and were only notified a day before our trip began, which left no time to rebook and find another place without breaking the bank. The facility was clean and spacious, but the dishes in the cabinets were all filled with water and had to all be cleaned again before using. If I were to book here again, I would want to make sure the pool was working."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"a very large, spacious and wonderful house and a very helpful host 10/10******"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our crew enjoyed their stay!
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,Cool place
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I liked the sand castle, it was nice and clean."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed the unique experience and decor. Very spacious and comfortable.
2023-02-01,4,Group trip,The house was fun and unique. Worth a stay. The decorations were a little odd and unmatchable. Should stick with the castle vibe and Declutter. There were a ton of flies for some reason.
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"We had such a fun time at this location. There is so much to see and is just a unique place with interesting oddities and grounds. Great hosts with quick responses and flexibility. Only drawback is distance from town and strong smell of fertilizer occasionally. Overall, outstanding experience!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Overall great stay. Place was bigger than I imagined based on the pictures. Me and my friends had a great time.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I slept in a castle it was awesome
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,what a great place
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Fun living in a Castle for a few days!!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place overall.
Had some issues but hosts were prompt at fixing them. Pool was ice cold so no swimming in winter. Unique decor and the front door was the highlight!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Alex and Montse’s sand castle home was perfect for our group of three! Check in was super easy, the place was clean and ready, and the hosts were very responsive during our stay. We would highly recommend this spot!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a very nice stay.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay at the castle house. Wish it was a little warmer to be able to swim.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had 3 kids with us for the stay and they absolutely loved it! Comfortableand clean living space!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alex & Montse’s Sand Castle was outstanding! It was huge! Very well kept. Super huge back yard. I have to admit my favorite part of the house was the castle like front door and the drawbridge. Everything was very modern and well-kept. Will definitely stay again thank you Alex!
2022-10-01,2,Group trip,"The place is not as listed. Cool idea but the house is very much a flipped landlord special with paint covering things that should be fixed or refinished. Some of our linens were dirty so we washed them when we had time. Thankfully we weren’t there a lot except to sleep. The house is JOINED to two others and someone tried to come into our kitchen thinking it was communal so that was scary. The hosts communication is not great and they accused me of trying to get “free things” when I explained the dissatisfaction of our stay after staying. We just didn’t have time to find a new place with our agenda the way it was. Hot water was iffy and the pool was not swimmable due to how dirty it was. We also had to double check about a crib and when I brought it up the host said “bring your own that’s wrong” and removed it from the listing. We even moved our reservation by their request so they could accommodate a long stay and they were still rude and extremely disrespectful. All around just a poor experience with both house and host. Stay somewhere nicer, closer to town, would be safer and a better experience."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"We had a good stay at the Sand Castle! A unique place to stay. We needed a ground level place with enough room and this place had plenty of room. Kitchen had everything we needed and everything was very clean. Also, hosts responded quickly to my questions."
2022-10-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"The castle decor was fun. However, there were several downsides. There are two units attached to the main house that were also rented out. The guests from all 3 units share the yard and pool. Also, the house can only be reached via dirt road. Lastly, it says they accept dogs, but be aware there will be an extra cleaning charge if they find any dog hair on the premises. You are also required to keep your dog on a leash while in the yard."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,This place is so cool. Exactly as advertised.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We are thrilled with the experience we had at Alex and Montse’ place. This is such a unique opportunity for guests because it feels just like you are staying in a castle. So much detail and beauty throughout the entire Airbnb. We would definitely love to stay here again. Hosts keep the house very and the communication was great. Highly recommended!
2022-10-01,4,Group trip,"Great, communicative hosts."
2022-10-01,3,Group trip,"The Sand Castle is a distinctive place to stay for any occasion you plan! Inside, it is spacious and has unique decorations. The front and backyard are decorated much like the inside with notable decor.
The house has most if not all the amenities you would need for a long or short stay.
A few things to note:
1) The pool/hottub were dirty/unusable
There was a lot of dirt build up at the bottom of the pool as well as A LOT of dead bugs floating around. We don't mind taking the net to get the bugs out, but the state of the pool was disappointing.
The hot tub was broken and full of dirty and trash. Sad.
2)  SO MANY FLIES.
When my party and I decided to check out the backyard, we were IMMEDIATELY bombarded by tons of flies. We constantly had to wave our hands in our face or around our head. It was annoying and turned us all off from exiting the house to even sit on the back porch. Which was disappointing because we had outside activities planned that we had to scrap. It would be worth getting lots of fly traps and scattering them around the yard.
However, the beds were clean and comfortable."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Communicates well and keeps a nice place.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you for a very memorable trip . We love the space in the kitchen we had a family soul train dance!
Such great decor and lovely back yard
Thank you"

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great hosts, quick responses, house was comfortable and had everything we needed for a nice stay. Lot of flies outside, but that might’ve just been because of the recent rain. The one negative was that the pool was dirty when we got there."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very beautiful
2022-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,It’s a solid place to check out . It might be a little far out there for some. It’s definitely a unique place to stay .

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Decent place to stay it is up staircase could be difficult for some other than that. Nice large room with just the right necessities.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Denis' place was a super convenient distance to Algodones and Downtown/Oldtown Yuma. It is also close to the beautiful Wetlands, for walking and the Colorado River.
It is a comfortable, and good-sized studio, with plenty of windows for fresh air, a ceiling fan, and a good cooling/heating unit for more extreme temperatures. A huge plus to the studio, is the salvation (!) of having a covered parking space. Anyone familiar with Arizona summer temperatures understands what a value that is.
As described in his listing, there is no kitchen,...but I needed only a fridge, as I took my meals out in the town.
The neighborhood is residential and quiet. Denis as a host, was always responsive, friendly and accomodating."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was very calming and comfortable to be in. The location was great with the neighborhood being safe and quiet. It's close to the park which was wonderful for walking in the morning. Every place that I wanted to go was only 5 or 10 minutes away. I would highly recommend staying here and look forward to coming back!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even though we stayed 6 nights, we knew we would be eating out most of the time, so we didn't need a kitchen - the small fridge and microwave were fine. King bed was great."

I really like the parking spot - it is shaded and easy to come and go.
The location of this Airbnb was convenient and ideal ( at least for my needs - i had some dental work done in Algodones) – centrally located with easy access to many places to eat and shop, yet tucked away in a quiet oasis, providing the perfect balance of convenience and tranquility.
Communication with Denis was great
Overall, I had a wonderful experience staying and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy , tranquil and nice place to stay here in Yuma ."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Yuma to visit my Mom and Dad who live down there now. We just needed a quiet place to come back to, to rest in and get ready for the next day.
We had a late flight/drive over to Yuma, and mentioned it to our host who was very accommodating about the time we were going to check in.
Upon arrival, the place was very clean, with the amenities listed. We didn't need a kitchen, or any of that type of thing, so it was perfect for us.
The location of this place was great as well, with shopping/grocery stores/hospital/freeway access very conveniently located.
The day of our departure, we took care of the few items requested to clean up, and were on our way.
I'll be coming back to Yuma to visit again, and hope this place is available, as I'll seek it out, again.
Thanks for having us, and hopefully we'll see y'all soon.
Andy"

I live in Tucson and she lives in Yuma. Hunter's place turned out to be only 5 blocks from her home. After 2 days of being together, we fell in love. She is now coming to Tucson this weekend for several days. Hunter's great place to stay was instrumental in setting up this meeting. I thank you Hunter and Taylor, from the bottom of my heart!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed my stay with Hunter & Taylor! The listing is exactly as it is described. A few things I was curious about upon my stay: (a) the bed slept amazing. It's medium firmness, which is a great fit for me! I slept really well. The property is in a neighborhood, which was very quiet during the day and at night, which was great for the rest I needed; (b) the AC unit in the window works amazing! As a person that lives full-time in a van, and was traveling through Yuma in 103 degree weather, I needed a place that was going to keep me cool. This place did the trick; (c) there is ample lighting for when you want all the house lights on as well as mood lighting to watch t.v.; (d) the water pressure in the shower was great! The temps were also amazing--good for those that like really hot water, or not.
Hunter was very responsive to me. While I only stayed for a night, he was very accommodating of needing an early arrival & answering any questions I had. Highly recommend this spot!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, very quiet, kept nice and cool with the A/C window unit. Very dark at night. Would deffinetly stay here again when in the area!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hunter was a great host, he communicated with me every day to make sure I had what I needed during my stay. The room was clean and comfortable.
The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful.
I will definitely stay there again when in Yuma if available."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The PERFECT overnight between Tucson and San Diego! Left Tucson late and needed a stop. The apartment was private and in a very safe and trusted location. Wifi speeds were high and I was able to take video meetings the next morning leading up to check out. Comfortable bed, all the amenities necessary, and incredibly clean. Window unit AC worked great and kept the perfect temp. Exactly what I need for a stop on my road trip."

All the smallest details were proactively provided and magically available. From our welcome note, to the time we departed, we felt right at home. I loved the helpful labels everywhere, especially with light switches - no guessing or testing needed. We were inspired by the home decorations and found plenty of ideas with a visit to the Dandy Home and Ranch store in town. Awesome stay all around!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Dandy House was nothing short of amazing! We used the house for the night before my wedding for a girls night, getting ready for the day of the wedding, and for our first night as husband and wife. It was beautiful for all the pictures and it was such a fun place to wake up in the morning as husband & wife! I would 10/10 recommend!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,The cutest most cozy ABNB I have ever stayed in. We had so many moving parts last week for my daughters wedding and this was the perfect spot to keep it all together.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at the Dandy house! Thank you!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The most beautiful oasis in Yuma! An interior design enthusiasts dream. Perfect for a girls weekend with my mom and daughter. Amanda is so kind and easy to get in touch with. Will definitely be back (and of course to shop at Dandy home store as well!!)
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as advertised. The home was very nicely appointed with an attractive, well thought out decor. Everything we had to use from toaster, coffee machine, appliances and dishwater worked well and/or in relatively new and well cared for condition. The bedrooms and baths were spotless. The surrounding area was quiet throughout the night for peaceful sleep. I highly recommend this home. The host obviously cares about providing a quality rental and the comfort of clients."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although we were in Yuma for a business trip, it was so nice to be in a comfortable and beautiful home rather than a hotel for a week. It was so quiet and relaxing. It is a quiet community that was near stores and restaurants. Super comfortable and beautifully decorated. This is the second time we have rented the home for a business trip. A trip is not complete without also visiting their Dandy Home & Ranch store!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hands down, the best Air BnB that I’ve ever stayed in after a decade of travelling with the platform’s service. Amanda is an incredible hostess who has paid great attention to ensure her guests have a lovely stay at The Dandy. The house amenities are chic yet practical, bedroom suites comfy yet indulgent, and kitchen is spotless yet made for cooking. We enjoyed the outdoor area too for BBQ’ing and our toddler had fun running around blowing bubbles & counting cacti. Our family truly felt spoiled to be on holiday at The Dandy! I hope to make this our regular spot when we travel into Yuma to visit family. Thank you for hosting us!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I consider the Dandy House a “home away from home” for me and my daughters. Divine Love is both seen and felt in this place. Ms. Amanda‘s attention to detail-- including even the diffuser fragrance that was in the air when we arrived--shows her care for people, and makes for a peaceful, relaxing space that is conducive to mental health…I always wish that I could stay “just one more” day. Thank you and see you next time. Like Abraham, you are Blessed to be a blessing.🙏🏾"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Dandy House felt like home from the moment we walked in! It was comfortable and spacious, inviting and warm. We were visiting family in Yuma and it was a perfect place to share a cup of coffee and make memories together. Amanda was a responsive, gracious and accommodating hostess. We look forward to staying at Dandy House again in the future!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down one of the best Airbnbs I’ve ever stayed at—Amanda’s home is a joy and beautiful curated desert oasis. Comfortable, cozy, and luxe aesthetic that I wish I could have taken home with me… but the best part is you can! Her shop in town has the most delightful collection of home goods and keepsakes."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Amanda for creating such a beautiful place to stay in Yuma!

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Such a great, peaceful respite for our family. We were in town for a memorial service and it was so homey, gave a warm feeling upon arrival, the split floor plan was ideal. Everything was as beautiful and squeaky clean as pictured. Every amenity was high quality and makes you want for nothing. We made a trip by the store to buy their Dandy Colombian coffee and lavender syrup. What a treat! So many cute things, you don’t want to miss a trip to check it out. Overall, such a great stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"For us , it was perfect. Higher-priced for this area--but I feel no buyer's remorse. Every penny was well-spent. I regret that I could not afford to stay longer. It felt like home from the moment I walked in. For our occasion, at this time of year, it was simply perfect. (Wait, did I already say that?) We just needed to rest-- and we were able to do just that. I would love to come back on the few days a year when it is cold in Yuma, so I can feel the cozy warmth of the home with the fireplace burning and roast Marshmallows in the firepit outside. During hot Summer days I might miss not having a pool--but there is room to put up a temporary above ground pool and or jacuzzi/hot tub in the backyard. The care taken and thoughtfulness are evident in each detail. I appreciated that: The home was so clean-- but did not smell like chemicals. The light switches were wiped clean AND labeled! The information handbook was right near the entrance. The personalized note just made our day! Thanks"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the BEST! Highly recommend. Had everything we needed and its gorgeous inside and very functional! And Amanda is a great host, very responsive and caring. If you get the chance, check out The Dandy Store, they have some really great stuff there for purchase."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After a long day of travel and being weary, we arrived at the Dandy House with all the relief and comfort of 'being home'.
As soon as we pulled up in the driveway, the house was welcoming.....the lights were on inside and out. When we opened the door, everything was clean and inviting.
All the amenities that we could need, were there including the personal touches of a handwritten welcoming postcard. 🙂
Will use this residence again when in Yuma."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I’ll never stay in a hotel when visiting Yuma again!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was absolutely perfect. Beautiful cozy home that gives you those warm fuzzy feelings all inside. Yuma is my hometown and I knew this would be the perfect place to stay during my stay for my parents 50th Anniversary celebration.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amanda allowed me and two guests to stay at the Dandy House with a very last minute booking when another property we were staying in had the water go out. I’m not sure why we didn’t book it in the first place but I’m so happy that I had the opportunity to stay there. The house is clean, well designed, and conveniently located near grocery stores and other local serving needs. The next time I’m in Yuma I will absolutely try to book my stay at the Dandy house!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Dandy House is a great choice for your next Yuma stay!! It’s thoughtfully decorated, well equipped, centrally located, comfy beds … & overall quiet & so cozy!!

The place is a great find in Yuma, AZ. The hosts were very nice and checked in with us - consider staying here as you pass through or if you are visiting…"

We could have just brought our suitcases and felt at home."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Dandy Home is absolutely the best Airbnb we’ve stayed at. The amazing photos on this listing are already captivating and the experience is even better! This home is a true gem, loaded with style in a cozy and functional way. We had to pry our 8 and 5 year old girls out of there because they didn’t want to leave (and neither did we!).
Favorite space: The Kitchen! Just gorgeous and we’d like a mirror image of this in our own home. Even though this is our favorite, we can add a very long list of other detailed favorites in this house.
How about the beds? Super comfortable for a great night rest. Great quiet neighborhood too! Sound machines provided are a nice touch as well.
What do you notice right away? Even from the outside when pulling up you realize this is something special, and quite rare. Upon opening the door you enter this gorgeous and amazingly styled interior that is impeccably clean and smells so good. You can easily spend time just exploring with your eyes trying to discover the “secret sauce” behind such a cozy and cohesive design.
MUST DO: Yes, this is a total marketing plug and very intentional - check out Dandy Home & Ranch on 2500 E 16th. Why? You’ll love the home so much that you’ll want to take a piece of it with you. Thankfully there’s a legal way to do that - just go shop at the store! We grabbed a few small items since we were short on space, but as you go through the shop you’ll notice some very familiar items from the home, along with plenty more! We also got to meet Amanda too who is absolutely sweet and a joy to speak with.
Amanda, we’re excited for what you’re doing both at the Dandy Home and the Dandy Home & Ranch store and we were honored to be guests in the Dandy Home! Thanks again and may God continue to bless you and your family!"
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"3rd stay at my home away from home. And already planning for my next trip! The Dandy House is so tranquil, so cozy and so beautiful.

A completely renovated home, no detail was spared. It is a stunning, beautifully decorated and so well thought out home for Dandy guests. Everything, inside and out, is sweet and welcoming. From the fully stocked kitchen (to include breakfast/snacks and drinks) to the beautifully made, comfortable beds, to the cozy living spaces!

Communication is always there and respond time is minimal. This home here is the best, so spacious. Two floors separate the common living space and bedrooms and the powder room down stairs is very practical. The back yard is huge with enough room for littles ones to run around in and the pool is very well shaded by the house. The airport, Walmart and gas stations are all within 5 minutes of this home. Definitely will seek Brooke’s and Amy’s listings before looking elsewhere when booking in Yuma again."

The house and appliances all worked and were in great condition and very clean. It had all the amenities we needed for a comfortable stay. The beds and pillow were some of the best we have ever slept on. During our visit to Yuma the temperatures were around 100 degrees. The a/c and ceiling fans did it’s job to keep the temp inside to where we wanted. Additionally, the shaded back patio and being able to use the garage for our vehicle made it bearable in the heat. The pool was clean and clear. The host and crew did an amazing job with this place and were very responsive and flexible with our needs. We would recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable place to relax. Almost forgot to mention that it was very convenient to have a Walmart super close, and all sorts of shopping just minutes away. Thank you for making our stay AMAZING!"

Important things for me include Crisp white sheets, I travel with my own pillow, spotless bathroom, a real coffee pot in the kitchen. WiFi is excellent. There’s a shaded patio in the back. Each bedroom door has its own Yale lock with your own code.
After a little chit chat Maria disappears into her private living area. This is a quiet and peaceful home, guests are expected to be respectful.
I stay with her when I do my dental work in Lis Algodones and will see her again in 6 months."

Her place is 12 minutes from the airport and 20 minutes from the border crossing if you are going to the dentist like I do. There is a Walmart Superstore 2 miles from her place, and lots of places to buy food very close.. My room was clean and comfortable. If you want you can enjoy sitting in the backyard, or other shared living spaces in the house. Maria is one of my top experiences with Airbnb."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Maria was a great host and made me feel very welcome during my stay. The house was beautifully decorated, very clean, and quiet.

2023-01-01,2,Stayed one night,"A bit of a disappointment, there is no TV in the bedroom, bathrooms are shared with other people staying in other rooms Also I could not find the towel that should have been provided for me there is a Living Room TV. However, the living room was not peaceful. The owner was standing in the kitchen for quite some time , having an extremely loud phone conversation without care to myself or other guests in the home. ( almost as if she wanted me to leave the area.) I would not recommend staying here. There are many other choices."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a safe and comfortable, albeit brief, stay at Maria's clean and lovely home. I booked Maria's ""Joy"" room at the last minute one evening, after I arrived in Yuma, as I was heading over the Andrade-Los Algodones US/Mexico border the following morning to have some much-needed (and long postponed due to the pandemic) dental work done.
Maria's home is located in a lovely, safe neighborhood. I parked my fully-loaded Lexus for 2 nights in front of her home and had no issues with break-ins. Maria's communication is welcoming, responsive, and clear. She is clearly a very experienced Superhost, deserving of the title.
My iPhone Maps GPS said it was an 18-20 minute drive to the US-Mexico Andrade-Los Algodones border crossing (NOTE: I parked in the Quechan tribe's day-time parking lot $6/day, also safe) , which I drove to/from her home on 4 separate occasions, and at different times of day on a Wednesday and Thursday in the last week of August (TIP: this is a slower time for dental/optical tourism due to the extreme heat...as in 111 degrees on day one, 119 on day two, and 110 on day 3). Despite the extreme heat warnings outside, the temperature inside Maria's home was comfortable morning, afternoon, and overnight. I kept the ceiling fan going overnight which was a nice, light breeze.
Maria has put a lot of care and thought into making her home easily accessible, clean, safe, comfortable, and well-thought-out for her guests. She gives you a brief tour/overview after your arrival, so you know where everything is, where to place your food items in the refrigerator, and which rooms in her home have other Airbnb guests. As a female traveling alone, I felt very safe and comfortable staying there, even with male guests in two of the other rooms. There is a lock on both the ""Joy"" bedroom door and the shared bathroom door. Maria creates an individual code for you to gain entrance to her home.
Two male guests were staying in the other rooms, and I shared a bathroom with one of them who was booked in the ""Hope"" room. There was no issue with timing, as our schedules turned out to be quite different (mine was arising early and early to bed and he was a late arrival, later to arise). I am not irritated by the noise of an across-the-hall neighbor arriving while I'm sleeping and using the adjacent shared bathroom to prepare for bed. If you are someone who is (i.e. you struggle to return to sleep once awakened), I would recommend you book the room that has its own private bath, as it is located down the hall from the two that share a bathroom (the ""joy"" and ""hope"" bedrooms.
I will be returning to Yuma in January of 2023, and if Maria has availability in her home at that time, I would not hesitate to book the ""Joy"" room again, as she is a welcoming and lovely Superhost who makes you feel welcome in her home without being in any way intrusive.
Highly recommended.
Travel Tips: Maria's home is within walking distance of a nearby major grocery store and nail salon. If you enjoy Mexican food, I can recommend the Mi Hefitas enchiladas from Duron's El Zarape grill. Five days later, I'm still thinking about them. I was raised on Mexican food in Texas and SoCal, but I've never had anything like them before. On an extremely hot day, you can find refreshingly cool treats at Raspados Penguino. I had the very sweet (and rather seedy) raspado de guayaba (guava), but you get the flavor you prefer. They also have Thrifty ice cream flavors and other sweet treats, and even nachos.
I found the best fuel prices in Yuma to be at any of the Arco stations, as long as you pay cash. If you happen to be driving from/through Phoenix on your way to Yuma, and you are a Costco member, you will not find a lower price on fuel in AZ than the Costco there, so if there is no line, fill up your tank there. I did not drive across the US-Mexico Andrade-Los Algodones border, but if you are, it might be worth your while to fill up on fuel over there, depending on how busy the border crossing is when you are visiting. In the last week of August, there were few cars making the crossing (again, due to the extreme heat that is common in late August), so the wait to drive through customs was brief, and there was no wait walking across or coming back through customs on foot. I hear this is *not* the case during the much busier winter months, when all the snowbirds are in town, so just something to keep in mind.
In closing, I highly recommend Maria's very clean, safe, conveniently located, well-appointed, and comfortable home."

The last time my Mom and I stayed at her place, she sent food to my room when I was not feeling well. Her house is very homely and her bed is very comfortable. Overall, I highly recommend her place to stay when visiting Yuma 😊"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The room as described
It’s always tricky to rent a room and not the whole place. I felt mostly comfortable. It’s clean, the owner was very specific about her needs and not much flexible."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super comfy and super clean! Appreciated that I was able to make coffee (brewed, not powder) in the morning. Since I stayed overnight in order to go to Mexico the next day, it was a little farther than I would have liked - BUT - it was pretty close to the restaurants downtown, and to the river and prison which was a really great historic place to visit. That's why I gave it 4 stars for location.....it took me 30 min to get to Los Algodones - but it wasn't that big an issue."

The room was just as pictured on the listing with a spacious bed, small computer desk, two nightstands, and and dresser with multiple pullout drawers.

2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maria provided a great, quiet place for me to catch up on writing and reading for a couple of days. She has such a nice home, in which guests immediately feel welcomed and comfortable. Although a very busy person, she graciously took some time to discuss cultural topics that were on both of our minds. Also, her house was only a few minutes' walk from a grocery store and brewery/restaurant when I needed sustenance. Maria's is the first space I would look for the next time I pass through Yuma."

2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maria is a warm and gracious host. Her home is very pretty and spacious. I enjoyed the room I had.
It felt secure and comforting to be in such a nice home when I was in Yuma for the first time and going across the border to Los Algodones to get extensive dental work done. Her home is in a perfect location for that, and close to everything in town. It is only 20 minutes to the border, and 10 minutes the airport. Walmart, Albertsons and many places to eat are minutes from her home. I would stay at Maria's again when I return to Yuma."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay
2020-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A wonderful place to stay in Yuma. Conveniently located, very nice neighborhood, offstreet parking, very nice room and beautiful shared facilities. Wonderful hostess. Highly recommended."

Located in a beautiful, safe area of lovely homes, I highly recommend this AirBnb!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maria's home was very clean, she is a wonderful host. Very polite and courteous. Only complaint would be the room I rented didn't have a TV. I was given access to the living room TV if I so desired, only a bummer because I wanted to play some video games after work but really not a big deal. Overall I would recommend Maria and would definitely stay again."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay. It’s quiet it’s private and Maria keeps everything clean and immaculate.

2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice and very clean. She is very friendly.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great experience at Maria's home! I stayed for two nights. I got in at 9:00pm on a Sunday and left at 4:30am on the following Tuesday. It was a very short trip. Her and her husband were there. Their bedroom is on the other side of the house. The room I had, had a shared bathroom but no one else was in the bedroom opposite of mine while I was there, so I had it to myself. Her home is extremely clean. Shoes are taken off at the entry. Maria is very kind and hospitable. She showed me around the house when I first arrived. I was able to put my little cooler bag in the fridge and my ice packs in the freezer. I slept well. I like a dark room and it was plenty dark for me. I kept the ceiling fan on all night and it felt great! The bed was a little more firm than my own at home, but very comfortable. I woke up feeling well rested! I was traveling alone and I really liked staying here. I think I would've felt uneasy by myself at a hotel and I don't think I would've slept well. Maria's home was perfect for my needs. This will be my first choice when staying in Yuma again!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"María is a great host, reliable and accesible. Location is great.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"very nice place. very convenient. I will want to stay again. would've been nice to know up front in the advertising that the heated pool needed to be turned on and was 60.00 or 40.00/ day depending where the info was. we did use it one day and with the temps being so low it was quite chilly but my Grandkids and I were determined to swim, so we did! lots of fun!@"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home! It was incredibly cozy for our stay, we loved the fireplace. As always Chris’ homes are designed incredibly nice and it feels like a luxury stay.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From start to finish, Chris' place was a wonderful stay. We arrived early (my car clock jumped forward an hour for Arizona, when the time didn't actually change). Regardless, Chris responded and allowed us entry. The house is newly renovated and decorated beautifully. Everything is clean, pristine and tasteful, but modern and still comfortable. The kitchen had what we needed to cook a couple of meals as well as a nice bbq outside. The master bedroom and bath are large and lovely, and the freestanding tub is gloriously big, as is the shower. The other 2 bedrooms are also beautifully renovated, as is their shared bathroom. The open living, dining area and kitchen separate the master suite from the other two bedrooms, which would make the house nice for couples or families with kids. The backyard has a nice grassy area, as well as a small dining patio, bbq area and pool. The neighborhood is very quiet, safe and peaceful. Chris was extremely responsive. I'd love to stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was great. Chris was great. Overall a great stay.

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,This house was so beautiful and peaceful hood I will come back Chris is a great people and knows how to communicate with people
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chris is an amazing host. Literally felt like we were staying at a friend's house. Extremely friendly, responsive and supportive. We felt comfortable from the minute we walked in the front door. The home was spotless, pool warm and inviting and the host made everything smooth as silk. Absolutely will stay again when our travels take us through Yuma. Worth every penny! Thanks Chris!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chris’s house was incredible! Spacious, clean, comfortable, quiet neighborhood, cute yard, perfect pool, nice kitchen, comfortable beds- I could go on and on. Chris was also a wonderful host and was extremely responsive and kind during our stay. I will definitely book her place again when I come back to the area! Don’t hesitate to book this home!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Chris's house is right out of a magazine! It's well furnished and decorated. The living room furniture is uber comfortable, with a big enough couch for four adults to spread out on to watch a movie.
The kitchen is a chef's kitchen, and there was a surprising amount of appliances in the pantry, everything from a kettle and microwave, to a juicer and blender, not to mention two different kinds of coffee makers. He also left some nice treats for us, which was a lovely touch!
Having two king bedrooms is a real plus! The master suite is beyond spacious. It's absolute luxury with the large walk-in shower, beautiful soaker tub, double sink vanity, and plenty of storage room for toiletries.
The backyard is an oasis with real grass, trees, and shrubs! We've stayed several times in Yuma and most rentals have astroturf. We didn't use the pool as the weather wasn't extremely cooperative. The outdoor grille area is also a nice touch!
Chris was an extremely responsive and wonderful host!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Place was everything it was supposed to be !
What made it special
Was Chris The world needs more people like her. So accommodating!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great experience! We stayed over Christmas and within 24 hours of our request, Chris had a tree put up for our kiddos to walk into when we arrived! There was even Christmas party favors, chocolate and a nice card set out for us! You won’t leave disappointed!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptional experience from start to finish! My husband and I are very fortunate to have traveled extensively through the states and overseas, and this stay ranks as our number 1 stay regarding hospitality with our accommodations. The host, Chris, went waaaayyyy above and beyond to make sure our stay was great. We requested that a few specific items be available in the home, and he actually went out purchased them brand new so we would be accommodated. We didn’t even ask him to this….he offered and delivered! We extended our stay by two additional days and he even delivered additional supplies so we would have everything we needed (again without us even needing to ask!). The home was eat off the floor clean, and minimally and tastefully decorated. The home appeared brand new or very recently remodeled. We would stay here again in an absolute heartbeat! Chris was a phenomenal host. Thank you, Chris!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,I don't want to

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home. Nice mattresses and extra blankets were available. Furniture was comfy with lots of pillows and blankets to cover up with while watching tv. It was quite chilly in the house but the thermostat had a combination lock on it so we couldn't change it. Fully stocked kitchen so we greatly appreciated a kitchen that was easy to cook in as well as clean up after ourselves. Plenty of sponges, soaps, towels even spices. Bathrooms were clean and had very fluffy bath towels even by the pool. Back home, I'm used to a warmer pool and, though heated, I didn't feel it was warm enough but hubby went swimming a bit. Some instructions on the TV, stovetop could have been helpful. Super clean and so nice to have access to to garage. Will definitely stay again if in the area."

All in all, 5 stars and would stay here again!"

It was very clean and exactly as described.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Irvin's place is perfect to stay at while in Yuma. The house is beautifully designed and the pool is the seller while staying in Yuma.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot speak highly enough of this home! Our jaws hit the floor walking in through the front door - the photos do not do the space justice, nor do they accurately portray just how large the space is. It was clean, had excellent amenities and was perfect for cooking and spending time with family. The location is great and makes travel easy, but is tucked back where it’s quiet and serene. The pool was nice and warm, the patio was a great space to hang out and all the seating options were cozy. The beds were comfortable and bedrooms were extremely spacious. If you are visiting family in Yuma, or traveling in a larger group - this place is an absolute must!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just off the freeway but set back enough you don’t hear the noise of the traffic. Very quiet! Easy to get in and out of. Only 30 minutes to Fishers Landing. Would stay here again. Very clean and exactly as described..

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The home was beautifully situated on a private street with no noisy distractions. The pool was clean and heated. The two bedrooms were full suites on opposite sides of the house which was ideal for us. We would definitely recommend this home!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great, beautiful space. Would stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is absolutely beautiful! My family of 7 stayed here one night while we were on our way to Peoria for Padres Spring Training. The house was extremely clean and provided my family with everything we needed during our short stay. My kids loved the pool. The open concert of the main area of the house allowed all of us to be in one space together without feeling overcrowded. Our only regret is that we didn’t spend more time here. We definitely hope to be back in the area so we can stay at this house again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house, absolutely spotless. Irvin was the most responsive host ever! Beds were comfortable, we had everything we need. This is a great place to stay in Yuma"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at Irvin's Airbnb and it was a great experience. The property was clean, well-maintained and had all the necessary amenities to make my stay comfortable and enjoyable.
The property itself was spacious, with plenty of natural light and modern furnishings. The bedroom was cozy and the bed was very comfortable. The house has everything you would need for your stay.
Both bedrooms in the home are very large, so when we go back in the future, it would be super easy to have some family with us as well.
The check-in process couldn't have been any easier. The key is in the lock box and you get right in. The garage is huge! This was great for us as we had some bikes on our car with a bike rack so we had no issues getting the entire car and the bikes in the garage.
Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The layout of the house was perfect for two couples. The two large bedrooms with private baths were separated by the kitchen and living areas. Each bedroom had access to the pool area via private doors. The kitchen had the basics for making meals. The beds were comfortable and extra pillows and blankets were accessible in the walk in closets. The outside of the house had beautiful landscaping with seating to enjoy the outdoors. Even though the house was located close to the freeway it was extremely quiet. Irvin was very responsive to any questions we had. The pool looked inviting, but it was too cold for our group, so we didn’t utilize it. I’m sure on a hot Arizona day it would be refreshing."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We very much enjoyed our five week stay at Irvin's beautiful home. It was exceptionally clean, very comfortable, and conveniently located. We appreciated being able to watch Netflix movies on the large screen TV.

We highly recommend Irvin and his lovely home!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely beautiful and perfect in every way. It was so peaceful which is what we were looking for. Unfortunately we weren’t able to enjoy the pool, the outdoor temperature was just too cold. I’m not sure if there was a way to turn up the heat. I made a dinner and had everything I needed for that. The bed was so comfortable and the blankets were so soft. We didn’t want to leave!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home with the heated pool.
Huge living space and was well stocked with whatever we would need.
The only thing I would personally do is put the couch with a pull out bed in the living room rather than in a room.
Also maybe leave instructions on how to use the stove top properly it was a learning experience for us lol
All in all the home was amazing. The location out of the way and peaceful."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Great location close to the freeway. Would definitely recommend.

2022-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place. Super Clean. Looks just like the pictures. Super high end appliances, cook top took a video to learn how to use lol. Location was great for my reason I was visiting in yuma, may be a bit too far out of town for some.
Irvin was super quick to answer any questions.
Would have gave 5 stars but pool heater was broken and was not notified, had to contact him about why pool was so cold. We Rented the place because of the pool, was a bummer sitting by the pool but way too cold to use. He did explain to me previous renters did damage pool heater and he had to turn off because of fire hazard. I really wish some people would take care of rental places like it was their own so others can enjoy it too.
Hope to stay there again next time I visit yuma."

There was plenty of space and the open concept was incredibly helpful for our group. There were four distinct sitting areas including kitchen bar for four, dining table for six, couches and chairs in the TV and lounge area, and the pool room. The open concept made everything distinct yet connected. We used every space across our time together for eating, connecting, and hanging out. The space was so very clean and pristine. A true delight! The gorgeous mountains are a huge plus. Great stay and I very highly recommend this gorgeous home."
