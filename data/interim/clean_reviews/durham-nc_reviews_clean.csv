2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amos’ place was as described, in a safe neighborhood with plenty of parking and a great value if looking for a comfy bed for a weekend visit to Durham. Also nice was that my friend was able to bring her pup. The apartment was free of dog hair even though it is pet friendly. The place was well stocked with thoughtful conveniences such as bug spray, doggie bags and Q-tips. Thanks Amos!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We have no complaints about our stay with Amos. He was very responsive, allowed us to check in an hour early when we asked, and made us feel right at home. It was the perfect set up for our dog, with a fenced in back yard and in an area easy for walking. It’s the perfect location to be right next to downtown, but also far enough to have quiet and privacy."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amos' place is very comfortable and well-located. I didn't have my dog with me, but I know it can often be a challenge to find dog welcoming places on road trips. Amos' place is perfectly set up for that which I appreciate as an occasional dog-traveller. As for we humans, the bed was comfortable, the AC nice and cool, and the couch comfy for working and watching shows. It's a great value."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Really chill overnight stay. Clean and safe!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice place and we enjoyed the privacy. Amos was polite and responsive when I messages.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amos was a great host! He was very responsive before booking when I had questions about his pet policy. He was also very helpful and flexible when I realized last minute that I'd made a mistake with my original booking. The place was exactly as described and his instructions/information was very clear and helpful. The place itself was cute and cozy and perfect for what I needed. His place was very pet friendly with bowls, a big dog bed, waste bags, cleaning supplies, towels, and blankets for my dogs. Everything was clearly labeled so I knew what could or couldn't be used for them too (towels/blankets/etc). My dogs loved his big fenced-in backyard which was the biggest perk!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time at Amos' place. The location is easy to find and convenient, a short drive to the downtown area which we appreciated. The space itself felt nice and private and the ability to sit out in the backyard in the mornings was nice. I would definitely recommend Amos' place to others. Great value and very friendly host.
Thanks!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute spot tucked away in a great neighborhood in durham. Loved the spacious backyard and decor. Really nice to be able to walk a few blocks to good coffee shops, breweries, restaurants, and local parks. Amos was super responsive and very kind. Will definitely stay here again when my pup and I come back to durham."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks for a great stay
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amos was great host! It was perfect stay for few days at very reasonable price. The bed was super comfortable and one of the best I have stayed in while traveling!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This place was just what we needed for our 2-3 day stay in Durham. It was easy to access, in close proximity to downtown areas, comfortable, private, and quiet. All the amenities were there and it was convenient having a washer/dryer, and other little extras. We had our cat stay with us, and she was super comfortable there. It was clean, with the exception of a little pet hair, which is understandable when you're hosting pets. The house is on the older side, and perhaps needs a little TLC. The shower was quite tight and uncomfortable. These were the only downsides (but I might also be slightly pickier than most people) and easy to overlook because this apartment overall was great. And Amos was friendly and very responsive!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Amo's place was just as advertised. It was well appointed for a short term stay, clean, and comfortable. He was very responsive and his instructions were very clear. The fenced in yard was wonderful for our dog."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfectly met my needs
Easy communication and amenities exceeded expectation."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Just fine for a two night stay! House is in pretty bad condition outside, but inside had all the basic things I needed."

He was able to roam yard and do hound dog stuff and that was just the best !!!"

Nothing fancy but has everything you need for a comfy sleep and we appreciated the extra dog towels,bowls and blankets provided. We were able to scoot out to nearby restuarants and parks very easily. Thanks Amos!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amos was a friendly, kind host. The room was exactly as described and pictured in the listing and minutes away from Duke, the downtown area, and most of the major roads. I got to see Durham in late winter/early spring and couldn't have asked for a nicer place to crash while I was doing it!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amos is great with communication. The place is very private. Everything is super clean. It's also perfect for bringing a pet. He provides a dog bed, bowls and blankets for your furry friends. The space is cozy and super cute. I will be returning when we come back to the area. It's only a mile, walking distance, to downtown. The neighborhood is nice and so are the neighbors. We ran into several people as we were leaving this morning and they were all very friendly. Highly recommended!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"we felt so at home, as did our dog! great stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a good experience with this Airbnb. Amos sent clear check-in instructions with pictures. He also encouraged us to read over the house rules ahead of arrival. The place looks just like the pictures. They provided coffee, tea, bottled water, and a few snacks. There is a RING doorbell as you enter. We brought our dog and appreciated the fenced in backyard."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was wonderful....perfect for what I was looking for. I was there for work and it offered me the peace and quiet I needed in my off hours. I especially loved the fact that the bed was comfortable and that there were several TV apps available to guests for entertainment which was a pleasant surprise. I was there during one of our famous cold spells in NC and the unit was a little on the cold side during my stay but there was a space heater there which helped out a lot! I would definitely recommend this Airbnb and I am sure I will be back the next time business brings me back to the Durham area.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy check in and comfortable stay. Heads up (literally) for tall folks- low ceilings in this charming old home.
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Very comfortable space, especially for traveling with a dog."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thanks for a great stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This apartment was perfect for our short stay! We loved being close enough to bars and restaurants to walk through a very sweet neighborhood. The bed is the most comfortable in a rental that we’ve had in ages. We didn’t bring a dog but as dog people I appreciate how thoughtfully Amos has the apt prepared for pup guests. We will happily return to this rental anytime we’re in Durham!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I was only in town for one night for a concert but this was a nice stay! I everything we needed was available and then some. I didn’t bring any pets with me but it was well stocked if I had. There was absolutely no pet smells if that is something you are worried about. I would definitely book this location again for future travels.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can’t say enough about how great our stay was. We spent three nights over Thanksgiving - my fiancé, dog and myself. The space makes you feel right at home. It’s very private and cozy. There were even dog bowls and a dog bed available, which I thought was so adorable and kind. Nice kitchen area that was stocked with all we needed - utensils, snacks, coffee and teas. Comfy bed, even a sound machine (I need to get one of my own now) and a nice living area with couch and tv. Amos is a very responsive and helpful host. When we’re back in town we will definitely look to stay here again! Thanks, Amos!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amos has a wonderful suite very close to all the amazing things Durham has to offer. It is a beautiful house that was lit up when I arrived and easy to get in even though it was past sundown. Parking on the street was not an issue at all. The place itself is exactly as described and you will feel instantly right at home. I hope to be back as I drive through the area often and it's a beautiful halfway point to stop. Thanks, Amos!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Good location, pet friendly, and has some charm. Not really worth the price though, and for the price I should not have to put sheets in the washer and start it."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amos was so responsible and flexible. The space was clean and comfortable, and I appreciated how well everything was labeled and organized. Linens were fresh and smelled lovely. It was great to have a big backyard for my dog to explore."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! Everything was as described. The location is fantastic — quiet street, but super close to so much of what we wanted to explore in Durham!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here with our two dogs for one night to see a Duke basketball game. It was good for us because we truly just needed a dog friendly spot where we could shower and rest our heads. The yard was perfect for our dogs to have some space to roam off leash and the space was great for our dogs inside as they don’t require much room. They just sleep in their beds when we aren’t around. Everything was as described. Just like other air bnbs you don’t know the cleaning required of you until you already have the spot. We were asked to strip the bed and start the load of laundry as well as clean any used dishes. Amos was helpful before, during, and after our trip with any questions/needs/concerns! Excellent host!! This place fill all of our needs for our trip."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cute, welcoming place. Felt cozy and comfortable. Would absolutely recommend this place to a friend & would stay there again. Amos, the host, was accommodating and kind. 10/10"

I would definitely recommend staying at their place for a comfortable and enjoyable Airbnb experience."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place was nice with lots of convenient amenities. The only issue was that the yard gate was heavy and broken off the bottom hinge so it was difficult to open and close to keep the dogs in.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Amos’s place! The location is safe & close to town. It felt super private even though the suite is connected to the house.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,A perfect place to land and incredible price - I would love to stay here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I was extremely satisfied with my stay! I was a little worried because I moved to the state and didn’t know the area so it was hard choosing a spot. I lucked out this place was well stocked and extremely comfortable! It was a older house but it had a lot of character and a great yard for my pup to run around in. I went for a walk twice a day the neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful! If I’m in the area I would definitely stay again! 10/10 would recommend!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We ventured out to Durham for my birthday weekend on short notice, and Amos was happy to host us. The space was exactly what we needed for one comfortable night after a full Saturday of activities. The bed was very comfortable, the space and bathroom were very clean. He also had little snack bars and coffee/tea (coffee pot AND Keurig!), everything was labeled so no confusion for what things were or meant for. Also, it felt very homey and cozy! We didn't use the backyard any, but it's vast and clean and great for if you're bringing your doggo."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Just stayed for a night but it was a cozy spot close to everything we needed.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"So happy to have found this Airbnb! Amos's place was close, convenient, and a fantastic deal for the price. We were in town for a night to see Wicked, and after paying for our tickets we didn't want to spend a ton on lodging, so this was a perfect find. A mile walk to the theater meant no paying for parking, and allowed us to explore all that downtown had to offer.
Amos was quick to respond, easy to talk to, and very accommodating. Check-in was a breeze and a few extra touches (water bottles in the fridge for us, Cliff and Kind bars for a little snack, the TV access) were much appreciated! Would definitely stay here again in the future."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amos is a very nice host and easy to communicate! The room is super clean and everything has clear labels. There are also many considerate details in the room, such as a power strip with outlets, USB, and typeC ports, a cool coffee bar with coffee and relaxing herb tea, small side tables for the bed and couch, etc. I really enjoy the stay! Thank you Amos!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The suite was very cozy and exactly what I was looking for when I needed a place while visiting Durham! I felt very comfortable and safe. I will definitely check to see if this place is available when I come visit my family again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amos’s place was great for our one night stay. We were on a road trip and the bed was comfy for crashing + the space was quiet, felt safe, and was close to downtown Durham.
We didn’t need to use it, but it’s super convenient to have a washer/dryer. Also didn’t have much time to enjoy it, but the backyard looked like a nice place to hang.
I didn’t get to meet Amos, but my fiancé did and said he seemed like a great guy!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great airbnb. I would 10 out of 10 recommend especially if i had a dog. Place was clean and quiet. Everything was just great.

Grateful we found this spot.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described. We had a wonderful stay. Some places were walkable others were a very short drive.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Amos' place was exactly what I needed - and when I was running late from delayed flight - Amos was communicative and flexible. Thanks Amos!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amos's place was perfect for my stay. I loved the cozy space he has set up, completely independent of the rest of the house, and with its own entrance. It is close to a bunch of stuff; I didn't have a long stay so didn't get to see everything, but I did like the Durty Bull Brewery basically right down the street. Parking was easy and instructions were clear. Amos was responsive and helpful as a host, including the house guide he put together with local suggestions for just about everything. Highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I recently stayed at Amos' Airbnb in Durham, NC and it was a fantastic experience. The space was cozy and clean, making it the perfect home base for exploring the city. The location was great, with easy access to everything Durham has to offer.
Communication with Amos was top-notch - he was always quick to respond and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. He also provided us with great recommendations for things to do and see in Durham, which really made our trip.
One of the highlights of the Airbnb was the fantastic shower - it was the perfect way to unwind after a day of exploring the city. We also loved having a fridge and coffee maker in the room, which made it easy to enjoy a quick breakfast before heading out for the day.
Overall, I would highly recommend Amos' Airbnb to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay in Durham."

From the moment we walked in, we were in awe of the size of the place and the beautiful natural light. The location made our stay fun and encouraged us to explore. Situated in downtown Durham, we could walk to nearby coffee shops, cafes, and even the bookstore. We appreciated the coziness and privacy of the space where we could eat dinner, watch our favorite shows on TV, and relax after a day of exploring.

Lots of bars to hang and dance. The space is so modern and cute. The only thing is that there is a loud train that goes by throughout the night, but she does offer free ear plugs for this reason. Overall, loved my stay and would stay again!"

2023-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Unique spot. Good communication. Great location downtown. Although it was extremely noisy; the bedroom widow is right next to a parking deck and a block from active train tracks. If you aren’t a deep sleeper then find somewhere else.

Her place is tastefully decorated, well-located, and has everything you’d need. The airy kitchen space is well-equipped — though we did not take advantage of anything besides her tea kettle and coffee maker.

We didn't get a chance to cook, but the kitchen is open, spacious and well equipped. Pleasant touches like books and vinyl records make it and easygoing place to lounge during downtime or between activities.
A word of warning: We were woken up by a series of blaring freight train horns on both weekend days as trains approached the railroad crossing up the street. Light sleepers and late-risers beware."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is an outstanding loft apartment ideally located so close to many fun spots in Downtown Durham--DPAC, restaurants, coffee shops & retail. The apartment itself is sparkling clean, comfortable queen bed, nice walk in closet with full length mirrors, nice open kitchen with all appliances: stove/oven, microwave, refrig/freezer, dishwasher, dishware & utensils, Keurig machine w/pods as well as some snacks--such a nice touch! Decorated so cool with interesting curated pieces of furniture and art. Wonderful books, puzzles and records (yes, there is even a working record player). Plenty of natural light streaming in, especially in the early evening. Nice for just sitting around before going out for the evening. Rachael is terrific at communicating. To my surprise, she got in touch with me the morning I was leaving to go over all the instructions for parking and getting in. After I had been there a couple of hours, she even came back during a working day for her, to get me back in after I accidentally locked myself out (instead of trusting my instincts to trust the code she gave me, I locked the door from the inside)--worried more about me when I was the one incoveniencing her. She couldn't have been more lovely and accommodating. I will definitely stay here next time I'm in Durham. Great place and outstanding service. Thank you Rachael."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is so cute and in an excellent location! Walking distance to everything downtown Durham has to offer, with a close-by parking deck for easy access. Such a unique and cool space - I definitely recommend it and would stay here again!"

As a host, Rachael is kind, prompt, and provides excellent recommendations for things to do while in Durham. Do yourself a favor and book immediately for your special moments, your staycations, or just to treat yourself."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rachel’s apartment is the perfect location- so close to restaurants and bars downtown. It also was so clean-which is so important to me. What really sets this place apart is the owners- my husband and I got locked out on accident (by locking the door handle and not using the fantastic keyless lock that they have) and within the hour- our host came to our rescue! Highly recommend to anyone who wants to be very close to incredible bars/restaurants!

We truly enjoyed the lush vegetative landscaping that made it seem you were miles away from the city when actually it was not that far at all :-). The inside of the house was immaculate, and the personal touches made you feel welcomed and at home. All in all, my wife and I will return and enjoy the tranquility of this beautifully designed tiny house in the trees."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Me and my partner had a great stay! The place was spotless and the screened in porch was great for mornings and cool evenings. Had a bit of an issue with the door lock code. The radio didn’t work and there’s was no TV (stated in description) but for the price, it would’ve been nice to have it at night. Overall, great experience 👍🏻"

2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very peaceful stay at this home. We felt that it was very clean and we didn’t need to ask for anything additional because they thought of everything! Some things that did not impact our stay, but would have been helpful to know is that there is no oven and there are not blinds on every window so it gets bright in the mornings. I would absolutely come back!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hubby and I booked this airbnb for a mini-staycation to connect and relax. This airbnb felt like a home away from home and looked exactly as advertised.
As foodies, we were very surprised to have pour over coffee and French press coffee at our reach - including fresh local coffee beans, grinDer, and digital scale (things that we never bring, so we were so excited to make good coffee during out stay.
The kitchen is full stocked with essentials - pots, pans, base condiments, and more. Part of relaxing this weekend included making kimbap. If I had known there was so many kitchen essentials, I probably could have packed lighter and left certain items at home.
Riley and Gabby were very attentive and gave us stellar recommendations for dinner one night. Their guidebook is stellar, full of fun places to eat within 10 min from the location.
While it's winter, I did enjoy the screened porch and admired the natural surroundings at this tiny home.
We plan to stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little place! Really cool aesthetic and the host was very responsive and helpful!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here! Riley was very friendly and constantly checking in which was very nice. Riley even suggested some local spots that were super yummy! It was secluded but also close enough to nearby retail stores which was exactly what I was looking for. You had all the basic necessities you could need and the overall feel was very home-y. It was a very nice space to decompress and will definitely recommend this place to my friends and families! Can't wait to visit again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great getaway stay especially in a neighborhood that is close to Downtown Durham and other areas surrounding it.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The house is lovely. It is perfect for an off the grid vacation. I liked that there was no tv because it gave me the opportunity to connect with my friends.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place is a wonderful getaway for home. Our dogs loved the screened porch and watching all the squirrels. We found it a great place for us to reconnect as a couple and cook a wonderful meal in a spacious kitchen. I can’t wait to come back.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10 every time. A peaceful refuge from a busy life when you need it with homey and welcoming touches. Riley is a fantastic host!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed Rileys place *immensely* and would return. The space was so well-designed, we took notes. The loft was cozy, checking in and out was a breeze, and the neighborhood felt safe. We loved it, and our doggie did too!
Note that, although it *looks* like a full kitchen, there is no oven. Wasn't a big deal for us because we were planning to eat out, just FYI."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a great home away from home. I’ll have to come back when everything is in bloom. Big thank you to Riley and Gaby! The design and aura was so nice and the outside lights were so romantic that my boyfriend ended up proposing to me here! We will be back to reminisce in the future 🤍
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Riley’s tiny home was very quaint and comfortable. It’s located right off the main road. It was very clean and well kept. We enjoyed our little pit stop here!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This tiny home was perfect for a peaceful baby moon!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a really nice little spot. House is tastefully decorated, bathroom is large for a ""tiny"" house. The bed was very comfortable, wifi worked great, and there was a nice bluetooth speaker/radio. Coffee, restaurants and groceries are just a 5 minute drive away. Check in and check out was very easy and communication was great. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a chill little getaway in very nice surroundings. 10/10, no notes."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The porch area was beautiful. Lots of trees and a swinging chair. It was perfect for cuddling up with a book in the evening and morning. It was next to two houses so not quite private, but like the other neighbors were far away so it still felt like it otherwise. Communication was easy and good. Lots of recommendations."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Riley’s place was a well thought out space. We loved the design and materials they used. It is also surrounded by trees that with plenty of windows. We’ll definitely stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Well kept home with a relaxing atmosphere and comfortable arrangements
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,what a beautiful place to stay.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,My perfect local hide away spot!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Riley was an amazing host all around! They don’t wait until you’re inside their your Airbnb to make sure you don’t need anything etc! It starts well before that I could write a three page review and how satisfied and happy I am with staying with them! Don’t pass up the chance to experience this Airbnb, and host!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"An absolute gem of a find! I want this house! My stay with my pup was unforgettable and perfection! Minutes from everything and some extra tasty eats, yet it's a tranquil escape at the same time. The amenities were perfect - a fully equipped kitchen, laundry, A/C, and high-speed internet. The screened-in porch is basically the best outdoor living room in existence. The bed was sooo comfy. The kitchen felt like being right at home. I actually REALLY enjoyed the no TV element. They also pointed me to great and very well maintained walking trail at the end of their road where I enjoyed morning walks and evening runs with my pup, even saw a few deer. Also, their commitment to inclusivity and planting a tree for each visit is commendable. My stay was a delightful escape, and I'm already planning my next visit with a friend. If you want a unique and peaceful getaway, this is the place to be. Five stars for both the hosts and the home!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny home is in a lovely, leafy part of the city of Durham, but you would never think it. Everything was as described, especially a well-stocked kitchen. Me and my little dog were happy there. Duke University campus and gardens is a very short distance away, worth a visit. Riley was very nice, extremely prompt and helpful. You will not be disappointed."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place with great scenery!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Needed this pause in life as I moved between my work and some grief work due to my husband's death. Sitting in the swinging chair in the screened in porch listening to the birds and squirrels was amazing. Fantastic space, perfectly set up with all the amenities you'd want! Thank you."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,It was a great stay for the two of us! Only thing is we did not expect it to be right next to two other houses. The pictures made it seem very secluded. But other than that it was a cute little house and perfect for a little get away!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home with a beautiful screened in porch. it was rainy all weekend but we loved being on the porch for that. very cozy and felt at home. didn’t realize we would be having such close neighbors, pictures just made it seem very private. other than that it was amazing."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay stayed here with my boyfriend and really enjoyed it was great! Everything was clean too and looked good great place for pictures!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I could just say, “don’t hesitate to book the tiny house”…but that wouldn’t begin to emphasize how truly restorative the experience was.
Getting to the house was very comprehensive. The entrance and surroundings were giving “suburban tropical oasis”. The front porch is the cutest and perfect for yoga during the day and quaint dining during the evening. The kitchen had everything that I needed to make quick meals (I made a very impressive stove top pizza!) and the bathroom was very spacious and luxurious. The loft bedroom was very cozy. I really appreciated that all of the light and ceiling fan fixtures are labeled so I didn’t have to guess where to adjust the lights & fan. The hosts were very responsive and gave great recommendations for hiking and dining. They also gave a little “thank you” box of toffees that I delighted in when I got home later. :) This was a truly relaxing stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space for getaway very close to everything Durham/Chapel Hill has to offer! Clean and spacious tiny home!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I celebrated my birthday weekend at Riley's place and it exceeded all of our expectations. It is a very tranquil setting and the accommodations and amenities are top notch. There are so many small touches, including the welcome note and sweet treat, that we felt right at home. Everything is very high quality and the decor is lovely. We enjoyed relaxing on the screened in porch after an active day of hiking and exploring the area. Riley and his co-host Gaby provided us with excellent recommendations from hiking to parks to dining and unique sights and events in and around town. Communication from booking through our stay was outstanding. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. We absolutely loved Riley's place and hope to return soon!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful and peaceful stay - exactly what I was looking for! This tiny home is truly identical to the photos and was immaculately kept. You won't be disappointed!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, looks as pictured. Place was clean and hosts were great communicators."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My lady and i had been eyeing this stay for a while, and it was definitely worth the trip! Everything look identical to the pics, if not better in person upon arriving. Great ambiance, tidy inside, very helpful hosts, and it’s pretty secluded for being in Durham. If you’re looking to get away and breathe for a bit, i’d say overall that this one of the best stays i’ve had so far! I can’t think of many others than can rival this trip, 10/10!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,That Tiny house was a great getaway . was definitely worth the price. There are a lot of design decisions made for that house which add to the joy of staying there.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic stay!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great getaway!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It’s a beautiful tiny home. Perfect for Cozy getaway! Great hosts!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The tiny house is an absolute gem. My dog and I stayed here for 4 nights and we would return without a doubt. Riley and Gaby’s home is the perfect mixture of being close to things while still feeling pleasantly secluded. And I mean, if that porch doesn’t convince you to stay here then I don’t know what will.
Their house looked exactly like it did in the pictures—if not better in person. The property was clean, thoughtfully appointed and designed, and had all the amenities one might need. And as promised, the bed and sheets were top quality.
Riley and Gaby are the epitome of ideal hosts and both went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was a comfortable and welcoming one. They went the extra mile as hosts and it showed, which makes this an easy recommendation for me.
Thanks for sharing your home with us!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Riley's place is just fantastic. The photos looked too good to be true but the home is really as beautiful and vibey as it looks. The bnb is generously stocked as well which was a pleasant surprise. Riley is perfectly friendly and professional and accommodating as he can be. We would absolutely go back. Can't recommend enough.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,wonderful place! highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A wonderful little oasis hidden off Hope Valley. A deer came and laid down in the garden while we were on the screened-in porch. The place is small but not crampt, with a lot of attention to little details. We had a great stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful place to be even if it was for one day. The house is wonderful and very welcoming. It was very clean and with good airflow. And the best thing for us was that it was surrounded by trees and while we were on the porch, a deer was grazing unbothered and stayed with us for a while. We are definitely planning to return and will recommend this place to our friends.
Five stars!!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I had a lovely weekend getaway at Riley’s place. I recommend them highly. We look forward to coming back.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely lovely home to vacation. Very clean, modern, and did not need for anything. Amazing recommendations for local restaurants. Guglhupf bakery and cafe was amazing!
You have a lovely view to wake up to, quiet, and relaxing. I was happy about no tv, I wanted to get away from technology and just be where I was. The a/c worked perfectly.
This is a great vacation spot to get away for a few days. Thank you Riley for your hospitality, you are a great host."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed Riley's place, especially the screen porch and the proximity to a lovely dog walking path. The kitchen was also really nice and spacious to work in, and the bathroom felt like a spa. Great escape from the city and nice quiet to unplug in!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although a simple 4-room space, this house is so well designed that it felt roomier than the square footage. The setting is lush, nearly tropical, not what you’d expect in suburbia. The kitchen’s well equipped, bed comfortable, plenty of towels—adding up to a wonderful stay. Lovely plus, the rattan hanging chair on the porch—I’d never sat in one before, serene experience."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very responsive host and great over all!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Riley’s tiny house is a dream, surrounded by all kinds of green. We brought our little baby and a pet for a getaway vacation. Everyone seems like the place. It was clean and well designed. I really love the details of the decoration. Not mention it’s so close to everything! Highly recommended!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Riley was an awesome host!! He responded very quickly to our questions!! The Airbnb was the perfect size for two people for a couples getaway!! The decor was lovely and we found ourselves taking pictures of it to do something similar with our apartment! We also enjoyed the connivence of downtown Durham being only ten minutes away!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I found this a lovely and relaxing place to stay, very thoughtfully equipped with kitchen and coffee setup (though we did bring our own toaster oven).

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Riley and Gaby were wonderful hosts! Both were communicative and shared lots of info prior and during my stay to make sure I got settled in safely.
Highly recommend staying here, not an in and out accomodations...get ready to make it a nice night in, I promise you'll be recharged and refreshed in no time!
I fell in love with the ambiance and design of the place. I've such a fascination with tiny homes and this spot definitely met my expectation if not more. I was so impressed!
I stayed at the tiny home the entire duration of my stay and it had everything I needed. It was quaint yet modern and so cozy and comfortable! If I have the opportunity to visit again I will!
Thanks for having me!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As shown and described! The whole setup and decor made you feel at home and it was just enough space for my wife and I. I'd say book it if you want that feeling of being away from home, but not too far away. The seclusion piece was a nice touch as well!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Riley's place is everything you see in the listing, and then some. Beautifully decorated, clean, and comfortable, from the moment I walked in I felt right at home. Plentiful linens, fully stocked, you will lack for nothing in RIley's space. Nice amenities such as local candy, coffee and ingredients to make a drink rounded out a perfect weekend in Durham."

This perfect hideaway was the highlight of our long weekend in Durham - well located, within a close driving distance to a myriad of great local spots and Duke campus. It felt like a true escape from the city with each window giving you a perfect vantage point to the leafy woods outside. The interior layout, while tiny, is incredibly spacious with fresh, modern details, great lighting, and a fantastic porch to enjoy the outdoors. Riley and Gaby were so welcoming and communicative + especially helpful in their local recommendations, making sure we had access to everything we needed. We'd stay again in a heartbeat!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, the house was beautiful and the host was respectful. The only problem I had was the ants, I don’t know where they were coming from but they popped up on my second day there. Aside from the ants, I enjoyed my experience."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed our 3 night stay. The location was great for exploring the area (by car).

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great weekend getaway ! Perfect for a rainy night in.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the tiny house! It was our first year anniversary, and we wanted something cozy and tucked away. The neighborhood was very peaceful and quiet. There’s a lot to do in the area, we enjoyed local restaurants and also local hiking. Duke University is close by and lots of shops. Our hosts were great! Check in and check out were very easy! The house had everything that we required we thoroughly love the screened in porch and swinging chair. Would definitely like to come again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of our favorite Airbnb's to date. So comfortable and peaceful.
We enjoyed the incredible weather out on the porch morning noon and night. We brought along a bluetooth speaker which I'd highly recommend! (some LoFi tunes were just what was needed while playing cards and having conversation)
Making pour over coffee was definitely a treat for us, as well!
Couldn't have been any better. Thanks for creating a wonderfully peaceful place to share :)"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was just as pictured- extremely clean, peaceful, cozy, only 10+ mins from every awesome restaurant downtown, but still made you feel like you were tucked away in the middle of the woods. We were lucky since we were able to wake up & fall asleep to the sound of rain one day, which felt surreal being surrounded by all of the greenery. The place was amazing, the hosts were proactive with communicating, and the location was just perfect. Thank you for an incredible stay!"

I would give this spot a 1000000/10 highly recommend to anyone on their next getaway in the Durham area !"

Walking through the space it is incredibly clean with added touches to ensure that the space was prepared just for you. Although I was only here for the night, the kitchen appeared well stocked if you wanted to cook your own meal during your stay. Enjoying a cup of coffee in the sun room and reading a book in the swing are just such nice touches you really can’t beat! You get a nice woodsy, outdoorsy feel while still being right within the neighborhood . Very accessible to Chapel Hill/UNC/Duke with lots of greats options for exploring the area! Would’ve loved to stay longer and absolutely recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The accommodations were exactly as described - a tiny house amongst the trees. It was a hard place to leave as it was lovely to just sit and enjoy the natural light that filtered in. A very nice spot with great hosts.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Riley’s place was absolutely beautiful! We really enjoyed all the aspects of the tiny house, the loft and the screened in porch were my favorite things. Riley was also a VERY attentive host and super friendly. We really loved this place and are very happy with our decision to stay here! The only thing I would have preferred is if there was more of a yard space for the dog to use the bathroom, we usually had to take him for actual walks to fully do his business. Which isn’t at all an issue but definitely glad we had prepared for that with long leads and what not. Overall it was a really nice stay and Riley was a really awesome host. Bonus, we met his new rescue puppy, Lasso. Thanks for everything Riley ❤️🐾"
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"While this place was not in the middle of nowhere, it definitely felt like we had our privacy and the home was tucked away in its own little section of the woods.

Durham is a unique place, and having a unique place to stay adds to the entire experience."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This tiny home was perfect for our visit to the Raleigh/Durham area. It was super cute, very clean, in a convenient/safe location, and the owner was very hospital. He gave us local recommendations to the area and was very accommodating. We plan to return in the future."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So beautiful and magical! We had thunderstorms both nights which were so cool to see from both inside and outside. Was truly like a treehouse in the rainforest. It was quiet at night, and very very romantic of a spot. Everything was great!"

Stay here, you will be happy that you did."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a special and unique place to stay. It felt like we were in the forest but it was centrally located to be able to explore the area around Durham and RTP. Perfect way to stay cool in the summer and enjoy some wine or coffee without all the bugs!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect place to stay! Riley and Gaby were thoughtful hosts; I appreciated their detailed and timely communication, both before and during my visit.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So charming! Thank you for a great place to host a couple coworkers for a few days.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pretty Vacant is an incredible space! We stayed for my niece’s graduation and didn’t want to leave. It was the perfect place for my family to gather for a glass of wine and so incredibly charming. And, the wine bar and staff downstairs is so cute and inviting.
One thing to note is that the back patio of the wine bar is noisy (music and people chatting like the should be) until 12am on a Saturday night. It didn’t bother us upstairs because the music was sooo good and we weren’t going to bed early. But, if you are sensitive to sound or need to go to bed early, bring some ear plugs. Either way, it was 200% worth it.
Would stay here again and again.
And Sylvia had everything dialed in and is so responsive and easy-going."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I wish I could live at Pretty Vacant Loft
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pretty Vacant exceeded our expectations! We were there celebrating my birthday and had a beautiful intimate dinner party. Couldn't have asked for a more gorgeous space to host a gathering with my close friends! Space was clean and well-stocked, beds were comfortable, and checking in and out was so easy. We will be talking about this stay for a long time! Thanks to Sylvia for being such a communicative and generous host."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,What a cool spot in a great location!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We have traveled a lot and stayed in a lot of airbnbs. Pretty Vacant is our favorite of all of them. The place is just the coolest, and comfortable and in a great location if you are looking for a downtown hideaway. Also having Killer Queen Wine Bar (fun and welcoming in itself) right there was great. Sylvia could not have been more responsive and generous as a host. We can't recommend this place highly enough."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time I have stayed at Silvia’s place. I love it so much! It’s so well decorated and comfy. The beds and all the linens are high quality. The kitchen has everything you need. It’s just perfect!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the best place I have ever rented through AirBnB. The place was gorgeous and so unique. The attention to detail was above and beyond. It was so easy to communicate with them and they went out of their way to welcome us! I will absolutely stay here again and recommend to anyone!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lindsey and Silvia thought of everything!
We both just wanted to say that you have an extraordinary home and an absolutely fantastic attention to detail.
We've never stayed in an AirBnB as well done and as well thought out and with such amazing design as yours. Thank you for so much for an amazing stay and we will be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can’t say enough good things about the Pretty Vacant loft, and our experience with the hosts. We hosted a 12 person sit down dinner at the loft, and the host had set up the space beforehand to accommodate our party (including setting out the exact number of plates and cups and everything we would need). The space was absolutely beautiful and had such a unique vibe. The hosts were incredibly responsive and helpful every step of the way. Wonderful experience!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was immaculate! The pictures truly don’t do it justice. As soon as you step inside Silvia’s Airbnb you can see the attention to detail that was put into their home and it’s those things that make this stay such an amazing experience. All the decor and artwork throughout the house was so cool. It felt like you were walking down the red carpet when you stepped into the home. I highly recommend staying at Silvia’s place if you’re visiting Durham, especially if you enjoy wine. Location is great and walking distance to everything.
The coffee was excellent and the complementary bottle of wine made for a nice warm welcome! We will definitely stay again next time we’re in Durham."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend staying here! The apartment is even better in real life - it’s a beautiful space with high quality amenities.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pretty Vacant is beautiful and feels like an indulgence given the opulent decor. This would be a great place for a vacation or retreat from the norm, but we were in town for work and it was perfect! Having Killer Queen wine bar downstairs was the cherry on top. Like the home, the aesthetics, wine, and food are nicely appointed and the service is great. Will return in the future."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I held an hour long meeting with a dozen attendees. I’d made wine and food arrangements with the Killer Queen wine bar downstairs. The wine was there when I arrived and her staff brought the food up at 7:00, right on schedule. Everyone was impressed with the space and had a ball."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful space. It truly felt magical walking into the living room/kitchen/great room. Silvia paid attention to even the smallest details to welcome us. We were staying for a concert and they had that artists station playing in the apartment. The linens were so comfortable I asked where they were from. The space had everything you needed. 10/10, can’t wait to find a reason to stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Pretty Vacant was amazing! The space is gorgeous and the hosts thought of every special touch! Sweet notes, full coffee and tea service, complimentary wine. The coolest atmosphere located above a wine bar. So many restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance. We will definitely be back - we honestly never wanted to leave because the vibe was super chill!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This has to be one of the best Airbnb’s I have ever stayed at. It is even better than than the pictures.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed at PV to celebrate my birthday and it was an experience from check-in to check-out. It is so well appointed and just beautiful. It blew my dinner guests away! I definitely plan to stay and host here in the future.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Walking in, we were immediately taken aback by the incredible friendly, gorgeous accommodations. Absolutely classy and spotless, bright and inviting, cozy and warm, we wanted to move in!! The mattress and linens are high quality and oh so comfortable. The kitchen….where to begin. This kitchen could host a beautiful and intimate event. There is not one detail overlooked. The hosts are lovely and communicative. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND this property. It’s worth every penny."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Came to town for a wedding weekend and chose not to have a car. Plenty to do within walking distance! The wine bar downstairs had perfect late night snacks for arrival night and beds were really comfy. Great stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you would rather see more than 4 cream walls and the smell of dirty feet of a local hotel room, add Pretty Vacant to your favorites. This property displays so much uniqueness and was perfect for the whole aesthetic of the weekend away! Pretty vacant was a great host! Responded very quickly, and was very accommodating to our needs/requests. Check-in instructions were super detailed and helpful to include photos! The loft was very clean and well stocked with extra goodies for our moms weekend away! Pictures on the internet do not do this property justice wow factor. Location was fab. Conveniently located over a wine bar and walking distance to shopping, food, bars and our fav a tattoo shop! Overall a wonderful place; we would stay here again easily!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,So thankful for these two hosts! Very responsive and extremely friendly! Would stay here again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,My boyfriend and I stayed at Pretty Vacant to celebrate his birthday and kick off our vacation. The loft is beautiful and is decorated incredibly. It felt upscale and comfortable at the same time. It has all the amenities you would need and we recieved complimentary cookies and wine! I would recommend visiting Killer Queen downstairs while staying here. The wine bar staff was very friendly and super knowledgable. The selection and food there were also amazing Try the warm cookies! I would highly recommend reserving this loft for a great night in downtown Durham with an attentive host.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely wonderful place. We had an amazing celebration and everyone was in awe!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Once in a blue moon, you discover an AirBnB space so remarkable, so compelling, and so special, that you hesitate when it comes to sharing it with the whole wide world. Pretty Vacant is one such place.
For starters, it's named for a Sex Pistols song - that alone cranks up the hip factor exponentially. It's also located directly above an amazing wine bar and equally compelling record store. And it features a classic turntable, excellent sound system and an amazing collection of records to choose from during your stay. Indeed, we made good use of all of these resources during our stay.
Exquisite attention and care have gone into decorating Pretty Vacant, and the owner's love of the arts is apparent in every nook and cranny. We easily could have spent the night simply relaxing and relishing in Pretty Vacant's aura. In truth, we might return someday and do just that.
Silvia & Lindsay have curated a remarkable ""experience."" It's a space like no other, and worth your attention."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Second time staying at Pretty Vacant and cannot wait to stay again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This is now one of my favorite airbnbs of all time! It is even better than the photos.

We walked to restaurants and relaxed in the space. The beds and bedding were comfy and qualify. It was perfect!

Location. Remarkable creativity in this historical building the art work and staging make you want to blend in the decor."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pretty Vacant far exceeded our expectations on every level. There is such attention to every little detail, including clearly labeled instructions for utilizing the amazing sound system to the “hidden” tv projector. The decor is thoughtful and gorgeous. The space was immaculate. The ambience was everything we desired for the wine dinner we hosted there."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I hesitate to write a review of this place because I don’t really want people to know about it for purely selfish reasons - if it gets as popular as it should be then I won’t be able to book it when I want. Honestly, this is one of the best properties on Airbnb. It’s spacious, the decor is awesome, it is comfortable, it is clean, and it’s located in a good area of downtown Durham for nightlife (especially at the wine bar directly downstairs owned by the same people). Sylvia is really responsive and everything was really perfect. I will be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and very convenient. Had a great time.

Absolutely gorgeous apartment, with the comfiest bed, and a beautiful space to hang and relax, or perfect for entertaining a group. This would be perfect for a dinner with family and friends- it has everything you need to host a group. I was by myself and it still felt cozy and intimate.
The towels were the softest I've ever felt! The design is both warm and inviting, but also fun and joyful. Silvia is the ultimate host and was incredibly easy to contact if any need arises. And you can pop down to the wine bar below for the best Chocolate Chip Cookie of your life! Can't wait to return."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lindsay and Silvia's place was unforgettable and the most beautiful and unique Airbnb we have ever stayed in. We are super host ourselves and we were incredibly impressed with how immaculate the place was. They really went above and beyond and made us feel so welcomed and right at home from the moment we got there. The place is even bigger than we thought and the decor is out of this world it felt like we were celebrities staying here. Every thing we looked at had an elevated sense of style, art and intentionality that only a true interior artist can achieve and we felt we had found a gem that needs to be showcased in a TV show show where- You will not find any like this place any where else for the price. It was was an unforgettable stay and our memories here with our friends will last forever. Everyone fell in love with our airbnb and we can wait to come back to visit!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,My sister and I stayed there to celebrate our birthdays. It will be a memory we will always cherish.!! The loft is absolutely amazing and the fact that it’s above an incredible wine bar makes it all the more special. We’re even talking about trying to come back once a month just to have a nice R&R recharge to look forward to. Highly recommend!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is incredibly beautiful and set up for a successful stay in Durham or to host a few friends. It has everything you need to host a small gathering and it has the most comfortable beds. The bathrooms are pristine, the fridge starts you off with some bread, butter, sparkling water and wine; You really do feel right at home. It’s right above one of the best wine bars in Durham and you can’t even tell ( noise wise). You can hear loud cars pass by if you’re sitting in the living room but that’s to be expected considering the amazing location.
All in all this is a great spot and highly recommend it."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow factor plus some!!! This place is by far my most fav airbnb to date! Cool, hip, and cozy, every detail is absolute perfection. From the projector, to the large dining table table, exposed brick, huge kitchen island, vintage record player and twinkle lights, it’s a dream come true! Thank you for an amazing stay in a hip, whimsical place! We’ll be back for sure!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful loft, so tastefully done! Silvia thought of everything!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,What an incredible and unique apartment! Everything was exquisite! Can’t wait to stay here again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our stay at Pretty Vacant. The space looked even better than the pictures. This was our first time in Durham and the location was easily walkable to everything. Great little “Bulldega” down the street for any wine or food supplies we needed, lots of local brew pubs, local eateries, bakeries and of course we stopped into Killer Queen Wine Bar every night and were treated like celebrities by the host and staff. We will definitely be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Silvia’s place far exceeded my expectations. As soon as walking into the Airbnb and walking around, I immediately extended my reservation because I wanted more time in the lovely home. It was beautifully decorated with great care and the space is truly perfect for hosting. I wish I could’ve used the kitchen more with all that it had to offer but I intend to stay here again in the future to take full advantage of all the amenities."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was amazing and Silvia was an amazing host - so helpful and responsive we will be staying there again for sure - the restaurants were amazing and had a great time at the ball park
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I hesitate to write a review of how great this spot was because it will become impossible to get again once the word is out.
We stayed here for a post-Durham Bulls game evening of snacks with family and friends (using the great kitchen and 14-person dining table) and then my wife and I spent the night. There are no negatives about this location, especially if you plan to take advantage of the kitchen.
The hosts are incredibly responsive and ready to offer assistance and ideas. The location is convenient and lively. The space inspires fun."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We always enjoy staying at Pearl Mill Flats! Robert and Andrea are excellent hosts and the grounds are particularly lovely at this time of year. This comfy apartment is my go-to Durham getaway. Great location and walkable to all kinds of good food and entertainment.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I found this gem of a stay on short notice and SO glad I did. It was perfectly clean, quant, and within walking distance to so many options for social hour and dinner! Very comfortable bed, great water pressure in the shower. Friendly neighbors. I wish I could give this one a six star rating; I really would! Highly recommend this location."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. Clean, easy check in, close to many restaurants."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Robert and Andrea were incredibly hospitable and kind. Their condo was ideally located for us, within easy distance of family members and downtown destinations. It's a lovely walking neighborhood, too. They were also very flexible, as we had an emergency during our stay, about checkout procedures and times. They anticipated touches that were helpful during our stay, from providing Saran Wrap to leaving Kleenex and toiletries for our use. I'd add a light, breathable (not polyester) blanket for that intermediary layer between the sheets and comforter, for visitors who like to sleep cooler. Perhaps a few hangers for skirts/pants? Glad to be able to bring our Pomeranian, Ted, on the trip; perhaps warn pet owners that dogs have to be taken out of the complex for all pee breaks (I might have missed this in your guidelines.) We hope we can stay with you again, particularly in pool-side weather. Thank you both again for your kindness and support."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Airbnb was within driving distance to locations and very clean upon arrival. The hosts were incredibly communicative and sent us information to help us navigate the area!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at this sweet condo in Durham for three nights. Very comfortable amenities, very clean with every last detail addressed to make our stay more comfortable! I requested extra pillows on our beds and there were plenty! Robert and his team were excellent communicators-fast response to any questions.
They also offered great suggestions for local dining and attractions.
Great location! I actually took a 15 min walk to downtown to shop and felt very safe.
I would highly recommend this condo to anyone looking to stay in the Durham NC area!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay at and very clean place you won’t be disappointed at all
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Loved the attention to detail of this host. Lush and abundant towels and a high-end shower head made bathing a luxurious experience. There is an awesome trail entrance across the street for jogging or walking. There is wonderful chocolate shop called Cacao Canela nearby. The garden has a communal herb planter box which was amazing for roasting veggies.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean and felt at home. I’ll be back when in town."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This petit apartment was great: clean, secure, good amenities. Comfortable bed and great shower. The location is good too: close to downtown, but not too close. My only word of advice is to see if there is a football/basketball game in town -- as that will increase the traffic and noise in this area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the fourth time we've stayed with Robert in Pearl Mill Flats, so I'm biased--this is a well-taken care of, hospitable, comfortable AirBnB with excellent hosts. It's dog-friendly and they provided a lovely floor cushion for Toby (which he really loved!). On the ground floor so there are no stairs, easy parking, excellent short walk to downtown Durham dining and nightlife. We had a minor problem w/ the lock and our host was immediately responsive. There's a nice pool, lovely outdoor spaces, and pleasant neighbors. Kind of like going to a spa, but much less expensive :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, cozy, clean and comfortable place. It was perfect for our needs and exactly as described.
Great smart tv system, as we were stuck inside a bit by weather. Gated system, so we felt secure.
The complex was very interesting. Beautiful pool, clean laundry room, and wonderful vibe."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent communication. Very clean. Was pleasantly surprised at how quickly every message was responded to and how clear the check in instructions were.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Robert’s place was exactly what I needed for my trip. The place was squeaky clean and had everything I could possibly need. Bonus points for being able to bring my dog with me. It was great to have a place with a security gate which made me feel extra safe. I was also able to enjoy the pool which gave a lot of relief from the hot NC weather. I would definitely stay again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"It's a struggle to find anything really wrong with this listing. The hosts are very accommodating and the condo was clean, stylish, and comfortable!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at the flat in Durham! Robert and Andrea were very accommodating for our last minute booking and we were even able to check in early. The condo had everything we needed for a few days in Durham and the location was so convenient to downtown.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A great Durham location and the condo is very comfortable. The pool is amazing. A fine place for our small dog. No complaints at all. Hopefully we will return on our next visit to Durham.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is the 2nd time we've stayed in one of Robert's apartments. We love the community, the landscaping, and the apartments. The co-hosts, Robert, Andrea and Amy were all incredibly helpful and responsive. They even found my husband's wedding ring after we left! He had lost it the first day we were there, and we had given up hope of finding it, but they found it for us!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can't say enough about this spot & particularly this host. My reservation was accepted the same day with frequent communication until I was safety checked in. Car troubles on check out day & Andrea IMMEDIATELY offered an extra night so that I could get back indoors & develop a plan. They were SO good to me, I will absolutely stay again & definitely recommend❤️"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robert and Andrea responded promptly to texts and emails. Their condo is pristine and well-appointed; it contains everything you need for a pleasant stay in Durham. The building is near a hiking/biking path and is very walkable to restaurants and shopping downtown. What stands out most about the building is its unique and lovely courtyard, complete with pool, grills, dining area, shuffleboard, chess set, arbor, hammocks and relaxing water features - such a beautiful and peaceful place to spend a relaxing evening. I definitely will book a return visit."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome place in the middle of downtown Durham, close to LOTS of local restaurants and bars. Robert and his team were super responsive, helpful, and courteous.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time my parents have stayed in one of Robert's condos. The community is beautiful with lots of flowers, life size chess, and a pool. Condo is simple, small, comfortable, and clean. My dad newly uses a walker so for anyone with mobility issues just be aware there is a large rug and some tight turns. As accessibility pros, the gate is very near the condo and accessible parking is available."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an ideal spot for our visit with a son and daughter-in-law in Trinity Park. The courtyard is an appealing feature - would love to come back when the pool is open!
Communication couldn’t have been better."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Robert's was exceptional! I felt extremely comfortable while there. The environment as soon as I walked in was very welcoming. The place was clean and smelled amazing. This property had everything I needed to feel as if I were ""at home"". The mattress was absolutely amazing! In fact, it made me question the quality of my own mattress and I have to have this mattress! I slept so peacefully. I will stay again if ever in this area again. The price for these accommodations were more than reasonable. Overall, great experience!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our weekend in Bull City. Great location. This is our second time staying at this Air B & B. We will be back.

This was our first time staying at this place and we couldn’t have loved it any more! It was so cozy and comfortable and the hosts were quick to respond and check in was easy! The location is great, walking distance to many restaurants and bars. Compared to other condos at this location, it was more reasonably priced too. We will definitely be choosing this location for our trips to Durham going forward!"

This was our first time in this flat, and Robert and Andrea installed a desk when we asked for it, which was a big help. Appreciate their hospitality and enjoyed our stay in Durham, as always."

Location was good and easy to get to downtown.

2022-09-01,4,Stayed about a week,"It's a very nice, clean place with lovely grounds in a nice location. Check in and check out were easy, and the hosts were very responsive. The plug-in air freshener can be hard for someone like me with asthma, though."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Clean and in a good location. Check in/communications was easy. Tons of info in the house manual. There are air fresheners that I think are covering up cigarette smoke, it was fine for us but maybe not if you are sensitive. The air conditioner didn’t work super well so it was a bit hot at night, again not an issue unless it is sensitive to that."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Condo was clean and comfortable. Pool and outdoor area were amazing. Blue Note restaurant around the corner from the condo was delicious. Convenience store was walkable. Perfect location.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great condo. It was small but had everything you need. It was difficult to find at first but once you know where it is it is easy to find again. It was quiet and clean. I sat out front in the courtyard a few times. Once two gentlemen asked if they could join me. I said yes and we had a great conversation. They gave me an idea of what it might be like to live in Durham when I retire soon. The hosts were very responsive. The guestbook offered great suggestions. It was a great home base to explore Durham.

The apartment itself is adorable and is stocked with everything you need: dishes, wine glasses (very important), dishwashing soap, cloth and towels, keurig coffees and sugars, utensils and cookware. The decorating is very well done. It is a perfect escape."

My husband & I were planning on attending a beer & blues festival nearby & were not notified that the event got canceled. Grrrr. We only found out when we showed up at the venue. After considering our options, we decided to bail & go home, so this reservation was cancelled only hours before check in. I can’t speak to the condition of the place, but I can say this: communication with the host(s) was excellent! Very attentive & responsive. Also very sympathetic to our situation. We did get the cleaning fee back, so yay for that. I would heartily recommend the host(s)!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot for a quick / refreshing stay. Location is near everything...place is very nice and the pool was perfect. It is a 5 star stay with one hiccup... you have to pay a REALLY high cleaning fee and then are asked to do chores / most of the cleaning before you checkout. I am a clean and respectful person & always do my best to leave a place better than I arrived but to make it seem mandatory for you to clean with such a high fee doesn't seem fair. Hopefully the fee is lowered for the following guests or the cleaning demands are changed to respectful suggestions. I would stay here again and do recommend, just note the high cleaning fee and cleaning requirements."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great Condo! It's right in the heart of Durham ... with lots to walk to. The Condo is great, clean, with a kitchen and comfy beds . The courtyard right outside is gorgeous, and has a pool. We'll definitely come back!"

2019-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Robert's place is a nice spot for a short weekend stay. Convenient location within walking distance to a bunch of restaurants. His place was quite clean and well maintained. Only thing is that I felt the bed was short for a 5'8"" guy (feet were hanging off the ends), and it was way too soft for my preference."

The check in and check out process is very smooth. The location of the condo is great! Great security and walking distance from great restaurants (Geer street garden, monuts), coffee shops (cocoa cinnamon) and breweries (full steam, motor co) just to name a few.

It also features a courtyard that is a near paradise, complete with a pool, plenty of garden space and relaxing areas, a hammock, life size chess, an artificial stream, herb garden, birds chirping everywhere.

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This rental has all of the amenities one needs, plus a great location as well. After a long day at work my train into Durham was delayed and I still had evening events to attend, so when I say laying my eyes on that Keurig with pods, sweetener, and creamer in the fridge was a lifesaver, I mean it. I had everything to support make my meals for the weekend in the kitchen, towels to enjoy the pool, and simple and easy check-in/out. I love staying at this location and Robert was easy to work with and always sent informative messages. -Thanks"

2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Roberts place definitely met my expectations. It was very neat and had everything I needed, including plenty of tea and Keurig coffee. It poured the entire time so I didn’t have much of a chance to take advantage of the very pleasant courtyard in the middle of the place. I suppose a light sleeper might have a challenge in that the bedroom window is very near the parking lot so things like car doors slamming could nudge you awake. I wore earplugs and slept perfectly. Robert was really on top of communications and very pleasant."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Robert's place was perfect for a weekend in Durham for a wedding. Easily accessible for all our events and all the things we would need for the weekend.

Her home is easy to find, the path to the Tiny(ish) Urban Oasis is well-lit, and the backyard is beautiful! Make SURE you stop at Rofhiwa Book Cafe (it's walkable!) and enjoy a good cup of coffee and check out the amazing collection of Black books!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,The tiny-ish house was well appointed and super cute. I stayed here for 1.5 months while working in RTP. It was much preferred over corporate housing and it was more affordable. Gail is an excellent host who responded to my questions promptly and made me feel right at home.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at the Tiny-ish house. Perfect location and very peaceful. The only thing that I would recommend is that it would have been nice to have a lamp in the corner of the room by the couch. I know the ceiling lights dim but it would have been nicer to have a lamp to turn on.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I loved this place. Very close to great food. When I am back in town I will look for this place again. Also a great place if you are a traveler in healthcare.
Very comfortable!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay! The Tiny(ish) Urban Oasis was cozy, clean and peaceful. Gail greeted me as soon as I arrived and gave me a tour of her beautiful property. She was hospitable, responsive and extremely knowledgeable of area. The bed was soooo comfortable! Would absolutely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my first time in North Carolina. I visited Durham for a week of leisure, and I'm so glad that I did. My week long stay in the Tiny-ish Urban Oasis was nothing short of phenomenal.
I received a warm, friendly greeting from Ms. Gail upon my arrival.
The communication was pleasant. She responded in a timely manner to my questions, which is greatly appreciated.
Upon my arrival, there was some infrastructure work being done in front of her house by the city, which was blocking the usual parking. Ms. Gail kindly offered a temporary parking alternative.
I was impressed. The Tiny-ish Urban Oasis is exactly as pictured and described. It is charming, clean, nicely decorated, and spacious.
After long days of exploring the city, I was able to return to the Tiny-ish house and comfortably relax.
I will definitely stay again when visiting the Durham area and will highly recommend it to others.
The Tiny-ish Urban Oasis was truly my home away from home for the week."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Tiny-ish House was lovely space for my 3 day visit to the area. The garden was lovely, the kitchen was very functional, the bedroom was very comfortable.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gail’s hospitality was just enough, responded when i reached out. although on the same property i appreciated the privacy.
the tiny(ish) house is sweet. just enough time in the space to design my own decluttering plan. i must admit, i had a moment or two of anxiety ;) due to my own needs, rather wants.
the time there provided the introspection i was looking for.
thank you."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"absolutely fantastic , very charming and comfortable , host was amazing as well !"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed for 6-weeks in Gail's Tiny(ish) house on a business trip and really enjoyed the experience. Gail was an extremely friendly and gracious host who went above and beyond on the occasions when I required her assistance. Her Tiny(ish) was exactly as advertised, I only wish I was there in summer when the garden would have been in full bloom. I would definitely stay there again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I loved staying at the Tiny-ish House. I have always wanted to try Tiny living and was able to take advantage of Gail's hospitality for a time. I love that I was left to myself but any need was taken care of. I had my own walkway, yard, and home! I liked that I could cook and eat in the kitchen/living room space with the television. It has Netflix and you can log in to your own streaming accounts as well. The bathroom is the perfect size and the shower is a nice standup. I never had hot water issues. The bedroom was so nice with ample storage.
The location is just like the description- it is close to Golden Belt and downtown! But I loved being half a block from the lovely historic East Durham neighborhood jewel of Rofhiwa bookstore (great coffee and hot chocolate)! I really got to know the neighbors. Everyone is so nice.
As someone with a disability I highly recommend the Tiny-ish House. There are three small steps to get up into the yard but everything else is flat."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gail's place was central to my office for the week and her back house was just the perfect amount of cozy and functional. I was able to cook dinner there every night and relax in peace and quiet. The neighborhood has a coffee shop just a two minute walk from Gail's. THe place is also centrally located to downtown Durham and the American Tobacco Campus. Gail is so kind and communicates so well. Highly recommend this little slice of heaven if you're traveling alone or with a partner.

I was at Duke Divinity (west campus) for the week and this spot is perfect…less than 10 minutes from everything. Beautiful and ultra clean house with nice amenities and decor (and the bed is super comfy). In a great neighborhood with easy close street parking.
And Gail is SUPER responsive and helpful. She actually anticipated many of my needs…sometimes even things I didn’t know I needed! Ha! And she is crazy nice and hospitable.
I will be staying here again for all of the rest of my residential weeks!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Myself and my family stayed at Gail’s Tiny(ish) house and it was the best experience especially coming in from out of state.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We felt so welcome in this space. It was our first AirBnB where the space is located behind the main building. We enjoyed the location and felt safe there too. If only the weather cooperated there could have been more outdoor time.
The space was beautiful inside and out, sound, and solid in so many ways that contributed to our comfort and sense of safety. Gail thought of just about every need.
All-in-all, we had a wonderful experience and we are so grateful for responsive communication, and a helpful host."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very clean and well-kept. It is also well-furnished and decorated. Gail went above and beyond to ensure I had a great stay. She even let me park in her driveway through the duration of my stay. Her driveway is long, but narrow. So, only one car can go in/out at a time…though 2 (maybe 3) cars can fit. Generally, we had to coordinate times to see who’d park on the outside (to ensure one person’s car doesn’t trap the other’s inside)."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I feel so calm, relaxed, and recharged after staying here! It was truly everything I wanted and more! Thank you Gail for pouring so much love into your tiny-ish house! I look forward to staying here again!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Tiny(ish) house while we were in town for a few days exploring the area. The space is stylish, clean, and comfortable while being conveniently located to shopping and lots of different restaurants. Gail made checking in and out a breeze and answered all of my questions before we even arrived. Definitely recommend!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place for a quiet, secluded getaway that is still near the city and local highways."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gail is a lovely host who thought of everything in her adorable tiny space! The place was chic & the bed super comfortable. We would love to stay here again!

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gail’s place was absolutely astonishing! The house was everything I expected and much much more. The thoughtful touches of decor made it feel like a home away from home. Everything was clean and pristine from top to bottom, the kitchen area was very helpful and I was oh so grateful for the coffee. She was very quick to respond to any inquiries I had and went the extra mile to make sure the outdoor area was prepped for o handle the elements and heat. All in all, I’d recommend this location to anyone who is staying in this area. The location was also close to many local restaurants, breweries, and events such as the farmers market!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute and cozy! Just what we needed for a long weekend getaway
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny(ish) house is super comfortable and did not feel tiny at all. It probably helps that Gail's decorating is flawless! The bathroom felt very spacious and there was plenty of storage space in the bedroom. I appreciated the natural lighting as well as energy-saving lights. I was very comfortable, whether catching up on work or relaxing with Netflix (which I was able to access as a guest!) Only 8 minutes to Duke's West Campus was a plus for me. Merci Gail!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely and cute, clean space!! I was obsessed with this tiny house! It served as the perfect solo getaway this weekend. Everything I needed for the weekend was in the space and accessible.
Gail is such a great host! Communicative and timely in responses."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gail’s place is a “ready to land” respite for whatever you are doing during your stay in Durham. We were on a work project and found the evenings in her place were a welcome relief after some hard working days. I highly recommend this lovely place.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erica is very responsive about the entire stay. The house is pristine and fully stocked. I loved that I could just cook while I was there and everything was as shown on the listing. The area is quiet and rural (which was what I wanted), but close enough to Raleigh that going to dinner etc was easy and fast.
Home is extremely well kept and when visiting the area will definitely book again!"

We enjoyed the warm sunshine in the morning and the starry sky at night. It's super clean with comfortable beds. Erica is friendly and helpful. We'll come again when get a chance."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay
2024-06-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The place was dirty when we arrived because the cleaner had not been there as planned. We were willing to wait while a cleaner came, but that was not possible. Joshua offered to relocate us to another property for the night with the hope that the cleaner would be able to clean the place up the following day. Unfortunately, that did not happen either. We're grateful that Joshua found a place for us for that one night, and we've had positive experiences with him and pleasant stays at his properties in the past. Unfortunately, this time we had to accept a full refund and find somewhere else for the duration of our week."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great place to stay in Durham! I rented this house for my mom and aunt for graduation weekend and they loved it! The furniture not only looks nice but is comfortable too. Couch makes you feel right at home and mattresses are comfortable (I was told). The airbnb was spotless. It’s also a block away from Monuts for breakfast and 2 blocks away from 9th street restaurants- keeping you walking distance from things to do, but far enough that the house is quiet. Highly recommend and it has parking in the back."

The apartment was clean, comfortable, functional, spacious, with plenty of windows for natural light. Nicely done bathrooms and kitchen were a plus too. Although the beds are on the firm side, we both slept well. All in all, a great place to stay! Highly recommend."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This has hands down been one of the best Airbnb stays I’ve had to date. What you see in the pictures is completely accurate. The place smelled and looked clean upon entering - I immediately felt right by at home. It met my expectations in every way. Josh was proactively communicative and always responsive. The neighborhood felt safe and was very walkable. My partner and I both worked remotely the week of our stay and had no issues with connective or speed. I have zero hesitation recommending this Airbnb and host for a future stay!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Hands down, this was the nicest Airbnb I have ever stayed at. I lived in Durham many years ago and the location is ideal. The place appears to be a recent new build and was tastefully furnished. It’s in a safe neighborhood and near grocery stores and restaurants."

2023-09-01,4,Group trip,Great convenient location with EV charger. Worked great for a short stay. Everything was clean and tidy. The only disappointment is that it really doesn’t not really accommodate 6 people. The air mattress for the other 2 people has to be blown up in the middle of the living room and it comes with no quilt or quilt cover for people sleeping on the air mattress. The lights being too bright and the lack of wall decorations made it feel a little clinical.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at this location, and we had an excellent experience. The place is clean and tidy and updated. The decor is beautiful, and the neighborhood is safe and close to a lot of great restaurants and shopping."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay in Durham. The location is GREAT - walkable neighborhood for safe, easy strolls and just a few doors down from Monuts! Just a little further walk gets you to some great restaurants, shops and a nice grocery. An easy ten minute drive got me to Duke West campus.
I loved the lack of clutter! It all felt so clean - visually and physically. Desks in rooms were well used as my husband and I worked. Linens were nice and bed was comfortable.
The host was quick to respond and always really nice - from checkin to checkout.
I hope to stay here again on future visits!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, clean!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joshua was very accommodating toward issues. Originally had an Airbnb booked with him at another location on Fayetteville St and it definitely did not live up to expectation whatsoever and the location was very unsafe.
Messaged about changing accommodations to this specific Airbnb which was in a nicer, quieter area and closer to Duke. This place was very clean and had all the necessities/amenities you need. Would definitely stay here again if I were to come back to the area."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I splurged a little to stay here while between leases and honestly I'm so glad I did! The location in terrific. Lots of things to walk to like restaurants and grocery. It was also easy to pop on the freeway. The neighborhood is quiet, clean, and close to Duke campus.

Communication from Joshua was proactive and quick. Don't look elsewhere, this is a great stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our time here. Very beautiful place in a beautiful location. From the moment we stepped inside, we were blown away by the modern, clean, and cozy feel of the house and always felt as if we were in a home away from home. Everything exceeded our expectations. The host was very responsive and checked in with us to make sure we were enjoying our stay. Our favorite aspects of the location were the walkability, the quiet neighborhood, and the proximity to the main attractions in Durham. We look forward to staying here again in the future when we come to visit family!"

The cleanliness of the accommodation was impressive, and the space looked just like the pictures provided. The hosts maintained a high standard of cleanliness, and the linens and floors were spotless.
The pictures accurately represented the Airbnb, and I found the decor to be tasteful and cozy. The amenities provided were of good quality, including a well-equipped kitchen and a comfortable bed.
The communication with the host was smooth, and he was responsive to my inquiries. The location of the Airbnb was convenient, situated in a pleasant neighborhood with easy access to nearby attractions.
Great Airbnb for a long weekend."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property definitely exceeded our expectations. It was an absolutely perfect location for Duke graduation/proximity to campus, our son's off-campus housing, and Durham attractions. The house itself is better than the photos - everything is new, fresh, and clean. We had plenty of space, and everything we needed. Although a duplex the house was very quiet. Parking was easy. Communication with Joshua was easy, prompt, and clear. Overall it was a fabulous property and stay - I only wish we had found it earlier, before our son was graduating!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family and I had a wonderful stay for graduation weekend! The place was beautiful and the neighborhood was friendly and walkable.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a good host! Everything meets expectations
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is absolutely spotless and everything seemed brand new. It felt like I was the very first person ever to use it. I was very comfortable there. The off-street parking was very convenient and I appreciated the plug for charging my rented EV. I slept well and had everything I needed. The check in process was easy and straight forward, with an access code to the door. My one criticism - and this is totally subjective - is that the apartment felt very sterile. There is no decoration and the overhead lights are very bright. It wasn't a good place to hang out."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for Duke medical appointments. Would stay here again.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The apartment was great! Very clean and bright. Joshua also included some nice amenities such as extra toiletries, an air mattress, extra pillows and blankets. Beds are on the firm side, and water pressure in the showers was terrific. Good assortment of cookware, and a large washer/dryer. Not too noisy being on 9th street. No complaints. Went to Monuts down the street. Yum!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for us! Walkable to lots of restaurants, grocery, and some shops. A really nice touch is that there were extra items in case you forgot your toothbrush like one of did. Coffee and teas were provided but I felt they went one step further and offered different types of sugar and a coco option. Nice touch! The place was super clean and beautiful. We really enjoyed it. I fully recommend and would stay here again.
Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet location away from the city. Cute affordable location.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome host here in North Carolina. Joshua was very responsive and pleasant. He made this process simple. The property is near Duke university and is in a very friendly and quiet neighborhood. People are very welcoming and we were extremely pleased. The house itself was in amazing condition with pristine features and comfortable furniture. We would be delighted to stay here again when we return to NC in the future.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful! We were there for medical appointments. This worked perfectly. Close to so many things. We would stay here again if needed and the place was available.

The neighborhood is quiet and pretty close to downtown Durham which is perfect if you enjoy being on the go. The owner was responsive to the many questions I asked throughout our stay. My boyfriend and I would definitely stay here again!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would stay in this pristine property again without a second thought! Looked brand new, everything worked as described and it is furnished nicely and thoughtfully.
I love love love the location - very quiet (I am quite noise sensitive), but a straightforward walk down 9th St to restaurants and businesses in Old West Durham. A fantastic breakfast spot ""Monuts"" is a one minute walk! In general, great location for getting around.
On property, I really appreciated how thoughtfully appointed this townhome is. The kitchen had everything to make full meals (although I did not take advantage of that on this trip) and there is a pleasant lounging and dining area that felt just right.
Upstairs two bedroom suites and laundry closet (I used the washer and dryer and they were quiet, great quality appliances). The nice bonus was my bedroom suite's walk in closet so I could put my luggage out of the way.
Further, Joshua was a great host with a very responsive and cordial communication. A+++++!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Super clean, spacious, uncluttered newer townhome. Within walking distance to some fabulous restaurants (Monuts is a must!). Kitchen easy to work in with basic utensils. Living area spacious with a big comfortable couch an extra chair. Beds were comfortable; bathrooms well stocked with fun little amenities and plenty of towels that were fluffy and absorbent. Good hot water supply with good water pressure in the showers one of which is also a tub. Full size washer dryer definitely a plus along with the laundry pods. Quiet home, part of a townhouse, duplex style. Can’t comment on noise from next-door as no one was renting at the time. There is a house next-door that obviously rents to college students who would gather on the weekend evenings, but was never a problem, noise wise, while we were there. moderate traffic and pedestrian activity outside, but clearly of the neighborhood variety and not unreasonably loud at all. Host was super proactive and communicative. We had an issue with the door lock on our first day, and he sent someone out to fix."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay 5 stars ⭐️
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and Joshua is an excellent host!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The half a duplex was exceedingly clean and well stocked. The area could have been better. Screams from the street, and plethora of profanities, and a person in the driveway who yelled for a few minutes. I am used to an urban environment, but I would not walk around the area at night.
Otherwise an excellent stay"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time in Durham visiting my sister before she moves to Kentucky. The location was great near Downtown where we ate and took in a Durham Bulls game. The rooftop fun to hang out on, and there was plenty of space for our group of four. The kitchen was very well stocked and we really appreciated the toiletries."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a fantastic, unique home away from home during our trip to Durham! The rooftop space was awesome and the house was spotless. We really appreciated the little touches William provided that made our stay more comfy, like plenty of extra pillows and blankets and towels. The kitchen was great for baking and all the electronics worked perfectly. We would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect for a family gathering - graduation and Mothers Day. The house was well equipped and we cooked in, ate on the rooftop, and also could walk to restaurants on the Tobacco Trail. Perfect location and great stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, great host! Stay here!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at William’s place with some friends for our college reunion. We had a wonderful time in the home. It was clean, spacious, and just as described. We used the rooftop and the back porch. The home had all of the amenities we needed and clear instructions for how to use everything. We will definitely return when we are next in Durham!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great unit convenient to Durham and Duke campus. Roofdeck is extraordinary. Comfortable pullout bed. Neighborhood is bland and in need of some TLC. Great host communication. Only thing missing was creamers and tissue.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Williams place is great for a Durham get away. House was clean and as advertised. Quick access to everything Durham.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rooftop deck was great and other amenities (kitchen, bathrooms and beds) were great as well. We were on a college tour of Duke, NC State and UNC and it served nicely as a home base to visit all 3. Short drive to lots of different restaurants and shops as well."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,William’s place was just as described and the pictures were accurate. The layout of the duplex was nice. We had 5 adults and did not feel crowded in the kitchen or living space. The weather was nice the weekend we visited so the back porch and roof top patio added even more space to spread out.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family loved staying here! The keypad was simple to use, which we appreciated due to getting in later than expected. The house was clean and well decorated. This host thought of everything to make our stay comfortable. The rooftop area is gorgeous! Unfortunately, we had rain most of our stay but did get to enjoy a few hours before leaving. One thing we kept discussing, while we were there, is the attention to details when outfitting and decorating this home. We look forward to hopefully staying again in the future."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was a fantastic spot for the needs of our entire family. Great location, easy access to all areas of Durham and a relaxing place to lay your head at night. William is so responsive to every question and every need.
Definitely will be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great place to stay. William is an outstanding host. Very comfortable place with a great location if like to jog, hike, or be able to walk to downtown Durham."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"""I had the most amazing experience at William's Roof Top Oasis! The atmosphere was truly magical, with stunning views and a relaxing ambiance. William's attention to detail and hospitality made me feel like a VIP guest. I can't recommend this place enough for anyone looking for a memorable and luxurious experience. Thank you, William, for creating such a special haven in the city!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would stay there again, place felt like was renewed recently.
The neighborhood has few houses that were a bit sketchy but nothing too bad and it wasn’t noisy at all. Also, the host lives next door so we felt safe.
With a 5 min drive, it’s possible to get to great coffee shop, restaurants and bars."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb ever! I travel quite a bit and I have to say William’s place is my favorite Airbnb. It’s beautiful, clean, comfortable, more than adequately stocked with kitchen essentials, and William is always available. Don’t hesitate to book!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I came out from California to visit my son who is working at Duke. This was my first time in North Carolina. This Airbnb was spotless, incredibly comfortable, very well appointed, and lots of little extras. William had very clear instructions on how to use everything, and excellent recommendations for local restaurants and activities in the Durham area. I would highly recommend this Airbnb and will stay here again on another trip to Durham."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was in a great location. Close to downtown and lots of restaurants. He had so many resources for anything you may want to do. The kitchen was well stocked with supplies. I needed to communicate a few things and he responded almost immediately. I would definitely stay here again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"With the exception of some spots of the house having less than ideal wifi reception, I have no complaints about William’s house and would stay here again! I also would stay during warmer times to take advantage of the amazing rooftop!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"William is a super-duper host!! He went above and beyond what most folks would do. I had a family emergency and need to extended my stay. I was waiting to hear from the hospital as to when my father may undergo surgery. During this wait, I lost William's place to someone who did a quick reservation (doesn't need host approval). I got the news as I was sitting next to my very sick father in the hospital. As this was our first time in North Carolina, I wasn't sure what to do and panicked a little. As I was frantically trying to book another place, William contacted me to let me know he pleaded my case to AirBnB and the new reservation was canceled and I was able to extend my stay. This proved to be a lifesaver for my parents and me. Not only is William's place immaculate, beautifully decorated and furnished, it was also an ideal location for all of our wedding then hospital trips. I will be forever grateful to William for his kindness, patience, support and amazing hospitality."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! The home was clean, comfortable, and had every amenity, down to a blackout curtain that we used for our toddler. William is a great host and very responsive."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful home. Very quiet and peaceful. Great location for all things in Durham. We loved sitting outside on the roof patio and enjoying some games and family time. It was also great to have a fenced in back yard for our small dogs. Highly recommend.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"William’s place was very nice, clean, and as shown in pictures. It’s close to downtown Durham, the rooftop patio is great, and William was very friendly, responsive, and proactive in his assistance. He genuinely seems to care about his guests’ experience.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at William's home. It's a beautiful space - very nicely decorated, comfortable and inviting. William is very communicative and helpful. The kitchen is well stocked for cooking, and in general it seems no detail was spared in designing this space. We highly recommend this rental."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Rooftop Oasis lived up to our expectations. The apartment was immaculate, well equipped, beautifully decorated and very well thought-out; I especially loved all the natural light that flooded the house. The rooftop was just an added treat! It is evident that the area is undergoing gentrification; that being that, it was just my daughter and I and we felt very safe. The home is in close proximity to anything and everything you need. Whether you're traveling within Durham or the Chapel Hill area, I would strongly recommend the Rooftop Oasis -- it will not disappoint. William is very responsive and accommodating, we would return."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"William's place was the perfect spot for a visit to Durham. It's a great location for walking downtown or on the Tobacco trail, which is right next door to the house. It's been decorated with comfortable furniture and all the amenities needed. It's got a ton of room, with different areas to work and relax - and a great fenced yard for dogs. Would absolutely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Couple things that we mentioned to improve but overall it was spacious and nice little backyard. Thanks!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I can't rave enough about our stay at William's place. I've stayed in a LOT of airbnbs--and I can't think of a better host and listing! First, if you like gorgeous outdoor quarters and also indoor space that is elegant and comfortable--this is the place for you. The house is CLEAN and FABULOUS. And the host and communication were just as stellar. William could not be more helpful and accomodating. I will certainly be back!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, plenty of space."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Superb house! Gorgeous place and everything from check in to check out was easy and William was nothing but an awesome host. Super responsive and helpful.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, 4 year old and I had an amazing trip to Durham, NC! Loves the location and how you could walk to places. But the Airbnb was so nice you totally fine just chillin on the roof top! Highly recommend this place. We will be back for sure! Williams was also a great host and communicated very well which he so important to me!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a place to stay in Durham, look no further. This home is beautiful and modern with all the amenities one could ask for. The American Tobacco Historic District is very close and easy to walk to. I highly recommend staying here."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Williams home is beautiful! Brand new and well thought out. You just can’t beat that rooftop.
There was construction going on next door during our stay. Wasn’t too disruptive but something to note!
The house and William make up for it tenfold!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is perfect! Super clean, modern and gorgeous! The rooftop was what drew us to stay here but the rest of the house is just as spectacular.
Everything from shops and restaurants to the university was very close by.
William has QR codes for so many things which made it super easy to find places to eat, shop and even how things work in the house.
If you come across this listing, book it. You will have a relaxing, home away from home stay! ☺️"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic place. Great hosts. Highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our Durham visit. Very clean and organized property. The rooftop was a highlight. William responded quickly to my inquiries. Would definitely stay again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at William’s Rooftop Patio Oasis. The house is newly built w/all the amenities you need. The rooftop area was great and the location was very central to downtown, in an area that is quickly growing! William was quick with responses with any of our issues. We had a lovely stay and look forward to coming back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place - just as depicted in the pictures! Everything was so spotless when we got there! Loved the rooftop -- we even just ditched continuing bar hopping and opted to just bring back wine to hang out up there. William was also the best host! Very responsive and has great suggestions! He even has a lot of QR codes in the house to links for suggestions throughout the city for things like brunch or dinner and also for instructions throughout the house. Loved staying here -- very convenient location; we drove mostly but I imagine it could be walkable? Highly recommend to any looking for a stay in Durham!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved this place! When we go back to Durham, we will definitely try to book here again. Fantastic location, clean, qr codes placed around for wifi and other info. Great AirBnB experience!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and nice location with a super responsive host.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice house, well equipped, close to downtown. Great rooftop deck"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"William’s home was exactly what we had hoped for during our stay in Durham! It had all the amenities we could have needed, and is located in a great spot with easy access to lots of nearby attractions, downtown, and Duke. Unfortunately, there was ongoing construction next door during our stay, so a lack of privacy from construction workers limited our ability to use the backyard and roof deck - totally out of William’s control, and he kindly reached out to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible. I will note, if you have a nervous dog (like we do) that you are planning on bringing, they may not fare well with the construction noise, so I would recommend checking in with William about the status of the construction before booking! Otherwise, I highly recommend this spot and would absolutely stay here again. Thanks, William!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place- rooftop was amazing. Would love to come back again!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,William's place was absolutely perfect for our family weekend trip. Communication was great and the home's amenities were exactly what we needed. We especially enjoyed time on the rooftop patio and getting to take walks on the American Tobacco Trail literally steps away. Couldn't recommend the home and location more.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great, I definitely would recommend"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. William’s house was as described and pictured—it’s modern, clean, and comfy. It had all the conveniences like extra towels, blankets, and toiletries. The kitchen was well stocked with all the basic essentials and cookware. The back porch and rooftop patio were a huge plus. There was some construction going on next door, but I didn’t have any issues during my stay. William was great—he reached out to ensure I was enjoying my stay and communicated about the construction prior to my arrival. The location was great—you’re just minutes from downtown and plenty of great restaurants/bars/breweries. The neighborhood as a whole was a little scruffy, like many areas undergoing regeneration, but it wouldn’t deter me from staying here again. Overall, a positive experience!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love the roof top patio. The scan links to instructions and recommendations were really helpful; great idea. The property in in great shape. It looks like it has been well maintained.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was pristine. The entry directions were slightly confusing, but I chalk that up to getting there after dark and too many of us trying to interpret them.
The place was exactly what we were looking for. Very clean and fully stocked. It appeared to be new construction. It was a nice quiet neighborhood and William was the perfect Airbnb owner/neighbor (unlike the last one we had). Other than helping us get in the first night we never saw him again, yet he responded to email promptly.
We highly recommend the place, especially if you are going to Duke University medical center as it is very convenient.
Only recommendation would be televisions in the bedrooms."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our 5 night stay in this lovely home. It is exactly as pictured … very new, comfortable and modern. It is in a transitioning neighborhood very close to downtown Durham and super convenient to all that Durham has to offer. William was super responsive and a joy to communicate with. We had rain everyday so we were not able to use the rooftop area… we did take a peak though and it’s very cool. Hoping for sunshine next time. 😊"

We only wished it was longer. It rained most of our trip, but we were able to enjoy the covered lower lanai for a nice glass of wine. The house was clean and offered everything we needed for a comfortable stay. William was very attentive to our needs and very accommodating. There are plenty of board games to play on a rainy/cold evening. We would certainly stay again when the weather permits to enjoy the rooftop views. The beds are very comfortable.
Note: there is one television downstairs, but we were able to sign into our Netflix account. We enjoyed watching family friendly movies before bed."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"William offered a comfortable and clean home to our family during a difficult time and I had pierce of mind when coming and going to and from Duke medical ( only 3 miles away).

It was a wonderful stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"On Cloud Durham is a great place to stay for anyone visiting the Durham area. The house is attractive, clean & comfy, and has all the conveniences. There are nice areas for relaxing and/or visiting both inside the unit and outside on the balcony and rooftop. During our stay we biked the Tobacco Trail which runs behind the property.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great stay 100% recommend
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous space! Loved the light and tall ceilings.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay. Beautiful and private space. Easily walkable to downtown attractions. Highly recommend for staying in Durham!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at Taylor & Dylan’s place in Durham. The home was quiet and secluded. We enjoyed the wraparound patio and had a few meals outside. They were kind enough to let us check out later which let our baby sleep in before traveling home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything is perfect about this home! Location is beautiful, walkable to downtown and peaceful! The space is gorgeous and so well decorated, clean and comfortable. Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little house with lots of natural light! Very conveniently located, very clean, and overall a delightful place to stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming stay in Durham! Super walkable, very clean, and very comfortable beds. I am definitely already recommending this place to folks if they are in Durham, and certainly if we are back in the area, we would love to stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private, well-kept, quiet house within walking distance to downtown. I recommend it!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here more than once, feel right at home! WIll come again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Having stayed in several short term rentals during the two months I was in Durham, I have to say the natural light in Taylor and Dylan’s vacation rental property was the best, which is something that is important to me. Also, I enjoyed the proximity to restaurants downtown. The property was perfect for myself and one guest as it has two bedrooms and two baths. The master does not have a closet but there are several wall hangers for clothes.
Taylor and Dylan were immediately responsive to my inquiries which I very much appreciated. All in all, it was the perfect place for me to recuperate during a difficult time. Thank you Taylor and Dylan."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an adorable new build behind other cottages up a hill. It felt like we were tucked away in a little Airy. The space was so open and filled with light. Loved all the glass and clerestory! Taylor and Dylan have consciously made some beautiful choices in sustainability-reclaimed doors and wood use -this is a really nice example. Always interested to see what they’ve done with their properties. Very impressed!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"PROS: Absolutely loved this house! It's in a great location and looks exactly like the pictures. The bed and couch were comfortable and the living area had natural light. It's tucked away and was very peaceful at night. It's in the heart of downtown so it's easy to walk to bars & restaurants. We LOVED the list of bars & restaurants the hosts provided!
CONS: The heat doesn't reach the primary bedroom as well so you may have to turn up the heat a bit higher at night. The shower in the primary doesn't get very hot. The water filter was also expired, slight oversight.
When I initially reached out about the possibility of an early check-in or at least some flexibility around the standard check-in time, I was met with a rigid response stating that it was not possible due to cleaning schedules. However there were no guests for the 4 days prior to our stay. I was disappointed with the lack of accommodation and service but overall happy with the property. We would definitely book again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Taylor & Dylan's place renewed my place in Airbnb. You can tell that the space is curated with hospitality in mind. I visit Durham frequently and I would, without hesitation, book their spot again. If you enjoy downtown Durham, the location is right around the corner from their fabulous library and about a 20 minute walk to the main drag. The photos are amazing, but it does manage to look even better inside. I would definitely recommend this location to others."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a calm and comfortable place to stay. Loved the bathrooms and the big tubs. The kitchen amenities were the nicest of any Airbnb home that I've stayed at. It was wonderful to have crisp clean linens without all the chemical fragrance so often used in Airbnbs. Thank you for having me!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Taylor & Dylan are Super Hosts. In fact, we feel that they are some of the best hosts that we have ever had on Airbnb.
Their home is darling, cozy, well appointed, and very private!
They provided constant communication, to make sure we were happy and didn't need anything.
They provided posts with great places to go while we're in town.
We love their property so much, we have shared with them that if the property is available, we will use it every time we come to town."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a perfect little house, very cute. Had everything you needed. Very clean and nicely stocked. So nice to have coffee, cream and sugar available. Taylor and Dylan were very informative and responded quickly to emails. Would stay there again in a heart beat."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great home. Would recommend and will keep in our back pocket for future trips!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful place! Thoughtfully curated and felt right at home. We enjoyed our stay and would return again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Taylor and Dylan's house in Durham was a wonderful place to stay. It was extremely clean, well-appointed, well-kept, comfy and so beautiful and stylish. Every detail and finish was very well done. While we didn't use much of the kitchen, it looked well-stocked. The house was private and felt very safe. Great location and very walkable to downtown Durham. The street parking could be a tad tricky, but there was plenty of space. I'd definitely stay here again if back in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a restful stay. The air b and b was better than we expected. Beautiful, clean and cozy with the fireplace! The location was easy to get to restaurants. We highly recommend this gorgeous place!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay and loved the property. It has a very well thought out layout and is everything you would want for a relaxing getaway. We were so comfortable we left with ideas for improving our own home!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was so comfortable and clean and well equipped- we loved staying there.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Possibly the best Air BnB we've ever stayed in. Well-appointed. Private. Beautiful porch that wraps around the front and a small patio on the side. We were there for 3 nights. 3 adults and we all needed to work from home one day. WiFi was great and we were able to spread out and all work without bothering each other. Clean, modern furnishings. Washer/Dryer and dishwasher. Also, they thought of little touches like coffee and sugar, oilve oil, salt and pepper, etc. A real gem. The neighborhood is totally walkable. One of us had a meeting at the main library and we were thrilled to realize it was literally around the corner. All in all, a great stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing home
.On a rainy day i made stew and we read in from of the fire gorgeous details and well stocked house
very private and very comfortable.
Close walk to everything
The space is absolutely perfect
I love this house and the owners are amazing.
Thank you so much for allowing us to enjoy your home"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I could live in Taylor & Dylan's place. Seriously. The accommodations were 5-star. So many things made it perfect for me & my family. It's now #1 place I'll look for when I'm in Durham. This place felt spacious and healthy: linens & towels free of harmful chemicals; white towels that smelled clean (people try to protect the color in colored towels by not using hot water and those towels often smell funky covered with fragrance); quality stainless steel cookware (not the scratched up, cheap teflon coated stuff in so many airbnbs); comfy mattresses and pillows; tons of natural light; a couple of windows with screens so you could get fresh air. Beautifully designed & decorated, wonderful porch, nestled among trees, nice privacy fence. The location was super convenient to downtown and everywhere I needed to be in town. Taylor & Dylan knocked it out of the park."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really appreciated how the host was quick to respond. Also, very welcoming beforehand. A very nice place to stay and a great location in Durham."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I really liked this property. The house is very cute, and it was clean and looked like the photos. While very close to downtown Durham, the house is nestled back away from the street and among many trees so it felt private and peaceful."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Very convenient to downtown, nice private home, and well stocked with everything we needed."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was perfect! Met my expectations and then some. Taylor & Dylan did a beautiful job on the decor and feel of the home. I enjoyed how tucked away it was, PEACEFUL! I wish I would’ve had more vacation days available to stay, I didn’t want to leave!
They also provided detailed instructions, info about the surrounding area and were quick to respond.
Thank you so much for this beautiful home and stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the house was beautifully decorated and comfortable. there is very limited cabinet space which made storing pantry items difficult. but overall lovely stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We so enjoyed our stay at Taylor and Dylan’s! We booked last minute as we had plans change on our way to my sister’s wedding, and we could not have had a better experience! The space was beautiful and just as it looks in the pictures. The local recommendations they sent prior to check
in made it so we could have a fantastic stay with only a day’s notice! Highly highly recommend and we’ll be staying here the next time we’re in Durham!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Taylor & Dylan were wonderful. They personally built the small house and it was clear to me they are true craftsmen. Attention to detail was amazing. Beautiful wood flooring, very private and serene setting, and all new (high quality) appliances and fixtures. Of all the airbnbs I have ever stayed in, this was the one with the greatest upside surprise when I got inside the place. I wish every airbnb was as nice as this was. They were also very attentive and responsive and very much cared that I have a great experience staying at their Airbnb. 5+ Stars!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Centrally located to walk to downtown Durham with lots of great restaurants. The apartment was so cute and homey- very comfortable for our family of 3. Appreciated the modern, simple and clean furnishings. Washer and dryer was really useful. Taylor and Dylan kept us in the loop and sent some great recommendations prior to our arrival. Would definitely stay here again on our next trip."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was just perfect!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful hidden gem. Such a beautiful house with trees and a wonderful deck. A short walk to downtown and the farmers market. We will definitely be staying here again. A truly lovely property with a private patio and nice deck.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is a tucked away gem that offers privacy and a place to restore just down the street from downtown Durham.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place! The house is so cute, full of light, and beautiful inside and out. It is really close to downtown and all the great restaurants and shops but on a quiet street surrounded by trees. Taylor and Dylan were super responsive and helpful with recommendations, and they thought of all the right touches in this place -comfy beds, great furniture and spaces for relaxing inside and on the decks outside. One of my top Air BNB experiences ever!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great all around!
2023-05-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Beautiful home, fantastic location, Taylor & Dylan were super responsive, amazing feeling in the trees like a cabin in the woods but in down town. we loved it!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was a great stay and I have enjoyed the house very much. Minimalist style decor, clean, and had everything I needed. Well, I couldn’t find a toaster but I made do with a pan. I like toast in the morning 🙂. I loved listening to the birds and watching the squirrels. I’d certainly stay at this place again in the future."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and charming place in excellent condition. The bed was very comfy. Cute porch and toasty fireplace. Highly recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Perfect location to walk downtown. Amazing porch. Comfortable beds. Will stay here again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This space is beautiful.
Well thought and designed, with lots of window so you feel in nature and still very private since the property is elevated vis a vis the other houses.
Location is good: shops, downtown and brewery all walkable.
And finally, the hosts are really helpful and responsive.
We’ll be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great property in a great location.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot and very convenient
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's such a nice little compact house to stay in! Really nice for a pair of friends or perhaps two couples. My only gripe with this house is that the road it's on has no sidewalks, which is a shame because as soon as you move to another street you can see how walkable downtown Durham is!
But, the property itself is great, I would totally stay here again in the future."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place !!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed the stay
I do do it again in the future"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Taylor & Dylan’s place. Tons of natural light was the best part of the space. The close proximity to the library made for a great trip too. Would highly recommend.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. Quite a lovely home- very clean and comfortable. Close to downtown as well. It was a great location to visit our son at Duke! Taylor and Dylan sent us several recommendations for places to check out which was really nice as well. I would definitely stay there again.
AB Hawkins"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed a great stay at Taylor & Dylan's place. Perfect in every way. The space is clean, amenities are great, furniture/beds are comfy, and it is private. Easy to walk to places in downtown Durham. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. Very close to downtown.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Taylor and Dylan's place is absolutely beautiful -- immaculately clean bright, beautifully appointed, very comfortable beds, and even quality cookware. I especially appreciated the deep bathtubs with plenty of hot water. It's a lovely, private, and safe spot, even though close to downtown."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Taylor and Dylan’s place was beautiful. It was located behind a small two unit property but you never heard a thing from anyone! The place was adorable inside and out! Beds were also very comfortable! Location was convenient to everywhere we needed to go. For not knowing the area and narrowing it down to a couple places we were very happy that we choose their place!! We will definitely chose it again if we are back in the area.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is an ADU and it’s spectacular. We were originally on the fence bc there weren’t a ton of reviews but we LUCKED out. Walkable to so much and super well designed. The hosts have great taste and reply lightning fast. A++
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Taylor and Dylan have created a serene, thoughtfully and beautifully decorated, well-appointed home. The beds were extremely comfortable, the kitchen is well-stocked and the home was impeccably clean!
The location is ideal for a Durham stay. It truly felt like a hideaway in the woods while being conveniently walkable to downtown. Thank you for creating a wonderful stay for us! We can’t wait to stay again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really beautiful and clean place with lovely appointments. The beds were extremely comfy! The porch and patio were tempting but sadly it was just too chilly for us to hang out there. We can tell Taylor and Dylan put a lot of love into their work. And they are super easy to deal with and very responsive. Exceptional stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Very limited parking but otherwise excellent!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place was beautiful and had everything we needed for our long stay. It did feel like a hideaway close to downtown. So many squirrels and birds in the tall trees that surrounded the private little home up the driveway, made it feel private and cozy. They really put a lot of love into this place to make it look beautiful. The only thing I missed was having an actual work space. Two people working on the dinning room table for 2 weeks wasn't ideal, but we made it work. Also, although the livingroom furniture was beautiful it wasn't actually comfortable for watching TV when we wanted to relax. Communication was great and fast, although it seemed like we were always communicating with someone different. That said, I would definitly recommend it and would definitly be back."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is amazing. It’s beautifully decorated, well appointed, and feels like a home away from home."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I had a lovely stay with my pup! The outdoor area is gorgeous and it was a great spot to work from home for the week. Communication was great, would stay again!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Bird’s Nest was such a great find! It was a cozy and spacious little apartment. Jacqueline did an AMAZING job with providing toiletries and other items you may have forgotten to pack. She really went above and beyond l, and was extremely quick to respond and help if we needed something. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Was a great place to stay while our daughter in law graduated Dental school at UNC. Thanks for everything
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay !

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In the heart of charming Durham, Jackie's place was a great find. I've never stayed at an airbnb with a bathroom that had so many thoughtful, generous touches to make our stay comfortable. She thought of everything! The entire apartment was absolutely clean and comfy. We'll be back to Durham and will be in touch again. Thanks so much, Jackie!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,A cozy place to stay! The house was well stocked with pretty much everything you need. Nice finishing touches.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Many thoughtful touches. Lovely towels. Very responsive hosts. The bed was not up to our comfort standards as we do have back issues. Functional kitchen - please note absence of oven, though there is a two burner hot plate. If you like drip coffee bring your coffee maker.. Recording outside which informs you that you are being filmed whenever you enter or leave the property. Great return for the asking price and pet friendly, big bonus and nice neighborhood to walk your furry friend around. We hope to return."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect location and space for our needs. Would definitely stay again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay, will definitely book again in the future."

2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Overall a great place to stay!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful private hideaway that is the perfect central location to enjoy Durham. Friendly host with lots of extra amenities at the home.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I loved my time here. I would not hesitate to visit again. The hosts were wonderful and hospitable.
The space was lovely with a great outdoor area for relaxing. Jackie has taken great care to try to provide everything someone could ever need!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My girlfriend and I went to a show in Durham and needed a quick overnight place to stay. The Bird’s Nest was perfect for that and super cozy! Jaqueline provided easy instructions to find it, and it’s tucked away in a quiet, safe neighborhood. There are so many extra amenities provided here- Kcups, coffee, creamer, snacks, and tons of toiletries. There was extra blankets and pillows as well. Everything felt like home away from home and I wasn’t worried about forgetting anything because I was pretty sure it was stocked by Jacqueline! She was responsive and friendly. We would definitely stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We adore Jackie and the Bird’s Nest. It has become our home away from home on our trips to Durham. She has everything you need to have a pleasant stay. We’ve already booked our next stay. :)
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay- everything we needed!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a great deal! I am from Durham and come home to visit but there isn't room for me staying with my family. I grew up about a mile from this place and can confirm it's a great and safe location. This airbnb is great value for the price compared to other places I've seen and stayed at. It can be tough to find at night although the hosts did give really good instructions. I did hear some noise from upstairs but it wasn't a big deal or enough to deter me from staying here again. You can tell that the hosts put a lot of effort into making this place comfortable for their guests.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoy staying with her, she always above what is necessary. Good hospitality is invaluable!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, great location, plenty of towels, and lots of little extras like make up remover wipes and cosmetic sponges. Nice variety of coffee pods!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a wonderful stay! Very clean and enjoyed the extras included in the bathroom and kitchen. Quaint and nice place very close to DPAC. Will stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice little place to stay. Enjoyed the location and privacy. Was well above our expectations and would definitely look to stay again if ever in Durham again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So cozy and relaxing. Perfect place to stay while visiting Durham!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect spot on a quiet street and under a ten-minute drive to the Duke campus. Clean, comfortable and well appointed, we'll look to stay here again next time we're in town."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The Bird's Nest is a cozy, well-stocked, comfortable and very clean place in a beautiful part of Durham. Directions and check-in/check-out procedures were clear and easy to follow. Jackie always responded quickly to my messages. The outdoor patio space was lovely as well. We really enjoyed our stay there."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jackie was very responsive to my questions and requests. The Bird’s Nest was perfect for my short stay in North Carolina and had everything I needed to feel right at home.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Very clean. Very nice for location.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such an amazing time with our pup in the Bird’s Nest!!! We felt right at home as soon as we got there and everything was meticulously clean, with special treats offered. We felt like we were in a private suite and can’t wait to go back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at the Birds Nest!! There are tons of restaurants nearby and only 5mins from downtown Durham. Jacqueline was also amazing! She responds super quickly and provides everything you need for your stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pros: Nice accommodations, lots of very sweet extras. Place was very clean and welcoming. Area felt very safe! The little touches Jacqueline provides were very nice and heartwarming and you can see she goes the extra mile for sure!!!!
Cons: It is located below a residence and you can hear foot traffic above. Not in a terrible way but just something to note. Also because it is the lower level of a residence and in a woodsy area it is definitely damp and somewhat musty. Again, not terrible but it did slightly aggravate my allergies.
Overall a very good stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay. There were snacks available, and all kinds of bathroom amenities. My sister and I were seeing a concert at the Carolina Theatre which was only a short drive away with lots to do in that area. It was a perfect location and great stay. Jacqueline was even nice enough to mail my sisters sweater when she forgot it. If you need a nice place to stay that has great hosts this is a good location!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Jacqueline's Bird's Nest was so well equipped and decorated. We have stayed in many Airbnbs over the years and I believe she had the most well stocked bathroom and linens of any. She communicated immediately and her husband was very nice. We did walk around the neighborhood and look at all the beautiful houses. it was easy to get to the Duke campus and most other spots. A good value for money.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay. Very clean, comfortable, and cozy, with lots of extra special touches."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our stay. Loved the area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jacqueline's place is comfy, cozy, clean, and private. The terrace garden and outdoor seating and dining area was lovely. Her place is near many dining options with good ratings and is close to the medical center. The rooms are well appointed and tastefully decorated. Everything you need is available in the bathroom. We didn't use the kitchen, but it appears ready for light use. There's even a stacked washer/dryer. I would stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came into town on my first vacation and had a blast. The home was beautiful, quiet and clean. The hosts were nice and responsive with my questions. Really enjoyed staying and will definitely want to stay again in the future."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Bird's Nest was terrific! There was plenty of space and everything was extremely clean. I was delighted to find such thoughtful design and finishing touches throughout the apartment and in the garden outside. The outdoor patio space was truly wonderful for working and eating in the mornings and early evenings around the conference I was in town for. The hosts were easy to communicate with and even went out of their way to make sure I recovered some luggage I left behind. Absolutely recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Always a pleasure staying at the Bird’s Nest! It is comfortable, peaceful, well laid out and like staying at a retreat. I always look to book with Jacqueline first, when traveling to the Durham area!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was grateful for Jacqueline’s quick responses. I wrote her a lot of back and forth as we were trying to figure out logistics of arrival related to my son’s graduation ceremonies. She was patient and responded quickly and helpfully. The place was very clean and had in offer far more little extras than other airbnbs where I’ve stayed: toiletries, snacks, etc."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jacqueline was such a great communicating host. We had crazy plans with our Son’s graduation…. but she continued to answer promptly with questions we had. Such a cute, eclectic space. Very comfortable!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jacqueline’s place was everything described in the photos and more. She had made an incredibly cozy vibe with the space, and catered with little “extras” to all that you will possibly need (or forget to bring yourself) during your stay. I particularly enjoyed the outside space, which features a dedicated garden and seating, for restful meals in the beautiful Durham spring weather."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was perfect and the little amenities were a welcome and needed treat. Will definitely stay here again whej I am in town.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Bird’s Nest was the perfect space for 2. I’ve never stayed at an AIRBNB that was attached to the owner’s home, and I was a little worried, but it is it’s own separate apartment with all
the touches of home and completely private. Highly recommend."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jackie's place was a great place to stay during our visit to Durham. It's on a pleasant street 5-10 minutes drive from most places we wanted to visit in Durham. It was a great place for our dog too, as we had plenty privacy and space."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great cozy stay, with amazing hosts."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay here! It is the bottom of a two story duplex type house. I have nothing bad to say about the house, and location was great. Only 5 minutes from restaurants and downtown Durham! Very clean and they provided anything you could need. One thing I would say is the neighbors above are very loud due to the wooden floors, you could hear their every move. Overall great stay and I would definitely come back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Many reviews have highlighted the great location, communications, cleanliness, and attention to detail of this airbnb, all of which I found true. This is a basement apartment with easy parking, nice spaces inside and out, and very close to much of what I wanted to do. The one thing I learned that I didn't see mentioned in other reviews, is that the many cool metal pieces of art and furniture inside and out result from Jackie being a welder! She recommended a fun place she used to work - Cricket Forge - which I visited and really enjoyed! She and her husband have worked hard to make this place personal and special."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay in Durham near everything we wanted to do. Amenities were top notch--thought of things we didn't even realize we needed! Good tv choices. Good coffee selections. Really felt like home.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jackie’s place is well situated in Durham. The neighborhood is beautiful. Her place is on a busy street but well protected with a good fence. The outdoor space is great, a nice deck as you walk out the door. Parking is convenient just outside the door and down the steps.
There are a number of restaurants within a mile or so. You are near the Duke campus, and there is a park just a few minutes away, walking.
There were snacks and a number of additional products such as toiletries available for my use. This was very nice and special and generous. Everything that I needed was there plus more.
Jackie was super attentive to details and offered to get me whatever I needed.
Jackie helped me adjust my dates and was always available for any questions. I needed a carrot peeler and she brought me one right away. It was a nice, super sharp one.
The Airbnb is located below Jackie and her family’s home. It was a very nice, quiet and comfortable space."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Completely enjoy my stay! The entire space is well put together and they had the guest in mind throughout all the details. From the lovely organized signs around the house, to the snacks they had to enjoy at the dinner table. Everything was clean and with a purpose. The living room had a super comfy couch, the dinner table was perfect. I actually got to enjoy the perks of the house having a washer and dryer, splendid! The bed was relaxing and the room had all the essentials for a good night sleep. I would recommend to everyone interested in staying!♥️"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jackie and Victor were so sweet (they even let me do a late checkout!) and the Bird’s Nest was awesome!

When you first walk in it smells kinda of vintage but you get used to it, there are two air purifiers that work amazing. The bed was very comfy and I even took a nap on the couch it was comfy as well! The apartment was very well stocked plus I did wash a load of clothes. Super cute bathroom, the shower was a little small but worked fine for me just had to get used to it! I had some trouble sleeping because my dogs were reactive (barking/upset) towards the dogs upstairs just walking around or playing late at night. So if you have a reactive or high alert dog keep that in mind!! Overall a really great host, great living space, and would definitely return again!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks to our hosts for everything! They addressed any issues right away, and have so many little 'extras' that made our stay feel more luxurious and personal. Currently there is no hand rail for the short group of stairs getting up to the front door, so if you are a senior, you'll want to take that into consideration.
Overall, we really loved our stay at the Birds Nest! Great value and great location to everything."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Good place to stay in Raleigh in a private house! Good coffe!

It was near DPAC, many great restaurants, and parks. The apartment had wonderful amenities for a short stay. The hosts provided complimentary snacks and an assortment of toiletries in case you forget anything. The WiFi was fast, and Netflix was provided on both TVs. Our golden retriever traveled with us as well, and The Bird’s Nest was very pet friendly. Communication with Jacqueline was detailed and informative. We fell in love with Durham and will definitely stay at The Bird’s Nest the next time we’re in town!"
2022-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We liked the birds nest and its spaciousness. However, there was a musty basement odor the place had that we were not expecting. Very responsive hosts."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"such a lovely bnb! so cozy and sweet, everything you could ever need was there! would love to book again if given the chance!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Convenient location, reasonable price, good accommodations."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jackie’s Bird’s Nest is a great place to stay overnight. I could not think of anything that a traveler may need but forgot to bring is not offered by Jackie. We had a long day of driving from NJ, and sleeping on that comfy bed gave us a good sleep and we recovered fully the next day. Yes, we will check in again if we come back to this area."

The place is always clean and is super convenient to everything in Durham."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute! Perfect size and around a lot of fun things to do and places to eat!
2022-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Though there’s been great attention given to small touches, when you enter the home there is a distinct, malodorous smell. They try to mask with a very strong, floral scent. The website description that you have the entire house to yourself is not accurate. This is the downstairs of a home, a basement apartment.The upstairs is rented so there are people and a small dog walking across the floor. The furnace for the house is located in the bedroom, so it is noisy at night."
2022-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Jaqueline’s place was the ideal location for our quick overnight trip to Durham. It’s located within a quick drive to many lovely restaurants and shops. There’s a lovely deck right outside the door where we got to soak up some sun. Jaqueline was communicative and responded to all messages promptly and even allowed us to do an early check-in when we got to town sooner than expected. The apartment was clean and tidy for our arrival. My only issue was that the bed wasn’t the most comfortable for me because I have some problems with my joints and it seemed to be exacerbated by the bed. It might be something to consider if you’re a person with similar challenges. Overall it was a great stay and I would definitely recommend!!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay here!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,so cute! great for a couples stay!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay in Durham! Easy check-in, location, and communication!"
2022-02-01,3,Stayed one night,The location is safe and convenient and the host is friendly and informative. There are definitely a lot of extras and conveniences available with this rental. During our stay we struggled with a strong mal odor in the apartment and several cleanliness issues - since we were only there one night we decided not to pursue it with the owner during our stay and perhaps these will be addressed before future guest visits.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at The Bird’s Nest was great! The original plan was to use it as a place to crash while exploring Durham for the rest of the weekend, but we were snowed in for most of our trip. Thankfully, this was a great space to be snowed in to! We had everything we needed- and more. This was the first Airbnb I have stayed in that provided so many things to do (crossword puzzles, sudoku, magazines), and so many “in case you forgot” (cotton balls, band aids, floss, and even a face mask!) items. The towels were fluffy and plentiful! I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone visit the Raleigh Durham area."
