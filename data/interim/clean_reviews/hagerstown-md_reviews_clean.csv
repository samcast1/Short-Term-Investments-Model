2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Older unit, but very charming.
Easy to get to with ample parking out front.
Location worked out well for us and was near convenience stores."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"very nice place ....not completely perfect because the beds are a little old and the cleanliness under them should be better, there was a lot of dust behind the furniture in the room and a very ugly smell of cigarette with cat manure in the courtyard of the steps was very penetrating and unpleasant."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,100% recomendable! Nice place
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay while traveling to D.C. Everything was great.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason's place was like home away from home! The instructions for check-in were easy, parking was ample and the space was very comfortable. The apartment is well-appointed, with everything you need for your stay- including comfy beds, clean towels, linens, a spacious bathroom and nice furniture. Jason was very accommodating to my request and I will highly recommend his place to friends staying in this beautiful, historic area."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I recently stayed at this antique and beautiful location and we have absolutely no regrets! The host was extremely friendly and responsive. I attempted to reach out to him via text message, but it didn't go through. However, when I contacted him through Airbnb messaging, he was quick to respond. I highly recommend this location to everyone! We felt very welcome and at home. Thank you, Jason, for making our stay so enjoyable!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I've stayed at Jason's place twice now and both times were wonderful visits. The place is always clean, it's absolutely beautiful and always clean and free of clutter and it is within walking distance of multiple restaurants and the city park. I've staying there, and it is definitely worth every penny! Thank you, Jason!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved how quiet the space was, and how peaceful the space was. We were in town for a Roller Derby bout so the nice bathtub and shower accommodations were perfect! If you don’t mind stairs we highly recommend Jason’s place! Get your steps in, and then relax in this great AirBnB!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed my stay here. I think Jason was super proactive and communicative. I will say I got a “we hope you had a nice stay” message through Airbnb before our stay so that was a bit confusing. Jason was super accommodating when I realized I forgot something at the Airbnb and he let me grab it after check out. A couple of things I didn’t expect were the cigarette smell in the building common space (not the unit itself). Of course it’s an old building so it’s not out of the ordinary. I was also worried about parking due to not having a dedicated space but that wasn’t an issue at all. There were spaces in front of the building. Figuring out the heat/a/c in each of the rooms was a bit challenging since each room was controlled separately. And lastly while the towels that were provided were obviously cleaned, they were slightly stained - which made me a bit apprehensive to use them. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this Airbnb to others!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful host. Loved the amenities. Super responsive
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was exactly as described! It had all the amenities listed and more! Very clean and private - you have all of the top floor to yourself. Jason even worked with us for a later checkout time, which was super super convenient and very helpful!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the vibe, great communication, fun layout, and nestled at the top of a beautiful building atop a slight hill."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,It's a beautiful place. It's unfortunately on the top floor so you have to climb up 4 flights of stairs which my kids hated and the floor is very creaky because it's an older style house. I wouldn't recommend younger kids as mine wanted to run around a lot and we were afraid of disturbing the tenants under us with the creaky floor. All and all everything was clean. We stayed a week which was a long trip and there are heaters thankfully in each room because it was rather chilly out.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I absolutely loved it. It was nice and clean and I absolutely loved the porch and the bathroom. It was outstanding!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came into town to see our daughter and we wanted a place that had a good location, amenities to cook, 2 bedrooms and lots of space and this condo was PERFECT!! We were able to hang out with our family, cook meals, play games and relax in this spacious space. It was clean, packed with everything we needed and even had a balcony with a view. It was located in a nice area, close to downtown. We visit Hagerstown often and we will be back and will stay here!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect and I really enjoyed the couple of days I was able to stay. The apartment was beautiful! The bathroom and kitchen were absolutely beautiful and the bed was comfortable! 100 percent recommend!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The only thing I must say is that the apartment is on the fourth floor and the post does not say it and there are no elevators to raise luggage and difficult access for people over 65 years of age with disabilities
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice one night stay:)
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming but cold… loved the place but had issues with the heat. (I keep my old house at 68 and it was much colder than that.) Host called HVAC but I found out from them that the issues had previously been reported. Recommend getting confirmation that the heat works well and that the noisy bedroom unit has been fixed (another guest 5 months ago had reported that issue and it hadn’t been fixed). Otherwise, this was a great place - cute, charming, quiet, and close enough to restaurants to walk."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a lovely apartment. The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of towels. Easy parking. Guests should be aware, before booking, of the 4 flights of stairs!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We felt right at home when we arrived at Jason's beautifully-decorated apartment! It was well-appointed, super clean and had easy check-in. Because we were attending a show at Maryland Theater, it was super walkable and we found a nice selection of restaurants near the theater. The street on which the apartment is located had many beautiful, historic homes and churches making a stroll down the street enjoyable. The covered back porch with a view was a nice surprise."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charming apartment on a quiet one-way street and close enough to walk to many restaurants. We loved our quick getaway to explore a new town.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love this apartment and plan to stay here every time we are in town visiting family.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The premise was great. Clean and well maintained. The amenities were great. I really like the old fashioned deep bath tub.
The location appeared to be safe overall, but occasionally there were people in the area who you need to be careful.
Overall I recommend this place (good for the money)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good for a getaway that feels like home . Very clean and lots of great amenities
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cute place and conveniently located.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean, the communication was good and also the location. We liked the experience"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m a returning guest and would definitely recommend. Very clean, tidy & comfortable furnishings. Jason was very responsive when I needed to reached out about a concern & made sure all our needs were met. I’m sure we will return again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay. Very comfortable, clean with magazine style decor. We felt right at home and comfortable."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jason was excellent. Handled a minor issue immediately. Very polite and helpful. I recommend this location to anyone. It will not disappoint.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,OK
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason provided thorough information and details before our stay, which was great! There was plenty of parking directly in front of the house, we never had an issue finding a spot anytime we left and came back. The stairs were fine for us but I could see how some folks might have a tough time, there were quite a few staircases to climb. No issues getting into the building or the unit itself. Upon entering the unit, we notice that the floors weren't very clean, it seems that the housekeeper(s) might need to focus more on that, it look like it hadn't been swept at all and rugs not vacuumed. Otherwise the place seemed to be clean. Shower was nice and roomy and no issues with water pressure during our stay. Was kind of surprised to not find any paper towel provided in the kitchen or tissues anywhere either. Beds were comfortable enough but the AC units in the bedrooms were pretty noisy, we ended up just not using them. Overall, a good stay, but some minor things that could be improved upon."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My sister and I came to Hagerstown to see my father and really enjoyed staying at Jason's. It had a lot of room and was very clean. Great location too. An issue with the TV was solved by quick communication with Jason. We will stay there again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jason’s place was very comfortable an peaceful. He’s a great host very responsive I would definitely book his place again when I’m in town
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just as pictured, clean, quiet and comfortable."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Will stay again soon. Not too bad
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent host always responded to all our needs. We wanted to stay there longer but ours got ahead of us. Many thanks to the host!! We would definitely choose this home again.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Centrally located, excellent shower/bath. Many televisions w/ cable, lots of towels, fully stocked kitchen, comfy couch. Was checking out Hagerstown for a potential job transfer but I’m not sure if the area is for me. Went to bull & bear around the corner, 5 minute walk. We ate outside so we had a chance to see locals walking around and not to be critical but a lot of them looked pretty rough. I wanted to experience Hagerstown for myself and not go off of things I’ve read on Reddit about the area but after closer inspection, those people were pretty accurate. If you’re just passing through, great place to stay. As noted by Jason, on the better side of town."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place. I would like to return to enjoy all its comforts. Thank you Jason for so much kindness.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jason’s unit is spacious, very clean, comfortable beds, fully equipped kitchen - everything needed for a restful night on the road."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we enjoyed our stay. easy to get to. close to the event we were attending. quiet neighborhood.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love it reasonable price ♥️
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very comfortable and the location was great. The stairs up to the apartment and down to downtown were difficult for my elderly parents, but manageable."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place. Quiet, secure building. Well stocked kitchen. The shower is really nice. The neighborhood is walkable and has a great park with lakes and trails, and it’s next door to a really nice church. Would absolutely stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a very good stay. I will visit again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was lovely. The space was gorgeous and had a pleasant balance of old and new. Jason responded immediately when I had a small issue with the code for the front door. (I failed to fully read the entry instruction). The town is historic and also a bit sleepy. We loved how quiet the street is. Good stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My home away from home.
Thank you Jason"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location walkable to several restaurants.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay at this listing. The host, Jason, was responsive and provided clear instructions prior to my arrival so most of my questions were already answered. The place itself was spotless and well prepared for my arrival. 10/10 would recommend."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is nicely decorated. Everything provided that was needed. Jason responds with any questions quickly. The beds are super comfortable! Love the shower! Great water pressure. Parking was always available. The only thing to consider when traveling is the stairs. Anyone traveling with someone elderly or unsteady on their feet should be careful with booking. But as long as you and your travel partners are still good with stairs, it's not a big deal at all:)"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Jason's place was very easy to locate and parking was right in front of the entrance. Check-in was flawless thanks to very specific instructions. The condo was very clean and the rooms were spacious. The kitchen had top of the line appliances and was surprisingly well furnished for cooking--down to salt, sugar, coffee, etc. The bed we slept on in the room with the sitting area was extremely comfortable! The bathroom was amazing and the shower was HUGE! Shampoo and soap were provided and plenty of towels. There is a fire station nearby and some occasional sirens but we heard no noise from nearby units. We found the living room TV and shower door a little tricky to navigate but we managed. Jason was very responsive to emails. We were missing a working hair dryer and a can opener, which he said would be replaced ASAP. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would highly recommended Jason's place!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Incredible place for what you're paying. Book now!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was very last min with this reservation. Jason did awesome with making things go smooth on very short notice. I appreciate his efforts.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place- would definitely stay again
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great host! We loved the character and feel of the condo. Highly recommend.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful place downtown. Easily accessible, clean, and within walking distance to anything you would need. Would stay again the next time I’m in town."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb has a beautiful kitchen and bathroom and large washer/dryer. I'd recommend a sleep mask/earplugs if you are sensitive to light and sound at night because the windows let light in and the cooling/heating units buzz. Jason was very responsive to my question during my stay, which I enjoyed!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, beautiful decorations, love the two person shower."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason's place is right in the middle of things in Hagerstown, but very quiet and peaceful. The space is very well laid out, with a high-ceiling open kitchen/living room/dining space, two sizable bedrooms, and a fantastic bathroom (the walk-in shower is huge and has two rain heads, and there's a separate clawfoot bathtub for those who prefer to soak). There's even a bench on the back side of the condo with a great view of the city and countryside. It's a great place to stay for those who are just passing through, or those who will be in town for a while."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was nice and we had a memorable family time there!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jason was such a great and responsive host. When we couldn’t figure out how to turn one of his heaters on, he purchased one and it arrived within an hour! That really impressed us! The beds were very comfortable and for me as a disabled veteran that was huge! Perfect location and parking was so easy. We will be here again soon!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the great place & simple check-in & check-put process. Would 100% recommend!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A lovely, quiet get-away."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place and the room is nice
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The condo was comfortable and cozy! It was exactly as described. My family frequents the area and we would stay there again. The cost of staying was a rare find and very affordable.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jason's place is super spacious and well furnished. The bed was oh so comfy, too!
The very old house where his condo is located is in an historic area and close to the City Park and Washington County Fine Arts Museum. Convenient to restaurants and all that downtown Hagerstown has to offer."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good location and clean
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very modern updated condo. It was quiet and had everything you needed inside. We will definitely stay again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the stay. The place was very clean. We enjoyed walking down to the square. The bars and coffee shops are well worth the visit. The architecture of the surrounding buildings as well as the buildings downtown are a hidden gem in MD. If you like vinyl records, I HIGHLY recommend a short walk to Hub City Vinyl. If you are a beer or bourbon fanatic, the Prohibition Hub is an excellent choice. We will definitely stay here again in the future."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay and the place was clean and very comfy.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place. I loved the ambience of the area. Easy peasy check in!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,looking forward to seeing you soon
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Place is absolutely beautiful! I would definitely recommend to stay her if you are trying to stay in the area. The unit is very spacious with a lot of room to enjoy your stay. There is even a rooftop balcony to enjoy your morning coffee!
Only thing, if you feel you need flexibility with the check-out or check-in time, from my experience from unforeseen circumstances from the stay before me these times were not flexible.
But over-all this place is absolutely perfect and easy parking across the street!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My guest and I enjoyed our stay overall. Beautiful and neat condo with a decent view of the surrounding area with a patio on the roof. Kitchen has all the basic necessities required to cook, if you wish. You plenty of different things to go do within driving or within walking distance. Overall an amazing place to stay."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great access to downtown.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The directions for checking in were extremely clear and easy to follow. The space was comforting and felt as if I were home. There were plenty of toiletries available for myself and my little ones. I enjoyed the outside seating space for late night book reads and for quiet time after everyone was asleep. I will definitely book this space again during my future travels to Mercersburg.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family were in town looking for a new home and while in town searching we stayed at Jason’s place. Wow factor is is under statement. It’s so comfortable and accommodating. You will not be disappointed staying here.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice place and a beautiful street. The stairs aren't bad, after we reserved I was told it was a 4 floor walk up but it is really 3, they are just broken down weird."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Historic condo walking distance from beautiful city park.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Perfect location and had everything I needed. Would return again!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was very clean, comfortable and cozy, we will be back to stay here again.
Thanks for the great hospitality!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,absolute fantastic. loved all the details like coffee and soaps!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jason’s place was perfect, it’s bigger than in pictures for sure. The two bedrooms were a perfect size for my family it’s very clean and very pretty. The place is very well updated, would definitely consider staying here again. Jason was very responsive and kept us well communicated."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Hello Jason, we loved our stay in Hagerstown and really enjoyed the beautiful old building we got to stay in. You have it very nicely decorated and well stocked...it made us feel right at home We noticed that the light in the shower didn't work as well as the string lights on the back porch. Both of these weren't a big deal, but it would have been nice if they would have worked. We also noticed that the rugs didn't seem to have been vacuumed and this bothered us some. Otherwise the condo seemed very clean and the accommodations suited us very well. I would be happy to recommend this place to my friends Thank you very much for letting us stay at your condo. Heather"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Air BNB was amazing, the property and condo was way more for the money!!!! Our party were in town for a wedding, the view was fantastic. As a larger guy I decided to go with the stairs and they were no issue, and we're way less stairs than imagined"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Jason was a wonderful host. Being very responsive in times of questions and kind. The place was cool to stay and neighborhood was quiet and clean.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Space is huge- bigger than pictures show. Both rooms could fit a pack n play. It is a walk up but stairs are very wide. Living spaces are updated and nice.
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The air bnb itself was lovely- super cute and clean. Water pressure was very low. The shower heads worked well, but it took a little to fill the tub since the pressure was so low. Same with the sinks in the bathroom and kitchen. Basically a trickle so it made it hard to wash dishes. Also very uneasy feeling throughout the air bnb. The street it was on was okay, but down the hill (about 500 feet), the area wasn't very safe. Cameras were put on the outside of the doors and I wasn't notified of those, as well as not being notified that there was a fire escape that led straight to the street. Anyone could've had access to the air bnb if they wanted. I was also not notified that the air bnb is on the 3rd floor of the building. Lastly, there was a Nest ""security system"" (thats what it was called when I looked it up) that would reconfigure every once in a while and I was not notified of that either. Lastly, this is a little picky, but the tvs were not connected to wifi so cable was the only option. I do recommend this spot, but do wish I was told about the above things."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jason’s home was big & comfy & had all the proper items needed to enjoy my stay. 5 stars ⭐️
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a blast, so clean and accurate!! My family and I had a fantastic time at this beautiful cabin!!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts have done a wonderful job of providing modern amenities to this jewel of a historic era home. Nearly ever convenience was at our finger tips and the hosts made sure access and communication was simple and prompt. The unit was quick to cool which was important as we visited in the hottest part of the year.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A great apartment and good communication with the owner
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in town, historic space and plenty of room."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place for us to stay while in town for a weekend event. The location is In a beautiful part of historic Hagerstown. This building/unit had so much character with all of the modern amenities needed for our stay.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jason's place was wonderful and exactly as advertised. We've stayed at several AirBNBs over the years and so far, this has been our favorite place. We just stopped for a night, but were impressed by the cleanliness and amenities for the price. We loved having access to a full kitchen, and felt that there were hotel like touches (personal soaps/shampoo, availability to make delicious coffee!) We loved going to the Hagerstown City Park. It was so beautiful, and only a four minute drive. (I believe you could walk there as well.) We took our young toddler there and she played at the awesome playgrounds, but it was lovely just to walk around the pond as well. We even caught a rehearsal for the Hagerstown Municipal Band while we were there. I would highly recommend Jason's place if you are spending some time in Hagerstown."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great modern space. Good A/C. Easy parking. Great value
2022-05-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,Pictures are deceiving. No water pressure in kitchen sink and sink in bathroom. Both showers do not work only the far one in picture. Bath tub does not have any cold water and hot only comes out in a trickle. So all the things I looked forward to enjoying did not work. Bed is very comfy and air conditioners cool the house very well. Had trouble with Jason answering us with our questions about the water. He did not respond and he lives in another state so he is not there. Wet clothing was left in the dryer and dishwasher was full of clean dishes where housekeeper did not finish her job.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and overall place. we enjoyed our stay.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was awesome! Very clean and nice looking with every amenity that you may need. The host was very helpful and responsive when I needed to know how to work the heating unit and in accommodating my earlier arrival. Everything was super comfortable. The only drawback would be that if you are unable to do stairs, this might not work out for you, but for me it was fine. I got a little winded over the four short flights but all that said was I need to do more cardio! Lol!
Overall, this was great stay and the host was fantastic. I highly recommend you to book this. I will on my future visits to Hagerstown!"
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Street parking but we were able to park very close and easily each time. Charming building. Comfortable apartment. Would stay again.
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place in a gorgeous old building. Plenty of parking right in front. Very clean. Comfy bed and great heat /AC system.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying at this place in Hagerstown. We knew it was a historic building, and expected the sounds and smells of an older building, but it was nicely renovated and very comfortable. The main living area was nice and open, and the bathroom was a nice size. Being on the top floor did mean there were steps to climb, but there were no other rooms on the same floor, so it was pretty quiet. I would only ask that the water pressure be checked to see if it can be adjusted, but overall we had a really nice time."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location. Close walk to restaurants. Also a nice walk around to see beautifully architectures homes and churches. Highly recommend. The condo has so many comfortable features.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house is an absolute gem! I audibly gasped several times when walking through, especially when I saw the bathroom. My boyfriend and I were just looking for a place to stay for the night during a long road trip and we were so pleasantly surprised by the house and Hagerstown in general that we’re already planning a trip back."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason was a wonderful host with an incredibly clean and comfortable home. There was plenty of space for my two girlfriends and myself, parking was super easy and we were able to walk to restaurants in town. Jason provided all of the details we would need ahead of time to ensure a stress free stay. We will definitely stay here again in the future!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place
Nice location
Very convenient"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect for our needs; we jaunted off to Frederick for dinner each night because it was so close. All the amenities were there, in fact we wished we had stayed longer to really enjoy the space. Water pressure was a little low, but that really didn't bother us."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay at!
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason’s apartment is comfy, roomy, clean and we would stay there again. Be forewarned it is on the 4th floor so be prepared to climb 38 stairs. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen very nicely furnished and he even left us a bottle of wine. Nice touch!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jason’s place was a perfect layover spot! It is conveniently located and communication was seamless. Definitely recommended.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, bright, clean, historical, rich character, and romantic.
Quality washer dryer, gorgeous bathtub and double shower.
This place is on the top flour, so there are a couple flights of stairs. This adds to the character of the place and wasn't hard to work with at all. Just be aware that you will have to use stairs to get up there. The advantage is total privacy and bright light from all the windows.
We loved this place and it's definitely somewhere we'd love to revisit."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,fantastic! so to have a luxury place to stay in downtown Hagerstown!
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Place was cute and in a good location.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall a decent to good stay however there are some things that need fixed/ worked on. I would check with the host to see if these things got addressed before booking. The water pressure in the kitchen is especially bad if you are planning on using the kitchen a decent amount and needing to wash dishes. The bath tub in the picture wasn't usable because only the hot water worked and it also didn't have good water pressure. The shower has 2 faucet heads and only one of them worked. This wasn't a huge deal since we really only needed one to work but its not great to be advertised and then not work. The couches really could be updated because you sank way down into them, seem like they have had their wear. On a good note Jason was very responsive and check in and out was super easy. The location was great. We walked to a small grocery store and to one of the local restaurants. There were other good restaurants in walking distance that we didn't get to try and i could see that once there is a little warmer weather it would be a fun city to check out more. I did not mind that we had to climb 4 sets of stairs to get in our room, the stair sets were pretty short and didn't take long to get to the top. I had seen someone mention in their review about the smell of the place. Being that it is an old Historic building that was remodeled i understand its hard to have a new place smell. Jason did have 1 or 2 air purifiers running that was nice. There still was a slight smell but being that i worked there during the day i got used to it and it didn't bother me. It was nice having the whole place to ourselves and for the price if the few things i mentioned would get fixed i would say it would be a good place for anyone who isn't crazy bothered by old building smells to stay. Also forgot to mention that we got to park right outside of the building every day so that made it super easy as well especially for unloading and loading our stuff ."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great location. You can walk to the city park or historic downtown in minutes. The condo was very clean and comfortable, we slept well and used the very nice & modern kitchen."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Jason was an attentive host & responded quickly to our questions. The apartment was well-equipped & comfortable. There was plenty of space in the kitchen, a sitting area, a dining area, 2 full bedrooms with comfy beds, & a bathroom with double sinks & a walk-in shower. All the TVs & ceiling fans worked with remotes. Something to expect ahead of time would be the 5 flights of steps required to access the apartment & the low water pressure."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet street, easy parking. Apartment was really nice and well outfitted. Jason was an excellent host and was very responsive."

It was clean and comfortable, and we liked the charm of the historic building it was in. Check in and check out were easy and Jason had great communication. Check it out if you need a fun place to stay!"
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, this rental has promise but is need of a deep clean and maintenance. Also, we did not feel safe in this location. We’re a family of 4 traveling with grade school kids.
I thought the location would allow for walkability to local cafes, restaurants, etc. The location is technically walkable but we didn’t feel safe walking the handful of blocks and drove for everything. I’m not sure if the neighborhood has been impacted due to Covid and businesses closing, etc.
The interior is renovated but the building itself is very old. We found decor broken and not hung. Also, we found water damage where paint was peeling off the ceiling and next to a window in the living area. The fire alarm was also removed from the kitchen which was a safety concern. One of the shower heads was labeled broken and the other one that is working barely had water pressure. Many of the pots and pans had loose handles.
Also, it caused me a bit of anxiety when I was only given access code info 24 hrs before check in, even after inquiring. I find it more typical for a week advance info. Also, it’s a 4 floor walk up, which I don’t recall in the description. And we had to buy our own laundry detergent which was a bit of a nuisance. Seems like a low cost expense to provide when the washer and dryer were highlighted in the amenities.
So we made due but would not return."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable accommodations. Good central location. We visited Boonsboro and Antietam battlefield/museum. Devils backbone County park and Frederick. All were 30 min or less away from the condo.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason’s spot was wonderful. It was great being on the top floor of the building. It’s a hike to get up the stairs, but the extra privacy is worth it. The kitchen was so well stocked with extensive supplies for cooking just about any meal, and the design was modern and very clean throughout the entire space. We were right next to lots of shops, restaurants, and a unique art walk just five minutes away. Definitely would book again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful place to stay! It had everything you would need and was very clean upon arrival. Jason was an excellent host!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was able to live and work in this space as if it was my own. Everything you need is provided and makes it a very comfortable space.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Exactly as described
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jason is an excellent host. His place is lovely, clean, and accurately listed. I deducted one star because I had a question and never got an answer, but it was the forth of July weekend, so I’m sure that had something to do with it.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, convenient, and quite."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, would stay again."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Spacious and well-accommodated living, sleeping, kitchen and bath. Age of building and attic location of unit evidenced some previous water damage on ceiling and walls and musty air that was addressed through the use of several air filters throughout the unit, but some could be sensitive and may wish to know of this in advance. One of the beds was hard and one was soft, so something for everyone. ;) We enjoyed our stay."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Quaint, older place to stay. Host is very well organized."

Short walk to all sorts of restaurants, less than a half hour to Catoctin. It's a very cute and stylish place with a well stocked kitchen and perfectly comfy couch after your long day of hiking."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason’s place is very well equipped, and a great location. He was very responsive to any inquiries we had and very helpful.

2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A fun stay in a old home at the top floor of a flat. Since the building is old there are it’s weird noises and no heat. But the space heaters make up for it. Jason is also a good renter being very responsive

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so beautiful! It felt like a home away from home. Jason was great at communicating and everything was exactly as pictured. I got a chance to chat with the person who came in to clean after my stay, and it was really reassuring to hear about all the different ways they’re working hard to make sure the place stays as clean and safe as possible during this pandemic. I’ll definitely be coming back for future travels in the area."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cool space in a neat old renovated building. Beds and living room were very comfortable. Kitchen seems basically new. I didn't cook anything so I don't recall how well equipped it was as far as cookware. Nice coffee maker. There was only salt, pepper, parsley, Lawry's and maybe one other spice so bring more if you plan to cook. It's an old building and I noticed DampRid in the hallways and the apartment itself has lots of air purifiers so maybe someone super sensitive to mold sensitivity should ask about that. I wasn't bothered."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It’s a very nice space, comfortable beds, good location too. I’d recommend it!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The condo was very clean. Jason was very responsive if I had any questions at all.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I will recommend this home a thousand times and more.. What a peaceful, beautiful and calm environment. If you seek to run away for awhile from the busy urban noise troubles and have a quiet time, this will work perfectly. Ruth is very communicative and welcoming..The place was clean to detail.. I love my time there and will certain reserve a spot soon.."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you, Ruth, for the opportunity to be your guest and for being so accommodating! I loved the big kitchen and the peaceful-ness of the neighborhood. It was all very comfortable and restful! Would love to come stay again."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"She was very friendly, helpful and responsive to texts. the place was spacious very clean and nice. comfortable reclining movie style couch In front of the TV. soap and shampoo for the shower. I enjoyed hot tea before bed and when I woke up. there was a small computer desk and chair perfect for my laptop. the bed is nice it is very firm though good for back sleepers not good for side sleepers. the home is in a nice neighborhood, quiet and peaceful. I wish I had another day to relax in front of the TV but my budget or schedule wouldn't allow that. :) It was a great place to stay while traveling and passing through the area!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Matched the description. Nice private entrance with designated parking in a safe neighborhood. As with any basement apartment, we could definitely hear the family upstairs. Unfortunately, the small children were making loud noise well beyond the “quiet hours” so just be mindful of this when booking. Otherwise we had no issues and the host was responsive to our request to adjust the temperature when asked."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, easy check in. and quick to respond when we reached out. Its easy to hear the family upstairs but when they heard we arrived, they quieted down.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So this place was a last minute booking for a quick getaway. it's a newer AirBnb and it shows (in all the right ways). It's clear that attention to detail was important to them... it's a perfect little spot for ground zero! It was immaculately clean, much nicer furniture and fixtures than I normally see in an AirBnb. Highly recommend!!"

We were on our way to Hagerstown and so at the last moment we found Kim’s listing. She responded quickly and within minutes we had our reservation with Kim. The house was clean and welcoming for our tired family which included a 3 year old and baby. The Locker Room was great. Just a couple of blocks from a nice playground. Kim was responsive to our needs. I would recommend her place to others"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kim and Walt were amazing hosts! They were very kind, and their response time was always immediate and lovely. I highly recommend this place to everyone, especially if you are in town for business. They have everything fully stocked, and the price is great. We will definitely be using their home again in the future. Thanks for providing our guests with an amazing experience and a relaxing holiday weekend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kim’s house was so beautiful and convenient! Kim was also super responsive and helpful. Highly recommend her place to anyone staying in the area.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I booked this for co-workers and did not stay there myself but they were very happy with the accommodations and Kim was very helpful and easy to work with. We would stay there again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Our stay at the house was perfect. The house had everything we needed and more.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Kim's place was great! It was perfect for our longer stay. Very much looking forward to booking again when we're back!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time using Kim’s place as a launching point for skiing at Whitetail. It is less than a 30 min drive from the slopes. The house had three bedrooms upstairs with two full baths and then a half bath on the main floor and a full bath in the basement. Everything was clean and super easy!
We managed to stuff 3 adults and 4 kids in, but it was a pretty tight (not unexpected for a 3 bedroom). I would highly recommend for groups of 5-6. The kids had a great time with the ping pong table in the basement.
A variety of shops (Wal-Mart, Dick’s, etc.) and chain restaurants are a few minutes away by car, so that is very handy.
Overall, definitely would recommend this place!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is absolutely amazing! We loved every minute of our almost two week stay! The house so incredibly clean. It was easy to get into the house. The hosts were so incredible. They are great people. The place has everything. My kids loved the ping pong and basketball in the basement. The beds were super comfortable. I want to get the same mattress they have. There is so much space and a beautiful home. We will definitely be back. I would recommend this place to anyone. We absolutely loved our stay here.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great decor! Very clean! Will definitely go back.
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I were very frustrated that we were unable to open the old lockbox and therefore we couldn't get into the unit. It took more than a little time for Kim to call back once I called to tell her we couldn't access the place. Therefore we were an hour late getting to our appointment and after a long drive we had to go to the local Mcdonald's to use their restroom. The king bed in the master bedroom was, I think, made entirely of hard foam. It was very uncomfortable and the king size pillows weren't high quality either. The place is spacious and clean but the sleeping situation wasn't good. My friend in the queen bed said her bed was uncomfortable also. I would not recommend this place."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Would totally recommend this beautiful home. My brother and I stayed here while working in town and it made our trip undeniably better. The house matches the host! Cannot say enough nice things about her and I urge you to find out for yourself! Would book again with them in a heartbeat! 10/10

2023-02-01,4.0,Group trip,"Solid townhome, short distance to shops and grocery stores as well as the downtown Hagerstown restaurants. ONLY 20 mins to Whitetail ski resort which makes it a great jumping off point for skiers.
We comfortably slept 5 but easily can accommodate a few other guests. It was well stocked and Kim was extremely responsive and friendly. There were a few cosmetic issues that I’m sure Kim has already fixed.
We enjoyed our stay."

She’s quick to respond to text and needs. Super host! Would absolutely come back if/when in the area again."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We spent two nights in the townhouse and felt right at home. The place is exactly as described and has been given so much thought for families that come to stay. All of us had a blast with the ping pong table. The kitchen has everything you need to cook for the family and the coffee bar is such a great perk.

The kitchen is stocked with everything you need to cook (sharp knives!, nice pots and pans, serving dishes, muffins pans, etc). We cooked every night and felt right at home.
Washer and Dryer in the basement was a bonus!
Would definitely recommend this place to family and friends!"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the first time I've booked an Airbnb, and it exceeded my expectations. We are a family of 6, and finding a place that's big enough for all of us is difficult. Kim's home is absolutely beautiful, and was large enough for us to spread out. The kids enjoyed the extras such as the pingpong table and mini basketball hoop. My fiance and I enjoyed the coffee and tea bar. The added little touches just set it over the top. There's plenty of places to shop and eat as well. We will be booking this home whenever we come back to Hagerstown."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Rorke was extremely accommodating! I let her know we would be coming in late due to traveling with kids and she left the lights on for us. The place is BEAUTIFUL and looks exactly how it is described. I feel everything you need is in the house as she provides lots of appliances etc. The beds were comfy. My kids loved climbing the stairs to their bedrooms! We loved watching the little ducks in the water & the salamanders under the house. I’m disappointed I didn’t get to see the vultures that every one raves about but that’s not her fault 🤣 We will definitely be back if we are ever in the area again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I am having trouble finding words to descibe Rorke's place. Its a truly special place and Rorke is great.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,beautiful historic house with nice furniture
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It's a nice historic home and it was a pleasure to stay here.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Historical portal to the past. Amazing opportunity to live amidst the handiwork of early Americans.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rorke has done an amazing job of renovating this 220+ year old house. It is cozy and quaint, set in a quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed her decorating touches and grew very fond of her Kuerig coffee maker. Since we have family nearby, we will very likely be back. Next time we might even schedule some time to actually relax and read a book or watch a movie instead of running around the countryside."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rorke’s place was the perfect retreat for my bestie and I after we went to a concert at Maryland theater in Hagerstown. Beautiful 200 year + renovated accommodation- quiet, clean and comfy. Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Springhouse is Awesome!!! No complaints whatsoever! Someone reviewed this saying it had a musty smell. I can assure you that the smell here is NOT MUSTY! This is a healthy house; one that has aged well in its 221 years!! The light sweet smell in the home is from the gloriously seasoned original wood in the structure. Will surely stay here again in our travels!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed our stay at Rorke's springhouse. The historic property has been comfortably appointed with the modern amenities you'd expect without sacrificing any of the original charm. The Airbnb was super well equipped with toiletries, extra towels, blankets, and pillows, and was so cozy and pristine. I really feel the pictures don't do it justice for how nice a stay it was. A few notes that might be relevant for others - overall the area outside of the Airbnb is a little rougher (abandoned homes) but do not let this deter you since the property itself was setback nicely, private, and enjoyable. As a historic home, the staircases are extremely steep/compact, so those with mobility challenges may want to look elsewhere. Lastly, while downstairs stayed quite comfortable in temperature, upstairs did get very hot with the rising heat in winter, so definitely don't be afraid to turn the thermostat down early so the upstairs doesn't stifle. Overall, I absolutely recommend this stay!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rorke's place was exactly as described: comfortable, easy to access, clean. We have enjoyed our stay greatly, and will probably be back!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great historic little building. It was such a nice place to relax and ring in the new year. A truly unique spot that we'd love to stay again if we find ourselves in Hagerstown. Charming, cozy, and comfortable."

The house was clean, exactly as photographed, and very interesting. I would definitely recommend it to a couple and close friends. The bathroom is downstairs from the bedrooms, which is indicated in the description. This might make it difficult for small children, older adults, or folks who are uncomfortable using stairs that start in someone else's bedroom. It wasn't an issue for us at all. We LOVED our stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice time at the Springhouse. You could watch animals and there was everything you needed in the house. It was all very lovingly furnished, only the strong vanilla room scent we could have waived;-). Overall we had a great time, thank you!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We only stayed for a night but I wished we’d stayed longer. It was very charming and cozy and a great location between Hagerstown and close to hiking near the mountains and state park. Thanks for a great place to stay Rorke! We will definitely book again!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at the Spring House. Everything was as described. Rorke gave very clear instructions to make finding the home and checking in easy and she was very responsive when I reached out. The home is warm and cozy and the way the house is set back from the road we felt like we were removed from the hustle and bustle, but stores and restaurants were only 5-10 minutes away. Also an easy 30 minute ride to skiing at Liberty Resort! Definitely a fun and unique experience - our kids thought the basement/spring room was very cool!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Springhouse was a super peaceful-relaxing-and very enjoyable space to stay in. We definitley plan on coming back and will try to stay there again. The host was amazing and very responsive.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Springhouse was a wonder getaway for us to have a quite and peaceful place to relax. Really amazing building built above a flowing spring! Good vibes!!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at the spring house! It was cozy and quiet, but close to downtown Hagerstown."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying at Rorke's Springhouse, and we love it. It is absolutely charming, with historical details that make you feel like you are stepping back in time. The beds are comfortable, the towels and linens were high quality and the entire setting is very peaceful. The spring outside running under the house is gorgeous with. lush covering of duckweed and lots of, well, ducks. We had to stay here unfortunately during a loved one's hospitalization and again for their memorial. Both times Rorke was helpful and communicative and flexible. And, during a hard time, the Springhouse offered us a peaceful respite. We will stay here anytime we are visiting our family in Hagerstown."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,This was my group’s second time here and it was just as perfect as the first.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great! Thanks again!
2022-12-01,3.0,Group trip,House was cute and historical inside / outside felt more unkept. / very close to other house
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Historic spring house, just as advertised."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved everything about the spring house. It is historic, but not small or cramped. Even though spring houses were meant to keep food cool, this house was toasty and warm in December, and the water in the shower was hot. The bathroom rugs were the fluffiest I've ever seen. Staying here in the winter was dreamy, private and secluded. The house is pretty easy to reach but felt a world away. I would love to return here. The house is lovely. The stairs to the second floor may be a little tricky for a tall person to navigate, but the lighting is great and there are very firm handrails on the stairs. I had to wash socks and clothes after hauling debris around from the ice storm. I really appreciated being able to use the washing machine and drier in the spring house."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Although I live locally I needed a quiet place to have a study group for my daughter and her friends before finals. The house was amazing and the perfect place for the girls to prepare for finals. We had everything we needed, even extra coffee pods! It was such a fun adventure."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic historic home to saty in while attending a wedding in nearby Greencastle! Close to everything--highly recommend!!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Springhouse was exactly what I needed—a cozy, quiet respite with good Wi-Fi so I could work remotely I slept soundly, worked at the kitchen table and relaxed in the parlor. The little creek outside was lovely.
The building has lots of character but it didn’t feel its age in terms of staying warm, the great shower and making coffee.
The check-in and check-out instructions were clear and thorough, and I liked the opportunities to learn more about the history of the building.
Thank you for an enjoyable stay. I’d definitely return!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,We had an amazing time and the house was perfect! Exactly as described and just what we were looking for. We were a group of 6 hiking the MD section of the Appalachian Trail and needed a place to stay for 4 nights that was centrally located to the trail. I can't say enough good things about Rourke and The Springhouse and we would definitely stay here again!!! Bonus...the house had the softest water ever. Everyone loved showering!!! :)
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Neat place to stay! If you love the look and feel of old houses, this place is great! Highly recommend if you are in this area. would definitely go back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean, beautiful, and conveniently located for all the places I wanted to visit. I would definitely stay there again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome and cozy place!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Springhouse felt peacefully remote yet everything we needed or wanted was very close by. For such a charming and centuries old building, it was beautifully restored and was warm and insulated better than many hotels I've stayed in. I would highly recommend this step back in time for your next getaway!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I absolutely adore this place! I just needed a place to crash for the night while traveling. But this place was so cool, love the house, love the attention to detail! Communication was perfect as well! I will definitely be coming back! Maybe I’ll even get in the spring next time :)"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Unusual and interesting place. Was as advertised. I would stay again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely charming and beautiful historic home nestled in town. Beautiful scenery and fabulous accommodation! A great value as well!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything at the Spring House was just as stated, and if anything, it was even cozier than we expected. The house was clean, comfortable, and an easy drive to the Gettysburg battlefield, which was our reason for this trip. We loved staying such an interesting old house -- the porch was perfect for enjoying my morning cup of tea, the kids enjoyed visiting with the cow in the pasture behind the house, and we all enjoyed playing new-to-us games from the game cupboard. Rorke was extremely responsive and courteous, which is a top priority for me when choosing an airbnb. This was an excellent stay."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Springhouse is such a jewel of history! Close to I-70 and a short drive to restaurants/stores, but tucked away in it's own private pocket of nature. Wish the walls could talk and tell it's rich story! The beds are comfortable with great linens and the updated bathroom was stocked with necessities."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A gem in every way. Rorke is gracious, her dogs (the girls) are wonderful and everything about her place is perfect. Very clean, every amenity, comfy beds. I love historic properties and this is rare in that it is still a working Springhouse. Lastly, the value is very high for the price paid. Thanks!!!!"
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The fact that people and dogs can show up on the property at anytime was the only problem I had. Once reading that it made us feel very uncomfortable considering the fact you can see into the house through the windows and my wife is terrified of dogs
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This lovely Spring House offers comfort and peace. It's obvious the owners have put much love into the restoration and renovation. It was very close to sites of interest, while maintaining seclusion on the property. My stay here was a blessing."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This was the most unique and beautiful Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at and I would definitely recommend it!!
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We love coming here for its isolation and amenities. Rorke is very responsive and even recognized us after repeated stays, and will follow up to see how we're doing. 10/10, 11/10 with rice."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was perfect! Clean, cozy and very cool to see! Will definitely be coming back to stay again! Highly recommend anyone to stay here!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"this was a very quaint and comfortable house. There was a detailed instruction book. The only drawback was a slight musty smell covered by a lot of Glade air freshener. Still, it is a great value."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely place! I love finding unique airbnbs and this one was one of the best. Wonderful history with so much original charm, yet all of the modern comforts! The grounds were beautifully maintained as well. I wish we could have stayed longer. My family can’t wait to come back again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"A very cute and quaint place. Location was nice and quiet. Really clean, nicely taken care of. Plenty of blankets and towels. Sitting on the porch is very tranquil. Owner was nice, responsive, and provided for all our needs. There is an old-style sliding door between the bathroom/laundry room and the kitchen/dining area that didn't have a latch or lock but was still secure since the handle for opening it is only on the bathroom/laundry room side. Adds to the character of the place. Would definitely stay there again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you enjoy unique experiences, appreciate history, architecture or both, this is an Air Bnb not to miss!!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely comfortable place, we had a quick stopover and hope to be back when we are in the area next"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a most unique and interesting place to stay. The Springhouse was clean and immaculate and even the kitchen and bathroom were stocked with the basic necessities! The springs in the basement were the most interesting of all. Definitely check them out when you stay! The beds were very comfortable and we slept quite well! Rorke was very good at communicating with us and let us know she'd be by to spray some wasps outside. We never even heard her, she was so discreet, but the wasps were gone the next morning. :) This place is a true value for the cost also. We will be looking forward to staying here again if we are ever in the area, for sure!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The spring house was a lovely place for us to stay for a night as we were passing through! Close to I-81 but very quiet and private feeling.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"the place is simply wonderful!! amazing:) very well equipped, clean, with wonderful furniture and the story of the house:)) we loved to seat of the porch, watching fireflies:)"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at this historic house!! The setting is idyllic! Everything about our stay was lovely!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was wonderful. Beautiful restoration. Lots of character with all the comforts. Great location. Lots to see in the near area but great to relax and hangout too.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family of 6 loved staying at the Springhouse. Rorke was very helpful in communicating with us and the house was just what we needed. Loved the area as well and hope to stay here again if we are passing through the area again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is an easy place to rest. Recharge your batteries only takes an instant. Tranquillity is calming. Place is clean and well maintained.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great historic house, updated but still has charm of the early 1800's. Easy check in, very clean, minutes from downtown Hagerstown. Very private and quite during our stay."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed staying in the springhouse. We enjoyed reading the guest book, playing the games, coffee, the front yard, the ambiance of the home, and Rorke was an excellent communicator."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The spring under the house was pretty cool. The house was clean and had everything we needed.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is so interesting - even though it's historic, it's still cozy and comfortable. Rorke did not compromise on her vision to create a unique rentable space - she's managed to achieve the perfect balance between history and function."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family truly enjoyed staying at the Springhouse. It is a beautiful and gorgeously restored historic home. I recommend checking out the Facebook page where you can see all of the pictures of the restoration process. It is very interesting to see all of the hard work that was put into revitalizing this historic home. Check-in was easy and the home is spotlessly clean. When we left, we accidentally left our son’s favorite stuffed animals. Rorke immediately contacted us when she discovered them. We had already driven a long way away, so she kindly offered to ship them to us. However, we decided just to turn around and go back and get them because our son was going to be very miserable for the rest of the trip without them. I highly recommend staying at the Springhouse."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Our group loved the place and would definitely come back when we have the chance. The property is beautiful and Rorke is a very kind and communicative host. Definitely recommend!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We appreciated all the little things that were left for our usage. It felt like very homey
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was an awesome place for my family and me to stay.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Rorke’s place is amazing! We very much enjoyed our stay!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Springhouse was a perfect spot for my group of three friends getting together for a college reunion. We used the Springhouse as a home base for a few days of adventuring. It was exactly as described in the listing and had everything we needed for our stay. The home was very comfortable and has so much historic charm. The kitchen was well stocked with everything you might need to make a small meal. We especially appreciated that Rorke got the fire pit and barbecue ready for us. Fork was super easy to communicate with. We had a great stay and would definitely go back.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a lovely piece of history!
Rorke has everything you need for a comfortable stay in this 219 year old house. Keep in mind that floors are uneven, staircases windy and narrow, beds on the smaller side imitating the style of the period. It’s really quite wonderful and a treasure you rarely find these days.
How cool is it that there’s a spring running under the house!
But my favorite part was enjoying the porch having a cup of tea and relishing nature."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"How neat it is to see this 219 year old structure!
We were comfortable staying overnight and everything worked well. Rorke is doing a great job updating and keeping this piece of history!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great stone house of the 1800s period. We loved our stay and could not be happier with our conversations with Rorke and her three full time boarders (dogs). If you are into period homes with the added amenity of being a springhouse you must stay here if in the area.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really wonderful and unique
5stars across the board!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful spot! The Springhouse is spacious and comfortable. Expected tight spots in stairs and ceilings for a historic building - not for folks with mobility issues, but no problems even for a tall/large person to get around and feel comfortable. Lots of character inside and out, with happy cows and great outdoor spaces. Location is perfect - feels like you're private and away from it all, but literally a couple minutes from town/ anything you need. Host communicates well and space feels truly private with the bonus of having host on property for any emergencies. Definitely recommend and will be returning!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. The spring room is the perfect place for coffee in the mornings.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A perfect little Hagerstown hideaway. Close by everything but seems miles from anything at all. This lovingly restored little house is the best deal in the area.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing!!! So much history… if those walls could talk!! HIGHLY recommend
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The spring house was even more beautiful than in the photographs! When we turned the corner in the driveway we were so impressed. The garden, the spring under the house and the restoration of the house itself were all wonderful. My daughter loved playing on the long front porch, and we saw large families of geese and ducks with so many fluffy babies in the adjacent stream. Wish we had more reasons to be in Hagerstown to stay here :) It was a very convenient spot to stay after picking up my husband from his ride on the C&O canal trail, if there are any bikers looking for places to stay (it would be harder to bike here from the trail because of busy roads however). Can't say enough about how comfortable and beautiful it was, hosts were super helpful and everything about the stay was very easy."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful old house very comfortable setting. Great place to decompress
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is fantastic. The experience from start to finish made this a great stay. My mother was with us and she LOVED this historic house. Highly recommend!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is my third our fourth time coming here. It's an awesome house and Rorke is super fast and detailed in her responses. It's isolated and quiet, but a 3-5 minute drive from anything you might need. Definitely saved in my favorites for future visits."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay, so clean despite being a very old home. Neat features including a bit of wall in a frame to show you the history of all the old plaster layers."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful historic place to stay! Exactly as described!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was absolutely amazing so much charm and history attached
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Springhouse is a unique and beautiful space to stay! We loved learning a bit about the history of springhouses and seeing how Rorke has kept many historical aspects while incorporating modern amenities. It was very clean, we had everything we needed, and Rorke was a great communicator. I would recommend this as a spot to stay for folks coming to Hagerstown."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,An awesome place in a great location

2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,😁
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! It is really beautiful inside. The stairs were a concern when we saw them but we got used to them very quickly. The main room is well decorated and the front porch is welcoming. We had a great trip and hope to be back sometime soon!
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely historic property, which is comfortable and cozy."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,a wonderful retreat near downtown Hagerstown yet secluded enough to feel country. The house was amazing and really took you back in time!

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredible property. Friends and I were in town for a dear friend’s funeral, and this house served as the backdrop for a refreshing and peaceful trip away. Everything in the house was immaculate—sheets, quilts, towels, dishes, nooks and crannies. The nighttime was serene and we loved opening the windows to hear the creek and birds."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,An easy to find and well furnished place to stay. We were very comfortable! Thanks!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything you need for a restful stay in a beautifully restored historic building. It was a great stop on our drive up north.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Charming little spring house conveniently located for multiple site seeing opportunities. Less than two hours to DC, Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, and several Civil War sites.
Upon Check in, there is a guide book that provides all the information one needs to know about the facility and after reading it, there were no surprises.
Host is very generous with supply of amenities."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is an amazing place to stay. Will definately stay here again.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a nice house, it was quiet, warm, and overall just peaceful."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, thank you. Would recommend."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is really wonderful. It is tranquil and historic. A perfect place to see Civil War battlefields, Antietam Creek and Gettysburg."

Perfect place to stay for a weekend getaway. I LOVED the historic details and the very clear instructions. Without a doubt the best Airbnb I have stayed in ever."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet, tranquil, and peaceful! Perfect for a quiet weekend in. Will definitely return!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay at The Spring House. It was clean, charming, and in a beautiful setting. We will return!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely place, spacious and comfortable--a great find and a perfect overnight travel stop-off for us."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the single best Airbnb experience we’ve ever had! The house is beautifully and thoughtfully restored, and so cozy that I dozed off on the couch immediately. We fell asleep to the sound of the rain on the roof, and got so close to the two sweetest cows just outside in the neighboring pasture. What a joy to be in a real spring house, and it felt like a real patch of spring outside. So nice to be able to walk around the premises and feel like I was in the country, yet so close to the amenities of the city, too. We are so excited to return and tell everyone we know about this little heavenly spot."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fun and funky (in a great way) stay, immaculately clean and well supplied. Only caveat (besides the stairs which are well noted in the listing) is that the upstairs sleeping spaces, while visually separated (and very comfy-we all slept great) are really more of one room with partitioned nooks. You won't have the privacy you're looking for if you are, say, traveling w kids but hoping for some couple time. We would absolutely stay again but in most circumstances I would want to know this, so heads up. If you're set to just hang out casually, this place is perfect and you can tell the owners have a fabulous time decorating it and a fun sense of history."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cool and cozy. We hope to stay there again soon!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay. Cozy little house. Owner is very nice. Even had Christmas decorations up
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a great stay! Definitely warm and cozy despite its age. The location is more neighborhood-y than I expected, but that just means it’s closer to downtown Hagerstown things. Would recommend or stay here again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Springhouse is a fantastic place to stay. Not only an interesting piece of history but it was clean and comfortable with a lot of added touches.

The whole family loved the charm and history of the house, my kids traveled down to the spring room each morning to start their day. Rorke was a wonderful host with lots of toiletries to accommodate our stay. We were even blessed with a visit from the neighborhood fox on our last night. The kids are already asking when we can come back. Thanks Rorke!!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house that is convenient to many things to do and places to eat.

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kim & Walt have a roomy & convenient set up. Many nice touches for the traveller like extra outlets/chargers, luggage area in the closet and toiletry items.
Hagerstown in general is not the most scenic of areas, but the townhouse was conveniently located & in a quiet neighborhood, exactly as described. The road noise others mentioned in reviews didn’t bother us at all & the value for the money was excellent in my opinion.
The hosts were communicative and kind. Would book again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This was the second home I’ve stayed at hosted from Kim and it was a great experience.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Kim’s place for 4 nights during a BMX championship weekend and had a wonderful time. Kim is a great host, great communicator, I asked a lot of questions and she would get back to me very quickly. The place is well looked after- very clean, well furnished, and has a lot of character. The main bedroom- I slept so well! Bed is amazing. Room is decorated lovely, ample wardrobe space for clothes, nice shower. The second bedroom was perfect for my 8 and 6 year old to share and the third lounge room upstairs was where we set up the pack and play for the youngest. Also used this room for the kids to watch tv which gave us some breathing space. Everyone slept great. Kitchen well stocked, cooked some nice meals, loved using the chef knives. We didn’t have much time to explore the area as we were bike racing every day but we did go for a couple of walks and the neighborhood is safe and quiet. Found a little playground for the kids. Would love to come back again."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely gorgeous home. Everything that was listed was accurate. Great hosts! They were very nice and responded immediately to any questions or concerns. House was very clean and organized. The absolute only negative thing was that it was right off of dual highway and could hear cars and motorcycles racing up and down the road at night....however that would not stop me from staying there again. Would definitely highly recommend to friends and family

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem for one or two people!
Spotlessly clean, bright open concept space with good quality furniture. The kitchen is well equipped with high quality cookware and beautiful crockery and flatware. There are no condiments of any kind unfortunately.
The bathroom is spacious with a full size stacked washer and dryer and the hot water was plentiful.
As I pulled up, I was worried about noise because the address is on a major road. The house is set far back off the road though and a row of hedges insured it was absolutely quiet and peaceful.
The unit is well worth your consideration if you're in the area and the host was friendly and pro-active.
A wonderful space"
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very cute and clean. The AC was control only by Alida. Which was an inconvenience the room was quite warm. The kitchen could use a few more utensils.

I loved the play yard and wished that we had our grandchildren with us as they would’ve loved it. Nice touch. We only stayed one quick night so we didn’t really get to enjoy all that was offered. Ralph was extremely helpful when we pulled up with a very empty tank (low fuel light had come on once we got off the highway) and offered to put in the gas he had in his garage. Phew! We might’ve been able to make it to the closest gas station but was relieved that we didn’t have to take that chance."

The full size refrigerator was great to have too. I appreciated everything and would highly recommend.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first airBNB…. It couldn’t have better. We arrived to fresh bake muffins and easy instructions.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"STELLAR! I travel to Hagerstown a couple of times per year for work and decided to check out an AIRBNB instead of the hotel where I usually stay. It was the best idea after landing on Dominic's page. The ""cottage"", as I call it, was pristine and all the snacks, breakfast items, and drinks were a surprise addition. Especially the homemade cranberry orange muffins and a lovely bottle of wine! It was such a treat to have a nice, clean, and quiet stay while working. My only disappointment....if it's not available the next time I'm in town! THANK YOU!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dominic’s place was very comfortable and cozy. There were lots of snacks, some milk, and fresh baked muffins, even a little vino waiting for us. The bed was comfy with nice soft linens. We had a rainy day or we would have enjoyed the lovely patio and garden space. You could tell that our hosts had thought out all the little details. We did however take the local recommendations. We visited the historic store right around the corner and walked the neighborhood to look at all the lovely historic homes. There was even a free music festival downtown. Dominic was very communicative with clear instructions. He even provided a spot to stow our gear. We had a great stay and would love to return."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All I can say about staying at Dominic's place is wow, wow, and WOW. The free snacks and food. The free bottle of wine. The cleanliness of his place. The great price! I have stayed at dozens and dozens of airbnbs in the last several years and I have NEVER been treated this good by a host! I can't wait to come back and anyone thinking about booking Dominic's place should , because I have a feeling it's going to be very hard to reserve his place in the future based on how great his service is!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely weekend stay here. Dominic's place was very clean, cute, & cozy with lots of little extras included.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we drove up and saw the beautiful yard and patio, we felt at home! The suite was immaculate and nicely decorated.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the third time I've stayed at Dominic & Dale's lovely AirBNB, it is the only place I go when I'm in Hagerstown! It is super comfortable, lovely and generous provisions, I can't rave enough about the jacuzzi tub! And this time of year the flowers in the charming, well-kept yard are just gorgeous! I sat outside reading in the early evening with a glass of wine in the rocking chair and had a hummingbird whiz right by my head, it was perfect."

You could not ask for more hospitable and kind hosts! They truly go above and beyond. I felt right at home the first time I stayed here and was so comfortable in their apartment. They have thought of everything! They take the stress out of traveling to a new location (AND there are so many yummy snacks). Plus, they are just super kind, interesting, fun people! 100% recommended! Thanks for everything, Dom and Dale!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Not enough space to write all the good things about this place. Super-responsive hosts, so friendly, nothing left to wish for in the accommodation, from the jacuzzi, the snacks and meal options, the oh-so-comfy bed, the home-baked treats, even a special makeup face cloth so I didn't have to stress about staining a towel. Oh yeah, the towels were huge and fluffy. Dominic and Dale were so friendly, we had coffee with them, and wine another time. We've had some lovely accommodations around the world, this one is the best ever!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding. These hosts are on it and obviously passionate about what they do. Excellence is in the details. Coffee with to-go cups and lids. All the fresh, clean towels you could possibly use. Candelabra by the jacuzzi tub (wonderful). The most comfortable mattress I’ve ever been on. Absolutely gorgeous garden and our parking space was roomy and in front of our private entrance. When I complained of a headache I was offered ibuprofen…they care ♥️ My husband’s 1st time with Airbnb and he loved it."

Our visit coincided with the 100th anniversary of the local grocery store, so that was a fun surprise!The fridge and freezer were stocked with such yummy goodies, and don't get me started on Dale's delicious muffins! This was a high quality AirBnB experience, and we felt so spoiled! If we are ever travelling in the area again, we would definitely stay here again."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time with this Airbnb. The place was amazing, clean, beautifully decorated and very comfortable.
Dominic and Dale added so many extra and special touches. It was obvious their goal was to make their guests right at home. There were fresh baked blueberry muffins when I arrived. There was water, OJ and milk in the refrigerator as well as a bottle of wine. Also food in the freezer if needed...And ice cream! There was a basket full of goodies and also fresh fruit. There was a welcome note and a list of places to go, eat, etc. which was very helpful.
I have stayed at multiple Airbnb's but never have I had an experience this great!
You really set the bar high!! Now I am spoiled :-)

Thank you Dominic and Dale!!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Exceptional. This Airbnb and it's hosts provided exactly what I was looking for, going above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable. There was food such as yogurt, orange juice, milk, etc. in the fridge, and microwavable meals such as pizzas, pot pies, and ice cream in the freezer. The cherry on top was a container of freshly baked homemade muffins, which were restocked halfway through my stay. This not only showcased Dale's top notch baking expertise, but also showed that the hosts view accommodation as essential and enjoyable to deliver, which is EXACTLY what you want from an Airbnb host. I would rate my stay as a 10/10, and I would replicate it to all future trips if I could."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dominic and Dale made our stay extra special with fresh muffins, welcome gift and note, stocked frige and catered to my plant-base request. Cozy and well decorated and the hot tub is devine. I loved the plants and orchid. Impeccably clean and delightful extra touches. The mini kitchen has everything you need for a lazy morning hang out and brochures of things to do in the area. Dominic responded quickly to one small repair of the shower head holder after asking us for a good time to do the fix. The neighborhood is quiet, quaint, and walkable with interesting architecture. I wish the downtown was doing better - it is struggling and not friendly to walk. Still we had a great lunch at the German restaurant and hope the community can raise up the downtown. This is close to Fredericksburg and that downtown is very interesting with lots to do. This was just the quiet relaxing private spot my husband and I needed to recharge and celebrate his 62nd birthday. thank you Dominic and Dale."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Dominic and Dale's place was amazing!Not only that, they were more considerate moments of constant communication and prepared a delicious breakfast for me (Dale's muffin!!!) The interior of the house is very cozy and comfortable, I hope I can decorate my place like this.The only regret I could not have stayed there longer because of the trip and hope to stay there again next time!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little Airbnb was absolutely wonderful. It was extremely clean and welcoming. I was in town for business and I couldn’t have wished for a better place. I stayed for five days four nights. The bed was so comfortable. There was fresh baked muffins when I arrived, and the refrigerator was stocked with anything I would need for breakfast and coffee. It was really nice to park right outside my door since I was coming home late at night. I will most definitely stay here again if I need to come back to Hagerstown for business."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,loved our third or fourth stay... lost count how many times we stayed here. Every time we visit we find something else interesting and fun! Love the thoughtfulness they put into everything. Superb as normal!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We love to stay at Dominic’s BNB because it’s like home away from home. It has a separate entrance so you don’t disturb anyone with your leaving and returning.

We were able to make it for two of our three nights and we were very happy we did. We met Dominic and Dale when we arrived and they couldn't have been nicer. When we entered the suite we found fresh muffins and a bottle of wine- delicious and welcoming. All was clean and uncluttered. The décor was interesting and fun. The bedding was top notch and really pretty, the bathroom was roomy with beautiful separate shower and jacuzzi tub, and the furniture was comfortable and sturdy. Their place is a ""GEM"", and they are very talented ""jewelers""!!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dominic and Dale definitely go out of their way to make their place a home away from home. This is our 2nd time staying with them, and we will be back next year. Thank you for providing us an extremely clean place to to rest our heads while we are drag racing."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we stayed here in 2 years and it is very nice. Plenty of foods, beverages, and treats. Bathroom is laid out very nicely. Very close to the PA Dutch market where you can get really good food to eat there or bring back to the room. Good location too. The hosts are very friendly, as was their co-host we met while there."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dominic's suite was a lovely place for our Ann. getaway!
We enjoyed sitting on the patio with the flower garden around us. The suite was very clean and so inviting to walk into. Dominic and Dale were very generous with the breakfast foods, snacks and other freezer foods they had for us to enjoy. The cranberry-orange muffins and granola were a favorite!
Their suite is highly recommended!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love this place, and will definitely return. The photos are accurate, but the experience of the place is even more comfortable and more lovely. I especially appreciated the privacy, and the friendly, walkable neighborhood."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A++! What an excellent spot - close to everything yet still secluded. The apartment was SPOTLESS, clean but not sterile! I loved all of the extra touches - great for weary travelers. I loved sitting outside with a glass of wine! Thanks for excellent communication and an awesome stay!!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are fortunate enough to stay at Dominic & Dale’s guest quarters, you will have no regrets! The place is cozy, warm, and super inviting. The extra special touches that they provide make you feel at home while also feeling like you are in a little spa oasis! The home is centrally located and easy to get to anything you would need in the Hagerstown area. Dale’s flowers outside are amazingly beautiful and the little patio area is very comfortable. All of the linens and decor are of exquisite quality. I particularly enjoyed the jacuzzi tub! The countertop snacks as well as the water, juice, and milk in the refrigerator were nice treats…and the frozen microwaveable foods were a pleasant surprise which saved us money from having to eat out all of the time. We will definitely be back and make this our favorite place to stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down the best provisions we have ever seen at an AirBNB! Really nice touches, and the jacuzzi tub was simply DIVINE! Lovely little garden, easy parking and cute little market a minute away - Gordon's. Dominic & Dale were gracious hosts, we will be back!"

Definitely recommend a stay in their private suite."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was such a safe and nice place.
It was a place I stayed for a child's school, but it would be the best hotel than any other hotel in this area.
There were simple things to eat in the refrigerator, and the beautifully tended backyard was also very good. Everything was perfect.
Also, the owner lived above, so it was easy and safe to stay. If I come back to Hagus Town, I'll choose this place over a hotel."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This guest suite is exactly as described: beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. Dominic included thoughtful extras that made us feel very welcome, and you can't beat the location!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was as perfect as an AirBnB could possibly be!! Very nicely done inside! Looked like something on HGTV. And all the extra amenities (snacks galore, milk, juice, ice cream, wine, granola, and some frozen microwave foods, and more) will surprise you for sure! The neighborhood is beautiful, hosts and neighbors friendly. I honestly don’t know how you could improve anything."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful stay we had! Beautiful location with special touches that really made us feel right at home! Everything we could have ever needed for our weekend in Hagerstown. This was our first long distance trip with our baby, and this place was very toddler friendly. Such warm, friendly as welcoming hosts as well, who made share they had vegan treats for us due to our dietary needs. You will never regret staying here!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This charming suite was everything we could have wanted, and more. Conveniently located in a charming and quiet neighborhood, it exuded class and friendliness. The suite itself was lovely, with an upscale and eclectic decorating sense. A cozy queen-sized bed, comfortable seating, a lovely and private patio, and ""extras"" galore (snacks, frozen treats, OJ and milk, water, coffee, luxurious towels, etc.) And it was definitely a value for the area. We will certainly visit Dominick and Dale again should we find ourselves in Hagerstown, or passing thru. Don't miss this hidden gem."

We have never been at such a hospitable AirBnB before! The jacuzzi was lovely as well, and everything was spotless. We hope to return sometime!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This lovely suite gave us a home away from home. The pantry was really well stocked. I’m just sorry we were always on the run and didn’t have time to really get to know our host. He seemed like someone we’d enjoy knowing. We will definitely be back!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Airbnb! Friendly hosts who provided so many special touches. Great neighborhood to explore on foot.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really love Dominic’s place. Oak Hill is an amazing historic neighborhood, really recommend walking around both sides of Oak Hill Ave.
You’re also just down the alley from a family grocery store that opened with the neighborhood 100 years ago and within walking distance of downtown.
Dominic and his wife have everything you need in the apt and if you need something else, just send them a note. I loved my stay and would gladly stay again."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best Air BB experience! Spotless!! Enjoy a well stocked fridge and comfy place to stay while you visit Hagerstown! Ski area close by. Art Museum and Gallery nearby with great restaurants. Kick back and relax… enjoy the jacuzzi tub! We just really enjoyed this great spot. Hosts are so helpful with tips re places to visit and eat nearby. We shall return!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our romantic getaway in this quaint and cozy. Hosts made it a true bnb tailored experience that is rare to find. The place was in the loveliest of neighborhoods and Dale and Dominic did a phenomenal job renovating the basement. Recommend this place 100%
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place has everything that you need for a comfortable stay. Lots of snacks and extras. Hosts are very responsive and thoughtful. Nice and quiet place to stay.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is beautiful! Very very clean and I can't say that about many places.

Check-in easy and parking right at your door."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay here. The hosts went above and beyond to make our short stay as comfortable and cozy as possible. The fridge and snacks were generously full, and they left a number of small touches that made the stay very hospitable. For example, they left us some Valentine’s Day treats and some freshly baked muffins. Overall, a great Airbnb! Hope to stay again the next time we go ski here."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very comfortable, clean and quiet! thank you!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Romantic private suite ❤️
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful stay! So clean, so comfortable, so relaxing. Best hosts I have ever come across! I have no complaints whatsoever."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! The hosts are so thoughtful and sweet! Would definitely stay here again
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very nice looking place and tons of free snacks which was great and free wine!!!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a delightful stay it was. Thank you for being very thoughtful in every little details inside the house. We enjoyed a perfect gateway. Hope we can be back anytime soon!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Air BNB hosting, done right! What a wonderful place to stay. Dominic was very accommodating and helpful!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, very generous and attentive host."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was comfortable and clean, and the hosts were wonderful and responsive. I appreciated the larger features (e.g., being able to control the temperature, parking) and smaller touches (e.g., available snacks and local recommendations) they offered."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed in a lot of AirBnBs, and this one is hands-down the best. If you have any reason to be in Hagerstown (and there are many), I recommend it highly. The bed and bath appointments go beyond comfortable, all the way to luxurious. The kitchen is convenient and spotless. Having a private little deck to relax on is a big plus. But the best part is having Dominic and Dale right there. The welcoming touches in place when you arrive are only surpassed by the good care they take of you during your stay. So many AirBnBs these days are owned by corporate entities, and you're dealing with ""hosts"" who may not even exist. This place is the real deal: a real home, real hosts, real hospitality."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One word: WOW! Dominic and Dale went above and beyond to make our stay extraordinary, including specials touches like freshly baked banana bread, a bottle of wine, and a stocked kitchen! In our personalized welcome letter, they recommended a delicious restaurant that we visited for lunch and a lovely neighborhood loop walk that was so nice we did it twice: once in the morning, and once after dark to see the beautiful Christmas lights. The location was perfect, only a few minutes from downtown and the venue for the wedding we were attending. If you need to stay in Hagerstown definitely don’t hesitate to book here!!!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the third time we have stayed here and it is our favorite of all the Airbnbs we've stayed at anywhere in the world ! Dom and Dale are the best and the place is amazing. Can't wait to go back!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great hosts.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to stay. The hosts go above and beyond. If you need anything, they're there to assist. Located in a quiet, historic neighborhood and close to historic Hagerstown, freeways, mall, historical landmarks, and restaurants. I always stay here when I come out to visit family."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fantastic stay! Great, welcoming hosts in a beautiful neighborhood. I would definitely return."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough about this place...especially the value you get for the money. only possible negative for someone might be that it is missing an oven/stove, but they have a powerful toaster oven and a microwave, so it wasn't a problem for me. it is my favorite place so far! and the hosts are so kind, sweet and accommodating. she checks in with me to see how my week is going and to ask if I need anything. and I can tell she genuinely means it. when I encounter people like them, it helps restore my faith in humanity a little. they are making the world a better place just by being air b&b hosts, which I think is awesome."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I don't need any other words. Everything is excellent!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were warm and welcoming. The space was lovely and comfortable and they had treats for us including delicious homemade muffins! The location in a beautiful area and we had a very relaxing stay. The Jacuzzi was magnificent !!! Could not have had kinder and more hospitable hosts!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"They live above the unit, but I did not hear anything, not even footsteps. I asked if my music would bother them, she said she couldn't hear it, so I was able to have it on loud while enjoying their awesome bathroom! Bed is comfortable, place gets a lot of sunshine, and kitchen was spacious. I've been in a lot of finished basements, but this is first time I was unable to tell. They did a wonderful job on it! Best part of the trip was when i arrived exhausted and hungry, but too tired to stop somewhere, there was food in the freezer...and ice cream! My stress level immediately dropped just from that small act of kindness. Thank you and I will pay it forward!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dominic & Dale go above and beyond as hosts. Their stay is amazingly clean and packed with a warm welcome of amenities and ideas for things to do around town. I’d highly suggest to anyone looking to explore Hagerstown or Frederick to stay with Dominic & Dale!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great. Dominic and Dale are warm and welcoming hosts. Their rental is charming, clean, and comfortable. They are so generous with all of the special touches. We had all manner of treats to eat, as well as homemade muffins and breakfast items. We were also greeted with a bottle of Prosecco which paired nicely with the jacuzzi and orchids. They did a great job of staging a spa-like ambience in the bathroom. Walking around the neighborhood was fun, too, with such a varied mix of architectural styles. The grand mansions on the Terrace were delightful. We really enjoyed our quiet, restful stay."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is very well cared for and they have thought of all the little extras for a perfect stay. Nice neighborhood close to many amenities. As for the guest suite it was great! Clean and has anything you could need for your stay.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dominic and Dale's space was lovely, warm and inviting. comfortable, clean, and just what I needed. I will definitely stay there again if in the area or just for another self care weekend. Everything was decorated lovingly and the rooms were super clean. The bed was comfortable and I slept better there than I have in months. The suite was quiet. Communication was great. One of the best Airbnb's I have ever stayed in."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dominic’s place is in such a quaint, cute part of Hagerstown! Surrounded by historic, beautiful houses with charming people. The suite was very cozy and intimate - perfect for a weekend getaway. Dominick & Gale welcomed us with fresh flowers and homemade muffins. They truly care about your stay and have great suggestions for local spots to visit! Highly recommend!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great second stay here. Highly recommend this spot as it feels a lot like home. All the special touches and hospitality from Dominic and Dale make this spot perfect. Hope to be back soon!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay here, and it was delightful as always! It was great to arrive to beer and fresh muffins, and I actually took advantage of the toaster oven this time! Their place is only about 25 minutes from Catoctin Mountain, so my day of hiking was capped with a trip to Upper Stem Brewery (10-15 minutes away— also highly recommended!), a soak in the jacuzzi tub, and some football on cable tv— perfection! I can’t wait to find another reason to visit Hagerstown."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect air bnb experience. All the extras and the suite itself are just what a hotel weary traveler needed. Beautiful space in a lovely neighborhood. Super hosts indeed!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cutest little place. Perfect for a couple! Very clean and the owners go above and beyond. From the home made breakfast muffins, to making sure the Dunkin lover had DD coffee to brew in the morning, the beautiful flower arrangement on the table. We kept referring to it as, “ our little hidden gem!”
Would book again without thinking twice."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We stayed for a week in Dominic and Dale s apartment and loved it. They have made every effort to create a comfortable place to visit. They generously provided milk, orange juice, and some breakfast sandwiches that were delicious and came in handy. The layout of the apartment is really great and feels like home and we look forward to staying with them again"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A spectacular location. Can not describe the couple and the amenities of a true gem!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You won’t be disappointed with this lovely location. Wonderful hosts who specialize in making you feel special.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Dominic and Dale's lovely home. The jacuzzi, the beautiful patio, the snacks, the super-comfy bed -- it truly exceeded my expectations. I wouldn't change a thing!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I attended the Peaceable Paws Intern Academy with Pat Miller and this was the perfect space to stay for the week.

They graciously stocked the fridge, freezer, and pantry with snacks too! Staying here was a treat."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dominic and Dale have created a really welcoming and wonderful space. We throughly enjoyed our stay, and appreciated all the attention to detail, such as a well stocked snack bar and fresh banana bread upon arrival. It felt clean and well taken care of. The jacuzzi tub was a wonderful plus and so nice to use after a long day of travel. Highly recommend staying here!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off lemme just say the first day we were greeted by these two lovely souls. They made us feel very welcomed & comfortable. We checked in to our bNb it was clean, smelled clean! They even baked us some muffins that my fiancé & I loved so much we almost ask for more lol. It was quiet. We only stayed for 2 days but wanted to stay longer. They made sure we were good & the communication were amazing. Great stay from start to end!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our trip to this adorable suite was fantastic from beginning to end! The hosts were great with communication and seemed genuinely excited to greet us when we arrived. The suite is absolutely perfect for a two person getaway. Dominic and Dale did a tremendous job thinking of all the details. We were welcomed with fresh flowers and a bottle of wine. The snacks and drinks were so thoughtful. Dale even checked to see if we had dietary restrictions before we arrived. Dominic suggested Catoctin State Park for hiking and we were not disappointed. We will definitely stay here again should we go to Hagerstown area again.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dominic's place is located in a beautiful historic home in an equally historic neighborhood. It is exactly as pictured and a quiet refuge after a busy day. The fridge is stocked with breakfast items and frozen foods for that ""just in case"" meal or snack. Great shower and comfortable bed. A real treat in Hagerstown!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend staying here. Our stay was amazing, and our hosts went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and comfortable."

When we arrived there were fresh flowers, fruit, an assortment of snacks and even some items in the refrigerator/freezer. This was very special to us. We are looking forward to staying there again when we return to the area."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place and fantastic hosts.. Enjoyed every moment of being there. Hope to get another chance to stay again soon.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very pleasant Airbnb experience! Dominic and Dale are very hospitable and have taken care in the setup of their space. They want you to be comfortable and are always available to answer questions or make recommendations. Thanks!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Hosts were incredibly thoughtful and accomodating. They went the extra mile to make our visit personalized and special.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful trip and I can truly say staying here made it all worth it! Between the snacks, the quiet coziness, and the wonderful suggestions for food and places to see, we were set. Dominic and Dale are wonderful hosts who truly care about you and are available whenever you need them. The setting is a lovely, restful place I highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful B&B. So warm and comfortable. Like staying in a family members guest suite. Tons of thoughtful touches throughout. Great communication. Check in is a breeze. Wonderful location in a beautiful & safe neighborhood. Hosts are very welcoming and provide a lot of extra amenities not found in most Airbnb’s.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I booked this place last-minute for an event I needed to attend in the area. I didn’t know what to expect, but was thrilled to find a sparkling clean, beautifully decorated studio apartment in a quiet, historic neighborhood in Hagerstown. The access to the mature, colorful garden was very welcome at the end of the day. The hosts—Dominic & Dale—were very kind and accommodating, having stocked the kitchenette with snacks and quick meals. They also provided a self-inflating twin mattress for my young son, which made our stay that much more relaxing. Plus, what a luxurious bath! If it hadn’t been 95 degrees out I’d definitely have made use of the hot tub. In sum, this place is a gem, and Dale & Dominic are fabulous hosts. Thank you so much :-)"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Absolutely fantastic stay -
Hosts could not have been more welcoming!!! Highly recommend!!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great. The walk to downtown isn’t bad and the place itself is great. You can tell Dominic cares a lot about his guests’ experience. Will certainly stay here again.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are going to be in the Hagerstown area, don't miss the opportunity to be guests of Dominic and Dale. Their Airbnb is second to none. The photos just don't do it justice.
The neighborhood has tree lined streets and beautiful homes in a quiet, serene setting but close to all of the comforts of the city. Unfortunately, we didn't get the opportunity to meet Dominic and Dale in person since they were travelling during our stay. Nancy was house sitting for them and was a delightful stand in host. Because the hosts were travelling, they made sure we had everything we would need for breakfast during our stay. The fridge was stocked with fruit, yogurt, apple sauce, milk and juice. The freezer had some ready made options and there were delicious blueberry muffins. There were also snacks, coffee and granola.
The check in process was seamless and we were greeted by fresh flowers along with a personal note. Do yourself a favor and relax in the beautiful jetted tub by candlelight. Then shower off in the spacious shower. After, the beautiful bed linens will call your name. The bed is super comfy and you will wake rested and refreshed.
If I could give this Airbnb 10 stars, I would in a heartbeat. I've been a guest of many units and Dominic and Dale's is the absolute best. Pamper yourself and become one the guests they treat like family."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts’ warmth and personality made this Airbnb one of our favorites of all time. Highly recommend.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"How do I love thee … let me count the ways.
Could it be the freezer stocked with breakfasts, snacks, pizza and one of my favorite libations?
Or the refrigerator with beverages, yogurt, and the specially-requested hard-boiled eggs?
Perhaps it’s the beauty of the garden and outside patio bursting with spring flowers and comfortable rocking chairs.
Or maybe it’s the snack basket with cookies, granola bars and more, as well as a candy jar, refilled with Hershey nuggets when I ate them all.
Possibly it’s the bathroom, with a jacuzzi tub and separate shower with not one but two shower heads and plenty of fluffy towels to wrap up in. Maybe it’s the bedsheets, soft to the touch and so easy to sink into, or the thoughtful lighting throughout the unit.
Ultimately, it’s the downright menschlichit – goodness — that Dale and Dominick demonstrated that made my 10 day stay in Hagerstown a pleasure and a blessing. Thank you for everything ... and a memory that will last in heaven!"

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dominic and Dale’s place is full of thoughtful touches that make them the best Air bnb hosts! We enjoyed meeting them and spending time with them and their neighbors as a bonus! We would love to come back again in the near future and couldn’t recommend them more as hosts! 😊
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying at Dominic's could only be described as perfection!! The most kind and accommodating hosts possible. Many extras .. treats and flowers make you feel so at home. I will continue to stay with them on my frequent trips to Hagerstown.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely wonderful! Dominic and Dale are kind and gracious hosts and their place is beautiful. They went out of their way to accommodate us and provide special touches to make our stay that much more special. We just cannot speak highly enough about our stay with Dominic and Dale. We hope to see them again next year!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean, and very comfortable. The kitchen had most everything you needed to prepare meals. The only suggestion I would make is to have the place better stocked with some essentials like paper towels, toilet paper, bath soap and shampoo. Have been to other AirBnBs where these essentials were always provided. Other than that, we had a great stay."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! About 30 min from the ski area!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Bradley’s place was very comfortable. I felt right at home. He was very responsive and even helped me when my car was stuck in the snow. It was so peaceful and comfortable. The home had ample amount of space and everything that you would need away from home. Thanks for a wonderful stay.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great time at Bradley’s place! Enjoyed a peaceful long weekend and enjoyed cooking in the kitchen and watching tv in the couch!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved staying here! It was spotless, which is the most important thing for me. Our Children loved the extra touches this host had. We definitely plan on staying here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a very nice stay. Host is very kind and helpful. Appreciate all she did to make us feel at home.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As always staying here was a pleasure. It has truly become our home away from home when in town for business. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy place to stay while they're in town.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"EVERYTHING was AWESOME!!! Great place, exactly as advertised, and in beautiful condition, . Nikita’s place was quiet, clean, neat, and well-appointed. The walkway has automatic lights highlighting your path to and from her place. The neighborhood was very safe with all the area houses in top notch condition. This is probably one of the BEST Airbnb's I have ever stayed at (and I have stayed in many Airbnb's over the years)."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great home!! Very spacious and cozy! Definitely worth it, if you’re in the area. 10/20 recommend."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the pleasure of staying at Nikita's cozy and comfortable rental, and I must say it was a wonderful experience. Nikita was an amazing host who was always available and responsive to our needs, and her communication was top-notch. The rental was just as cozy and comfortable as the pictures showed, with super-comfortable beds that provided a peaceful night's sleep. The entire place was immaculately clean, and we felt right at home from the moment we arrived. During our stay, we experienced a snowstorm, but Nikita went above and beyond to ensure our safety by shoveling the walkway and driveway and salting the area. We would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. We stayed here for two weeks for work, and we were thrilled that we didn't opt for a hotel. Nikita's rental was the perfect home away from home!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing host, beautiful place."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"beautiful house in a very quiet neighborhood, Nikita and her husband are very kind people, we had a very beautiful weekend"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was as described. It was clean. I’d note that it’s a dark (mostly windowless) apartment and it’s in the middle of a very suburban neighborhood.
I can’t say there’s anything wrong with the place/locale but personally wouldn’t stay again. There’s not much going on in/Hagerstown but that doesn’t have anything to do with the host.
I’d say it’s a fair price for a fair place in a fair location."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best places we have stayed! The location is amazing. The place is so clean and inviting. To top it all off, Nikita is an amazing host!"

Beautiful home, lovely gardens and very relaxing pool"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great time is Nikita’s place. My sisters, daughter and kids had nothing planned except to relax. The pool was so nice, we were in there every day! This was a much-needed getaway for us.
The suite was very spacious, clean and had everything you needed. The kitchen was well equipped, and it was very easy to put together meals, then spend evenings on the patio eating, laughing, and planning our next visit! There is even a stocked table for the kids for coloring and drawing. Our 5 yr. old felt special with her own space to create.
Nikita checked in to see if we needed anything or had questions, but everything was just perfect. The weather even cooperated, and the rain didn’t materialize as expected. As soon as we can figure out everyone’s schedule, we plan on booking again!!!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a beautiful place to stay. Very spacious and comfortable. We will definitely be coming back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This guest suite, situated in a very peaceful and safe community and separated from the host family's space, was equipped with everything we needed. Furthermore, they were very clean and high-quality. Even though we did not use the pool, it was right in front of the suite and maintained very well.
The host, Nikita, was very kind and lives in the same house, so she responds promptly for everything.
Would recommend it strongly."

I would definitely recommend staying here if you’re looking for a great stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is absolutely gorgeous. Much larger than you would think.. The beds are very comfortable and the host is amazing and included many nice touches like a welcome basket including a bottle of wine.
It is in a very lovely, quiet subdivision not far from downtown Hagerstown. We also were about 30 minutes away from Frederick."
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"5 stars across the board! This thoughtful host anticipated almost every need imaginable, and for 5 women staying there for our vacation, that was no small feat! The fact that she had done that leads me to believe she listens to her guests! SUPERB!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,My team loved everything

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was clean and comfortable. Great place for a family get away. Although we didn't get to use the outside area because the pool was closed because of the season. It was very nice and looks like it would of been big fun for the family.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A great, private stay! The pool was lovely, especially with lights & a heater for my daughter at night. Easy & convenient access to a lot of things, but quiet neighborhood."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nikita was a wonderful host! The private space is so beautiful! And the pool was beautiful!
,,,"Kim is a terrible host! She's the worst host we had so far. No instructions whatsoever were placed in the house on anything. The lack of instructions caused me to get locked out for over 2 hours the next morning of my arrival. Not having Kim's phone number I wrote to her an email informing her of my predicament. Being on travel Overseas, her husband Walter was kind enough and did very best to help resolve my over 2 hours waiting outside. I also reported an issue with the AC and heating! Strangely, both were working at the same time as the house has an old split system that cools and heats at the same time in a vicious circle! Again, the lack of instructions has retarded the resolution of this issue. I also reported the lack of blinds in the master bedroom which was very annoying mainly early in the morning. When Kim showed up a week or so later, she was unapologetic about all what happened! In summary, I found her tactless, inconsiderate, cheap and terrible!"
