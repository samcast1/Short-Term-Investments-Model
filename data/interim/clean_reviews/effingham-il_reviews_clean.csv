2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cozy stay, will be back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Last minute decision to stay here on a long roadtrip. They were immediately responsive to the stay and the place was very quaint and clean! Great stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"2nd time staying here, great stays both times"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This has to be one of my favorite places i’ve stayed. It was a last minute booking on our move across country and it was extremely cozy and beautiful. I did not hear any border from the bar next door and slept like a baby. I highly recommend.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay for one night. Very clean. Host was responsive and helpful!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great place! I arrived late and had to leave early, but still was able to get some work done. I rely heavily on wifi and The Shoe Inn had a great lightning quick connection! Exactly what I needed!
From the time you enter the front door, The Shoe Inn was immaculent! Everything you need is right there. So clean. The electric fireplace is a visual. Not sure if I was really tired or it was the comfort of the bed and pillows, but I don't think I moved the entire night. I didn't check in until 10:30pm, so the bar connected to the Inn was alive for a Saturday night. The noise... barely heard it and was no issue at all as I had work to do.
I highly recommend staying here if you have the opportunity whether it be one night or more. I'm definitely going to keep a lookout for it on future trips to the area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place to stay! Great location!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to rest after a day on the road.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I reserved at the last minute and it was quick and easy to pay and have access on short notice. The apt was cute, super clean, and I was able to park right outside the front door which gave comfort as I was transporting expensive items in my vehicle. The local grocery/general store was located right next door so I was able to grab a beer when I arrived and get coffee, a fountain drink, and a ham and cheese sandwich in the morning for the road which cost less than $5! Lovely space! The only issue I had was the keypad to get in. It was a bit fussy for me and took multiple tries to get in."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were actually only here for about 11 hours and most of that was spent sleeping. However, after spending the day and most of the evening driving in rain, heavy fog and construction..walking in was like ""ahhhhhh"". So cozy and immaculate that I was instantly comfortable. We were very happy with our evening there. The bed is SUPER comfortable and the place is darling."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was exactly as listed. Very cozy. Would stay here again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I chose the Shoebox Inn despite it being out of my way, and I’m so glad I did! Honestly it ended up being one of my favorite Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in.
It was easy enough to find, had parking right in front, and felt safe enough even with me being a solo female traveler.
Once inside, it was clear that everything was new and sparkly clean. The washer and dryer was an added bonus. I would note that guests need to supply their own laundry detergent; I was glad I had some on hand!
I was able to hear the bar next door, but really only when using the bathroom. It was peaceful and quiet when it came time for me to go to sleep.
I’d definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We actually thought we had booked across the highway at another Airbnb with a very similar name and same street name but quieter side of highway, so we’re a little thrown off. BUT it was surprisingly a sweet and quiet little spot. Clean. Comfortable. Only regret is we missed the wonderful foretold breakfast as the diner next door is closed Sundays. lol.."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just adorable and very comfortable. There was a little noise from the game room and railroad track but it didn’t last long. 5 stars! Definitely coming back again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is by far one of my favorite Air BNBs! It was so cozy, comfortable, and clean. If I could stay here longer I would. If I’m ever back in the area, I wouldn’t look any place else to stay the night!!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town for a week for work. John and Janice’s place was perfect. Quiet, close to my work in Effingham, and perfect size. This would work for a week stay for work, and get away night for one or two. Highly recommend the Shoe Inn, on a scale from 1-10, it’s definitely a 13.7!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,2 for 2. This was my second stay at this hidden gem. It's a great place to stay! It is 100% as advertised minus the bar noise potential from next door. There were no noises that kept me awake or woke me up...I hope to be back there again next December!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, will definitely stay again. Had a question about getting in at 9pm on check in night and got an answer from Janice and John in less than a minute!

Awesome coffee shop right across the street with good breakfast."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoy coming here! It's so nicely decorated and such an efficient small cozy place. Gas fireplace is a plus! Can walk to bank, local pub, cafe that serves homemade cinnamon roles and coffee shop just across the street. John and Janice are so helpful and respond at lightning speed. A fun and comfy place to be!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Had some trouble finding it and getting inside, but John was quick to help. Once inside, the place was super cute and clean. My only complaint is the noise is very prominent. However, luckily I was there on a Thursday so the bar wasn't as busy. I turned on the TV until I fell asleep and had no issues."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,So glad we decided to stay here inside of getting a hotel! The check-in was really easy and the place was very clean!! Janice was helpful in bringing a travel crib over and setting it up for us before we got there. We heard a little noise from the pub when in the bathroom but not in the studio.

A notebook provided information on the amenities —helpful! We would definitely stay again, Janice and John are great hosts."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything is exactly as described. The AirBnB shares a building with the bar but the noise was not an issue at all. Effingham is a very short drive and the gas store next door was very convenient for any of your needs!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved the accomadations! Very nicely decorated and very clean. We will definitely stay again when we are in town. We especially liked the walkability to nearby restaurants and bars.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect overnight stay for road weary travelers. Comfortable bed, emaculate bath with great shower. Lots of outlets for all of our devices, great places to get a bite to eat, paved sidewalks for early morning walks, what more could you ask for?"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Appreciate the clean and great space to rest on our trip. It is attached to a small pub but the music & conversation wasn't unbearable. Around midnight we didn't hear anything through the walls. I appreciated them letting us know in the description. Everything was neat and clean! The bed was comfy and all the amenities we needed for our night stay. There is a wonderful cafe around the corner with awesome home cooked food!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great overnight stay in Teutopolis. Easy to find, very cute studio type unit. Very well appointed, perfect accommodations for a short or long stay. While there is a train crossing about a 1/4 mile away, noise was not an issue. I heard only two trains go through the area while I was there and I don't believe either blew its horn (besides, I like the sound of trains passing...). The owners are very congenial and helpful and respond to messages immediately. They offered suggestions on nearby restaurants and best ways to venture about the area. Also, great beer specials and friendly people at the gaming bar next door. As Arnold once said, ""I'll be back""."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect! Everything we needed with modern decor and responsive hosts! Clean and comfortable. Will definitely stay here again!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay in this quaint space! It was the perfect size for two for an overnight visit to the area. There was a little bit of sound from the bar next door but not enough to disrupt our sleep. Don’t let the location deter you from staying here. Great space that is well-decorated and perfectly-stocked!
The only downside was the local coffee shops & restaurants are closed on Sunday morning but there are plenty of available places in the neighboring town (Effingham). We had a great breakfast at Niemerg’s which is a very popular local restaurant."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such an adorable and comfy space! Would definitely stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute and clean! Exactly as described! Got a late start on my drive so couldn’t make it to my original destination, and I am so glad! Found the Shoebox Inn it was the perfect stay. Easy to access. I parked right in front, and could take my suitcase in without having to deal with steps.
As in the host description, the space is attached to the pub. I could hear some of the chatter and music through the wall but it wasn’t particularly loud and didn’t keep me awake. And if I’d needed them, there was a white noise machine and ear plugs.
Comfortable bed.
The window faces the street and sidewalk and the blackout curtains allowed for complete privacy.
Look forward to coming back through this way again and having a little more time so I can enjoy the fireplace and go to the pub and game room with nice wooden shoe motif.
Janice and John were very responsive, helpful, and polite!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great little place to stay if you happen to be nearby. Just a few minutes from Effingham and beats the chain hotels. The local bars are fun and within walking distance. Room was small, but had everything I needed. Super clean, well kept, and comfortable. Bring ear plugs as the train comes by throughout the night. I'll be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed Janice and John’s place!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Will definitely stay there again when I’m in town.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute little place to stay. Obsessed with the different colors the fireplace produces! Stayed on a Saturday and couldn’t even hear the bar it’s attached to.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cosy little studio close to I70 was a real treasure. It’s beautifully designed and extremely comfortable.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Comfortable bed and really cute place. Good water pressure. It was pretty quiet, even with the game bar next door (which was a fun place). We didn’t need the white noise machine, but nice it was there as an option."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LOVED the ShoeInn!! We were visiting family in Teutopolis, so the location was perfect!! Super clean, just like the pics. Whoever designed, did a great job. I've stayed in hotels that were not nearly as nice, plus what a steal!!
The hosts-and friends had warned that there might be a noise issue due to a gaming place literally next door (shares walls). However, it was only talking we ever heard, kind of like when your roommate is talking too loud in their room. All we did was shut the bathroom door & the vestibule door-the only places you could actually hear it-and we were fine! We had a speaker to listen to just in case, and the host provides earplugs (didn't use) & a white noise machine (accidentally turned it on then couldn't figure out where the fan was coming from!).
Super clean & cozy-loved the fireplace!! Will definitely stay again!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location. all you need is a toothbrush. The unit contained everything you could possibly need and was perfect for my stay. Janice and John were incredible hosts. It will definitely be my go to location when I'm in the area.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was great! We loved the stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable bed. Cozy little place. Noise from the pub barely noticeable.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very friendly and responsive hosts. They have done an amazing job with the small space next to the bar. Did not find bar noise overwhelming at all. Did not need the white noise machine but nice it is there if someone does.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super clean space, bed was so soft and comfy!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay here in this little one-room spot. Parking right in front of the door. Clear instructions for everything, easy to find and get in and out. Felt safe and relaxed and felt like it was a good value."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I really loved the space! Cute and cozy - bed was so comfy! I always felt safe. I misunderstood the connected to a bar descriptions. The sound machine helped except for the base of the music. I was there for a retreat/conference and was up early so not a lot of sleep. But if I was passing through town or visiting family in the area it would have been perfect. I just needed more sleep :-) If you are there for business or conference just be aware of the noise factor.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adorable spot, clean, and great hosts!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"cool, great lil.spot"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,such a cute place walking distance to a great pub.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little studio apartment that was perfect for what I needed it for as a place to stay while at a training in nearby Effingham. It is attached to the bar next door, but wasn’t a huge deal and hosts provide white noise machine and ear plugs. Really only noisy where I was like “what’s going on” when someone was winning the jackpot on the slot machine apparently haha. Bed was super comfy so I just slid the door shut and was out like a light. The fireplace is the main heat source and adds some nice glow to the room at night too."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy stay ! I’d recommend highly as a great value .
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,awesome place 😎 just like the listing
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an amazing deal. Perfect stay, loved everything about it! Don’t hesitate to book!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great little place. John and Janice were quick to respond with any questions we had during our stay. Would definitely go back again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place very clean and cozy
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had been planning to stay for about 6 months. My wife and I were able I listen to some local music and spend the night here even though we only live a few miles away. It allowed us to have a good time and stay safe. Janice and John’s place was perfect!! We had a great evening and a great stay at this cozy Airbnb. I highly recommend a stay here.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janice and John’s place was very nice and relaxing. I really enjoyed my stay!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place. Everything you need, exactly as described, great price.
Hosts are very friendly and responsive.
Will stay again!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, tasteful accommodations, but for sure gets a little noisy in the evening time. Other than that, the place was awesome!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful little cozy spot to stay! and really good value. Very cute decorating, nice roaring gas fireplace, easy walk to nearby coffee shop and restaurant, everything you needed at hand. Surprisingly quiet for being next door to the bar. Enjoyed my stay so much, hope to return! Thanks Janice and John : )"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An excellent little cozy spot in an awesome town. We will definitely use again and tell others as well!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Will definitely be staying here again! Cute little spot and very clean!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little stay for what we needed while passing through! Comfy beds and cozy atmosphere - would definitely stay again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This will definitely be my ""go to place"" each time we come to visit our children!! It was perfect for me and my husband to relax."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was just what we needed and was great location.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Although this place was attached to the bar and across the street from the grain silos we found it to be super quiet at night and we slept great even without the white noise machine. Great place to stay if you’re passing through. Much cleaner and cheaper than a hotel.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was wonderful! A very cute place to stay! I would stay here again if I find myself in the area.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was fantastic. Great hosts that made it super easy to check in and out. Very clean. Great communication. Would recommend to anyone to stay here.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you...way better than a hotel!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I accidentally picked the perfect location in relationship to why I was in T-town. I was able to walk to my destination. The Shoe Inn was clean, comfortable, and decorated for the holidays. If I could rate it higher than 5 stars, I would! I'll be back next year! Maybe stay 2 nights so I can check out to attached Bar. Appreciate the honesty about the noise potential from the bar, it was only barely noticeable and did not prevent me from getting a great night's sleep in that big bed. Thank-you Janice and John!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We’ve stayed at quite a few properties, and this was hands down the best one. Clearly Janice & John know what they’re doing and you can tell a lot of time, energy, sweat and creative thinking went into this hidden gem.
Every single detail is accounted for and the well laid out instructions are second to none.
The space is modern, well designed, well built, comfy, safe and so clean you could eat off the floor. The holiday decor was the cherry on top.
Being connected to an elegant bar & a Saturday night, we wondered how it would play out. Never heard a thing other than some very faint music while in the shower, and who doesn’t like tunes in the shower ? We’re convinced the walls have been soundproofed.
We will stay nowhere else when passing through in the future if it’s available. Cool little town and an amazing place. We’d give it 10 stars if it were possible."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy and good area
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The perfect overnight stay! Janice and John have thought of every detail for this room. The room darkening shades were nice. The fireplace and the Christmas decorations made the room feel so cozy. We loved that it was right next door to the bar. We went next door and talked to the locals. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. If we would have been in town longer, I would have liked to check out the other establishments in town, but it was a short trip. Oh, we did stop at the winery before checking in. There is also a very nice winery about 5 minutes from there. Long story short, this place was perfect and we plan to stay there again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was perfect. Loved the holiday decorations.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!! Thank you for having us: decor was really cute and had a huge bed with a nice little light up fireplace.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a beautiful little studio, which was well decorated, clean, and had everything you could need for a one night stay. While the bar was a bit nosy, the ear plugs and noise machine helped a ton! I highly recommend."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a lovely place to stay!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place. Some reviews mentioned the noise from the trains. Did not bother us at all. The accommodations were excellent. Clean, convenient and reasonably priced. We will stay again when passing through Teutopolis."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great host! We had to stop somewhere in between states since we had a 10 hour drive, super clean and cozy!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,An absolute beautiful place to stay! It’s definitely spacious and had plenty of room for me and my plus one. Would definitely recommend 10/10!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great lil space...super clean. and perfect.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice flat for an overnight stay, with a comfortable bed and new amenities - it managed to be modern and sleek but also cozy and rustic. Booked a weekend without reading the fine print regarding potential noise issues. That was a concern, but it turned out to be perfectly fine. The place is well-designed, so you can close doors to block out light and sound if you wish, and the bathroom is another sound buffer."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always a perfect overnight stay.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great space! stayed on a Friday night and while there was noise it wasn't much worse than staying in a noisy city block. would definitely stay again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"it was very nice,"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic little place to stay after a local wedding reception. The bar next door was super fun also. We gave the locals a hard time, and they reciprocated with buying us drinks! Host was great at communicating, and this apartment was perfect for our needs!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great apartment. Very clean and convenient to Effingham.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay here. Lovely place and pleasant stay. Thank you!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay here!!! Zero complaints!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely space that is sparkling clean, well-furnished and comfortable. One note, it does not have a full kitchen - microwave, sink and small fridge only."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved this place. It was a quick stay for me as I was traveling back east and had a lot of driving to do, but this was definitely better than expected, by far! The bed was so comfy and the decor was beautiful! 10/10 would recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice, unique and perfect for our purposes."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place. A bit strange location across from big grain silos

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great hosts and a lovely spot. Trains aren’t too noisy and you are a good distance from Effingham and things to do. Amenities work well and overall I would recommend.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Very nice place but trains go by several times at night blowing horn waking me up
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Mary & Ryan’s house was perfect for our weekend getaway with friends. It is beautifully decorated and felt like home! All the accommodations were top notch.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was so nice and the space worked great for our couples weekend with friends. The decor and layout is something we’d love to have in retirement. Loved the whole experience. Surroundings are not pretty (industrial) but did not bother us at all. Thanks for a nice trip!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Even though our stay didn't turn out quite how we imagined, it was absolutely wonderful! Mary and Ryan were incredible hosts, very helpful! There was a terrible accident with an ammonia truck that ended up with an evacuation of the town. We still were able to enjoy the house for a little and enjoy some time and hospitality with the hosts. Will book again if I'm in the area, was an immaculate place in such a quiet cute little town!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. Very clean, beds comfortable and very accommodating!!! Would go back!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely neat room.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hotel apartment overlooked back parking lot price was on point

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I love staying at Adara’s place. It is so convenient for my half way trip from PA to OK and they allow (and love!) dogs.
I did have a little glitch checking in this time, but Adara was quick to fix everything."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Check in was easy. Reception staff was very friendly and welcoming. The King Suite was pristine clean with a comfortable bed. There were plenty of grassy places to walk our dog. Hotel is right off I-70. My only complaint was the noise from the interstate. That’s my personal problem. It probably doesn’t bother most people. It was a great location for a great price on our cross country trip.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We have stayed here 3 times . I will always book when we come through Effingham. Best Hotel in the area!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Favorite place to stay in Effingham so clean and everyone is so friendly

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed my stay
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Check in was as easy as any stay at a hotel. The suite was immaculate. Only slight negative was noisy box springs on one side of the bed, but that was disclosed and would not stop us from staying here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super friendly staff and always wanting to help, I would definitely stay again!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy check in! Will book again!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were greeted immediately by Shaakira. She was so helpful as I had made a mistake on my reservation date. Shaakira told me not to worry and she corrected my mistake. She was so nice, helpful and kind. Our room was beautiful and very clean. I would book again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean place, great price and wonderful area!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The mattress was so loud, like pipes banging, was very hard for me but my husband was able to sleep. I was also charged twice for the room. Once by Air BnB and again by La Quinta. I’m hoping to get some money back soon. Not great"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Space was just as described. I was traveling through Illinois on a cross country road trip with my dog and checked in around 11 PM. The front desk attendant was cheerful and agreed that Airbnb was the best way to book a hotel suit through them. Like other reviews mentioned, the bed was squeaky but all in all the space was perfect for a one night stop after driving for 14 hours. The spaciousness of the room was a pleasant surprise as well."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was extremely pleased with the room. It felt very comfortable, and it was very clean."
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"very nice staff. however, I wonder if they changed the sheets at all before I arrived. I got in very late and left very early so the bed/bathroom was all I used. there was a stain on the bed sheet & a bug (I'm pretty sure a flea). the rest of the room looked clean, but I didn't sleep well after seeing that."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cannot wait to stay there again for work!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,we travel frequently along i70 and stay here whenever we can. pet friendly is a huge plus for us.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So grateful we found this place! Through booking with Adara on Airbnb we were able to stay in a large king suite at a nice hotel for the price of a small room at a not-so-nice hotel. 110% worth the money!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice La Quinta suite. Great location. Very good farm to table restaurant down the road, along with several chain restaurants near by."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Surprised that LaQuinta Inn was an Airbnb but it worked out well and was a very good price.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love staying here when I’m in town. It’s always the first place I look for.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our room was nice and spacious. It was very clean. The bed was comfortable but it squeaked. The breakfast had a lot to choose from but I wouldn’t say it was great. Overall it was good and I would stay here again. Price was well worth it!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First, this is not a bnb, or not the usual sort. It is a hotel, but a nice one. I just happened to come across the listing on Airbnb and was surprised, and found the price very agreeable. We will look for it again down the road to see if it is available."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I had never booked a hotel through airbnb before, but everything was just as easy as booking on the hotel website. Super quick and smooth check-in for a fantastic price on a last-minute booking while in town for a family wedding. The bed was creaky but very comfortable. One thin top layer blanket had a few super light stains, but nothing I could have complained about. We didn't need to use it anyway, so no biggie for us. I would absolutely book here again if we were to visit. Great location next to literally everything!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"would definitely stay here again if in the area. easy to find, nice area, ac was awesome,and space is huge."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks Adara, great space!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect stay for a concert at the Effingham Performance Center. Some friends stayed at another hotel and my room was much nicer , more accommodating and more cost effective!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice hotel..

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed only one night on our way through on a road trip. I did not know the area, just chose it based on the distance we were wanting to travel that day. I was a bit nervous because I got an AMAZING rate (too good to be true) so I thought the area might not be good. WOW! We were so impressed! The area was perfect just off the Hwy with Walmart, gas stations, many restaurants both sit down and quick serve, shops, liquor store all within walking distance! The lobby was very clean and modern looking. The hostess was at the desk and greeted us immediately. Check in took 5 min at most and she told us we could use the pool and breakfast was included even though we booked through AirB&B (some places don’t allow this). The pool was super warm and clean. Very quiet even though we were near an elevator. Room was beautiful, clean, looked like the pictures and was huge. A/C worked great and Internet was fast! Check out was easy just dropped the key cards at the desk. definitely worth $."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Everything was great. The only one thing was we had asked to have the room cleaned and they didn’t clean it and we asked again the next day to have the room cleaned and it didn’t get clean. The room wasn’t dirty, we just wanted one time change of the sheets. I took out our garbage daily to the bins outside because they were not being emptied from housekeeping. Loved the room and the location, definitely coming back and telling others to stay here."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to stay on my road trip!! Booked it last minute, but everything was perfect for what i needed. Right off i70 and surrounded by restaurants and a walmart right across the street. Such a great deal"

The space was very comfortable, both living and bedroom area. The location of the room was convenient and the elevator was there each time it was needed. There was no problem with noise for us. Dogs were perfectly content and all furniture and flooring was dog friendly. It was really nice to have a kitchen area to store our cold things and prepare what little we brought. Location of the facility was easy to find and right off the interstate roads. Staff was accessible and helpful. We will stay again when needed while visiting the area. Thanks so much for making the stay so simple."

2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"I was not made aware that I would be charged separately for the pet. I searched Airbnb for the option of having a pet along and the listing mentioned pet friendly. However I was asked to pay a $25 pet fee, and then charge $50 from the hotel. This listing is at a La Quinta Inn and was nice to stay at, the staff was friendly and kind. Check in was easy and the location is great for people with dogs."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"La Quinta is rated the best hotel in Effingham for a reason. I love staying here! Shout out to Trystin for doing a fabulous job cleaning my room and also to Deirdra (sp) at the Front desk. She was welcoming, professional and fun to talk to. Last but not least is Tina who preps and manages the breakfast area. She is awesome and always does a great job. I will be back!"

I will definitely stay at La Quinta any time I’m back in Effingham!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Way more than what I was expecting from the listing. The place was spotless, the bed was comfy and there is so much room. We are pet transporters and it can be hard to find places that let you have more than 2 pets. We had 4 cats with us on this trip. I asked ahead of booking and was told they are pet friendly. I will tell everyone I know about this experience. I'm sure we will use it again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay, no additional taxes or fees… clean and tidy-"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Deidra was on duty when I checked into the Airbnb. There was a man having a mental health crisis staying in the hotel but she took control of the situation promptly, and made all the guests feel safe. She even escorted Guests to their rooms for additional safety, even though the person was already removed by law-enforcement. Although this situation was not her fault, she apologized profusely, took exceptional care of each, and everyone of us. Very reassuring. Deidra was outstanding!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place! I was a little confused with the initial check in, but the person working the front desk knew exactly what I was doing there and was extremely helpful!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stopped through in Effigham on our drive across the country and this was the PERFECT place for an overnight stay. For the price you pay, it is so worth staying at a hotel versus having to pay all the normal airbnb fees for staying at a house that you don't even use the kitchen/living room/all the beds etc... They had an amazing continental breakfast. The staff were super friendly. They accommodated our dog. And it was super accessible from I-70. I would definitely recommend staying here!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best place to stop in the area, highly recommend"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"How lucky for us that we stopped for an overnight stay in Effingham, Illinois, during our cross-country drive from Los Angeles to New York. Determined to get a small town experience, we booked Michael and Teagan's loft apartment in a 100-year-old converted bank on this charming town's main street. The apartment could easily be in Manhattan, with exposed brick, hardwood floors, and oversized windows. It was the perfect space to unwind, with a comfortable kitchen, living room and separate bedroom and bath. Why would anyone stay at a boring chain hotel on the interstate when this kind of memorable accommodation is just a few miles away? We absolutely LOVED Effingham and our 24 hours there was a true highlight of our trip."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while visiting in Effingham. Walking distance to shops and restaurants. The space is very lovely and has everything you will need. The hosts were great and very friendly!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautifully appointed AirBnb in an excellent location in Effingham. Excellent restaurants, shops, coffee house, and bars all in very easy walking distance. Hosts were quickly responsive to my late booking and very accommodating. This trip was for a family visit, but would be the perfect place for a business traveler. I hope to return in the future!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful and spotlessly clean apartment that's full of everything you could want to enjoy your stay (except for caffeinated coffee, plenty of decaf and hot chocolate but bring your own pods if you need caffeine). The bed was super comfortable for both my wife and I and we slept well. It's quiet and clean and nicely decorated. Parking is easy and we were right downtown where we wanted to be. A great place to stay in Effingham. I guarantee we will stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was great, just like the pictures. We stayed here for the Eclipse and they went out of their way and made sure eclipse glasses were there already waiting for you. Plenty of restaurants near by. Definitely recommended."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful… lovely space… with all things needed in walkable distance! Thank you for sharing space with me. Peace, love, and betterment for the future."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Hands down best place in town .!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This loft looks EXACTLY like the pictures, and will immediately make you feel right at home (both thanks to the beautiful, fully-stocked interior and welcoming hosts). It’s right next door to a grill pub/lounge, and has a variety of other restaurants within short walking distance…specifically Joe’s Pasta and Pizza, which has one of the best tasting pizzas.
My fiancé and I loved our stay and definitely plan on booking again if we’re ever in the area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, clean apartment with everything you might need."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful loft and nice hosts. Thank you!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second time staying at this fabulous place. Had everything we needed for a short visit. The hosts were quick to respond when asking for a late check in and everything else was seamless. Great spot!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always an excellent stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Xchange Loft was amazing. It was very clean, beautifully decorated and they spared no expense! Teagan and Michael were fantastic hosts! Would recommend without hesitation !"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a very unique location in the heart of the city that is in walking distance for food and drinks. I travel a handful of times for work in Effingham and I thought this would be a different experience than staying at one of the multiple chain hotels off the highway. I don't regret the decision at all and I would highly recommend anyone visiting the city to book here as well!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful loft for the night! You can tell the hosts care about the property and there is a lot of attention to detail. It was the ideal stay

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exceptional place.. My kids enjoyed this more then anything they ever done.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is an amazing space. No negatives about inside of the unit or the location.
Cons:
Sound —You share a wall with another loft. Unlucky, but there was a bridal party in it and I could hear over a dozen excited women squealing and stomping around for hours at a time. You can hear even normal level conversations from the other unit .
Host — after the bridal party finally left I took a nap. I woke to some man standing in the middle of the apartment talking. One of Startled, I jumped out of bed confused thinking someone had broken In. The host. This is unacceptable and warrants 0 stars. He didn’t message first or call, etc . He said he wanted to check the water since another part of the building had an issue. But he took my word for it not being an issue and didnt even check it . Again, clearly could’ve and should’ve messaged first. Especially coming from a host that needs you to tell them you’ve checked in and sends you an optional cleaning to do list for your final night ."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Always great to stay at the XChange! This was my 3rd time and appreciate the outstanding details and disarming hospitality that is a constant each and every visit. Thanks, I hope to return soon."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly this was worlds beyond what I thought it was going to be. The pictures do not do justice to how amazing this loft is and how unbelievable the area is! Squeaky clean and modern in every inch of the loft. So much to do just steps from the loft like fine dining, great bars, awesome shopping (I bought a classic Babe Ruth framed photo from the 1920’s and my wife bought all kinds of clothes!) The nook in the loft is amazing! The bed is completely comfortable. Shower head was uniquely designed and felt great! Bathroom pristine. Kitchen pristine. TV was HUGE! Parking was right behind the building and easy to navigate and we met so many unbelievably charming and nice people throughout the entire downtown area . This was the best weekend getaway my wife and I have ever taken and we will be coming back again and again in the future. Thank you Michael and Ann! Keep rocking it out!!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved staying here. The pictures look just like the place listed. It was a strange key set up but we figured it out. The place is very nicely decorated but if you get cold easily bring your own fuzzy blanket. They left out fresh flowers and offered a bottle of complimentary wine. I recommend this stay!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loft is as pictured on site. Very cute, clean, comfortable with a great central walkable location and easy/free parking; hosts communicated all information to me, including entry instructions and local restaurant options. Although it did not bother me, there are a lot of stairs. Highly recommend if you are ever visiting Effingham. Thank you Michael and Ann. I enjoyed my stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great loft within walking distance of local restaurants. Perfect stopping point for our road trip. Second year in a row, planning on more in the future."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was simply perfect! The vibe is amazing with all the brick work and careful attention to details. We stayed to visit family and it was centrally located to all activities. Easy walking to restaurants, a great coffee shop, wine & cocktail shop, the library, grocery store, etc. Even enjoyed the nice bottle of wine - what a treat! Will likely stay again on one of our next trips."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked this place for a girl’s night and it was absolutely perfect. This space had everything we needed! It was clean, spacious, & homey. The location in downtown Effingham was perfect & peaceful. The hosts were very kind also!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I always enjoy staying at Ann's. Favorite place to stay in town.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a place to unwind and get good rest on our way from Florida to Wisconsin. We stayed here on drive day 2 of 3, and were exhausted when we got to Effingham. The place was easy to find, instructions were clear and I was able to get into the lock box and then the loft in just a few minutes. There are a lot of stairs to walk up when you first come in, and no elevator, so keep that in mind if you don’t do well with stairs or dont like stairs. The loft space is incredible! Wide-open concept and ceilings that had to be about 15 feet high or more. They had the place spotless clean like a model loft getting ready to be photographed for a magazine. They had a free bottle of wine waiting for me, which was much needed on this trip. We stayed up a few hours after arrival, playing shuffleboard, which is one of my favorite things to play. The bed was really comfortable, the shower was super cool, the bathroom clean, and it was just amazing staying there. The hosts are super amazing too!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Would stay again!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the most thoughtfully set up Airbnb I have started at.
They didn’t cut any corners. The place was immaculate. They had great, soft TP (so many places go cheap there).
The bed was cozy, the couch was comfy.
I was immediately able to imagine myself living there.
They are not only stewards of the property but of the community also."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great space! We were able to invite friends over to watch some of March Madness—there’s lots of room to spread out. It’s very well appointed.
We will return, definitely."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stopover at Ann’s place in Effingham. We were only in for a quick night during a road trip. So having a primo location with a great pub right next door was super convenient. The decor and small touches were on point. Extremely clean, well organized and had absolutely everything we could need in a space. Loved the shuffle board table! Renovated, great location, trendy, well appointed— a great space for traveling couples. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was such a quaint space! I loved the space! It was bright and sunny and beautiful! Close to fun places to eat and shop. It is a beautiful building and would definitely come back again!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed staying there. The description and photos were very accurate- they even warned us about the 28 stairs! It's a beautiful loft space. We did have some neighbors with kids who were a little noisy, but it didn't really bother us. We would definitely stay there again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic stay!!! It was in the perfect location, right in the center of this adorable town. The place is spotless, the bed and pullout couch are very comfortable. They also provide 2 air mattresses!! Plenty of space in this gorgeous one bedroom loft. I’m so happy with my stay here."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My family has stayed a handful of times at this Airbnb and every time we come back, it seems like they've added a new little touch or detail to make things more personal and enjoyable.
I can honestly say this is the cleanest place I've EVER stayed outside of my own home - they pay attention to even the smallest of cleaning details that it seems like a lot of other places tend to overlook.
The hosts are very responsive and proactive!
We could occasionally hear the neighbors in the next door unit, which was a first for us (we chalked it up to holiday excitement), but everyone respected the quiet time hours and all was well!
We will continue to be returning guests any time we're in the area!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the second time I’ve stayed at this location and I love it even more. It’s so convenient to downtown shopping and dining. It was a great spot to gather with my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday. Five ⭐️’s in my book.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super happy with this spot. In a cool spot of town, but quiet enough to feel like an isolated getaway. Clean and modern, exactly as described, and at a great value. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This urban loft was in the perfect location. We wanted dining/shopping and everything was walkable. The hosts were awesome and responsive. The space had loads of amenities, we wanted for nothing."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a gem! This place is gorgeous with a perfect location downtown! Walk to a cute cute coffee shop, the library, several boutiques, and a delicious Mexican restaurant. The decor was modern, clean and beautiful. The space was cozy and clean. Would highly recommend. We used the space for a team day retreat and would certainly consider using it again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing spot ! Highly recommend
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay in the loft. We had to change our initial reservation and Ann was really helpful and kind, we manage to make the changes we needed without any trouble. The loft was spotlessly clean, everything was perfect!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was the second of two units I rented to facilitate a family holiday. Perfect in every way.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Needed a place to stay while visiting family. This establishment will be our go to place for these family trips. We stayed in the one bedroom this time but checking out the studio when we swing back through in a few days. I’m sure we will not be disappointed.
Thank you,
Sara and Shane"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My first time picking, booking and staying at an Airbnb. My next one that I go to has a lot to live up to! Katy & Michael were great from the time I booked till my friend and I left. Our stay at the XCHNG Master Suite was perfect! Clean, adorable and cozy! Beautiful building inside and out. Literally in the middle of downtown. So many stores and restaurants all around us. It was the most perfect weekend for my friend and I!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect! Clean, great location, easy parking and nice touches. Smartly appointed, chic yet comfortable. So much better than a hotel stay! Felt like a much-needed escape but also at home!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful space that was everything as advertised plus some. Great location in the downtown district. Will certainly stay again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay. We are frequent visitors.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful, comfy, cozy space and great location. Our host was amazing and very responsive. Loved the welcome book with the suggestions for shopping, places to eat and general knowledge of our space. Very well appointed with everything we needed to enjoy our weekend. Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This rental is everything it says it is, clean, nicely appointed, in a great area. However, we had an issue with noisy neighbors. With the renovation of the space, there is a wall that is not original brick and may be just a drywall wall between two units allowing noise to transfer very easily. The people next door were having a gathering and were very loud, so much so that we could not sleep. It was as if they were sitting in our living area. I called the host at midnight and asked her to intervein. She got ahold of the people next door, and everything was quiet by 12:30. Hopefully it was a one time issue, however, we only got 5 1/2 hours of sleep and had to drive 7 hours the next morning. If it were not for the noise issue, I would have rated it a 5."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host was more than accommodating with providing information. Very clean, user friendly and location was conveniently located within walking distance to other venues."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My parents, boyfriend, and our pup all stayed here over the weekend for a wedding in Shelbyville. This was my parents first AirBnB experience and they were absolutely blown away. The building is an old bank that is newly (beautifully) renovated, very clean, and the hosts have obviously tried to think of everything you need to have a comfortable stay. We weren't sure what to expect, but the town of Effingham is so unexpectedly quaint, with friendly locals, a farmer's market on Saturday mornings, and a beautiful town museum. Very walkable and doggy-friendly! Highly recommend staying here for both the AirBnB and to experience all that Effingham has to offer. Wouldn't mind heading back for relaxing mini vacation! We were sad to leave! Thank you to the hosts for a great weekend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice Loft very comfortable and right down town close to shopping and Restaurants. We will defiantly rent the Loft again as we have family in Effingham.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a great place to stay! Perfect for our family with multiple kids. Had a family movie night and had great take out right downstairs. Looking forward to the next time we are anywhere close to Effingham and staying here again.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had to book a place last minute as we realized we couldn't make a long drive in one day. Katy's place showed up on the route and we really lucked out! The place was spacious, fully stocked bathroom and kitchen (including kid plates, which my toddler loved), and check-in was a breeze. The local town was cute too - we ordered from Joe's Pizza then picked up breakfast at Daylight Donuts and Fox Holler, all locales that came recommended in the well-done visitors guide that Katy provided. We are already planning a trip back to Effingham for a visit rather than just a stopover and would love to stay in Katy's place again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful space! 100% recommend!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is our second year in a row staying at Katy and Michael’s beautiful place on a long road trip.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love this Airbnb! It was super cute. I love the old school exposed brick, meeting up with a very modern style! It is right in the middle of downtown, close to food, bars, and a grocery store. The little area is super cute, and super dog friendly. Learned how to play a few of the games there, and learned I am pretty great at shuffleboard lol. The book nook is adorable, there's plenty of books to keep you busy for a weekend in, and I love how stocked it is. Last Airbnb we went to, gave us two towels for a week stay and almost no utensils. This one was well stocked on everything, including pots, pans, plates, cups etc. Even had shampoo and conditioner etc there for use. Bed and couch is super soft. I love it. Recommend Fox Holler coffee. We are already planning to come back here early fall or next year in the spring."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and comfortable apartment. It is exactly as pictured and described. Michael and Katy are very responsive and helpful. Check in was easy and convenient. The location was great! Thank you.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend this space, especially when staying for multiple days. The entire place is beautifully designed as well as functional. These hosts provide some great amenities that allow for the ""at home"" feel like board games, video streaming services, and a keuregg machine. The entire loft is cleaned extremely well, and both beds, the regular bed and the couch pull out, are super comfortable with no shortage of pillows.
A few personal favorite features:
1. Rain shower head!
2. Sit & Stand adjustable desk
3. Window reading nook
4. Shuffle board setup
5. A few hidden surprises ;)"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Can’t say enough about this studio apartment. Location is perfect to enjoy the quaint downtown shops and restaurants. The decor and space has such a cool vibe. The little nook by the window is perfect to sit and read. Can’t wait to come back and stay longer.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time we have stayed in the one-bedroom rental and as with the first everything was just fine. The two-bedroom rental went to my sister-in-law and it is really a fantastic rental. I am not impressed with the service of airbnb though..
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cool place with a great vibe. Walkable to anything you’d need. The train during the night is the only thing that’s a bummer but bring ear plugs and it’s all good.

Excellent downtown location."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You must add XCHNG Loft to your bucket list the next time you come to Effingham. The second we unlocked the door we were transformed into a whole new world of overnight accommodations. This place is spectacular! If you love character, brick, black pipe and barn siding accents, this is your place. It’s beautiful and so close to everything uptown, you never need to drive once you arrive. We will be back!! 4 of us slept comfortably, thank you."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"MUST STAY! This loft space is absolutely stunning. The exposed brick, high ceilings, lighting fixtures, everything is just beautiful. You can see how much work went into the remodel. There were also so many personal touches that really showcase how kind the humans running it are. We walked in to find complimentary wine, popcorn, coffee, and water bottles, as well as suggestions for all of their favorite local spots (some of which are in walking distance). There were plenty of extra blankets, towels, toiletries, and more. The bed was also one of the comfiest I have ever slept on, and even the pillows were really nice. Parking and entry were both painless. I was sad to leave and I honestly can't wait to stay again in the future!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Xchange loft Unit A was quite perfect for our little family. My husband and I, along with our 7 month old and 2 dogs booked this space with super short notice and Katy responded to our reservation request almost immediately! The space was just as pictured in the listing photos, super clean, spacious, and the hosts provide all of the essentials to make you feel at home. There was plenty of parking available in the back lot and several local shops and eateries within walking distance. Don’t miss the opportunity to experience this lovely space!"

I couldn't say enough good things about the loft that haven't been said in other reviews."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed at many Air BnBs across the country and also in Europe. Katy’s place was by far the best that we’ve experienced and we were very impressed. The space is beautifully designed, rustic and inviting. Comfortable bedding and great amenities including a lovely bottle of red wine! The views of downtown were fantastic and we loved the character of the historic building- Highly recommend booking this space, we wished we could have stayed longer! What a gem❤️"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Unfortunately we had to cancel this trip because our child started running a fever in the early morning hours when we were supposed to leave. I hate having to cancel plans last minute, but Michael and Katy are such gracious hosts that they were understanding and empathetic to the situation. Seriously, they set the standard for Airbnb hosts - I will always compare my stays elsewhere to my stays at the XCHNG Lofts. Even though we had to cancel our stay this time, this will always be the first place we check availability at when we need to stay in the area. 10/10 recommend."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Katy is an incredible host and her spot might as well be a 5-star hotel. If you are traveling or looking to spend some time in downtown Effington this is the place to grab.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb I’ve found in the area. Clean, cute, spacious. Will be back!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place will stay again perfect location and close to everything in town.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful property to stay at. It was clean and in an interesting setting located around a neat downtown area with plenty of things to do around a small town. Would definitely book again if we are in the area.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re on the fence….book it!
This space was clean, conveniently close to the highway, and around the corner from so many cool spots in town. We loved our stay!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,perfect place to stay
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful loft and great hospitality. I highly recommend staying and plan on visiting again
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"STOP LOOKING AND BOOK! This is literally the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed. And my wife and I have been to dozens all over the Country. Starting with the communication with the hosts, they couldn’t have been any more helpful. The place is amazing in every way. The decor, the amenities, the cleanliness. The location downtown was perfect. My wife and I worked remotely with a perfect setup of a standing/sitting desk and great WiFi. We were walking distance to coffee and breakfast in the morning, and great dinner spots and local brewery and wine bar at night. It all was next level. If you’re looking to stay in or around Effingham, there’s no question where you should stay. Thanks again to our amazing hosts!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Loft was beautiful and clean! great view of downtown and within walking distance of all fun things downtown and the store!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Michael and Katy have created an incredible space in their loft in Effingham - modern industrial meets highly functional. The furnishings are top notch, the bed incredibly comfortable, the kitchen has any and all items you would need to prepare a meal, and the location is central to all things Effingham. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning countless times as we return to the area to visit family. By far one of the best Airbnb’s we have had the privilege of staying in."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a perfect condo with a perfect location. The condo is updated, immaculately clean and well equipped with all the extras. We enjoyed eating outside Gopher's Grill which is downstairs. The Village wine bar is a few steps away. A ton of free parking. Excellent communication and accommodations. We will definitely stay again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Huge and beautiful space, such a great overnight stop for us. Were able to get dinner and breakfast within walking distance and it was great."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed in one of their lofts again on my way back from a trip and it was fantastic! The place was super clean and check-in was smooth. Their communication was great and with the recommendations of places to eat from them we ate at a very tasty restaurant!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Loft is so well done and Katy and Michael have thought of everything. It is a great urban feel with all of the quaintness and feeling of safety of a small town. The shuffleboard was a real bonus and we played several times. The window seat was a great place for my morning Bible reading with my first cuppa. Thanks for sharing the space because it helped make our trip special.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, location, and hosts. Highly recommend"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay with absolutely wonderful hosts.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Katy’s place in downtown Effingham was wonderful. Super clean and exactly what you’d expect from the photos.
Very easy to walk to restaurants (Our favorite was Frugal Pond Pub. Get the honey quesadilla and say hi to Leroy!) and other Effingham establishments.
It truly is an effing wonderful home base for exploring Central Illinois (visit Mattoon for the Bagelfest! It’s BYOB though - bring your own bagel.).
Michael and Katy were super responsive and flexible to our itinerary. It made check-in/check-out a breeze. Major gratitude, y’all!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. Smack dab in the middle of downtown. Great brewery across the street and plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Loft was amazing too. Big and open. We’ll definitely be back.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! Everything was top of the line from the appliances to the furniture. We had every convenience we might need and the place was super clean! Hope to visit again!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Michael’s place was perfect for us! Extremely clean, conveniently located and charming decor. We will absolutely stay here again when we are back in town."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You will not regret staying here during your visit to Effingham. Fantastic location, incredible building, and an even better interior. It was exactly as pictured and possibly better than expected."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to stay! So spacious, clean and comfortable. We felt like we were at home with the quality of the kitchen, furniture and bathroom. We weren’t able to check out any of the area bars or restaurants because it was a holiday and everything was closed. We took our dog to Trec trails, which is close by and was great for exercise. The hosts were great to work with. We hope to stay again on our travels through the area."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This may possibly be one of the best Air B and Bs my husband has ever stayed at. The décor, the cleanliness, the responsiveness of the hosts, the location - everything about it is a 10. We come to Effingham a couple of times a year to visit my husband's family and we will only stay here going forward. We bring our two little Morkies and it is so much more room for them here than in a hotel room. The pictures don't do it justice, it is a huge space with lots of room and high ceilings. The parking is a breeze. The steps to load and unload the luggage are a little strenuous, but nothing to stop us from staying again. It is walking distance to many bars and restaurants. They have a shuffleboard game in the living room. There was plenty of anything you needed within the loft - toilet paper, dish detergent, laundry detergent, etc. I cannot say enough great things about this place!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,excellent. stay here
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is one of the nicest AirBnbs I’ve stayed across the world. Michael/Katy were very communicative. The space is well designed, comfortable, and clean. A great place to stay in Effingham!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A Beautiful open modern Apartment nestled in the heart of Effingham, IL. With courteous and professional host, you will have everything taken care of before you step into the door. This was our first air b&b experience and loved the ease of ""checking in"" at our own convenience with no need to wait on a host or let them know our schedule like a bed and breakfast. It was very nice to be able to throw in some laundry before we went to bed and have coffee at our convenience in the morning. The decor is perfect for the space. Michael and Katie made sure we had ample of bedding needed with the double mattress height air up mattresses. The appliances are all up to date if you want to warm up any food and the basic but classy plateware will cover all your needs. If we need to stay in town again, this will be our first choice."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a last-minute stay and our host got it ready in no time for us. When we arrived everything was perfect. We hadn't stayed in an urban Loft like this before and we thoroughly enjoyed it! We love the character and it was very suspicious and comfortable and cool.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying at Katy's place. Great location and the apartment was wonderful. Great architecture and furnishings. You can walk to shops and restaurants and there is plenty of free parking. Katy was wonderful to work with and she went out of her way to help us. We would definitely stay there again.
Ed and Lori"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This was a a amazing place to stay. Highly recommended it beautifully decorated with a comfortable bed. If you want food go to Effingham Brew the burgers are to die for. I will gladly stay again.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This loft is an amazing oasis you can get comfortable in after walking around town or having a nearby dinner – it's an unbelievable location and value, and we can't recommend it highly enough. Our whole family – human and dog – totally loved it!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect place for us, very quiet and private inside but with easy access to restaurants and shops. Our hosts were helpful and communicative and we couldn't have been happier. Highly recommend and we will definitely look to stay there again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Michael’s loft is fantastic. Very clean, new, and comfortable. Lots of light. Super high ceilings, exposed brick, wide plank floors, and a great layout."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay here. The pictures are accurate and its a beautiful loft. It made us feel like we are in a sleek modern / urban New York city apartment with all the exposed brick and piping. Very cool. The loft is literally right down town and there are multiple small boutiques, restaurants, and grocery store all within a minutes walk.
Michael was very accommodating and responsive to text messages. We even brought our 3 month old and they set up a pack n play for her to sleep in at night. This really helped us keep down the amount of stuff we had to bring for her so it was a huge help.
The only issue you may run into (which wasn't a problem for us) is that there are a lot of stairs to get up to the loft. So if you struggle climbing stairs then you may have a little bit of a hard time getting up and down them.
Thanks again to you both and we will definitely be back. 5 out of 5 stars overall."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you for sharing your home with our family. We had a great time in spite of all the CIcada's

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Chose this place for the number of bedrooms and baths to accommodate two young families and Grandma coming together for the weekend. Had plenty of room to cook and be together comfortably. Kitchen was well outfitted and plenty of towels and comfortable beds with nice pillows. It was too cold in January to enjoy the beautiful outdoor spaces with lake and dock but that would certainly be a huge plus in the summer months. Communication was good and check-in was easy and contactless as well as check-out. We had a great weekend and I would rent here again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Thanks!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our family enjoyed a relaxing weekend together swimming, renting a boat, grilling out and playing games.

Loved the walk out patio and upper boat deck to lounge.
Karen & hosts were always responsive and helpful anytime we had a question.
Loved our stay !"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay with my parents and siblings and a few kids. Beautiful views and lots of outdoor space. We enjoyed renting a boat and having a place to dock it. The house had kayaks and floats for swimming. The house was very well stocked. We cooked several meals and had everything we needed. I forgot the coffee, but it was already there for us! One night ate at pinky’s, a nearby restaurant on the lake. Hosts were very responsive to messages. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was amazing. Came down here with my kids and grandkids. The kids played in the water and we even rented a boat. Such a peaceful place to come for the weekend and just relax will be back in the future. The owners where always so responsive if we had any questions they where great hosts. Definitely won’t be disappointed.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay at a beautiful place. Karen was extremely helpful and quick to respond if I had a question. The location was central to areas that we wanted to see in the area; Marcoot Jersey Creamery, Casey (Big Things in a Small Town), and Amish country in Arthur, IL. The kids loved the lake and kayaking in the fingers. Very peaceful and relaxing."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I could not have been more pleased with Karen’s place. It was clean, spacious, comfortable, and literally had everything we could have wanted or needed! Everything was clear cut and easy to find thanks to labels on everything, and the home and area were exactly as described. We made some great memories during our stay, and we will most definitely be coming back in the future. I’ve stayed at a lot of Air B & B’s and this one was definitely at the top of the list!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"I have stayed at many vacation rental houses with family and friends over the years, and this was one of the better stocked places and it easily accommodated the 8 adults in my group. Whether we were all in the living room, at the dining room table, or on the patio, there was seating for everyone. All of the beds and pillows were comfortable and of good quality. The BBQ grill was clean and an extra propane tank was ready as a backup. We cooked all of our meals at the house and found all the cookware and table settings we needed. We rented a pontoon boat from Rusty Reel Marina, which is on the other side of the lake, and we enjoyed sightseeing and fishing around the lake. Thanks for the nice accommodations!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A special thanks to Karen and co-hosts who went over and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable. The place was exactly what we were looking for and even exceeded our expectations. The spacious cottage has a well-loved feel. It has it all …. a comfortable place to sleep, a fully equipped kitchen, gorgeous views, a patio, a deck, a cupboard full of games, swimming, and a couple of kayaks available to name a few of the highlights. We loved being there and would definitely enjoy being a guest again on our next trip to the Effingham."

The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. Everything was labeled in the house which made finding things very easy. They also did a great job on the house manual which is filled with very helpful information. The views of the lake are beautiful.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The price was a little steeper than I expected for a one bedroom and no real outdoor space to enjoy a sunny day.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a nice find. Great little spot for anyone traveling through or like me - be away from the big cities and get some nice time away.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed at many Airbnb's and this has to be my favorite one so far!!! It felt like I walked into my own home. The Host thought of everything to make it the perfect stay. I'm very picky about my linens. I could smell how clean they were. The pillows were so comfy. The bath towels smelled fresh and were soft. I look for dust and dirt. Didn't see any!!! The neighborhood was quiet and I felt safe the entire time. Host did a great job of communicating. I didn't have many questions since instructions were made clear from the start. I liked that a guide to the area was made handy on the coffee table. Overall this was a WONDERFUL experience. Look forward to booking again in the future.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I had the best time at the Birdhouse! It was an extended stay lasting one month. I felt right at home. The kitchen was wonderful to use.

In a previous trip I had asked if there was regular coffee pot rather than a single cup type. For this trip the hosts provided me the pot I preferred without me even asking.
A small thing, maybe but says volumes about them."

2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I travel for business once or twice a month from Chicago. Mary & Ryan’s place is near my business location and is a much better value and more comfortable than a hotel. I highly recommend it for a single or couple to stay.
I recommend it to you as long as you don’t want to stay there when I want to come back"

The kitchen and amenities are all modern with stainless steal appliances, new washer/dryer, great shower, etc. When I arrived it was very clean. It is very cute from the inside and out. I never had any problems with the Wi-Fi during my stay and it was fast. I actually had no problems while I was there! The backyard has cute landscaping. It is located behind a nice and safe subdivision. I took walks throughout the week around the subdivision. It is a quite area and still located 10-15 minutes from chain restaurants and stores. Located 1 minute down the road is a gas station/mini mart for all the last minute things you would need as well as a few local bars with good bar food! The hosts are quick to respond. For people who are staying for a short-time or have a quick turn around the breakfast set up is nice with teas, coffees, Keurig, to-go cups, oatmeal. etc. The two televisions were great lots of options on what to watch as well as easy hook up to your netflix, hulu, etc. Comfortable mattress and pillows! I felt very comfortable there and was able to get a good nights sleep on the first few nights of being in a new and unfamiliar place which is very important!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This shouldn't be a private note, this should be part of the evaluation and review. Traveling from Detroit to Dallas and finding a gem like this was, well, a little shocking. Any traveler, especially those who travel as much as we do, would be blown away by this little place. Cool old house... completely renovated and done in ways that utilizes every inch of the kitchen/ laundry/ bathroom space. Dug the perfectly balanced sliding door to the laundry, the English phone booth styled shower, Pikes coffee with cream... but our favorite was the tall, thin & handsome blue refrigerator... Seriously, great jobs guys... we loved it..."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I wanted to spend a few days alone (without roommates or grad school work) for our anniversary. This was the perfect little house to hang out and relax together after a very stressful few months of work and school.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Incredible stay! Very large one bed room space for my wife and I. Wonderfully decorated, spotless clean, fresh sheets, and FINALLY a comfortable bed! That is more than enough, however that is not all you get. For the price if less than a Holiday Inn or similar stay, you get an entire kitchen fully stocked with a fridge stove microwave dishes and utensils, a spacious bathroom with a great shower, your own washer dryer, and an entire living room complete with a big screen tv. Once you wake up I suggest making yourself a complementary cup of coffee and sitting out on the back porch and listening to the church bell tower ring out the time (loud enough to hear outside but not inside). Mary and Ryan were incredible hosts, we got into the house pretty late and they accommodated us with ease. Keyless entry to the home made check in and out quick and painless. If you’re going to be in the area, stop looking for a place to stay, you just found it."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute little house! Mary and Ryan are wonderful hosts. They were very accommodating, and quick to respond to our questions about the area.

Check in communication was phenomenal and I had no issues during my stay. Side comment for anyone driving to the place at night, looks like the general neighborhood is under construction and expanding. Some map systems might not take you straight to the location, but if you continue East on State street you should see a mailbox with ""112"" on the other side of the street opposing the residence. Thanks Mary and Ryan!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jerry
Thanks for being a great host and easy to work with. It was great to have a place to sleep and shower before the wedding we where attending. We had so much fun just sitting around the living room on friday night and catching up with family. Family is something that is very important to us and we realize sitting around and catching up like we did at your house is something we could not have done at a hotel like we did in your house.
We are assuming you live in the house beside the Airbnb. If this is the case we really appreciate the privacy you gave us.
Thanks again for the great stay and privacy.

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was lovely, they have great updates in the home. I loved the king size adjustable bed in the master. We loved sitting outside & hearing the church bells every hour. The only thing that may bother some, it’s pretty close to the train track & the train horns are loud when outside. I slept so well that I didn’t hear them. Also I didn’t really notice them inside the house.
Jerry & Fran stopped by to say, hello. Very nice host. We were very comfortable there & the house had everything we could possibly need or want. I also loved that it had a drip coffeemaker & Keurig coffee maker.
Thank you Jerry & Fran."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is great! It was really nice, one of the best Airbnbs I have stayed at! The upstairs can be a little hot, but fans are provided and we all slept fine up there. There are two bedrooms on the first floor, so this is only a concern for the two queen beds and two twin beds that are upstairs. You can also hear the train go by at night, but most of us only heard it once and were able to fall back asleep easily. All in all, this is a great place to stay in T-town! Walking distance to the church and KC hall is a huge perk too!"

We highly recommend this listing and will definitely be back each time we visit the area."

Jerry communicated very well and check in was super easy! The only things that weren’t exactly impressive was there was food items left in the fridge and the little flies flew when I opened it up.

It was clean, and has a modern, classy style and decor with quality appliances, cabinetry, countertops, etc... It was very spacious for our large family, and is in a nice area for family walks. It was interesting to look at the old, collectible items in some of the closets, like older books, classic board games, antique typewriter and more. The bedding was very comfortable, the master shower was great, and the kitchen well stocked.
The upstairs bedrooms were a bit warm, maybe it’s just this time of year, but if anyone in your group has issues/health issues where it might be a problem for them, then you might want to plan to have them sleep downstairs. It did cool down overnight though. Jerry was very accommodating to allow us an early check in. Overall, a great stay for our family of nine!"

It has 1.5 baths which is great with two kids. It’s also handicapped accessible, which we don’t need, but it’s noteworthy that they’ve gone above and beyond. My kids were so excited to be returning here for our overnight stay on our way home from visiting family. They immediately ran outside to watch the train go by. Jerry is very communicative and kind. Responds quickly. We will definitely be staying here again and would highly recommend this spot."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,A Great house for a large group. There was 5 of us and we were very comfortable. It is clean and decorated beautifully.
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We moved to Indianapolis from T-town over 5 years ago. My mother passed last year but we still have lots of family and friends to visit, weddings to attend, occasions to celebrate. We loved having a place to stay where our family (6 adults, 4 children) can comfortably stay without imposing on our friends and family. The accommodations are beautiful, comfortable, and complete. Great place to stay."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was very clean and large. There are two bedrooms on the first level and two bedrooms on the second level. Each bedroom can sleep multiple people with either a king-sized bed or multiple beds in the room. A bonus-there is a school playground about a 3 minute walk down the road and my kids loved getting their energy out there. Would stay again if travelling through again in the future.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed at many Airbnb’s because it is so much more convenient with young kids than a hotel. This was by far the nicest home we have stayed in. It was immaculately clean and the care and finishing touches put into the home’s design and amenities were so impressive our parents walked around remarking on them the entire time, and even joked about taking photos for reference for their own home!
Jerry’s communication was great, and he was very kind in working with us when we requested a later checkout.
We would absolutely stay again and would highly recommend! Beautiful home, and fantastic host. Thank you!"

The kitchen includes a multitude of dish-ware options and large, modern appliances including the fridge and dishwasher. The handcrafted cabinetry and open concept made the kitchen and dining area one of our favorite places to gather.
Having access to the grill and fire pit let us enjoy the outdoors. We had lots of space inside and out to visit with our relatives.
The close proximity to Effingham made getting groceries and eating out quick and easy. We recommend the Gabby Goat.
Jerry and Fran were fantastic hosts. They answered our questions before arriving and during the visit promptly. This is a great place to stay."

Jerry was very communicative, kind, and helpful! We had one of the absolute best times, and it couldn’t have been more perfect. It was absolutely the comforts of home without actually being home. The bathroom was incredible, the kitchen was a dream, and all of the updates were such a great touch! It was also so kid friendly! We had a little tornado with us, and it was set up with little ones in mind too. When we arrived we had a very minor issue with one of the lights. It was absolutely no big deal, but he went above and beyond to accommodate what he felt was an inconvenience to us. The sleeping accommodations were absolutely fantastic. We are already planning our next girls weekend and a couples weekend for later this year! Every little detail you could think of was taken care of. You will fall in love with Jerry’s just like we did!"

Even with all of the walkable destinations we were perfectly happy staying at the apartment, it is a stylish and comfortable space that was clean and well appointed with things like alarm clocks, laundry drying racks, extra linens, and kitchen items. Staying here is going to become a staple of our trips to Effingham."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely fell in love with this place . Comfy beds . Very Quite . Safely walked streets at night . They thought of everything . I have bragged about This place to so many friends and had to show pictures of the decor . Researched the building after our stay so interesting. A hidden gem . Hosts always gave quick response . We were lucky enough to pass through the area twice in one week and stay in the three bedroom and the one bedroom loft. The only complaint my husband had was no tv in bedroom of the one bedroom loft . I have no complaints at all . ;). This place is above and beyond expectations.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this place! Immaculate, beautifully designed and decorated with luxurious and yet comfortable decor and furnishings. Awesome views from the apartment, overlooking the heart of the downtown area, which was quaint and scenic. As soon as you walk out of the apartment, there’s a great restaurant to eat at that’s also kid friendly just a few steps away. The hosts outlined every aspect of the stay perfectly, also laying out recommendations of where to eat and places to go. I could go on and on about this place, but it’d be too long of a review for someone to probably want to read. To sum it up, don’t miss out on this fantastic opportunity to stay at this amazing place. My 6 year old and I did not want to leave. We will definitely be booking this place in the future again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is the bomb. If you are anywhere near Effingham, don’t hesitate to book your stay here. Everything was clean and high quality. The games were great. It was fun to be in a loft, looking down on the town. I was sad that the brewery has closed down, but there were plenty of other options. The farmer’s market was great. Historic downtown was cool. The stairs up to the loft entrance are not easy with suitcases, so be aware of that. It wasn’t a problem for us, but it could be for others. Overall, this place was relaxing and quiet for my family but it would also be a fantastic meeting place for family reunions, etc. My family really enjoyed our stay. Thank you!"

Looked exactly like the pictures- Highly recommend if you’re traveling to Effingham!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unique, beautiful design, a delight for the eyes. Games and other thoughtful amenities. Kitchen is well-appointed. Everything is fresh and clean.
It is a hike up the stairs, and as a person with knee issues it was tough, so be mindful of that.
The hosts are great, very responsive. Overall, an amazing place!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful/extremely clean modern loft, host was easy to communicate with. Will 100% stay again whenever I’m in town."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So many good things to write about. Good food at the gophers grill, plus lots of stores and restaurants near by. Americas Groove record store is walking distance and it is a fun place to check out. The room was clean, we loved the kitchen and the games in the room. My wife enjoyed the tub. It was a nice relaxing time for the two of us. It was our anniversary and it was a well needed trip. I’d recommend this place to anyone with any kind of getaway in mind. Lots of room for kids or just a romantic weekend.
Really my only complaint was going up and down the stairs. But I’m old so that is not the owner fault :) I do wish that it was brighter in the stairwell."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent rental property. Well equipped and true to photos. Excellent location downtown. We would definitely start again.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was definitely the most beautiful apartment I’ve ever been, in the US and abroad. I felt like an Hollywood superstar living the best life in her wonderful flat. The place was clean, spacious and cozy, it was well furnished and had amazing interiors. We really felt like home and enjoyed spending time in the living room. All our colleagues staying in some hotel were super jealous ;P Anytime I’ll be around Effingham I’ll definitely stop there. Absolutely recommended!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was such a perfect place for a family getaway. We LOVED all near by shops, restaurants, and places to relax and have a drink. The loft had so many fun games and a great table to sit around as a family. I normally bring a fan to sleep with, but forgot, and they had one in the room! So thankful!! Every welcoming detail did not go unnoticed. We will be back!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Third stay and great as always. Fabulous location and great finishes. This unit is our go to when we come to Effingham to visit family.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you want or need to visit folks in central/southern Illinois, or are traveling through - this place is perfect. I rented two units to create the perfect thanksgiving/early xmas gathering, and I truly could not have asked for more. Big, bright, beautiful spaces. Modern decor, great amenities (shuffleboard, games, washer/dryer) - all the things I needed to entertain my four kids, two grandkids, and my daughters partners - who all live in Illinois while I live in California. The exposed brick, all the wood, big tvs, and comfy furniture - yes, please. The giant kitchen islands with stools - perfect for where every family gathers - but completely open to the living area. Restaurants of every flavor in every direction, arcade, wine store, shops and boutiques... I could not have asked for more. We'll be back if they'll have us - for sure. Having stayed in amazing airrbnbs all over the country, it ranks among the best. Not a bad spot for a staycation or remote working need as well."

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is incredible. Everything about this Airbnb experience was top notch and without a hitch. It is the best-equipped place I’ve ever stayed in and no doubt the most comfortable. It’s spacious, impeccably clean and the basket of keurigs, the bottled water and the offer of a bottle of wine makes you feel right at home. The beds are comfy, each room has tons of space and fun games like Asteroids are the icing on this cake. Katy and Michael are fantastic to work with and any time I had a question about they responded in seconds. I cannot think of one thing that needs to be better. Oh and the downtown location cannot be beat! Within walking distance to bars, restaurants and a grocery store. They even have white noise machines even though I didn’t need it to sleep. I usually do! Thanks for the best experience."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We were fortunate to stay at Katy’s loft in downtown Effinburg.
This is a beautiful loft. The view from the living room is so beautiful and even though it is downtown on a busy street, it was very quiet.
This is a 3 bedroom loft. Each bedroom was very comfortable with high end linens. Everyone enjoyed a very restful sleep. The decor and art in the loft is beautiful. We loved looking at all the details.
Two sparkling clean bathrooms with all the amenities you would need. Fluffy towels and good water pressure.
All of the appliances in the kitchen are in great working condition. I was able to cook and because of the layout - I could enjoy my family while cooking.
I highly recommend this property. You can walk to all the local restaurants and bars. Downtown is very nice and you feel safe walking.
The hosts were available and very good communicators. Answered all questions promptly and gave great recommendations for local fare."

There are games all over the place. This place is beautifully done in industrial décor. It was just two of us, but this place could easily fit 4 more very comfortably. They even have an 80's video game in the room with the bunks and washer and dryer. So much fun! The town is amazing too. We met so many great people. Book this place, you will LOVE it.

Great location in town with multiple local restaurant options within 5 minute walking distance ( to include one with roof top bar). The old school mini arcade game in third bedroom was a hit!

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, very relaxing.
Taking the canoes on the lake is fun.
Only thing a person I was with noticed was that there’s a cabin really close and if you are inside with the blinds open and they are in back there’s not much privacy.
Luckily they were only there for one night and we did two nights.
Other than that
A really nice stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"House was easy to find, very clean and had all necessary amenities. Good location if you want balance between sitting peacefully in the backyard by the fire or within walking distance to beach and nearby marina with restaurant/bar. I am sure after Memorial Day it will be a very fun & lively place. Looking forward to our next trip to Lake Sara, I would definitely stay here again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an adorable little cabin on the lake. You can tell it's been loved over the years, and well maintained and updated. Sitting back in what felt like our own private cove, we felt it was perfectly private & relaxed! We had access to the kayaks on the property and had a beautiful time utilizing them on the lake! Kristen even allowed us to check in a little early upon request because she knew we wanted to make the most of the sunshine we had that day. It rained in the evening and we were able to still enjoy the outdoor area, due to a little covered porch area in the back. Great stay - thanks Kristen!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great at our stay, place was clean, any questions along the way the hosts were quick to respond. We brought our boat, the covered slip was convenient, had plenty of space to park the boat trailer also."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,good location and price
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place for a pitstop to rest. Would be an awesome summer place to stay for a long weekend or even a week.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As always we had the best time! Thank you so much! Kristen is a great host and her cabins are so cozy. I will always book here when I am in town!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice little place.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The good: The cabin is about what you would expect from the pictures. Easily identifiable from the outside. There is a nice little path, right down to the lakeside and the dock. Checking in was as simple as entering the door code. Lots of information available, left by the hostess. Checkout instructions, as far as what their expectations were, were made pretty clear. The place was immaculately clean
The not so good: The area is a little crowded. The properties on either side are very close, one even sharing a driveway. Plus there are loads of campers right across the road. So a private, secluded cabin in the woods, it is not. The driveway is narrow, and at an odd angle, that makes it nearly impossible to turn and back up in a long pickup. It can be done, but it’s a challenge.
The outstanding: Responsiveness. Between Kristen and her co-host, Marietta, they were right on top of any question I had for them. Responses were timely and they were very accommodating and easy to work with."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was really nice had everything we needed nice coffee creamer those are my favorite thanks
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stay at Kristen's place when we are traveling across Illinois. It is a pleasure to know that just a few miles off the highway we can get a cozy, perfectly clean and quiet place to stay. Although you have to keep your dog leashed around the area, it's a very pleasant place to walk."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our third stay at Kristen’s (twice in this house, once at her place next door) and we will continue to choose to stay at her properties on our drive down south. Her places are clean, comfortable, and easy to get to in a quiet neighborhood."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I stayed here for a last minute get away. It was fantastic!! Very clean everything we needed for our little get away. Very peaceful and we enjoyed walking down to the dock on the lake and the town was very close by. Thanks again
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"VERY BEEAUTIFUL setting. Unfortunately, we did not realize it sits right by the RV park and in between other properties."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were in town for just a night and this was perfect for what we were looking for. A great and cozy stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Modern update of an original lake property. For the cost of a local hotel room, we got the whole house! This lake property is located on a campground with many year round campers but at this time of the year, we didn't see anyone else around so it was very quiet! It has a great location in that it is ""a hop, skip and a jump"" from the public playground, beach, and pavilions. There was also new pickleball courts, bocce ball, disk golf, as well as golf courts there! Pinky's is on the next road too! Kristen let us look at the adjacent property she has for a possible future rental. Both were clean, modern interior, and had everything you might need! Things I appreciated: selection of pillows, comfy bed, wonderful shower head with great pressure, Roku TV and even had some DVDs to watch, a fan(I forgot mine and love a bit a air flow when I sleep), shampoo and conditioner in the shower to use, and extra blankets in living room to snuggle up on the couch with. Close to everything in town also"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our family of four and dog had the absolute best time at Kristen’s cabin. She shared listings for local golf, restaurants and a boat rental. She even allowed me to borrow a crockpot. It was spotless upon our arrival so we were able to drop off our stuff and get outdoors to fish and kayak immediately. Our only full day was a little rainy but we made the most of it by playing games and watching movies using the streaming services available. Our kids, 10 & 12, never complained once about being bored and we didn’t even allow them to play on their electronics. Also, I go back to teaching in a couple weeks and being away from home in such a peaceful place helped me to focus on lesson planning. Our time at the cabin was invaluable and we hope to visit again!"

We wanted to do the cruise Friday evening and show Saturday but did not want to stay in a hotel. I stumbled on this gem and it was perfect! My dad loves to fish so he was so excited when I told him I got an Illinois state weekend fishing pass and there was a dock right off our cabin!
The cabin was super clean and stocked with everything you could imagine. It was peaceful and not too far off the beaten path. I could NOT have asked for anything more. Although my dad struggled with the TV… lol but we made due. Ha!
Thank you!!!"

It has a covered parking area and a covered dock which is wonderful if there is rain during your stay.
The fishing is excellent and there are a couple nice golf courses very close as well. Our preference is the Fore-Way 9-hole course but we have also played Cardinal Golf Course and Meadowview Golf Course in Mattoon
We plan to be back for many years to come.
Thank you Kristen!"

The sheltered, calm waters were the perfect place for our kids to kayak for the first time ever; the entire place was calm and peaceful; we walked through the adjacent campground and the locals were so nice. Highly recommend the ""Lickin' my Chicken, Pullin' my Pork"" restaurant nearby for a casual, low-key, fun dinner spot. We went there for good BBQ and had a blast staying for a bit of karaoke.

,,,"Unfortunately I was cancelled last minute so I’m not sure why I’m being asked to review but 1 star was all I could muster as this was a rather significant inconvenience. I’m a post Covid PTSD Nurse survivor and my therapy dog is retiring and my new pup in training is taking his place. This shouldn’t of been reason to cancel and I didn’t have time or energy to fix it as I was traveling post holidays on an unexpected timeline. I ended up staying in an over priced scary motel in the middle of the Midwest. I save lives, and I’m struggling to save my own health in a broken and delayed system. Shame on you for not allowing my fur children who are literally saving my life helping me fight night terrors by placing my in a situation out of my comfort zone. Do better, or stop using this plat form!"
,,,"Imy daughter birthday stay was cut short we got into the room after 7pm on saturday and we left the next morning and didnt go bk she slept with her hood up and tightly pulled and tied. She was embarrassed because her friend saw the conditions of the mattresses and Mattress pads. On both king bed and pull out we had to put down towels and sheets over the couch and bed to lay down TO COVER THE hair everywhere. URINE/fecal/BLOOD MAYBE? STAINS ON THE PADS AND MATTRESSES IT WAS THE DEATH NAIL IN THE COFFIN FOR HER TEEN BIRTHDAY WEEKEND. WHEN I LOOKED AT REVIEWS THERE WERE MANY OF THE SAME INCIDENTS HAPPENING TO LOTS OF GUESTS AND THE RESPONSES FROM THE HOTEL WERE TO STATE OVER AND OVEHEY WERE ISOLATED INCIDENTS WHICH IS RIDICULOUS CONSIDERING the volume of complaints. In all these cases, there is not any resulted in a refund of any kind. AIR BNB WAS THE ONLY WAY ID END UP THERE.(LAQUINTA). I thought airbnb ""weeded out the weakness"". 1 was there from 7pm check in to 7 pm the next day."
