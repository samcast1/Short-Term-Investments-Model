You are completely surrounded by cotton fields and a windmill farm. It has all the amenities. It is a little out there, but just a short drive from the surrounding towns for food and necessities.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was a perfect place for me for a quiet writing retreat. Bed was super deluxe and comfortable and kitchen and yard were great. It was quiet, with occasional neighborhood car stereo bass playing that could be heard, but that can perhaps be expected on a weekend and was no fault of the host. Conveniently located near pretty canyon landscapes and a short drive to Lubbock."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can not say enough about our host Theresa or her property. we visited here for the devastating circumstances of burying my son in law, helping my daughter and 5 young grandkids. The cottage was immaculate and so comfortable, the mattress beyond perfect! Was cold and snowy while we were there at first the heating was a little confusing but I contacted Theresa who immediately got back with me explained and even immediately went fiixed the settings and explained how it worked. she was super friendly, helpful, and very empathetic as to why we were there. even before I booked she was extremely helpful. she has another property located in post ( rustys cottage I believe) another family member booked it and loved it! Post is small and of course we had family staying in all the lodging areas and from their comments picking Theresa's cottage was hands downbe will be visiting as possible and will always book either one of Theresa's cottages!!!! thank you Theresa see you soon!"

Only downside is the bathroom is pretty small. Not a problem for most people, but if you‚Äôre a very tall or wide person, you may find the shower entrance a bit narrow or your knees touching the sink when using the toilet."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"For just an overnight stay, Theresa's little cottage was perfect for me, just what i wanted. The full kitchen allowed me to bring food from home to warm up in the microwave, guaranteeing me a healthy wholesome meal while on the road. The small but stylish bathroom has a wonderful shower. In spite of being over 100¬∞, the AC was efficient and quiet. I slept very comfortably. Thank you, Theresa, for a great stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Theresa‚Äôs places was small but soooooo warm and comfy!!!!!! It was sooooooo cute and amazing, and the patio and backyard was cute specially during the sunset and sunrise moments! Plus in the backyard there was a cute swing that was comfy, and very nice."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot to stay, clean, cozy, comfortable. Our dogs loved having a backyard after a long day on the road."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyable town and place. Exactly as described. Perfect for a safe, restful stopover for me and the fur family. Coffee Wizards is a GEM."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great for a stop over when headed to CO!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We will be back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cozy cottage was a great place to stay! Quiet neighborhood and two car driveway. My boyfriend and I were moving from Houston to Las Vegas. We picked this place and it was great! We got burgers from the local drive in burgers, it was delicious. In the morning we walked to Jack and Jill‚Äôs donuts. Such a cute town and great stop! Amazing we could bring our dog as well. If we are ever driving through again we will definitely stop here!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect space for my little dog and me .. clean, very nice decor & super comfy.., lots of outdoor seating Too!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect spot to crash with my pup on way back from Colorado to Austin! Place was clean and comfortable. And the fenced in yard was nice to let pup get some exercise as I was tired from driving! Highly recommend
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place that was very comfy for a stop on our road trip.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was perfect for us and our dogs. Large fenced yard with a comfortable swing. Though it is small, it's just what needed. Comfy bed and a good kitchen (with plenty of coffee!). Excellent price."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our second visit to Theresa‚Äôs Cottage. Perfect for our needs as an overnight for our travels from Colorado to Texas. The place is clean and comfortable with various goodies for the bathroom and kitchen. Theresa is a great communicator. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be there next year.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable space, very compact but serves its purpose well. Theresa is very responsive and communicative and the lock-box entry enables easy check-in! Will hopefully be back next year!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,nice little place
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Cozy Cottage was a quaint, peaceful place for one or two people. Although it is a tiny house, it has all the amenities needed for an overnight stay or extended stay. It is located in a residential area but is within walking distance of a grocery store and if you are an experienced walker even to restaurants (less than 1/2 mile away).
The cottage was very clean and provided a full kitchen for cooking and dining. I would recommend The Cozy Cabin. Theresa was quick to respond to texts and lived right across the street if there was any need for her attention."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Traveled to Post for a family reunion and the Cozy Cottage was like a home away from home. I enjoyed the privacy of not being in an actual hotel setting. Whenever I return to Post it would be my first choice to stay if available.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cottage was very clean! I was eager to get there after my 8 1/2 hour drive and pulling up under the carport gave me a sigh of relief. Nice little backyard for my dog, clean area, VERY comfortable bed. I rested very well that night!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying for overnight return from Colorado. Second time as good as the first!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Theresa's place was a perfect spot for the night. I was traveling from Colorado to south Texas and needed a place for myself and my dog. Truly appreciated the fenced-in backyard for her to run around. The home was cozy, just like the name, and very well kept. I would definitely stay again as I make this trip a couple times a year."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very conveniently located. The stay was better than expected. The people in Post, Texas are very friendly and welcoming."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,On the way to the mountains and stopped to rest. It was last minute decision to stop and Theresa accommodating last minute. Super easy and convenient to find when driving awhile. Doggo‚Äôs loved the bed provided. Would definitely stay again!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I believe the best review I could give is that when we travel to and from Colorado we only stay here.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed my stay at Theresa‚Äôs place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Ideal place to rest overnight after a long drive out of texas up north. Clean and organized.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thanks for a wonderful stay. We loved having the carport to park under. A storm came trough with hail so, having our vehicle protected was a huge bonus! The fenced in backyard was enjoyed by our fur babies so, we were all happy. Theresa was a wonderful host."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect little place to hunker down with the pups for a few days! This was my base camp for exploring Caprock Canyons SP, and I loved it. It was a bit further from the park, but it was so worth it. Full kitchen, comfy bed, backyard for the dogs to run around ‚Äî couldn‚Äôt have asked for more!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very relaxing and cozy. We hope to stay again soon.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Really clean and host is very responsive.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying at Theresa‚Äôs cozy cottage! It was even more cute and homey in person than in the pictures. The backyard was amazing for our dogs! We have nothing negative to say about this place!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy spot for a west Texas layover. We‚Äôve stayed here a couple of times, and will be back."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was traveling through and stayed for one night and this was perfect for me.
There was a hail storm (which was fun to watch roll in from the lovely backyard) but really nice to have covered parking just feet from the front door.
Kitchen is well stocked with equipment/utensils."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I‚Äôm giving the cozy cottage 5 stars because Theresa is a great host. The rating is relative; for its location - an older, very small house in West Texas - it was fine. My stay was relaxing and Theresa was quick to respond to my requests. The rollaway table at the foot of the bed (‚Äúdedicated work space‚Äù) took some getting use to but once acclimated, it was functional. Bathroom is small, particularly the entrance to the shower- I‚Äôm a large person and I had difficulty squeezing through. The carport was a big plus, providing a shelter from the sun for my vehicle. Kitchen was fully stocked and met all of my needs. Front porch was a definite plus and a relaxing place to sit for morning coffee or an evening after a long day. Theresa and her husband were very friendly - I enjoyed visiting them when they came to see Theresa‚Äôs mom, who lives across the street."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot that was just right for what I needed. I was disappointed that I had to bolt a day early and wound up missing the second night there. I hope next time I am in Post it will be available!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Theresa has a cute homey spot for an overnight. Liked the fenced yard for my dog and the covered parking. As others have noted the bathroom is tight but there was only one of me - and had there been 2 it would have worked out. I appreciate natural light and open windows in nice temperatures but this place doesn‚Äôt offer either. I felt safe taking my big dog for a walk around the neighborhood and there was a grocery store 2 blocks away. All in all a nice stopover.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent location, grateful you are on AirBNB"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice host - We needed to stay an extra day and Theresa was very accommodating and helped set it up for us. We also loved the private secured back yard for out doggie. We stay here again when we come back to town to visit family again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A lovely little place to stay! Very comfy and has everything you could need and more. Recommended for anyone coming to Post or passing through üòä

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a really lovely stay. The cottage was cozy and cute and has everything one needs. The bed and sheets were really comfortable and allowed for great sleep. The backyard was well kept and peaceful. Theresa was very communicative, accommodating and friendly. I would recommend this stay to others :)"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed my stay!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything you could possibly ask for in an Airbnb while traveling. Well lit, safe covered parking, and close to town and main travel routes."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our third stay at this location - always comfortable!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,total Gem!! So comfortable and cozy and exactly what we needed for a quick stop when passing through.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Theresa's place was a nice overnight on our trip across the panhandle. Comfortable and convenient, this little place is a real gem. We were able to cook our dinner and nestle in for a good sleep. Wall heating and cooling unit was loud, so we just kept it off during the night and were quite comfortable."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay, and it remains our preferred stopping play to stay between Houston and Santa Fe. While it is small, it is very efficiently set up, with no lack of amenities. We enjoyed our dinner at the recommended and not-to-be missed George‚Äôs restaurant, too!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Host was friendly and responsive! Home was very well kept and exactly was was pictured and expected! Will stay again when up in the area!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thanks to the hosts for working with us to figure out a way to charge our Tesla overnight, something very useful in this part of Texas where the superchargers are few and far apart. The cottage is lovely and compact; larger people might have some issues with the tiny bathroom."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We are so thankful for Theresa and this beautiful Airbnb! It was the perfect spot to rest after a long day of driving. It was clean and the bed was comfy. The yard was perfect for our big dog! Theresa was so kind and even had a gift basket for us. She truly went above and beyond. I hope we get the chance to come back!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying here - we love the cozy cottage! Theresa is super responsive and a great host.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Very quaint little home. The backyard was nice to allow our dog to run around off leash and us some outdoor time as well. Appreciated the dog bed and bowls also. We would definitely stay here again.üòä

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was a solo traveler and the cottage was a perfect place to stay for a few days. It was warmly decorated, furnished with all the amenities I needed, conveniently located, and I felt very safe. I really appreciated the small fenced back yard and the carport too."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best AirBnB‚Äôs I have stayed at! Amazing amenities, amazing location, amazing host!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute as a button. Bed was super comfortable - slept like a baby.

Thank you Theresa, we will be back."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Theresa's place was wonderful and she was such a great host! Everything was very clean and looked just as cute as it does in the the photos. The bed was comfy and the location was really close to the local grocery store, which made it very convenient. I would definitely recommend stopping and staying at this cute little place! Thanks for being so hospitable, Theresa!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Excellent little place with a nice backyard
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a wonderful cottage for an overnight stay in Post! Theresa is just lovely and our check-in couldn't have been easier thanks to Theresa's clear directions.
The A/C worked wonderfully and Theresa even left us a lovely goodie basket with soaps, lotions, and a candle....so thoughtful!
The bed was comfortable and the kitchen was well appointed. I really can't say enough good things about this cottage!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is easy, traveling with pets you will feel at ease because they can just well be pets. The sheets are ridiculously soft and clean and comfortable. I would love to know how the host is able to aquire such softness. My son and I were safe and that matters when traveling alone long distances. I really can't express how relaxing it was to just take a deep breath and snuggle in. Highly recommend."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic, cute little place to stay! Had everything you could ask for for a night or a little vacation getaway. Theresa was very communicative and was an awesome host! Would definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"cozy cozy cozy...
was staying in town for work
was so cozy I didn't want to go to work.."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot if you're visiting Post or driving through! Has everything you need and very comfortable
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute tiny cottage with kitchen and back yard. easy parking and comfortable bed. There is a grocery store, gas stations in the small town but not a lot of dining. I stopped into Mooseknuckles Bar for dinner and a beer.
Easy check in and out. Thank you"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Cottage was a very cozy and clean place to stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I so enjoyed my stay at the Cozy Cottage. I loved the quiet neighborhood and peaceful backyard setting.
Comfy bed, cool TV, and a nice hot shower.
I felt totally at home and I will definitely stay here again when traveling from Austin to Albuquerque!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute place. Great for a short stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very quick to respond. Comfortable. Great yard for the dog. Multiple relaxing places to sit outside. I loved the swing in the back yard. Cozy relaxing and pet friendly. I would stay here again. The host was amazing. Had issues on our drive there and Theresa responded every time I gave an update. The night ended at this oasis.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Exactly what we needed for our overnight pass-through stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Cozy Cottage was perfect for us. It was clean and comfortable and offered the privacy that was truly welcomed after a long day driving. In the past we have stayed in motels on these trips to the western states. With our dogs, especially, it‚Äôs always inconvenient and difficult. With a one story house to ourselves and an enclosed backyard it was ideal. The dogs got to stretch their legs and we got to relax without having to run through a motel and up and down stairs. Theresa warns you that the cottage is small, especially the bathroom, but it worked fine for the two of us. The inside of the cottage is clean, well equipped and very attractive and inviting. We will definitely stay again on our next trip through Post, Texas."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very comfortable place that makes excellent use of the space. Great yard for our dogs. Absolutely perfect for a stop after a long drive. Exceeded our expectations. Thanks!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I was passing through Post on a road trip and this place was a perfect stopover for one night. Theresa was very helpful and communicative and was able to accommodate my dog and me on only a couple hours' notice. Pet food bowls and a bed are thoughtfully included if you're traveling with a pet. One thing to keep in mind if you're a light sleeper is that there's a somewhat noisy air conditioner that turns on and off throughout the night. This bothered me for a little while but eventually I got used to it. It's also possible there's a setting to change this and I just didn't know how to work it. All in all I was very happy with this stay.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect for an over night stay! The cottage is very cozy and had everything we needed
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Loved the fenced in back yard and the double swing. The cozy cottage was easy to find and easily accessible. Great communication with the host.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is an excellent resting spot. Theresa is a great host. She anticipated every need I could have needed and made sure everything was well communicated. We had some vehicle challenges and she was extremely supportive and understanding as we worked through it all. I highly recommend her listings.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place for us to stop during a long journey.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Second time to stay at the Cozy Cottage to break up my trips to Ruidoso. Theresa is so prompt and courteous with her communication and makes me feel at home. My large breed Labrador is welcome and the host provides a dog bed and dog bowls. The Cozy Cottage is clean with a comfortable bed and a kitchen with all of the amenities needed for an overnight stay. My favorite feature of the Cozy Cottage is the privacy fenced in back yard with plenty of room for a large breed dog to stretch their legs and outdoor seating to relax after a long drive. I highly recommend the Cozy Cottage for your overnight stay!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,very cute loved it

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cottage lives up to its name and is very cozy, clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay there again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cozy cottage is exactly as described. Very small, but for two adults and one medium-sized dog it was perfect‚Äîbecause of the fenced back yard. Extremely clean and orderly. The location is fine for anyone who is just traveling through, as we were."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little place to stay in a cute little town!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Second stay in Theresa‚Äôs Cozy Cottage. Awesome each time. Perfect for the wife, myself and Ollie our fur baby. We will back be a third time I‚Äôm sure."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"An absolutely wonderful place to stay in Post. Everything was perfect. Comfortable bed, nice kitchen, makings for coffee. Even tho the bathroom was a bit on the small side, the shower was bigger than expected and supplied with individual shampoos, conditioners, body wash and lotion. Theresa was quick to respond when I texted her and a great hostess. There was also a covered spot to park which was much appreciated. If looking for a place to stay in this area this is it!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed my stay at the Cozy Cottage! Traveling from Texas to New Mexico with a labrador retriever and the Cottage was perfect for us. Theresa was very prompt with communication and provided all details, clear instructions, and answered my questions upfront. I appreciated the open communication and high level of customer service! The Cottage was clean with a very comfortable bed and a nice large breed dog bed was provided. There was no pet smell in the Cottage and no indication other pets had stayed there, which I greatly appreciated. The privacy-fenced backyard was peaceful with multiple seating options, a beautiful Magnolia tree and plants, and overall a great place to relax while my dog played and stretched his legs. I will definitely stay again at the Cozy Cottage!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,All good!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I really enjoyed this place, it was very comfortable with lots of nice touches. I really appreciated the dog bed that was provided, thanks Theresa! Highly recommend."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great little place. I‚Äôve stayed at many Airbnb‚Äôs and I loved the attention to the little details the host provides. The bed and pillows feels like heaven. Everything you need for your coffee.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cottage is super cute and has about everything you need. The space is small but very unique.
2022-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"The space was great! The dogs enjoyed the fenced in back yard. The dogs loved the bed provided and the water bowls. The thing that got me was after I left the home, I got a message that there was poop on the comforter and I needed to pay to clean it. Turns out she never saw poop on the comforter but accused me of it anyway. To be accused of something when your took great care of their home, it‚Äôs frustrating. Take photos if you decide to stay here."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was so cute and cozy. Theresa was a joy to deal with. I‚Äôll be back in the near future.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to hang hat

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Theresa was fantastic! So quick to answer and the space was so comfy. It was a great spot for us to rest. Relaxing, easy, and clean!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,just as described
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely small home with everything you could need for a getaway. Definitely ideal for 1-2 people, and the location was easy to get to. Were able to visit the Old Mill Trade Days and would've gone to the lake if it weren't Texas weather suddenly shifting. Would definitely stay here again. There are some nice hole-in-the-wall restaurants nearby, so even though this is a small town, we weren't bored.
Only con is that the bathroom is small. Functionally everything worked, but as a 6' tall guy, it was cramped. It was otherwise quiet, cozy, and had any amenity we could need."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Thank you for having me! It was a fantastic stay while I worked down in Fluvanna!

2021-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Small and older building but definitely was a perfect crash pad!
If you have dogs while traveling and need a cheap stay for one night - this is it!
The host was very kind and even gifted a little shower kit!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cottage is small, but feels bigger because of the thoughtful layout. The bed is very comfortable and the kitchen is well-supplied. The street is quiet, and the covered parking is very nice."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This my third visit to the Lubbock area and my second visit to the Cozy Cottage. It was just as wonderful as the first visit and I will definitely be staying here anytime I‚Äôm in Lubbock. Worth the drive for peace and quiet and a little respite from the world. My dog loved having a yard to play in and Theresa is a very accommodating host! üòÉ
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing!!! The Cozy Cottage was perfect for my stay. It was EXTREMELY clean, the bed was super comfortable, and the house had absolutely everything I needed‚Äî (even a washer & dryer!) I enjoyed it so much that I extended my stay!
The town was cute and it was fun to get away from the big city I live in (Chicago). The location was great and I felt very safe staying alone as a single girl.
The host, Theresa, was simply outstanding. She responded extremely fast to my questions and was accommodating to any requests I had!! Truly a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend staying at this charming place!!!"

We would definitely recommend this house and will return if ever given the opportunity."

The surrounding neighborhoods are great for morning and evening walks. If you are looking for a quiet place to rest and relax, look no further."

My dog enjoyed investigating the backyard and the patio set and swing set made for a great hangout place for me! Theresa is very hospitable and goes out of her way to take care of her guests! 5 stars! (If you bring your dog and fancy a walk just be aware that the locals give their pups a lot of free range time but they have good manners)
Post is 110% small town America and such a cute place to explore !"

2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The place was very clean and spacious . Host was great and very responsive . However , feedback is to provide a better experience for future guests: ( we had 2 adults and 2 kids under 5 yrs)
1. There were no pool towels. We had to use bath towels, in which there were not enough towels because the ""pool towels"" became really dirty with the midland dust after taking outside
2. Kitchen is slim. 2 coffee mugs. 6 plates . 4 water glasses. No mixing type bowls/large salad/pasta bowls.There is no plastic in the place- so bringing a glass water cup outside was risky. It's pretty bare bones !
3. We had half a roll of paper towels and ran out quickly with no extras . No dish towels.
4. No laundry soap provided
5. Out of the 3 days we were there- the host showed up 2 times ( he messaged that he would have to drop by and clean the pool , and the meet a warranty repair person ) although host was accommodating and responsive - I still didn't want him dropping by at less than ideal hours ."

Coffee is provided & few tea options + nibbles. Lovely products when bathing. Enjoy a free movie snuggled up on the comfy couch, if weather doesn't permit sitting outside. View really is visible from inside. excellent placement of sliding glass door & window to feel as if you are comfy in a bird's nest or tree house.
You'll love the sound of the Arabesque wind chimes...so soothing. Quiet & peaceful.
MotoMed Mediterranean is a tasty option if you need a vegetarian & GF option.

I feel bad that that we were able to stay at their lakeside villa for so cheap! I would easily pay double the price to stay at their place again. Between 7-8 in the morning and 4-5 in the evening you can go on the porch and watch the neighbors feed the 100‚Äôs of ducks in the lake which was so peaceful to watch. Also, Ellie (their dog) is adorable and super friendly. All in all. 10 out of 10. If I‚Äôm in the area again, I will be, without a question, staying at this beautiful lakeside villa again!"

We were ok with a soft mattress, and no dishwasher or stove, or toaster, those are the only few things that could/might have an impact on someone else, but for us, the Villa was very accommodating. There is a microwave, a Keurig coffee maker and mini fridge, as well as cutlery, cups, plates, glasses, paper towels, wine opener, dish towels, salt & pepper shakers, coffee in Keurig cups, (medium roast), individual containers of half & half, a basket with assorted teabags, and an assortment of cookies, crackers, and chocolate bars, all very appreciated!

The air bnb was clean, and had some extra touches that made the stay so much nicer than a hotel- snacks, toiletry items, filtered water, little fridge.

The list of available extras and necessities was top notch! From gum, cold waters, warm cookies and a very welcoming card; to shaving cream, extra toothbrushes, antacids, and allergy medication. Just wow! We booked this home while I was in town for a wedding. Two large mirrors and especially the outdoor area by the pool (which felt great), allowed for amazing photos. Lastly, the comfort and cool temp, which could be adjusted, made for a great sleep! Outside of the home, we were close to fast food and restaurants, grocery stores, and coffee (if you wanted something other than what was already provided). Very very convenient, safe, and quiet home. We would happily recommended this home and would love to book here again!

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Dante's Place was ideal for our stay in Big Spring. We attended a family reunion a few miles away. Linda's home provided us with a clean, comfortable place to stay. If we stayed at the hotel, we would have had to book 3 rooms for 3 nights. Dante's Place was clearly a better value and easily more comfortable than a hotel stay. It enabled us to spend much of the day at the reunion and then relax in the evenings and part of the mornings in a private, relaxing setting. The house is well laid out with a really nice common area (family room with large sectional sofa, large kitchen and dining table) conducive for visiting. Each of us were treated to inviting, spacious bedrooms with comfortable beds. We really liked that the bedrooms are located in 3 separate corners of the house. This gave each of us additional privacy at night. The master bedroom suite is a highlight. It's a large bedroom with a king size bed, dual vanities, bathtub, large shower, walk-in closet and water closet."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,I was impressed with the home especially with the cleanness. I would stay here again. Linda was very helpful and friendly.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Can't beat the location. Just down the street from the family we were visiting. Easy to follow, proactive directions.

There was so much space in the house, which was just beautiful. The master bedroom was big, well lit with the big window and oh so nice king bed. The bathroom was huge and nice.
