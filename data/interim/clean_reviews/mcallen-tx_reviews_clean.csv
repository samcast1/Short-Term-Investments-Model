2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great place to stay, and the location was convenient. Plenty of restaurants, a mall, interstate access, and the airport are all within a couple of miles of the house. The house was lovely and comfy. I would stay again."
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The house was beautiful. We do not give it a five star because, the floor was dusty and the bed in the master was full of hairs. When we removed the blanket, we saw hairs as if the bed was just made and not clean from previous visitors. Hairs were on the pillows and on fitted sheet. The beds were too hard for our liking. Other than that, it was easy to find and in a quiet neighborhood. The host was responsive and very nice."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Grove wasn't just our wedding venue, it was the backdrop to a dream come true. Nestled amidst citrus groves bursting with fragrant life, vibrant flowers, and swaying palm trees that seemed to whisper congratulations, it felt like we'd stepped into a hidden paradise. Saying 'I do' surrounded by loved ones, with this breathtaking scenery as our witness, made the whole experience even more magical.
And the magic didn't end after the reception! Being able to retreat to a cozy guest house right there at The Grove after the festivities was the perfect way to end the night. Waking up the next morning, enveloped in the tranquil beauty of the venue, and knowing we'd begun our forever journey in such a special place, filled our hearts with pure joy. The Grove holds a piece of our love story now, and we can't wait to return in the future to reminisce about the start of our happily ever after."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay here for our anniversary the whole experience was above and beyond our expectations. We were greeting with the most welcoming owners of the guest house and their two dogs were the most friendly comforting pets that roam outside.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I‚Äôve stayed in just about all the rooms at the Nest, can‚Äôt go wrong with any of them but the cabin stands apart with the covered porch."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a very relaxing and cool place. We loved the greenery and the peacocks. Remember to bring insect repellant because the mosquitos are no joke!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the most unique stays I have ever had. Such a cool place. The living space has everything you need and more. If you have the chance please talk to loise and learn about the property, it was great learning everything they have done and how the property operates. The sunrise/sunset was absolutely beautiful. This is a must if you are staying anywhere close to Mission"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôm writing this just before leaving - sitting on the deck watching egrets, cormorants, teals, grebes, and shoveler ducks on the resaca; and an osprey on a nearby tree that has just caught its breakfast. Several families of purple martins are settling into the Martin house in front of our cabin and an orange crested warbler is darting around.
We stayed in Ethereal and can highly recommend it.
A beautiful place managed by wonderful people."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are very inspiring to come to this place, very quiet and special for inspiration. The hosts are great people and you feel at home at all times. Where you look, this is very cute.
Thank you very much for hosting us! We will always be back"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Peculiar Nest. The property with adjacent resaca (oxbow lake) is beautiful. We stayed in Ethereal, which was spacious, quiet, well appointed, and just as pictured. The hosts were gracious and quite friendly. We hope to return for another great trip."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was 10/10 when meeting expectations. waking up to peacocks in our porch was so peaceful. they also had so many amenities to use. the porch is beautiful, had many times that ny partner and I would sit and have tea/ coffee. (which they had also provided). the bedroom was so cozy and stunning. they had several books and board games which I thought was so nice. all appliances are new and easy to use."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! We are bird enthusiasts and were captivated by all the species both in the resaca and the trees around it. We saw Great Blue and Tri-colored herons, Great and Snowy Egrets, Night Herons, White Pelican, Roseate Spoonbill, Green Jays, Altamira Orioles and on and on. The Peacocks were an extra treat.
We also visited the National Butterfly Center and Bentsen State Park.
The unit is clean and modern. A Keurig coffee machine and coffee pods were provided (thank you, Nicholas!). We had everything we needed. I wish we had booked it for longer."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay at Nicolas‚Äôs listing was great! We felt right at home. It was a very peaceful and relaxing place to get away from city life. Highly recommended!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful view of lake just off deck. Very friendly proprietor. Small and well equipped. But just 2 sets of towels. An extra set would have been better for a woman with long hair. I would definitely go again. Just for a couple. Small but comfortable.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in a lot of AirBNBs over the years, in a variety of settings. But this one stands out as particularly restful, beautiful, and unusual. The setting was spectacular and we so enjoyed the bird reserve each morning. The cabin itself was well appointed with everything we needed, and the bed was absolutely heavenly in terms of comfort. McAllen is an interesting community-- lots of activity, and a man-made kind of feel. We are outdoorsy people, and this ""Peculiar Nest"" was the natural respite we needed after a day of socializing and taking in the city. Well done in every way-- we will be back!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place to stay! My husband and I traveled to the area to go birding at the state parks. We were so impressed with the amount of birds that we saw just while sitting on the patio. We got to see an osprey eat lunch every afternoon. Green Jays would visit us every evening, and the egrets roosted on a nearby tree every night. Kiskadees visit the property as well. The grounds are absolutely beautiful, and the inside of the cabin looked just like the photos. Everything was clean, the bed was super comfy, and the kitchen had everything we needed. We had a lovely time and will definitely be back to stay there again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed at the ethereal cabin the night after our wedding and found ourselves in a beautiful enchanting paradise. The surroundings were beautiful and everything was as described!
Nicolas was very responsive and friendly. I was allowed early check in to have time to prepare for my wedding!
Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more. Highly recommend."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! This Airbnb is a private lovely cabin on a peaceful lake. We came to South Texas in part for the birding and enjoyed watching all the waterbirds and waterfowl from our deck.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ideal place for bird watchers. We did a lot of bird watching from our deck and the property. It was very peaceful and relaxing. It was also a great home base for our daily birding trips to the many state parks, national wildlife refuges, and private properties. Our place had a kitchenette, washer/dryer for laundry, dishwasher - all in a very efficient and modernly decorated space. We would definitely stay again. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place! My boyfriend and I had the best time! Will be booking again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Peculiar Nest compound is truly a wonderful spot, especially for those who appreciate birds. The family are great hosts and really went above and beyond. We stayed in two different rooms/cabins (Ethereal and Dreamy) and this one was definitely our favorite: more private, newer, fantastic patio, and a layout that worked better for us (traveling with a young child). Overall very highly recommended!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Magical place. You would never dream of a location like this in McAllen. Peaceful, calm, and quiet. Host was awesome. They live onsite and available if needed. Gated and secure property. Easy parking and unloading. Outdoor space is spectacular! Multi-level decks, fire pit, lots of outdoor seating. Rooms are as described. Very clean and well equipped kitchen in the cabin. There is also a communal kitchen for larger groups. Just a incredible space. Highly recommend."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for birders!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Roll down blinds in living room need to be replaced. Fine other than that.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the ultimate place for birders or anyone wanting a peaceful place to relax. We stayed in the Ethereal Cabin. It was spacious, clean and very attractively decorated. The deck was the perfect place for my husband and I to have an impromptu wedding. Nicholas helped us find an amazing officiant and his dad took pictures for us. We were treated like family. Can‚Äôt wait to go back. I highly recommend."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place for couples!!!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place Iwill go back !!!! Thanks mr nicolas and family for making my Trip unforgettable ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a Wedding, and this Airbnb was like visiting another world! Very peaceful patio, lots of wildlife and bird watching! Great golf course across the street and plenty of food options near by. Would 100% come back. Kind hosts."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"It‚Äôs a hidden paradise, there is nothing quite like it in Texas. Very kind people that take care and teach you so much during your whole stay! Highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,great
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is just as advertised. As birders, we enjoyed the water, and the privacy. The few peacocks rambling around were excellent. A lovely back porch to view the water. The place was set up so well: outlets everywhere, an incredibly comfortable king-size bed (with a mattress topper and nice cotton sheets), a drip coffee maker and another with pods provided, a water machine, excellent lighting via windows, overhead can lights and lamps, good closet space, a hair dryer, new appliances, adequate cooking and eating utensils, and a few extras - some oils, spices, whatnot. The only thing missing, which I mentioned, was no ice maker or trays. I imagine the owner will fix this post-haste.
Communication was stellar. Any minor issues were handled within minutes. And the host was kind. I would absolutely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I came here to host our small courthouse wedding, and Nicholas and his family were very kind enough to let us host a small group at the peculiar nest. The scenery and architecture was fantastic, and the birds were a joy to watch and interact with as well!Would highly recommend coming here as it is a hidden gem in the City of McAllen. Thank you Nicholas and your family for the hospitality üôå"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"For someone who enjoys the outdoors and Nature, this little Gem of an Oasis was a Great find for sure.! A vibe worth every bit. Has more to offer than Your typical rentals. This one is on a return list for sure! Highly recommend for any type of occasion. The Hosts are friendly and inviting! If You‚Äôre ever in the Rio Grande Valley and need a place that has all that You can ask for‚Ä¶ This is It! 6‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüí´"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Splendid!! Spectacular setting. Isaac fabulous. Birds and new friend peacocks delightful. Great coffee. Absolutely terrific. Gracias!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A clean, spacious room on a beautiful lake! Birders everywhere should come stay at Peculiar Nest for wetlands birds and an observation tower!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a heavily-branded stylish cabin with a nice view of a lake and it is quite close to town. The living room, kitchen, and bedroom are arranged in an accommodating way and there is an inviting deck off the living room. The kitchen had everything we wanted and the washer drier was very handy to have. The hosts were great, very friendly and offered a lot of useful local information. It was very hot during our visit (100 degrees) and the air conditioning was great (the large ceiling fans were also nice). If you are interested in bird or butterfly watching this is an ideal place to base a visit to the local parks (the National Butterfly Center has the most to offer in a small footprint...when it is hot outside). You could also view local flora and fauna from the deck. Highly recommended."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Overall had a great experience. Our host was very accommodating.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay was well worth the money! Very peaceful and beautiful!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Air B N B I‚Äôve been to so far!! The directions to the place are easy to understand and the owners even send pictures of where to park so there is no confusion once you arrive. The ambiance is stunning, beautiful landscaping on the property that not only is peaceful but also serves a purpose to feed the wildlife that‚Äôs there. We were allowed to feed the peacocks in the morning, and at sunrise you can watch all of the beautiful birds flying over the lake right outside of your door. The bed and couch are very comfortable and there‚Äôs also a common area that has drinks, snacks etc. We definitely plan to be back in the near future!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is such a beautiful, peaceful retreat. We got to enjoy coffee outside on the deck with the peacocks right beside us. The scenery is so beautiful. The sounds of nature really helped us reset from our usual routine, and we enjoyed watching the ducks, squirrels, and birds all around us. The little cottage itself is perfect for two people. And the bed and pillows were super comfy."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,was a great experience
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Feels like your far away from the city but you're near lots of restaurants and stores. Great location overall.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have been coming down to McAllen for decades because my husband was originally from the area and this was a secret paradise. We enjoyed our visit so much that in the future we look forward to that being an added bonus our next family visit. Your parents are simply adorable and thoughtful we enjoyed meeting them, it was almost like we gained a few new relatives on this trip. This property is exactly like the pictures and guaranteed to give you a peaceful and relaxing reset‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is the second time I've stayed there.
I loved the first one and for that's why I came back. Unfortunately now the garden was a bit neglected maybe from the last storms in the area. I hope soon you can offer the garden as cute as it was before"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nicolas, it was a pleasure to stay in what you and your parents have created. if you are staying in the McAllen area, this place is worth consideration. Nice private lake view and patio, lush greenery/garden, and the many birds you will see. Peacocks ü¶ö made this place extra special. Thanks again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed having dinner in the attracted private balcony area. Seeing the sunset, lack, and peacocks during dinner (after a long day at work) was absolutely perfect. I‚Äôd love to stay here again when I‚Äôm in the area!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay! Very relaxing and beautiful surroundings! Gracious host and very responsive host! We will definitely be back!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Hosts were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay in the cabin. I Loved being greeted by stunning peacocks when we first arrived. Cabin and atmosphere made us feel off the grid but only 5 minutes away from restaurants and shopping centers so we had the best of both worlds. 10/10 I‚Äôm bringing more family and friends the next time.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"From the start Nick would respond super quickly with anything I needed. Even when I had a little trouble with electricity, the manager came straight over without hesitation to update us on the status. She gave us cold beverages, and even when the power was back on she set up Candles for me to help with my special date! 10 out of 10 communication. Will Definitely come back again to relive some memories and maybe take some photos :)."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, hosts are great. Vibes are so peaceful - fast internet 10/10 will stay here again & highly recommend to all. Truly hidden gem in McAllen"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful spot perfect for early morning bird watching.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a charming and unique spot! I loved being right on the water for easy birding and the rooftop made looking at the moon at night even more special. The cottage/ cabin itself was clean, comfortable, and easy to access. I loved the porch swing seat especially. The Peacocks were a lovely surprise and added a really fun and interesting sense of surreality to the whole stay‚ÄîI would love to come back someday."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome place, a quiet getaway but also near the stores"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Peculiar Nest is a wonderful accommodation. The property is a serene oasis in McAllen, which surrounds you in nature, yet is close to restaurants and shopping etc. The Ethereal cabin is spacious and comfortable. The full kitchen and laundry facilities were appreciated, not to mention the private deck on the lake."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Ethereal! The setting was beautiful. After a long day it was a lovely place to relax! The accommodations were clean and comfortable. Lois was very nice and helpful. We would definitely recommend it!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the peace and quiet, even when the peacocks squawked!! We came for the birding in the ""Valley""and this place was perfect in terms of location to visit the various state parks and wetlands around and about. It was even a nice day trip to South Padre Island. Will come to this place again, and stay in the cabin."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stay here twice a year when visiting family locally. We call it our vacation home and all 4 of us look forward to it. We love the peacocks, wild rabbits and birds, and love eating out of the vegetable garden. My sons explore freely and I know they are safe.
It was so wonderful, I went straight to the porch and sat in the hammock swing‚Äîmy happy place!
We love it here and can‚Äôt wait until our next stay in the fall!
Oh, also, they are building a birding platform with amazing views! They also have added a community kitchen and space is another lovely amenity for cooking and meeting other travelers!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,excellent birding from the deck. I loved the landscaping with papaya trees and gardens.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we've stayed here and love the place and the grounds. Some parts are still under construction but almost finished and it's beautiful, peaceful, and private. The lake, landscaping, wildlife, birds, and on grounds 5 peacocks are a great addition. It makes you feel like you're in the tropics."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our cabin was very clean and comfortable. The deck off the sliding doors was incredible for viewing birds. Early morning just at sunrise was spectacular. The kitchen was stocked well and the appliances all worked. The cabin was perfect for 2 people.
The property is big with other apartments off the main house. But our cabin allowed privacy but it was also enjoyable to say hello to other birders and the host Lois.
Some other guests mentioned building materials near the cabin. That didn‚Äôt bother us as they were just near the parking by the cabin . The hosts have fairly extensive gardens, trees and shrubs which they need to tend too as it is their home. So I assume there are continual projects and chores that need attention. A lovely place to stay if you enjoy nature and birds.
Thank you for sharing your property . Would definitely stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying at Peculiar Nest, and it didn't disappoint. upon arrival we were graciously offered at a snack by the host. It was incredibly sweet! I look forward to visiting again soon."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Situated on a lovely resaca (oxbow lake), this place is a nature-lover's dream, especially if you are a birder. We saw 51 species on the property during our 4-night stay. It's also centrally located to the birding hotspots of the area, and to the commercial corridor of McAllen. The unit is perfect for two: well- equipped kitchen, space to eat either indoor or out, lots of helpful amenities. Nicholas is super-fast at communicating, and the on-site host, Lois, is incredibly welcoming and is doing amazing things with the property. One of our favorite AirBnB's ever!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This trip for me and my wife was amazing. It truly was a remarkable trip and it started with very gracious hosts. We truly enjoyed every moment we had and it was a memory cherished.
The view is breath taking and it really does make you feel at peace. There is birds chirping all hours of the day to give you the feeling as you are next to them.
It looks like they have domesticated a couple peacocks because these guys walk around everywhere. This is not a problem at all if you want to feed them. Just ask the host and they have feed, and enjoy yet another amazing experience.
The house is decorated very well and modern. It is apartment style room. So everything is together but it has everything needed to enjoy your time, this would include dishwasher, washer & dryer, and a full fledge gas stove.
It is a wonderful experience and can really help shape your mind to experiences a beautiful environment. It was an amazing experience you need to try at least once. Can‚Äôt wait to come back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay. The best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. The setting is beyond belief for birding enthusiasts or anyone looking for a peaceful retreat. Gracious hospitality as well.
2023-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Nicholas was very responsive and helpful however there were multiple things we would like to mention. Firstly, there was construction material on the exterior of the location. I understand that things are being remodeled etc but it could‚Äôve been more kept. We were also sold on the fact that this was a get away and we assumed a private location however it is more of a community of buildings. There was an unpleasant smell of dirty water and old cologne that penetrated the rooms and remained in our luggage after we left. There was also noticeable grime/possible mold on the bathroom tiles. We were not able to connect to the internet and since it was a remote location, we did not have great communication via our cellular devices either. We feel it was slightly costly however despite all of these things, the space provides a unique experience that cannot be found anywhere else in the Valley."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely place to stay. Beautiful surroundings and extremely clean. The hosts were very friendly, lovely people and very helpful. I would highly recommend this place to stay. We will be going back."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed a beautiful peaceful staycation! The place was lovely and the nature, peacocks, ducks, birds, turtles, rabbit and other animals made it beautiful! The lake was scenic and the veggie garden was nice! Host was very accommodating. Only negative thing is to make sure you keep an eye out for mosquitoes. Other than that, the place went beyond my expectations. My family and I would love to visit again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved it, paired with a setup by charming picnics for a romantic valentines dinner and got engaged at this location!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Just simply an amazing oasis close enough but just far enough from civilization. Photographer‚Äôs and nature lover‚Äôs paradise! Will be back ASAP!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love this place. It is convenient to McAllen and local birding localities and a wonderful Resaca. Nicolas is very responsive and Lois and Isaac were very friendly and helpful. We felt almost like family. We would love to stay here again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Worth every penny. I read a bunch of reviews about the ‚Äúpeculiar nest‚Äù before booking, so I thought I knew what to expect. However what we found surpassed every one of my expectations! I was very satisfied with our stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This spot is fantastic. Gorgeous peaceful setting with spectacular birding right outside your door! Look for the beautiful green jay. :)
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peculiar Nest is a very beautiful and unique property. We go to the RGV to birdwatch. The location in McAllen is close to many of the places we want to see such as Bentson State Park and Estero Llano Grande State Park. Peculiar Nest is on a small lake called Lake Conception. One can see plenty of birds from the porch of the property. Nicholas is very responsive to questions. Issac and Lois are friendly and fun to talk to. I could not recommend this place more to folks seeking peace, quiet and birds."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing location, host is extremely helpful and will accommodate most requests. Very private and tranquil. Recommend to anyone"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for outdoor lovers.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is nice lots of different kind of birds. I went with my date she loved it.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"No overall complaints aside from the fact that there‚Äôs ongoing construction - ie some generator/welding machine noise, at 4-5p on a weekend is a bit annoying but it didn‚Äôt go too late or start too early.
Nicely appointed and very scenic. Fun to let the kid(s) run around and see some wildlife. Bugs - was windy enough to keep them at bay - but imagine at peak summer they‚Äôre rough at dawn or dusk.
Didn‚Äôt use the kitchen or the grille but they were available along with a large firepit. Comfy bed, nice pillows and linens. Would stay again for sure."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I cannot say enough about Peculiar Nest. I have now stayed in four of their rooms and loved each one. The hosts are exceptional not only extremely knowledgeable, friendly and helpful but they have become great friends. I cannot wait to stay again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place to stay we will be back!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Peculiar Nest is an ideal spot for birders and anyone who would enjoy a relaxing stay in a setting that is Walden-esque. During our December stay, we saw over 35 species of birds on the tranquil lakeside grounds. The hosts are welcoming and attentive; the cabin is clean and comfortable. The location works well for visiting local birding sites as well as restaurants and shopping. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Peculiar Nest."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,very nice
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our time here! ‚ù§Ô∏è

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything in the room was perfectly clean and in place. You almost never see hotel this clean!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what a lovely, peaceful setting! We really enjoyed the property, the view, and the owners. We are bird watchers and compiled quite a list of species on the property. We can't wait to return. We highly recommend any of the rooms at Peculiar Nest."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My favorite Air bnb of all time!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay in McAllen. Close to everything but it feels like you are in your own little paradise. Space was perfect for me during my visit, both inside and outside. Wish I had more time to relax by the lake. Thank you for everything."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nice spot for a stay. The wildlife around was a nice bonus. There were some minor hiccups, but host is very responsive and they were remedied quickly. Would definitely stay again."

We had a dinner with family and Nicolas‚Äôs mom set up the table outside so beautiful with flowers form her garden. The ambiance is so peaceful. I recommend this place to anyone just wanting a different environment from the McAllen or city life. Will come stay here again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,10/10. A perfect stay. The place was clean and had absolutely everything i needed. Inside the house was extremely cozy and comfortable and the outside was just straight up beautiful. Will come visit again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,great view for the area...felt like I was back in Hawaii with the palm trees and peacocks.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the Peculiar Nest so much! The bed was comfy and the location was quiet and cozy. Everything was lovely and clean. Nicholas was very responsive and helpful. The peacocks and setting were perfect for two birdwatchers!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve now stayed here twice and it has consistently been a wonderful, peaceful place to stay. The hosts are kind and inviting as well."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,It was really good. The view and the things inside in thr house were all good. My parents and I spent really good time. I'll stay this place later if I go to mcallen again
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best Airbnb in Texas!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow!! Best hidden spot in McAllen! A must stay spot.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you for the incredible experience. Your place was lovely and we can‚Äôt wait to visit again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying with Nicholas, although the first time was in a different space. After seeing this space, inside and out, my fianc√©e and I decided to get married there on the deck overlooking the lake. The space is beautiful and Nicholas‚Äô folks, who live on the property, are delightful and helpful! Thanks for making our wedding wonderful!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We fell in love w this place - will not hesitate to book again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful relaxing location. Adorable decor. Highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for a relaxing weekend.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was exactly as described in the listing. Truly a peaceful and relaxing place to get away for a few days.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the person who booked four rooms for a project workshop. Thanks to you, I was able to successfully finish the workshop, and the people who stayed with me gave me a great compliment about the room I booked. Thanks to you, I received a lot of compliments. In each room, we were able to talk a lot with a different theme decoration, and it was a wonderful place where the wonderful scenery with the lake, the trees that the host raised carefully, and everything was told the story. Thank you for helping to successfully complete our workshops in such a beautiful place."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed it so much, I‚Äôll be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best AirBnB‚Äôs I‚Äôve stayed at. The bed was so comfortable and it was so nice to be able to sleep late in a big and comfortable bed. The view from the back porch was amazing, we loved to sit out there on the hammock and just enjoy the nature and the view of the lake. They had peacocks roaming around and it was so nice to seem them just roaming around and enjoying everything too. They even gave us papayas! Will be very much enjoyed."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Ethereal @ Peculiar Nest was delightful. We were able to get away from the hustle and bustle, nestle down in this green oasis, and get some much needed rest and time for reflection. The on-site hosts, Isaac and Lois, are the best. So friendly and hospitable. We also 'visited' with several of the peacocks, had a long-distance friendship develop with an osprey that perched for hours each day on a lopped-off palm tree across the lake, and enjoyed the ducks flying overhead and settling in for a swim. So many beautiful moments during our stay. If you are looking for a quiet place to rest, reflect, and enjoy the beauty of a green oasis, this is the place for you!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Had an amazing night at this incredible location! Thank you so much! Excellent communication and such great scenery!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had the most beautiful experience! I was traveling alone, creating a commission art piece for a neighboring city, and used this place as my accommodation in the area. That was one of my smartest moves! instead of going to a generic hotel I got to go to this perfect hideaway, surrounded with nature and secluded from the urban mayhem. The place is immaculate and has much more than I needed. I would definitely come back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing!!! Loved every bit of it. Restful, comfortable and so peaceful!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful stay. And such a cozy cabin
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked an online meditation retreat and needed somewhere to stay during the retreat. This was kind of a random choice for me, but it turned out to be absolutely perfect! This was my little home away from home, where I silently mediated for 5 days. I didn‚Äôt leave the property once the entire time! The cabin is well stocked with essentials/amenities, the hosts are just lovely, and of course the garden oasis is just good for the soul. Lois gave me a garden tour and I enjoyed eating several foods from it. I‚Äôm not much of a birder, but I saw many different kinds. And of course the peacocks make for beautiful, hilarious companions during your stay. Highly, highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is a must-stay if you enjoy gardens and birds, or just want a peaceful setting in the middle of town. The property is very tropical, which makes it unique from staying in other places nearby. The home was very clean, modern, and comfortable. The host/concierge was very cordial and informative about the property and all that it offered. We highly recommend a visit to Ethereal@PeculiarNest."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place very therapeutic
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was lovelier than already displayed on the pictures, nice and quaint, very quiet and beautiful scenery. It was relaxing and will definitely book again üòá"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is our second stay at this location and it doesn‚Äôt disappoint. I highly recommend this home away from home. It‚Äôs perfect for a little getaway and relaxing. We will definitely stay again soon.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10 out of 10, lovely people, lovely space. We would come back in a heartbeat. Thank you!
If you don't like wildlife, don't come. :) Otherwise, the space is perfect."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is like taking a trip to the jungle. You are completely immersed in lush greenery, a large pond with plentiful beautiful birds and animals alike everywhere. This is a vacation within McAllen and i highly recommend you check this place out. It‚Äôs one of those gems you want to keep to your self.."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,I‚Äôve visited the valley Texas many times my parents actually had a house there. But this location is like a gem in the middle of the city only five minutes from Airport and it is spectacular gorgeous the hosts are so lovely as well. I would highly recommend it and return. If you‚Äôre looking for a place to decompress this it!!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Third visit to this Airbnb. Great accommodations. Close to delicious salsas. Organic produce. Birds. So many birds. I am excited for my next stay with this host.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a relaxing and lovely time at the Peculiar Nest - hosted by Nicolas, with his parents, Isaac and Lois as onsite groundskeepers. The cottage was cozy, the bed was super comfy and everything was extremely clean. As an ICU nurse, and superhosts ourselves, cleanliness is at the top of our requirement for any hotel or airbnb we stay in. The Peculiar Nest didn't disappoint. Lois brought us some fresh papaya to snack on and even gifted us a baby fig tree - after our conversation about gardening. I flew down to meet my husband and appreciated having shampoo, conditioner, body wash and even body lotion - so I din't have to pack a travel size or make a store run. Coffee assortments and teas were perfect. We are super appreciative and thankful. We will be back, next time we are in town for business or pleasure and can only hope it's available when we need it."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great experience and my family loved it!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A true oasis in the middle of the city. Very tranquil. Super clean and well maintained. We would book in a heartbeat again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is awesome! peacocks and lots of birds. the stay was wonderful!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our stay here was outstanding. Truly the best Airbnb experience yet, and we've been using Airbnb for years. As birders and wildlife enthusiasts who came from California to visit the local wildlife refuges, we found this Airbnb a perfect location and full of wildlife. It's very secluded for being in a developed area. We recorded more than 75 bird species, many being species we came here to observe. The property is very secure and we enjoyed breakfasts and dinners on the covered deck overlooking the lake. Issac was very welcoming and always available. We really enjoyed the papaya he shared with us. Our week at this Airbnb was a highlight of our trip. We definitely would recommend this Airbnb to anyone who wants to enjoy a beautiful place."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a truly amazing place! Issac greeted us when we arrived and gave us a tour of the cabin and the grounds, including freshly laid peacock eggs! We found a basket full of goodies on the kitchen table, and enjoyed many other amenities, including coffee and tea, which we especially enjoyed sipping on the deck each morning while watching the birds on the canal and enjoying the tropical surroundings. The cabin was very clean and comfortable, and we would return in a heartbeat if we are ever in McAllen again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient location to all RGV birding destinations!! Safe and calming atmosphere‚Ä¶host is exceptional!! Bed was perfect, kitchen is well equipped, porch facing water is very relaxing!! Roaming peacocks add to the perfect ambience. You will love this place!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,This property is simply paradise. It is the way that the Rio Grande valley is meant to be represented. It‚Äôs amazing how a property like this can completely change your impression of an entire region outside of it. Now when I think of Mcallen I think of something completely different and much more exotic than if I wouldn‚Äôt have discovered this gem. The owners put their heart and souls into it end it shines through the entire experience. They‚Äôve definitely perfected their hosting craft.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Accurately portrayed in the description. Great spot. Friendly host. Would definitely stay here again.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fianc√© and I were visiting for our wedding. We were a little disappointed to find out the hotel we met at was fully booked so we booked here. We were surprised on how beautiful the grounds were and turned out to be more enjoyable than our original plan. It‚Äôs super clean, comfortable bed, lovely views and great hospitality!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Our stay was absolutely wonderful and beyond our expectations. Very clean and perfectly stocked accommodations. The vegetable garden was a huge bonus and the hosts were superb. Our group of four was thrilled by the setting and loved watching all the birds right outside our doors. Great location to use as a base for visiting area parks and wildlife refuges. This was a fantastic and memorable experience.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were blown away with Ethereal. The setting on the lake with all of the birds and other wildlife is perfect. Sitting on the patio, you'd think you were miles from civilization, but anything you'd possibly need is only blocks away. The hosts were so friendly, with great advice on activities and dining options. We'll never stay elsewhere in the valley as long as this place is available!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perhaps the most interesting of my many AirBnB stays. The cottage was immaculate, and very well supplied. The hosts practice organic gardening throughput the property, and even encouraged us to pick some of the several varieties of lettuce grown in the garden adjacent to the cottage for our evening meal. The great variety of birds, including peacocks, were fun to watch. Will come back."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely stay, will be coming back!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful little place to get away (while not really leaving because kids were at grandmas üòÖ) and just enjoy a moment.
I would definitely go again to just enjoy the front patio overlooking the lake!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Issac and Lois were terrific hosts. So thoughtful and well-equipped! There was an HDMI cable for us in Ethereal should we have wanted to stream from our laptop to the TV. We loved being able to make a salad from the garden and the birds were just plentiful, varied and wonderful to watch. A very relaxing visit. We will be back."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay once again.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even more beautiful in person! We were blown away arriving at the property, greeted by beautiful birds and lush plants throughout. Our stay was peaceful, and felt like a true vacation getaway. The house was a cozy and a comfortable place to come home to after a day of hiking and birding. The hosts were gracious and accommodating, and even brought us a hot cooked meal when we arrived. My husband and I plan to return!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the place. It was very well set up for two people. Sitting outside watching the birds in the resaca while eating our meals was really great. This is a true oasis in the city. We enjoyed the garden tour (and garden produce) and the meal shared with us for lunar new year was amazing. We look forward to a return visit.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay at this beautiful place! The owners are kind and welcoming, and the property was beautiful! Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,These names for the rooms have intentionality in them. Ethereal became something meaningful to me after staying in this place. It is stellar!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I booked this place for my daughters wedding weekend. It was the perfect place to gather and take pictures. It was perfect!!!!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We spent ten quiet and relaxing days in early January. The hosts were innkeepers in the finest sense of the word. They have made the casita comfortable, and were responsive if we had questions.
We really enjoyed being in this natural venue. It was nice to sit or walk and watch birds. There were also two types of turtles and a watersnake in the lake. The bird list, including the entry road and brushy fields, for those ten days is below.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful little getaway spot. The location is just far enough away from ‚Äúthe city‚Äù that you feel like you‚Äôre not even in the valley. Can‚Äôt wait to go back.
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting! We couldn‚Äôt believe that we were in McAllen, TX. Loved sitting on the back porch and watching all of the birds.
The Airbnb is very charming. Nice touches inside the place. Communication with the hosts was excellent.
A few small things preventing me from giving five stars‚Ä¶ only two towels for a two-night stay, no sugar for the Keurig, no iron or ironing board. But other than that, the stay was amazing. Highly recommend!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is awesome! My wife and I spent one night here for out honeymoon and we didn't want to leave. I reserved the spot thinking that the pictures were too good to be true, but they accurately depicted the cleanliness, the nature, and the coziness of this little house. Nicolas even set up a display without being asked to help us celebrate our new marriage. 10/10 I highly recommend coming here. We will be back : )"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice and tranquil stay! I'm originally from the RGV, but no longer live there. We were in town visiting and decided to have a little escape from the holiday business. the location is a great hub to get access to all of the highlights of McAllen."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful. Tranquil. Peaceful. Perfect. Best Airbnb. Stay, ever. I will definitely be back soon. Thank you all for a wonderful and relaxing staycation. It was exactly what I needed."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great peaceful and relaxing escape
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the only time ever where the (great) look of the place on the AirBnB website did not do justice to the property, we could have stayed on the porch the whole time-highly recommend this one for anyone going to McAllan for bird watching (or just looking for a beautiful, relaxing place)"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Upon entering the Peculiar nest we were greeted and immediately shown around to be familiar where things were located. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. We were given a private tour on the many plants and beautiful garden that‚Äôs in the property. We were lucky to feed the peacocks that roam around the property even though they were a little shy. This place is truly breathtaking and I‚Äôm so glad they opened their home or should I say, their magical paradise and made our engagement extra special and memorable. Until next time Peculiar Nest."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A really relaxing and calm place to stay. Highly, highly recommend"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous Retreat!
We rented this house as a home base for our first birding vacation in South Texas and we were blown away. The house is conveniently located to the NWR, State Parks and other birding locations on our list.
The hosts were very friendly and the location is amazing! Who doesn't want to see Pelicans, Herons and Whistling ducks off their front porch!
We'll be back!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is quiet, relaxing and lovely.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is an absolute dream. I had breakfast with peacocks, spent my day reading in the hammock and soaking sun at the dock. The host provides everything you could need for a perfect staycation, including home comforts like kitchenware and tableware. Everything is extremely clean. The bed is super comfortable. Will definitely be staying here again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,I would definitely recommend staying here. A nature oasis in the middle of McAllen. The love and dedication the owner put toward creating a beautiful place to visit is seen at every turn. He's respect and appreciation for his land and the animals that depend on it is an inspiration.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,An absolutely beautiful home. A lovely romantic getaway. Check in was a breeze very communicative home owner.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to chill andone relax in McAllen. Went to have dental work done in Mexico and it was wonderful to come back to this every night. I could stay there forever watching all the birds and observing the lovely grounds! highly recommend
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cool place to stay and visit. You'll get to experience nature while being in the city. The room is clean and private, wonderful place to relax and recharge.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful return visit for me- an absolutely incredible place perfect for nature lovers! There are so many special touches and you can spend hours simply enjoying the beautiful surroundings ‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt miss this ( especially if you love birds )!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Totally recommend!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This lovely accommodation is located in a beautiful and secluded garden spot on the water. Surrounded by flowers and birdsong, everything you need for a comfortable relaxing stay is provided. Close to McAllen but feels a world away. The personable and friendly hosts live on site, providing help if needed, but give you as much privacy as you desire; I enjoyed visiting with them. In addition, they were also quite prompt in communication. Can highly recommend!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"An all around great stay! Incredible views, beautiful birds, and a very comfy living area."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed five nights and it was a perfect and delightful stay. The suite was extremely comfortable, spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. Everything we could need was provided. The private porch overlooked the lake and we spent hours sitting and watching the birds on the lake as well as conversing with the resident peacocks. It felt like a resort more than a room. Completely delightful."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Me and my girlfriend had an absolutely great stay! Thankyou so much

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great experience by the lake.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautiful!! Completely unexpected for McCallen. The wildlife was amazing but didn‚Äôt bother you when you were in the cabin or outside. Nicolas was an excellent host and would definitely recommend this place to others. Will return myself!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre thinking about selecting this location for your stay don‚Äôt second guess yourself, just do it! This bed is something else, you‚Äôll surely miss it. The place is clean and has everything you might need for your stay. (Obviously you do have to bring your own food) The cabin was a dream. The place is filled with life anywhere you see from the peacocks roaming the garden, the lizards and butterflies all through out the home lastly the fruit and vegetables planted. I would really like to thank the homeowners and nick for allowing us to be apart of their home and letting us appreciate their garden. On one of our nights we harvested from the garden the beets and green chard to make a beet and green chard salad (chefs kiss) Nick was quick to respond to any questions we had throughout the stay and both him and his parents encouraged us to appreciate all the home has to offer. They are currently working on restoring one of their rooms and the workers are also very kind and informative about the property and animals around. I did not see any snakes, we had no issue with insects inside the cabin but if we were to see one or two it wouldn‚Äôt be something out of the ordinary as it being the home has a lot of life. I had forgotten my yoga mat back at home and the second I mentioned it nicks mom provided me with one.We will surely return back in Spring. Thank you. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"

Storms had come through the area a few days before we arrived, and we could tell they had done their very best to get the place ready for us when we got there. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely book it again. Loved the game closet, it provided many memories for our family!
The backyard does back up to a pretty busy road. The yard is completely fenced in, but the traffic noise was noticeable. If you are used to being in the city, it is unlikely you would even notice it. But, we aren't used to that much traffic, so I used my sound machine at night to block the noise of loud trucks.

And I would throw out the trash daily throw away my cats litters. Me and my husband did a good job at cleaning. Anything we do didn't clean was due because we ran out of time.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"By far the best AirBnB experience ever! I‚Äôve stayed in many airbnbs and this was the very best by a landslide. Damaris doesn‚Äôt just provide you with basic necessities but so many ‚Äúextra mile/above and beyond‚Äù goodies. Like, I couldn‚Äôt believe how many items were available to us if needed. It didn‚Äôt feel like an air bnb, it felt like my own home and I cannot wait to return. It‚Äôs a street away from my parents and now I want to visit every week. Ha. I even recommended to them for mini staycations. My husband and I own construction companies and I can assure you, lots of effort and love went into creating this mini home. I literally cannot wait to rebook, I‚Äôm already etching my own ideas for our home for when family come to visit or I just want to hide away haha. So many Airbnb hosts just buy and provide the bare minimum to have an Airbnb and provide people with somewhere to lay their head, but this place, oh man, so much pride went into every aspect of this place!! Thank you!"

This is a very clean, peaceful, and private Airbnb that is very well stocked with cookware and essentials. While there is no central air, the two wall units work very well & kept the place cool. It is in a quiet & residential neighborhood. I appreciated the use of the outdoor patio space to relax and drink my coffee in the morning. The location is also conveniently located to both Edinburg and McAllen as it is in North McAllen. (Know that if you have any mobility limitations the stairs to the upstairs bedroom are steep. I had no problem with this but putting this in my review in case you are considering this Airbnb and you for in this category.). Finally, Damaris was a gracious, considerate, and communicative host!"

What an absolute treat!
And Damaris herself is an absolute JOY to communicate with. She responds within the hour, is so accommodating to anything her guest might need, and is just a delight of a host.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a beautiful apt. The place should be featured in a magazine. Damaris didn't miss a detail in offering an upsale Airbnb stay. If you are able to book this place you are lucky because I have a feeling this place will stay booked. Check it out.

It may have been a tiny home but the functionality and design made this feel like a big home at heart. It met all of our needs and then some. It‚Äôs a perfect family home for two.
Some of our favorites would include; the king size bed which is like a cloud. I had some of my most restful and deep sleeps here. - The kitchen is absolutely beautiful. And the sleeper sectional is perfect for movie nights.
-The dining room table is perfect for two and serves as a great desk as too!
-All the windows & blinds are so beautiful, with all of the natural light coming in makes this place peaceful and happy. -I love the stackable washers and dryers. It‚Äôs honestly the perfect stay that has everything you may need. I could go on and on because I really enjoyed my stay here but morale of the story; ITS A MUST RENT."

We thought that was a great touch. We also notice the home smelled great!! And was very clean! Beds were super comfortable and It felt real cozy. By far, this was one of the best Airbnb's we've stayed at. The only issue we really experienced was, during the hottest part of the day, the AC wouldn't go below 75 degrees. But to us, it was still a comfortable temp. Laura an Mike were really great at communication, which is a big plus when renting an Airbnb. Responses to any questions or concerns were within in minutes. Just an overall fantastic stay. We'll definitely be staying here again in the future!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Laura‚Äôs place was amazing! Everything was top of the line and surpassed what I was expecting. Very nice place to stay and Laura was amazing to say the least.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Laura and Mikes Airbnb was immaculate. They made it feel so homie and comfortable. They had aroma therapy going and ambiance music going for my check in.

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed at Mike and Laura‚Äôs to attend a graduation at the Bert Ogden Arena. From the minute we walked in to the minute we left, we felt right at home!
Laura sent us clear directions and instructions on how to enter the Airbnb. When we walked in, I was immediately impressed! The condo smelled great, the lamps were left on for us and everything was immaculate. It looked exactly like the pictures!
The first thing I always do is check the master bedroom and bathroom and again it was exactly as described, and the bed is sooooo comfortable with the pillows! You can tell them they have put money and effort into maintaining a nice condo for the guests! They gave complimentary shampoo, conditioner, body wash and a face mask, which felt great after a long day outside!
If and when we go back to the area, we hope to stay at Mike and Laura‚Äôs again! The hosts are wonderful and responsive! Thank y‚Äôall for helping us feel right at home!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay for my quick work trip.
Will be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We echo everything else that previous guests have mentioned. This was 5 stars all the way!Our comments below are simply personal preference.
We have stayed many times in Pharr and this unit was by far the nicest, cleanest, and safest feeling that we have experienced. Most condo communities can have quite a bit of late night noise on the weekends and this was absolutely quiet at all times.
The private enclosed patio was nice but a lounge chairs would increase comfort for outdoor relaxing and reading. A gas grill would be a plus.
The two large smart tv's are very nice for streaming so we didn't need to bring along our ROKU. Unforunately there is no cable or antenna tv so we were not able to get local news stations, etc. which was fine for a short term stay but would really be missed for a longer term.
Be aware that there is no garbage disposal or dishwasher, which again, was no big deal for a short term stay but would be for us if we were to stay for 2-3 month.
Beautiful unit!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Your house is so peaceful and beautiful. Always clean and you guys are awesome hosts!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely beautiful, it looked exactly like the pictures and everything was so clean and neat. The place includes all the utensils and amenities you may need and there were also so many free snacks that the hosts left for us, which meant so much. The beds were extremely comfortable to sleep in and the rooms are very spacious. There are so many restaurants/stores and things to do around the area so you will never run out of things to do. There is a lot of privacy since you enter the apartment complex and inside the apartment as well. It was a beautiful place to stay and I am looking forward to my next business trip to come back here. The hosts were extremely attentive and so friendly. Thank you Laura and Mike !"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful Air Bnb! The value you get for the price is unmatched üôåüèº!! The house was so clean and the bed was sooo comfy!! The nice big TVs made it fun for a movie night, and then the whole house smelled like heaven because she had awesome diffusers in there!

Description is accurate, but the actual experience is far from what is described. All is so clean, in order and comfortable that we wanted to stay longer. And last, after departure we were advised that some valuable item was left behind. We appreciated so much them offering ways on how to get it back. 5 stars!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Laura's and Mike's place was excellent! It was the highlight of our trip. Everything was neat, the beds were really comfy and overall, the place was so lovely.

Congratulations to hosts on such a beautiful place ü´∂"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"I love the modern,cozy, cleanliness and spaces . Very airy place for all three very spacious bedrooms. Enough pillows and quilt , soft and comfortable mattresses The very modern furnished. Absolutely cleaned feeling. Including kitchen, bathrooms, and showers. Great wifi and lots of connected appliances at the same time no problem. I love the labeling of each drawer and cabinet in the kitchen, it has all the necessary utensils and appliances, little details such as chocolates and muffins. We were able to watch the world final on TV without any problems.
It has many beautiful decorative details. Amazing stay for short medium and long term. Very cozy I would definitely come back. Air conditioning working perfectly. Quiet, no noise-free place.
You feel safe since you entered the subdivision once you've accessed the security code. Signposted and covered parking spaces.
Great hosts"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved my stay. One of the cleanest and coziest home I‚Äôve stayed at.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It is the best Airbnb we have been but by far, it far exceeded our expectations, I highly recommend it."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow- spectacular place! We were 2 adults and a toddler for the weekend. Beautiful serene place with peacocks just walking around! Also a neighbor has animals you can go look at. Capybara, goats, pigs, llamas and chickens that we saw. So cute!! The view out from our air conditioned kitchen was amazing (as it happened To be very hot during our stay. ) But lots of shaded areas and beautiful gardens to peruse. Friendly host family- even offered a high chair! It was a stay-cation for us and loved that it‚Äôs still in town but didn‚Äôt feel that way at all! We visited the mall one night for dinner and got pizza the next. Filtered water available was a huge unexpected plus. Beds comfy, had everything we needed in the kitchen to cook. We‚Äôll be back for sure and even talked about renting the space for an event in the future!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Always a pleasure! Gets better everytime! Ty
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peculiar Nest (Dreamy) was a great base camp for birding the Rio Grande Valley. Beautiful, peaceful surroundings and very close to Bensten Rio Gand Valley SP, National Butterfly Center, Anzalduas Park, and Santa Ana NWR."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We love staying here when we travel to visit family in the Rio Grande Valley. This was our 2nd time year and it is always a wonderful stay. Our twin 3-year olds love to be outside and love animals, so they get a lot of enjoyment out of our visits, and we love the peaceful atmosphere that really emphasizes everything about the natural beauty of the valley."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything at Peculiar Nest was a perfect fit for a couple, visiting the area to enjoy some birding. The outdoor decks and seating areas were great spaces to relax or see some birds on the property. The common area had extra snacks in case we forgot to bring something but Dreamy has everything we needed. The resident peafowl and Muscovy ducks were charming (and talkative). Isaac was very friendly, kind and took great pride in his gardens. It was a little oasis in Texas and we would come back and stay there again in a second."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic wonderful place to stay. Birds all over the place. Quiet serene and nicely priced. Had wonderful long weekend birding in McAllen.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peculiar Nest is a dream for birders visiting the RGV! Gorgeous multi-level decks overlook a beautiful resaca full of herons, egrets, ducks, cormorants and more. I stayed in Dreamy and it was lovely and comfortable, and with a full kitchen and laundry is great for a longer stay. Location is super convenient to Bentsen State Park and National Butterfly Center, Santa Ana, and Edinburgh wetlands. About an hour and a half of easy driving to South Padre Island, totally worth it. Easily driveable to other RGV birding destinations.
The hosts were warm and lovely and provided plenty of local recommendations. And the peacocks are a delight! Excellent stay, hope to return!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love coming here. This was our second time and it was even better than the first time. It‚Äôs beautiful and they sure know how to make you feel at home!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A stellar location for a birder like me! Each morning my husband and I looked out over the resaca/waterway and viewed Great Egrets and cormorants taking off from their roosting areas on the property. The sky lit up behind the tall palm trees. Many wintering ducks, herons, ibises, American Pelicans, and even a Roseate Spoonbill make this stretch of the resaca their home base. Additionally, the property is located mid-valley in the Lower Rio Grande Valley so you are relatively close to many of the great birding refuges and parks, especially Bentsen.
Our hosts, Isaac and Lois, were more than accommodating, going the extra mile to make us feel at home. As vacation rental hosts ourselves, we recognize a great property when when we come across it. And this is one!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicolas' home is one of my favs while visiting South Texas. The housing is always clean and neat and the surroundings are just breathtaking. An awesome place to stay. Perfect home away from home.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for those wanting peace away from the busy city life!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It really was a unique and amazing experience, it was our first experience on an Airbnb and it was fantastic! They treat you like family! We will be back soon!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèºüôåüèº the intention was to find a quiet place to write my new book and this place was definitely deeply inspired and motivated! Thanks to Isaac and Louis for your heart and making us feel like we're part of the family! Shalom üôèüèº"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Peculiar Nest compound is truly a wonderful spot, especially for those who appreciate birds. The family are great hosts and really went above and beyond. We stayed in two different rooms/cabins (Ethereal and Dreamy) and although we liked this one, our preference was Ethereal, which has a bigger/more convenient bathroom and better wifi in addition to some more obvious advantages (e.g., a private patio). Nonetheless, both are great options."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing time at dreamy peculiar nest.
It was spacious and airy with a very nice view.
The grounds are really beautiful and peaceful. I relaxed upon arrival.
My parents and family loved it as well."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love staying there.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pleasant visit with Lois & Isaac. Always available to help & make suggestions. Accommodation was a comfortable place away from home. Enjoyed viewing the local water fowl, especially the White Pelicans as they herded together to fish."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have stayed 3 times because I love everything was excellent, I highly recommend"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay in Dreamy was amazing!
The hosts were incredibly kind, the property was stunning, and the birds were innumerable. We brought our six year old along, and she never wanted to leave. Ms. Lois brought her sidewalk chalk and blankets when it got chilly, and Mr. Isaac brought her on a tour to see the wildlife on the property. The hosts even welcomed us to their Thanksgiving feast! It is a perfect place with wonderful people!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed unit and it's contemporary flair. We came for the birds and view and got them, although it rained the whole time for our visit."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, beautiful sunrises, and very comfy furnishings. A great place for nature lovers to base out of for an RGV stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is THE place to stay when in McAllen. Centrally located just blocks from the highway and convention center, but it feels secluded and peaceful. The sunrise and sunset on the lake is incredible. You don‚Äôt need to go to the World Birding Center to see popular RGV birds - they are all right outside the door of this airBnb! The furnishings were stylish and very clean, with quality linens and towels. The beds were comfy too!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is magical and such an escape for such an incredible price. We loved our stay and all the wildlife that came to visit!! Highly recommend.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,wonderful place to connect with nature and clean space. it was wonderful seeing the peacocks and hummingbirds. family had a great time with many options for board games.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very nice place, very private and full of nature and beautiful animals, very highly recommended. They took care of the best and offered more beautiful details in our stay. Very kindly the owner explained the fauna and nature that there is on the property and its excellent views of the river. On this occasion we were shopping and didn't enjoy it as much on the day but we plan to go again to just enjoy the accommodation and its amenities more."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was clean and beautiful setting by lake. Hosts were helpful with areas to visit/interest. Will visit again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Third unit I‚Äôve stayed at on the premises. As usual did not disappoint.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is BEAUTIFUL! The lake and all the wildlife was great to wake up to each morning. The place itself was very clean and had everything we needed. Nicolas was very responsive, kind, and worked with us on our checkout time. My favorite part of the experience was all the peacocks outside our door. Highly recommend and we definitely will be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for three weeks while working in the area. This is a peaceful retreat to come home too. The owners are helpful and also respect your privacy. I will stay here next time I work in this area, and I highly recommend you try it out too."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always one of my favorite places to stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location and property are absolutely beautiful. It's extremely tranquil to sit by the lake and enjoy the scenery. The family that runs this place are super friendly and nice also. We will definitely be back.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I never knew McAllen had such a sanctuary place as this one. It‚Äôs a perfect location for those looking to get away from the constant town noise. It‚Äôs also a great place to study and meditate. Looking forward to staying here again.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Had a nice stay and it was what I was looking for. Wish they had cable tv so I'll probably bring my firestick next time. Wifi worked great. Very nice people that own this hidden away place. Will be staying again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was amazing! So beautiful, so peaceful. Can‚Äôt wait to book again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was Beautiful. Photos don‚Äôt do it justice!!!!!! If you are looking for a one of a kind stay this is it!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed this stay. It was an absolutely beautiful location to propose to my fianc√©e. We didn't get out much due to the record breaking heat in Texas. The only thing we would have preferred is for a smart TV or streaming stick to be in the room. Luckily we brought a laptop and they already had an hdmi cable in the TV. Lovely place. We hope to return.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was only here for a night, but I loved every second of it. It was peaceful, private, and easy to find. I love the size of the kitchen/living space, and the morning view was stunning."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was an incredible place to stay and for someone who prefers to be surrounded by nature, this is the place to stay in the Rio Grande Valley! The property owners were onsite and available/quick to respond. They made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived, giving us a full tour of the entire property. It's a 5 minute drive to lots of restaurants, Oval Park, the cinema and huge indoor mall. While this property is in the city of McAllen, it is peaceful and tucked away and felt like a tropical paradise. The resident Peacocks were eager to greet us each morning and we really enjoyed being able to watch the sunrise and all the various birds and waterfowl right from the deck."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Interesting place
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I spent a long weekend at Dreamy@PeculiarNest to go birding at the local state parks. We had a terrific stay. The place was as pictured, very clean, comfortable beds and stocked with all the basics and then some. The hosts are very welcoming and even gave us a tour of the property and gardens when we arrived. The cucumbers and papaya that Lois gave us were delicious! The property is peaceful, charming and we look forward to visiting again in the future. We got a real kick out the peacocks that roam the property, too. We truly enjoyed our stay. Thank you so much."

Everything is very nice, the place where we had to stay was spotless, everything in very good condition, the quietest thing in the world, if you are looking to disconnect for a few days or just expand your mind, this is the perfect place. We loved everything, and we would definitely come back. ‚ú®"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband, my 7 year old daughter and I absolutely loved our stay at the Peculiar Nest. The place was decorated beautifully and it was just a
Perfect thoughtful layout. The linens, towels and accessories were all perfect. The property is so peaceful! We absolutely loved the nature, peacocks and other birds. I do hope to return for some down time in the future."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful and peaceful setting. I loved everything. I will be back. There‚Äôs no reason to stay anywhere else.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a tranquil place to stay! We had the Dreamy rental at Peculiar Nest and it went well beyond my expectations. It looked just like the photos and we had everything we needed including a choice in coffeemakers (both a Keurig and French press). Nicholas responded almost immediately to a couple of questions; his parents were on site to greet us and were very friendly throughout our stay, especially if we wanted to chat. We needed a replacement for the filtered water and they took care of it quickly while we were gone. This is the perfect place for anyone interested in birding - there is much to see right there on the lake and it is about 20 minutes to several local hotspots as well as a little over an hour to South Padre Island. I will hope to stay there again someday soon."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent place, warm people, friendly people, a very nice view and lots of tranquility in conjunction with nature and animals."

We also very much appreciated the warmth and friendliness of the hosts, and their local restaurant recommendations (Analiz Taqueria and Salome on Main were each extraordinary in their own ways)."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,I was in town for one night on business so my family and I stayed here. It was beyond our expectations! It was quiet and serene. The room was gorgeous. Ours allowed for the doors to open up to outside so we had breakfast while overlooking the sunset on the lake. It was also fascinating to be greeted by peacocks! Such a unique and wonderful experience! I definitely wish we had longer than a day to enjoy the place but we look forward to our next stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We thoroughly enjoyed visiting with Nicolas‚Äôs parents, Lois and Isaac, about their dreams for further enhancing the property and about permaculture and their endeavors in that regard. The bird life was amazing on the lake and we loved the peacock family.
And our apartment was so lovely- the design, the bed was extremely comfortable., and the kitchen is perfect for preparing your own meals. We would certainly stay with them again. This is a great place for wildlife enthusiasts and it is very close to several different birding centers including Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley World Birding Center. Plus it‚Äôs only 7 minutes from the airport!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was peaceful, comfortable and clean; tastefully put together. Having a full kitchen was nice. They have filtered water!

Being a former building contractor from the San Francisco Bay Area, the father of the family and I geeked for hours over the construction of new platforms and tree houses going up in the back.
I just found my new favorite go to place in Texas when I‚Äôm on my way to M√©xico through Mcallen!!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A friend and I were on a 5 day birding trip to the Rio Grande Valley. Peculiar Nest was a perfect location to access all our target areas and return to a beautiful, peaceful setting with MORE BIRDS!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay. A unique, beautiful setting with gardens, a small lake and birds. But still in the city and very accessible to surrounding amenities. The place is very modern, stylish, and clean with comfortable memory foam mattresses and peacocks!"

My kids love the peacocks and wildlife. I forage in the yard for wild and cultivated foods. And I really enjoy the hosts and their kindness. I really like how they introduce me to new ingredients and how to cook them.
I also LOVE how I can send my young boys outside to explore in the yard and have peace of mind that they are safe and making new discoveries. Worth every penny!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, relaxing place to stay! Highly recommend."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, very nice apartment. It's worth the place. The place, the lake and the excellent facilities. The apartment is very clean and nice.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property is absolutely amazing! from the peacocks roaming to the egrets wintering on the water, everyday we saw a new species of bird or butterfly.

They have dozens of papaya trees on the property and the morning we were leaving, there was a sack of 3 papayas on our outdoor table. Very thoughtful! If you like to bird watch, we saw dozens of species on the small lake, just steps from the front door. Plan on spending sunrise and sunset on the dock. It is a water bird byway."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Peculiar Nest was relaxing, tranquil and just what we needed on our pilgrimage to San Juan church. Our hosts especially made the trip comfortable, but allowed us the space and privacy to enjoy our stay. This place is a hidden sanctuary and spending this time with my Mom and Sister was a memory I will always carry in my heart. The peacocks were up close and beautiful. Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better. ‚Äî Albert Einstein could not have stated it better, and I highly recommend Peculiar Nest."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved this Airbnb! The place was nice and clean and had so much to offer, everyone was friendly and well mannered. We didn't get to fish sadly, but the lake was beautiful"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Peculiar Nest is a beautiful little secluded lake house with simple, modern decor and breathtaking views.

Excellent customer service. Will come back just to stay here again for sure. Loved the vibes and how at home I felt throughout my stay. Most comforting and welcoming Airbnb I have ever been to."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can't find a more peaceful, unexpectedly natural and refreshing spot in McAllen. I have only stayed in Dreamy B, the 1 - bedroom with a kitchen. It is clean, quiet, and the view is so refreshing to the soul. I always enjoy seeing the wildlife, along with the gorgeous sunrises and sunsets. I slept perfectly, too."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The only place I‚Äôll stay in McAllen. Would move permanently in a heartbeat!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another amazing stay. I was so tired and feeling a little sick‚Ä¶.this place helped me rest because of the coziness and quiet serene environment. Next day I felt refreshed and ready to take on the world again. Thank you to the host for coming out to see if needed anything. Also, I left my blue tooth keyboard during a previous visit and it was there waiting for me on the table. Host came out to make sure I knew it was in there.
Thank you and for sure see you soon."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, nice, conveniently located, it has all the amenities."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. Really enjoyed my stay. I came down to get my global entry and and was able to see some cool birds in the meantime. Nice little weekend trip.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Truly a hidden gem. Lush gardens, wildlife, birds, so many birds. The accommodations were gorgeous, clean, cozy, minimalist but wonderful. The on site concierge was extremely friendly and showed us around. Everything was great, we would definitely stay again.."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful paradise so close to the city! We absolutely loved our stay.

The view and beautiful birds were a bonus, loved being greeted by the peacocks when we arrived."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Simply a very peaceful and restful experience . This place is within the hustle and bustle of McAllen but once in there, you only feel the serenity of the place. When doing business or visiting family or friends‚Ä¶why would you stay at some of those sterile hotels when this place will and can help you relax. Had my cup of coffee early in the morning, caught up on my business and left plenty of time to spend with my love one. Mr. Issac, father of Nicolas was just a pleasure to speak with. Very accommodating. Someone staying there even got married outside on the lawn, that‚Äôs how accommodating this folks are.
Thank you Nicholas and Mr. Isaac. I certainly will be back and recommend to my friends."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A gem in hiding here. Best in the valley
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is one of the very ""rare"" places that had comfy beds and pillows. May I add if you like firm bed, firm but very comfortable which doesn't make your back hurt the next morning.
We stayed in Dreamy B which had a full size kitchen, perfect to cook breakfast (or other meals) as they're equipped with everything you need.
The ground is very serene and lovely. The peacocks are beautiful and friendly.
The hosts are amazing and kind, showed me around and even shared papayas. They're very passionate about gardening and it's obvious that they love what they do.
We drove 5.5 hours from SE Houston and this place is certainly worth that drive. Highly recommended."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice clean. Beautiful lake view.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent stay! They provided shampoo, conditioner(good stuff too) , towels, filtered water, kitchenware, board games, smart TV, coffee, and some really good tea üçµ. We were unaware of whether or not we could just roam around the property thinking we would overstep on someone else's stay, but nobody complained. Definitely be going back to choose a different room next time."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice place, friendly hosts."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Come for the birds and stay for the gas grill üî•‚ô®Ô∏è
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed in Dreamy and it was an excellent decision. Hosts have thought very well about how to please the needs that one can have. They take care of the details. The apartment is decorated very harmoniously. There is everything you need for cooking and if you want to do laundry it is an appropriate place.
A super plus is that the apartment is around a lake and a very well-kept and beautiful green area. The host had a great service to us... she gave us papayas grown by herself. This is a highly recommended place."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place always goes beyond expectations. A must visit for the RGV. Hidden Gem!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing experience....look foward to booking again‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where to begin? This is a beautiful space, inside and out! I stayed in room B, but was showed all the other rooms on a tour and they‚Äôre all beautiful, although A and B are the most spacious. My room was beautifully and thoughtful appointed, and had a full kitchen, and washer and dryer. The grounds are beautiful and the view of the resaca is beautiful any time of day. If you‚Äôre a birder, there‚Äôs plenty of birding right out your door. The owners are on-site and are delightful! The manager is remote, but very responsive. Overall, a wonderful experience and I‚Äôll be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is extremely relaxing! The on-site residents make you feel like family! Such a wonderful place to unplug from our hectic lives!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mom loved your place. She woke up early each morning and watched the birds. We enjoyed watching the little peacocks with their mom. The apartment was immaculate! The beds were comfortable! You thought of everything in the room! Filtered water, coffee maker, dishes, nightlight, reading lights on the bedside tables. My mom thought the sink in the bathroom was cute! She‚Äôd like to stay with you again if we return to McAllen!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazingly amazing. I used this for a photoshoot and let me tell you. It‚Äôs everything I needed and more. Such a beautiful, relaxing place and best of all, it photographs extremely well. I would use this again in a heart beat. It literally is the treasure box down the border. Amazing!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Checking in was very simple, and the host was easy to reach.. The room and atmosphere was just as amazing as the photos! Other hosts on the property made sure everything went smoothly during our stay. Great place, would come back again!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best place in the RGV Texas, you have to visit!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We will never stay anywhere else when we visit our family in Mission! This little gem of an Airbnb is now our go-to... The view and birdwatching was wonderful. We loved the family feel of the property.
It has everything we needed as a family to be comfortable. We will be back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was supposed to be a basic weekend getaway, but there is nothing ‚Äúbasic‚Äù about this place. First of all, this property is waterfront with amazing views! Secondly, you will be in the company of a number of beautiful peacocks walking around. Thirdly, the gardens are full of fruits and vegetables that you are welcome to taste‚Ä¶ but most importantly, the hosts are some of the most wonderful people we have ever met!!!
You will make memories!!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very aesthetically pleasing. My friends and I got to really relax and live in the moment. Overall we had a great time and I absolutely loved it.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful and peaceful place to stay!
I was in love with the place. The owners were so nice to us, they even shared with us some fruits and veggies that they harvest in their own garden! Definitely coming soon! ‚ú®"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful and relaxing apartment, the view from the room is breathtaking, it‚Äôs close to the main stores and coffee shops. Host were very welcoming. Definitely staying there again : )"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicolas' home is so beautiful and I had a very peaceful time. I would recommend this space to everyone!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very suitable for birders (which we are), the lake has good water bird habitat and there are a fair number of native land birds in the spring. Issac is a great host and we very much liked the relaxed atmosphere (and the ripe papayas). We will return."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and great place to stay at!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing and magical. That a place this beautiful could exist in downtown McAllen texas was incredible. The birds and nature are spectacular. Even the wild bunny munching on our lawn seemed friendly and relaxed when I blundered out the door. So peaceful. Nicolas‚Äô family have built a small paradise with peacocks, fresh veggies in the garden and papayas hanging off trees everywhere. A big hank you to them all."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful hidden gem right in the heart of McAllen. My husband and I stayed here with our twin boys who were 14 months old at the time while we were visiting family in Mission. The location is an oasis for nature lovers - just in the space of one morning we spotted a number of egrets, herons, tanagers, several Great Kiskadees, finches, cormorants, hummingbirds, rabbits, lizards, plus the resident peacocks and peahens. The space is well appointed and the hosts are awesome - we left with some green papaya and we will definitely stay here again when we visit family in the Valley."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A perfect place to spend a week while bird watching in the area. Everything in the unit is new and clean.
The hosts are lovely and provided a tour of the garden. They are very quick to respond and provide a wonderful, quiet place to relax."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such an amazing Airbnb we live in the valley but the location felt like as if you were an a whole different environment! I definitely recommend it!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent property and experience !! So
glad we picked this property for our
recent Rio Grande Valley Birding trip. It
was just as described. Truly was a pleasant
surprise to meet and get to know the
owners. The surroundings were so great
that we could not leave for our planned
dinner reservations on the first night. We
are planning our next stay this upcoming
Fall."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing little oasis. Hard to believe this is so close to town. Sitting by the lake listening to the birds was just the break we needed from the hustle of everyday life. Great hosts and spotless living space
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome place to stay. Will definitely be back. The host were super attentive throughout the entire stay. The place is better than advertised, clean, equipped and with a beautiful decor."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was exactly what I needed! I love everything about this place. It is a vacation spot that feels like home. The Kim's made the trip for us. They not only taught us about the area and the careful science of gardening in the Valley but they took time to visit and share their amazing life with us. Their knowledge about food and birds as well as just the wisdom of how to nurture your soul is absolutely priceless.
The accommodations are breathtaking: simple and eloquent. I have lived in the Valley most of my life. It was wonderful to see the beauty of my home without the growing hustle and bustle. I was transported back to my childhood living near the Arroyo. Sitting outside whether it be on the porch or the deck or on the pier surrounded by the beauty that ignites all senses, made me fall in love with where I live once again.
If you want to know the Rio Grande Valley and truly find peace, I highly recommend this stay. I am an avid Air BnB visitor (have been using Air BnB for over 3 years now) and this stay tops them all. So much so, we will be visiting again in two weeks!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is ECO-heaven! We had a marvelous stay, we traveled in southern Texas for a week and wished we booked more of our stay here. We came on a birding trip and it was the highlight of our week. The birds were breath-taking. Speaking as a fellow guesthouse owner and operator, accommodations were absolutely perfect. Modern, well- thought out decor. Clean, I mean, 5-star clean! (Passed my barefoot test!) The hosts are beyond lovely. Personable and attentive. Issac made a bonfire for us on our last night. They shared their amazing garden with us. We felt like part of their family and without a doubt will return next trip we take! Thank you, Issac and Lois."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"If utter relaxation is what you are looking for, this is your spot. We came to the RG Valley for the butterflies and the birds and found this location is centered perfectly. Easy navigation to all the RGV offers; The Butterfly Center, Bentsen-RGV State Park, Santa Ana NWR, shrimp tacos. After a day of exploring the area, we looked forward to returning to our ""nest"" to take in the beauty just outside our front door. Our room was bright and clean, and it was clear that much care was put in to the design and amenities. 10 stars for Nicolas!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our second stay at Peculiar Nest was amazing as always. This is the perfect place for birders or, like me, people looking for a peaceful escape from the big city."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host! very hospitable
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a unique little place. Nicholas‚Äô parents who care for the place were very sweet and welcoming.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Without question, this is one of the best Airbnb's we've ever stayed at, and we've been to more than 60 in a dozen different countries. The place itself is excellent - comfortable beds, great amenities, outstanding hosts - but the location is beyond compare, especially for anyone interested in birds. We came to the Valley for birding and ended up seeing more than 125 different species in a couple weeks, but more than 50 of those were right out the back door on the lake. Spectacular sunsets and awesome wildlife makes the place the ultimate destination for anyone staying in the Valley."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful in all aspects for our 3 member family. Interior only outdone by amazing front window views in front yard. Would be on every birders checklist in the TRG McAllen area. Location easy for a lot of the bird locations near McAllen. An amazing location to enjoy by itself or to base activities for multiple days
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The hosts were very nice and welcoming. Since it was cold out they even got a fire going and asked us to join! All the birds and other animals really liven the mood, allowing for nice outdoor time. The suites, were very clean and had lots of different amenities, which came in handy. Very happy with our experience, and may book in the future!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here. It felt so peaceful outside that you can‚Äôt even really tell you‚Äôre in a town/neighborhood. We enjoyed watching the sunset, and the next morning we got to see so much wildlife, including a swan, cranes, ducks, and even several peacocks! The space was very clean, very comfy, and again, very peaceful. Communication was excellent as well. Looking forward to staying here again in the future!"

They've given the utmost support in everything we need. Exceeded all of our expectations"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect stay for any nature lover. The grounds feel like a wildlife park with trees and birds everywhere. Waterfowl congregate on the water just outside the your front door. Peacocks roam the grounds. The hosts gave us a tour of the gardens pointing out all the plants they are growing. It's a small slice of paradise.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"its a very nice sunset view for pictures. Close to the city, but very private. owners were awesome!!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful little escape! We had an excellent time. Enjoyed a tour of the garden and fed the peacocks. Enjoyed the outdoor spaces and watching nature at its best.

When I saw the listing mention the sighting of birds, I knew I had to bring my daughter along. The guest suite was so beautiful and clean. It was wonderful being able to look out the window and see the lake and trees. We were blessed to be given a tour of the garden by Isaac. The salad made for us look so beautiful and was very delicious. We especially enjoyed the sightings of the peacocks roaming around the property. This was definitely the best place we have ever stayed at and one will not forget."

When you step onto their property you realize what a gem you have found. It was such a pleasure to meet Nicolas, Lois, and Isaac and enjoy their piece of paradise. They were very kind and open and we felt at home right away. We felt very comfortable and so enjoyed the atmosphere with the lake, birds, ducks. peacocks and other flying creatures. Each morning when we walked out of our room the birds were busy chattering and you felt you were in a bird sanctuary. It was a wonderful change of pace from staying in a hotel! They have a room and their cabin. We stayed in the room. It had a full and single bed. The beds were comfortable, the shower pressure great. The fan and AC worked well. They have soft and firm pillows. I love soft pillows. They have a BBQ, microwave, coffee maker, washer, dryer, and fridge you can use. We had a great time. Our expectations were exceeded. We had a marvelous stay! Thank you."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very special place and a must-see stop for every birder!
Of course you are in the heart of an incredible birder‚Äôs paradise - the LRGV of Texas. More importantly, you are staying in a natural haven with wonderful hosts. This stay - birds ranged from white pelicans, black crowned and great blue herons and many different ducks and waterbirds to kiskadees and a wide variety of smaller birds including the golden fronted woodpecker... just a joy! And other surprises await you!"

Over many years, I have spent a significant amount of time in McAllen and the residence was everything that I had hoped for. The location is phenomenal for the McAllen area. Minutes away from an array of grocery and retail shopping as well as multiple dining options. Yet, the neighborhood itself is secluded from the city traffic and is securely enclosed in a gated community. This property will be my first choice the next time that I visit McAllen."
