2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Traveled to attend a funeral and our original Airbnb location had to cancel due to the furnace not working. That was a blessing in disguise. Stumbled across this gem. Beautiful. You can hear the faint sound of the train horn in your sleep. (My kids and I are train enthusiasts) if you get up early enough for breakfast you’ll see them come by. The pictures of the rooms don’t do the property justice compared to how homey the place actually feels in person. My family felt right at home. You can watch Netflix on the Smart TV. However make sure it’s connected to the WiFi first. It wasn’t automatically connected when we turned it on. The kitchen was stocked with more than essential items to save you from running to the store because you forgot to bring/stop and get items before you came in. Bathrooms were nice and clean with provided body wash, hair conditioner, towels etc. Would definitely stay again"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We needed a place to stay for our boys 4 hockey games in Ebensburg and Johnstown. The location was in between the towns which made it easy to get to all of the games.
The fridge was stocked with drinks and the freezer had some food, too. This was so nice when we arrived with our three hungry 13 year old boys.
Joseph's place was clean and spatious. We felt right at home. If we come back to the area again, we will definitely rebook.
We needed a late checkout due to our game times and Joseph was extremely flexible."

Joseph has thought of everything to make guests feel welcome and taken care of. If our future travels should take us anywhere near the greater metropolitan South Fork area, we will be staying at Joseph's place."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice warm place where heat worked well. Not far from Ebensburg where family was getting together. Clean, good coffee, snacks for the long trip. Great place. tom & Peg"

2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean home. You can tell it was recently renovated. Host was kind enough to provide drinks/toiletries. He was very responsive to messages. Entering the home was a bit difficult as you have to go up a steep set of stairs, so a bit difficult if you have mobility issues. Nice backyard with a patio. Parking was a bit tricky due to the funeral home across the street, but manageable. We would stay here again if the need arose."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay! Joseph was responsive and took care of every detail. The house was newly renovated and was decorated nicely. Check-in was easy with house instructions and light snacks provided. We were very happy with our stay and can’t wait to return. A+

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, affordable with great amenities"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This place was perfect for us. We needed a place close to get our daughter from camp and it was 5 minutes away. The place was spotless and had so many extras. There were options for breakfast galore - frozen items, cereal, juice, eggs and milk. Extra toothbrushes, tooth paste, shampoo..... Would certainly stay again.
Joseph was very quick to respond and kept us in the loop for getting settled.
Only two complaints. One was I couldn't find a strainer/colander but that certainly was nothing to make me miserable and who knows, i probably missed it. Second, I have bad knees and the set of stairs to get up to the property were tough, manageable, but tough.
Really was comfortable and perfect for what we needed."

The amenities were excellent with extra and fresh linens, drinks, breakfast items, and coffee provided. Limited parking beside or in front of the house was a challenge one night when coming in late (no designated parking). House was excellent value and would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Joseph had all the little extras to help make our stay more enjoyable. From drinks, snacks and condiments in the frig. To tooth brush and toothpaste if you forgot something. Those little things already there were so nice.
We would definitely stay again. Our family had a great time in this clean and cozy home."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in airbnb's all over the world and have to admit, we have never experienced a house that was so well stocked. From the bathroom to the kitchen, extras abounded. It was wonderful to have a bit of cereal (organic milk was in the frig) a Jimmy Dean's breakfast bowl, bottled water and juice. Just a little bite to hold you over while you have that extra cup of coffee on the back porch swing. Thanks, Joseph; you made our trip ""home"" most enjoyable. We'll be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice house with updated amenities, over all a very pleasant visit to Johnstown."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I live in Virginia but was born and raised in South Fork. My wife and I took a couple of Virginia native friends to visit the area. Our stay at Joseph’s place could not have been better. Clearly one of the best homes in South Fork. The house was extremely clean and quite comfortable. You do need to be able to navigate some stairs to both get into the house and to the bedrooms but that is pretty much commonplace with all houses in South Fork. Joseph was very responsive and provided easy to follow directions on how to enter the house. Would definitely stay there again!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a night to attend a funeral in neighboring Portage. The place was perfect for our needs. Very clean. Showers were excellent…we had five of us getting ready at the same time. Reliable Wi-Fi.
The back patio was nice. We didn’t get to enjoy it as much as we could have, but having morning coffee out there was perfect.
Joseph was helpful when we needed recommendations, and accommodated our request for a later check out.
Many thanks!"

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We had to find a place for the whole family close to Saint Francis University in Loretto to celebrate my sister’s graduation there. Squeaky clean, enough space for everybody, and the cherry on the cake is the porch. Went on a nice morning run in the area, such good air!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was great, even better than its description. Everything we needed, and more, were supplied. The house was better stocked than a high-end hotel room, and at a great price! We liked that the captured bedroom kept the kids in the back, through another bedroom (not that the area left any worry- it was serene and quiet all day and night.) We also liked that there was another bedroom that had privacy. The water pressure was better than at home, there were more than enough beds. House instructions were easy to find and understand, and our host was friendly and accommodating. Can't say enough about this place. The kids wanted to move in!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The spanking clean house in South Fork appears brand new with the interior renovated to offer every convenient appliance I could imagine, all of them of high quality and easy to use. Beds were very comfortable and the spacious living areas likewise. The complimentary food and drinks were generous and helped save time. The location offered beautiful walks and the yard/deck were lovely and quiet. My daughter and I were visiting my sick brother and the house made for a restful place to relax. Cost was very reasonable and a great bargain. When I return to the area, if this house is available I would not even consider looking for a different place to stay."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Great place! Super clean and loved the stocked kitchen and back porch! Definitely recommend this home!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Joseph’s house was comfortable, wonderfully appointed and spotlessly clean. The neighborhood was very quiet and an easy drive down to our cycling event in Johnstown. The covered back patio was particularly nice for parking our bikes. The kitchen was extremely well stocked with both dishes/cookware and breakfast treats which was very much appreciated. Communication was prompt and thorough. I would happily rent from Joseph again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is just as described and pictured! The kitchen is pretty large and well-equipped. The living room is huge with a giant comfy sectional. The second floor bedrooms are spacious and the beds are super supportive. The whole place is super clean and feels like home away from home! My family of 7 stayed comfortably.
The stairs outside are a bit steep and the wi-fi is kind of slow. But from my experience visiting relatives nearby, that's more of a regional/location issue than a problem with this specific house. (The only people really upset by the ""poor"" internet were the kids, but thankfully they survived somehow. 😵‍💫) The neighborhood is pleasant, it was quiet at night, and the views are beautiful, especially with the leaves starting to change color!
Joseph was responsive and is a great host. I would definitely recommend this house and host, and would stay again for sure!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, very clean and lovely and just what we needed."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Joseph was very understanding and flexible. We had a softball tournament for one of my daughters that looked like it would be cancelled due to the weather so I cancelled my reservation. They did not cancel the tournament so I contacted Joseph about re-renting and all went smoothly. The house was clean and ready to go!

The place had all of the necessities plus many extras for a few night stay. The house is spotless, everything felt new and fresh including the appliances and carpeting. The back porch has a relaxing swing.
Something to be aware of is the staircase leading to the upstairs bedrooms are steep. There is a daybed and full bathroom on the first floor.
The neighborhood outside the house was very quiet. The house is close the johnstown flood national memorial and visitors center.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay while in South Fork for a family event. The house was exactly as described and the hosts have thought of so many little details that make the place easy to settle in to. Communication was seamless and responses were quick! Very clean! My only suggestion for future people who stay here is to know that the stairs to the bedrooms (upstairs) are very steep - anyone with mobility issues may have a hard time getting up and down the steps.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great home! We enjoyed this clean, spacious & well appointed home. The kitchen was large & had everything we could need. The bedrooms & sleeping arrangements were as presented, clean & comfortable. The back porch with a picnic table & swing were wonderful extra touches for a summer evening. Perfect for our family."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The checkin was quite smooth, with Joseph giving precise details beforehand. He was very helpful, that he cleared the snow for parking.
The apartment had many amenities including some breakfast and beverages, a TV. When there was a wifi glitch, Joseph was quite fast in responding and fixing it.
Overall, it was a great stay and would certainly take this stay if we were to be in the area again."
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,Great spot for our two families for a hockey weekend in PA. Very clean and host was super helpful and communicated very quickly. Highly recommend if you are in this area.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"An absolute gem of a place. Centrally located to meet our needs perfectly, clean, spacious, excellent amenities. It felt like a home away from home as we visited family during a tough time. Joseph could not have been anymore kind and accommodating. I sent messages at the most ridiculous times of the day because we were under a time crunch and even then he was super quick to answer. Our pups were welcome, parking was a breeze, truly a great experience!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were completely surprised by the standard of the house inside. The old town style view from outside is a compete misguide. Once you step inside the house, you will realize the comfort of the house in many sense. It is a very cozy house with modern updates all over. We truly loved the house and enjoyed everything it had to offer: very clean and beautiful kitchen. You will find the value of your money in this house. I highly recommend this place for family or anybody who wants a cozy place."

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"This is our 2nd time staying at Joe’s place in 3
months. It’s our home away from home. Joe is the best host we’ve ever worked with, and we travel frequently. Joe went above and beyond to help us with something this last time, and we are so grateful to him. Such a beautiful home in a cozy area with a great host. Back porch is a bonus. Cannot wait to come back. You will not be disappointed while staying at Joe’s place in beautiful Western PA."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! House was clean, cozy, and stocked with essentials. There was even a Keurig with coffee and hot chocolate pods, and breakfast sandwiches and cereal, and drinks in the fridge. Out host Joseph was easy to get in touch with when we needed batteries for the remote and brought us more right away. The beds were super comfy and the bunk room was great for the kids.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Parking on premises is street parking, the WiFi was having some issues while we had our trip. The signal it produces on working near the wireless box. The house is beautiful and renovated, besides the wifi issue our stay was pleasant!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first AirBNB stay, and Joseph set the bar high. The house was great, and in a good location for me. He was very responsive to questions, usually replying within a minute or 2 of asking. My only negative would be the wifi. The house only uses streaming TV (no cable or air antenna), and the internet speed is really slow, especially in the evening. I was excited to be able to watch the Steelers on Friday, but couldn't keep a strong enough signal to watch. It worked fine in the morning, so it may have been an issue with the ISP Friday night. Otherwise a great stay. I would definitely recommend."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice house, clean, many items were provided for bath and kitchen. Nice coffee and breakfast items."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,We loved the place. The neighbors are very welcoming and friendly. We loved the little local supermarket just a minute walk from the house. There is a great local bar called Vince 5 min from the house that makes great wings and pizza. Lots of historical landmarks. Loved waking up in the morning and going to drink coffee on the back porch and relaxing on the swing. Looking forward to going back again soon.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was very comfortable and newly renovated. The living room and kitchen were both big and the whole home was very clean. Plenty of space for our family of five and Labrador retriever to spread out. The borough of South Fork is small and quaint with not much to offer, but it was the perfect location for our family visits in Johnstown and Brush Valley. Joseph was very kind, helpful, and responsive. We would stay here again. Thank you!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very well equipped. Very clean. Will stay there again .

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This spot was clean and just as described. We were very satisfied with the experience and Joseph was quick and easy with communication!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, wow, wow! 5 stars! Joe's place was an amazing home to stay in for our family trip. I grew up in the area and wanted a place for my family to stay while I was in town visiting family. I could not believe the deal on this beautiful home...and it's dog friendly! Our 2 Corgi's are our world, and they travel with us, so dog friendly is a MUST! The pictures are beautiful, but they do not do the home justice. The downstairs has beautiful flooring, a washer and dryer, large kitchen with all the essentials, a kitchen table and chairs, a bathroom, a large living room with a beautiful sectional couch and big screen TV, and a room off the living room with a daybed. We enjoyed cooking meals in the kitchen each day, as well as the Keurig coffee pot. We also enjoyed the beautiful covered patio, complete with a picnic table and porch swing. I enjoyed sitting out there at night with a drink and taking in the sounds of the trains in sleepy little South Fork. Our Corgi's loved the big back yard, and we were so happy to find a pet friendly home! The upstairs was beautiful in its own right. 3 comfortable rooms with one queen bed, one double bed, and an attached room with bunk beds. The beds and pillows were heavenly! The upstairs bathroom had a wonderful shower, and the entire place was squeaky clean. Plenty of closet space, as well! The carpeting was new and plush. We had several questions for Joe throughout our stay, and he was very speedy in answering us. He even left a local newspaper on the front porch for us daily. It was also a very hot week, and the downstairs and upstairs AC kept the house very cool and comfortable. We enjoyed our week at Joe's place. It felt like home, and we didn't want to leave. We made many family memories that are sure to last a lifetime. We will be back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We picked South Fork randomly because we wanted to get away for the weekend with our 2 dogs and found some cool hiking and abandoned attractions nearby so this was perfect for us. We felt right at home here. The house itself is quite big and bigger then we expected with tons of sleeping options. It's recently renovated so everything is extremely modern, new, and clean. We loved our stay here in this sleepy little town. There was some really nice added amenities for our stay including plenty of breakfast items and drinks. There was also a lovely little backyard and patio with a swing bench and a gravity chair and picnic table so it was really nice sitting outside eating our breakfast and sipping our coffee listening to the birds chirping. The neighbors were very friendly and loved our dogs. There is a good amount of parking next door and on the street. There is also laundry available. Joe was very communicative and responsive. I would absolutely recommend staying at his Airbnb and think he's well on his way to becoming a Super host."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The house is very clean and is exactly as advertised.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable home, very clean. Amenities that helped our stay even more. Very welcoming and was a perfect location for us. Will stay again for sure"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Coming home to Heritage Days this year was special! After no event in 2019, Heritage Days was again the center of excitement for many! It was particularly eventful for the Jackson Family as the B & B which we stayed was the home i grew up in! it was refurbished with thought & the workmanship was outstanding. Although refurbished there were some items which were from my days growing up! A picnic table built by my Dad & Clyde Wadsworth and the swing which my Mom & Dad used to put their grandchildren to sleep!
I highly recommend this B & B to anyone visiting South Fork or the surrounding area! Joe was a gracious host & available for any of our needs!
Tom & Sharon Jackson"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our 5 night stay in Christopher's home which provided everything we needed. He went out of his way to check in with us during our stay to make sure that we were happy and comfortable in his home. We appreciated the attention to fine details to ensure a comfortable accommodation. The neighborhood is quiet and the view from the back of the house is spectacular.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our second stay at Christopher's was just as lovely as the first. Christopher is a great host, super responsive and easy to work with. The house is always clean and welcoming. We hope to stay here again on another trip to Johnstown."

First it is super cozy feeling, the house has a home type feel,beds comfy, nice towels!
Plenty of space, looked like photos. Would 10000% stay again!
We were in town due to a family medical emergency, and the host was amazing, he was able to extend our trip since our situation was up in the air.
Chris was so accomadating when my brother in law had to come due to our family memeber passing.
Thank you so much!"

We were just passing through so didn’t have an opportunity to see the area.
Would love to come back and spend more time and enjoy the home more."

2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"One of the best airbnbs my friends and I have ever stayed in. Very clean, cozy and welcoming. Christopher was very responsive and helpful as he made sure anything we needed was available to us. I would definitely recommend this stay and I plan to be back again if the situation calls for it"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Such a beautiful home with all the amenities. The neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful. We came to visit the Flight 93 Memorial and had a wonderful time exploring the area. We couldn’t wait to get back to the house to relax and enjoy it. Chris was very responsive and helpful. We will be back.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Other than a couple of minor things the place was a good fit for our trip. Christopher prep on getting into the house and his checking to see if we needed anything was helpful and appreciated.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great little place! It was perfect for what we needed and the location was great. We loved spending time on the front porch. Unfortunately it rained all weekend so we didn’t get a chance to use the fire pit out back, but maybe on our next visit!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Christopher's house. Unfortunately we were only there one night, so we didn't get to take advantage of the beautiful kitchen, or the fire pit and the view. But the house is charming, with beautiful original woodwork, and very clean and well-appointed. The only thing that was ""unexpected"" was that the 2nd bathroom, as has been mentioned, is in the basement. Christopher was very proactive with information, and the house rules were clearly spelled out. We found a good spot for dinner based on the information he has provided to guests. If we ever find ourselves coming back to the area, we will definitely try to book this house again!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We were in town for a wedding and this place was lovely to stay in. Christopher reached out before our arrival to give us the door pin and everything went smoothly. A couple things to be aware of before booking:
* The basement is very short - I am 6'2"" and could not stand up in it
* There is one bathroom upstairs, and one in the basement. The basement one essentially has no door (it's a sliding door, but you can't sit on the toilet while it's closed)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was comfortable and cozy and in a very convenient part of town. Chris (owner) was very responsive and friendly.

2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,Place was clean and well cared for. Was a little cold inside and took a while to heat up and we were a little to tall to enjoy the basement. But overall nice place.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chris was a great host. Responded almost immediately to my messages. The place was perfect! We had a family wedding to attend. The house was less than 10 minutes away from the venue. And the family all came by to say hi because it was so close to everything and everyone. I can’t say enough positive things about Chris and his home. I would recommend it to anyone!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house and great location. Definitely will come back.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,what a great place!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Christopher was there personally to greet me and make sure check-in was a breeze.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I were in town for a quick visit. Chris's house was perfect for our needs.

2023-07-01,4,Group trip,"House felt like owner had just stepped out of it. This is cozy or weird, depending on the point of view. For example, I couldn't use dresser drawers because they were full of owners' clothing.
1 bedroom has no air conditioner.
However, we made do and I
would stay again. Price is reasonable. Host is
easy to work with & replies quickly. House is clean and well stocked with towels, etc."

We especially loved the fire pit!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Chris’s place was just as described. Very clean and spacious and just what our family of 4 needed while we were in town for a funeral. Chris was very responsive and a gracious host. We will def book with him again.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's place is by far the most thoughtfully and tastefully decorated and equipped AirBnb we have ever stayed at. It was absolutely spotless. Her place is so colorful, bright and cheerful. She clearly thought carefully about every aspect of being ab great host. We will definitely stay with her again if we are in the Johnstown area!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING STAY! Lisa's place is just as pictured/described. Very bohemian feel and everything, I dare say, was curated for its exact spot. Every time, I went into a room (no matter how many times) something else caught my eye. Lisa's place has a fun spirited vibe and if you don't feel it just burn the sage!
Loved the place. The kitchen was well stocked and clean. Bathrooms spotless. Linens were cozy and comfortable. The master has black out shades which were great for an afternoon siesta! The backyard was lovely, fenced in and very private.
5 stars all the way around. Will definitely stay again the next time we are in town."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,I recommend this house to anyone! It is not only really nice but super super cool. Also very comfortable!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying at Dreamy Cottage! Lisa was a great host who was responsive and helpful. The home is cozy, clean and beautifully decorated. Bed was very comfy too. We didn't cook but the kitchen is well stocked if you have a need. This will be our go to place to stay when we come back to town. If it's available that is. She books up fast for good reason."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place to work or vacation. Cook as much as you please, enjoy the fireplace warmth and safe parking space right next to the house. My wife and I both felt like we didn’t want to leave (set schedules kill flexibility)."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"As always, Lisa’s place was warm and cozy. The furniture and bed are comfortable. A great neighborhood. The kitchen is well stocked. We love the living room in the evening with a fire in the fireplace. We will be back next month!"

The check in was a breeze, she responded quickly and efficiently. Lisa went above and beyond and bought a fan just for my comfort, she provided more sets of towels for the three of us. The house is eclectic and so charming and provided everything you needed for the perfect getaway. We really enjoyed the backyard Oasis and the fire pit. What I would recommend is lights strung on the patio deck. The neighborhood is beautiful and a great place to walk and enjoy
the beautiful stone homes and friendly neighbors. Look no further if you're seeking a piece of heaven!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This charmingly decorated home felt warm and welcoming from the moment we arrived. The location was ideal for our purposes. Lisa's information sheet was comprehensive and easy to understand. The beds were comfortable. The bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, and pantry were well stocked. We enjoyed relaxing on the patio and taking walks in the neighborhood. We'd definitely stay at Lisa's house again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was enjoyable. Loved the outside area. Area that it is in, is very nice.Lisa was a great host. Looking forward to going back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We truly enjoyed staying at “The Dreamy Cottage.” We felt right at home while visiting our hometown. The place was comfortable and well stocked. It was also cutely decorated.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice neighborhood
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect. Incredibly cozy house that met our every need and exceeded all expectations. Brilliantly decorated yet very comfortable and easy to live in. The house has everything, and everything is exactly as pictured. And everything is extremely clean. My family and I stayed here over a weekend and Lisa was the perfect host - great communication. I have family in Johnstown so I hope to stay here in our next visit!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, great spot & great host. Quiet location in a lovely neighborhood, house lived up to its pictures and had everything we needed for a 5 day summer stay. Lisa was an excellent communicator and made our experience very easy to navigate. We enjoyed the artwork and fine touches that Lisa has poured into the home - a very thoughtful design. Will definitely look foward to staying here in the future when we visit the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Lisa is a great host. She was accommodating to extending our stay. The house was also great. I will be staying here in the future.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely decor and artwork. Outdoor space was nice too
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay! Everywhere you look, there’s interesting decorations. There was everything we needed to cook, the beds were very cozy and comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,What a magnificent find this was. Lisa has done an amazing job with this cottage. I don't ever remember sleeping as well as i did during my two week stay. The neighborhood is super quiet and everyone couldn't have been any more friendly.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I was not able to stay at this house due to a water valve problem that arose before arrival, not her fault. Lisa was very good about keeping me informed on the status, she worked with AirBnb, and a full refund is being processed. She was very customer-focused as my future host, I would work with her any time."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful home! My parents had a great stay in the house and loved the decor and fenced in backyard. Quiet neighborhood with every amenity you might need. Would absolutely book this property again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leah’s place was great! As a host, she was clear, communicative and friendly. The house itself was well-stocked and beautifully decorated. The location is within walking distance of the stores and and restaurants in Westwood Plaza, and the area itself is peaceful. We’ll definitely be booking here the next time we’re in Johnstown!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We totally enjoyed our stay at Lisa’s Dreamy Cottage. It totally measured up to its portrayal on the Airbnb website. The fabulous decorations and artwork are a sight to behold and we really enjoyed looking at all the different artwork and objects. Everything was super comfortable and very fine. Our only disappointment was that we didn’t get there a week earlier and have the nice fall weather so that we could enjoy the backyard area and fire pit. Instead we had a little snow & cold weather but we were super cozy in the Dreamy Cottage . The neighborhood was beautiful & was blanketed in snow. What a beautiful and safe neighborhood as well - we felt totally safe staying at this location. Five stars all the way!!! Thank you, Lisa!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place for a getaway! 10 stars! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ The place was gorgeous and fun. We liked trying to find all the pigs throughout the house. The artwork was beautiful. Lisa provided everything we could want from dishes to appliances to cozy furniture. Her attention to every little detail was amazing. We didn’t want for anything. This was the only AirBnB I’ve ever stayed at that had plenty of toilet paper and paper towels.
My friend and I are already talking about returning."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my all time favorite Airbnb stay. I have noticed a significant change in Airbnb's over the years and for the most part it has not been positive. This home is the exact opposite. The host truly cares about her home. If you are an art lover this is the place for you. I did not love every piece, but I loved looking at every piece. I was obvious that Lisa loves art or is an artist. The home is remarkable spacious, with a wonderful use of all the unique features of a 1920's home. It is refreshingly clean and for a person who has serious OCD that says a lot. It really needs more than 5 stars. Johnstown is a bit sleepy and conventional, this home is definitely not what you would expect here. So if you want to stay in a very special home, I would urge you to try this one."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a well appreciated home. The owner truly cares about every part of their home. Allowing pets is truly appreciated! I enjoyed my stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This sweet little cottage is clean, comfortable, cozy, and in a safe and quiet neighborhood. It is unique with loads of character and is truly a ""dreamy"" cottage. The decor is beautiful and Lisa's attention to detail make it feel so homey and fun. The outdoor areas are private and there is plenty of seating. We enjoyed staying here and hope to come back again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dreamy Cottage is a really charming small house in a lovely neighborhood. All the amenities you could wish for are available, not to mention a beautiful private back yard and back porch. Our family of four was totally satisfied with our stay. Lisa is a great host who was very helpful to me as a first time Airbnb renter, and she was super accommodating regarding booking questions and a change I requested. If I go to Johnstown again, I would absolutely hope Dreamy Cottage is available."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is such a gem! The decor is gorgeous and the home is so nice and cozy! I would recommend this spot and I would definitely stay again!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lisa thought of every detail! This charming cottage is a must stay!! We loved sitting on the porch and cooking in the beautiful kitchen! The neighborhood is peaceful and perfect for evening strolls! Book now, you’ll be so happy you did!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lisa's place is incredible! I shared with her it's like a little slice of heaven on earth! From the easy communication before my trip, seamless check-in and well stocked home with all of the amenities of home that you could possible need and dream of I would highly recommend this home!
I was looking for a place that would allow me to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of the city and stay in a quiet place, the great thing about this house is that you were about 20-30 minutes from the ""city"" (Ulta, Tj Maxx, Walmart etc.) or main street towns full of charm and boutiques with mountain views! I felt like I had the opportunity to rest but full access to whatever I may want or need!
100% recommend Lisa's place!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is excellent for any occasion. Highly recommend, and Lisa is a highly responsive host. 10/10"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend this beautiful air b@b! So cute and cozy. And so clean!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lisa is a great host and you can really tell she wants you to enjoy your stay. Her house is so cool and interesting with art everywhere, every room is comfortable and had everything we needed. We loved the back yard so much!! I would sit out on the deck in the morning while my dog enjoyed the sun and grass and I enjoyed my coffee. It was private and so comfortable and definitely my favorite part. We will definitely stay here again if we visit Johnstown in the future."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Very nice and clean.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was neat and clean and very well appointed. We were lucky to have moderate weather and enjoyed the decks and yard. the location is very quiet and centrally located. A very good place to stay.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's place was really a perfect little getaway. The home is immaculately clean and well maintained.
It's clear a lot of love went into this home which is evident in its impeccable design and furnishings.
The home was complete with every possible detail you can imagine and more - even a letter opener!
We were really pleased with our stay and can't wait to return another time to this dreamy cottage."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very clean and adorable place. Close to lots of local places. The house was amazing and we enjoyed the back yard. Lisa was quick to respond if we have any questions ! Our puppers and baby loved it too !
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is beautiful. The art and decorations are really lovely. Cozy place, nice and quiet. Really comfortable. Bright and sunny during the day. Great backyard. Fully furnished!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautifully decorated house in a peaceful neighborhood. It was an ooh-ahh moment as soon as we opened the door. The interior is artfully decorated, super clean, and well appointed down to every careful detail Lisa was easy to work with and very responsive."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa’ place, you will enjoy the stay short or long, beautiful location, quiet and safe. The house is beautifully decorated in very good taste. Bath rooms, and kitchen are also very good. Cups and saucers are also nice, they are not for business. Washer and dryers are perfect. Nothing is cheap. Fenced back yard is very private.
I also found good hints of home renovation."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Do yourself a favor and stay in this stunning cottage in one of Johnstown’s best neighborhoods! It is so beautifully decorated and the owner is wonderful! Highly recommended!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely beautiful home in a great location! Private yard and off street parking.
The home was absolutely SPOTLESS inside and out and had everything you needed to feel at home. The eclectic decorating and art is gorgeous. Lisa was so accommodating and easy to communicate with. We came for a State wrestling tournament and will be booking again next year for sure! 5 stars!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is perfect. It's beautiful, totally equipped, comfortable and unique. It's super cozy and, at the same time, plenty spacious. The host's global travel experience and artful creativity are everywhere in the house from the art on the walls to the furnishings to the dishes! The beds and the bedding are luxurious! The house is perfectly located in Johnstown--basically walking distance to a CVS, and a quick drive to grocery shopping, hiking in Stackhouse Park, and food options (don't miss the Gobs at Clarks Corner Store and anything at Balance Restaurant!). The neighborhood is safe, quiet and friendly. Self-checking in and out was a breeze, and Lisa (the host) was communicative, informative, and flexible. I would highly recommend what is clearly a unique property in Johnstown, and I can't wait to have an excuse to stay there again!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lisa’s place is awesome and very well decorated. Private fences throughout, including in the backyard which makes you feel at ease. This is a must-see for frequent travelers or first timers. Lisa is a very responsive host."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First off, I would like to thank Rick and Lori for this very comfortable, stylish, and beautiful rental. They were very prompt with responses and very accommodating when I needed to extend my trip by a few days. Everything that I needed was available to me in this home. The beautiful views from the front rockers, the peaceful location, cofortable bedding, on site laundry, and the Coffee Bar! The thoughtful, holiday decorations were also a really nice touch, as I was traveling for Christmas. It felt like home, away from home. I would highly recommend this rental and would love to visit here again. Thank you"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay. Had everything we needed. The home was nicely decorated and very clean. The home is larger and has more space in person then what the pictures show. Beds were comfy. Only thing to note is the two bedrooms do share a bathroom and the one bedroom has a glass door that you can see through straight into the living room/kitchen area. Other then that we really enjoyed the stay and will be back if in the area!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. We loved the beautiful home, and hope that we can have the pleasure of staying there again sometime."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place to stay in Johnstown while on a work assignment.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very comfortable place to stay and good location.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here multiple times in this nicely decorated quaint house. Relaxing in the rockers on the front porch is the best. Close to all to do in Johnstown.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy and clean.
Needs better mattresses & general lighting at dining & living area."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,May be a good alternative to a hotel.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10! Would highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable little home with a great view. Will definitely be our place to stay when we visit family.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rick was very easy to work with. Answered all my questions in a timely manner. The place was quaint. It was quiet and clean. Very homey!!!! Exactly what I was looking for. Hope to visit again
Cheers
D2"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time I’ve stayed at this AirB&B. It is so cute and homey. The neighborhood is safe and quiet; the home is very clean and comfortable; and Rick and Lorrie are great hosts! I would highly recommend and will continue to stay here when I am in town.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rick’s place was great. Nice home and an enjoyable, comfortable stay. Would recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time staying at Rick's place. It feels like a home away from home..
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place! Porch with rockets was great.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The photos do not do justice to this charming place. The decor is lovely. Loved the coffee bar!! And the view Ed especially awesome at night.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was adorable, very quaint. Inside was very nice, loved lights and coffee bar. The view was beautiful. We would definitely stay there again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cute, cozy home with a really nice den/ office. Walking distance to grocery store. The house had all the amenities we needed."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for a peaceful weekend with my family. The host provided everything and more.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a weekend wrestling tournament, Ricks Airbnb was a perfect retreat to relax after a long day in an arena. Awesome coffee station, and felt very comfortable. The one thing I would comment on is the 2nd bedroom has glass on the door (which looks great, but there was no covering or curtains for privacy from the living room. We would definitely stay again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I stayed for 3 nights with my 3 children (ages 12, 7, and 4). We were in town for a hockey tournament. The house was super close to downtown Johnstown (8 minutes!) and was absolutely perfect.
Rick was super responsive with any questions I had and extremely kind.
The house itself is a perfect combination of practical and cozy. Everything you need is already there (dishwasher pods, laundry detergent, wash cloths, towels, pots, pans, kitchen appliances etc...) and the decor and set up is clean, neat, and peaceful while also feeling really welcoming! It's simply adorable.
My kids loved the puzzles, deck of cards, and TV in the sunroom, and I LOVED the coffee bar for our early morning hockey game wake ups, and also sitting on the side porch at the end of the night in a rocker with a cup of tea and blanket.
All of the details are just perfectly thought through!
Having laundry on site was also a huge bonus!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I had a wonderful stay at Rick's Air BNB. I really loved the decor, and the house was very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is peaceful and calm. I highly recommend Rick's Air BNB to anyone looking to stay in the area."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, cozy, great location for our need! Rick was very quick to respond regarding misunderstanding of entry into house."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute home in good neighborhood close to supermarket. Coffee selection was great.
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Airbnb was nicely decorated and clean. Overall it was an okay stay. Coffee bar was cute and well stocked. There are a few things I wish I had known about the place before booking. This house has a Jack and Jill style bathroom. One bedroom has a glass door, meaning that they do not have privacy. I was traveling with a coworker and that was not ideal. Lastly, the house sits right behind a fire station, and we were woken up twice during our 4 day stay from the sirens.
Some small touches are missing in the house like rug tape to keep them from sliding across the floor (almost fell over multiple times). The lights around the top of the rooms are beautiful but they aren't on a switch so you have to follow the cords and unplug them from the wall."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Ricks place. The house was great!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Host was great. Check-in super convenient. House is exactly as advertised.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was exactly what we were looking for! Rick did a wonderful job with adding little amenities that made our stay very enjoyable! We will definitely read book when we come back into the area!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in three of Rick's properties now, and have found that all three could be trusted to be comfortable, well-appointed and cleverly/tastefully decorated! This is my favorite so far, and I have stayed there twice now. You can select Ruck's properties with confidence!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely enjoyed our stay!! The coffee bar is everything everyone talks about and is truly an awesome added prize to this cute and well decorated place. We loved the charm and cleanliness of the place. Very close to shopping, some very cool restaurants and breweries. I highly recommend Flood City cafe, Asiagos, and The Boulevard. Looking forward to our next stay."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean cottage with a great view.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s my second stay at Rick’s place. We had one small issue and Rick stopped by to take care of it. A few minutes later, everything was working again. Great reaction time and resolution."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicely decorated with all the amenities. Great view from the porch rockers. Convenient off street pkg and a grocery store within a short walk.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay at Ricks house. It was convenient to all of the events we had to attend. The house is very cozy and well stocked. You can cook a meal or visit one of the many restaurants.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was clean, in a good location near Johnstown, and rather private."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable place to stay, clean, well stocked, and the porch with rockers has a nice view. Great place to sit in the morning as you enjoy your coffee from the well stocked coffee bar. Walking distance to the grocery store and close drive to many nice diners and parks. Driveway parking close to the entrance and fast response to questions."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My great Aunt loved this Air BNB it was easy to navigate, she enjoyed the location and was very happy with everything."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ricks listing was perfect. It is cozy, clean, and has the best cozy porch’s and coffee station. Take the next street to park at the back and bring your own shampoos and little things like that. Other than that you really don’t need anything. Ricks place is close to everything and the coffee and tea bar was much appreciated after a long trip form Florida. Best water pressure ever also. If I’m ever in PA again, I’ll definitely try to book ricks place. Thanks so much for an amazing stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot. Nice and cozy. Kitchen filled with everything you need. Loved sitting on the porch and taking in the view
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Rick's place is great. Very nice design inside and extremely cozy. loved the coffee bar. Will definitely stay here again!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay in Johnstown.
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,The property was as described. Would book again if in the Johnstown area.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, comfortable and homey feel. Mid-century, eclectic decor. Bed was super comfortable. Coffee/tea set up was bountiful and lots of choices. Parking was easy and convenient. There's a Giant Eagle down the hill in view of the house. Beautiful, peaceful neighborhood and lovely view from the porch of the city and mountains. Very relaxing location!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Cottage was perfect and Rick was a great host. I highly recommend both Rick as host and this cottage.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely little house in Johnstown - Rick has made it easy to stay and very comfortable! We loved how easy it was to cook and the close location to the Giant Eagle.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This really is a great little place. Modern feel, clean and and super well stocked-probably the most well stocked bnb we have stayed at. The coffee bar is such a nice little touch. Would most definitely recommend this space to others."
2022-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,This place was adorable. We really enjoyed staying here. The coffee bar was awesome. I enjoyed sitting on the closed in sun porch to read. We will stay here again when we visit!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Enjoyed our stay. Thank you again
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location is about a mile and quarter from the hospital in Johnstown. We rented it specifically for that purpose and it made this hard time easier. The decor is lovely! I was really happy to see how cheery the house was with all the lights on when we drove up, especially after a tough day at the hospital.
The house is immaculate and homey. It is walking distance to Giant Eagle and only a mile or less from downtown. I would definitely stay there again!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Rick’s house was one of the best Airbnb’s where we have ever stayed. It was absolutely perfect—it really felt like a home a way from home.
The only thing to note is that it is close to a volunteer firehouse with a loud siren but it only went off twice in the week we were there.
We would happily recommend this place and would stay there again."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice and cozy little cottage. Rick was very accommodating and even had the house decorated for Christmas. Loved the coffee bar. The view is beautiful and even watched the sun rise up from behind the mountain one morning.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great neighborhood. House is very comfortable, cozy, and clean. Beds very comfortable as well"
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Well, the house is amazing and very comfortable for a short stay... the neighborhood & town was completely peaceful to go home to after a long day of work, we had what was expected as the pictures showed. However, they are a bit misleading as you have to park on Maggie St to access the property (top side of the hill), not noted in the description. The coffee pot had to be moved to the kitchen for power... the 2nd tv on the front porch does not reach any power outlets... the Christmas lights are always on unless you physically unplug them. NO MICROWAVE or WASHER & DRYER ACCESS. Then there was the lack of information about the home being right next to the volunteer fire departments station & emergency sirens. Other than that, great place to stay!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is spot on. Rick was a marvelous host. It was clean and the decor was cheerful. The kitchen is spacious and by far, the best coffee bar I've ever seen at an Airbnb! The view was absolutely gorgeous. It's close to grocery and gas. I loved it."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A very cute, cozy place! Great location with good communication. Will stay again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay for a long weekend! Very clean, beautifully decorated, fantastic view! Rick was a great host!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean place to stay. Rick was great to work with."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jen’s place was very nice and clean! She was very responsive if I had any questions and even let us check in early as we were driving through the night from Wisconsin which is about a 12 hour drive. We will definitely stay again!
The only con to the place is there is only street parking, but if you know anything about the area then you know that not many places in Johnstown have driveways or garages! Nothing they can do about that. We always found a spot on the street to park!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great time
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Family friendly, quiet neighborhood. Thoughtful and responsive host."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely breathtaking. Beautiful large home. Exceptionally clean. Comfy stay. What more could you ask for.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay while we were in town. The home was very comfortable and we really enjoyed it!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great host, very nice and welcoming home"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jennifer’s place was amazing! The house is so much bigger than the pictures show. Nice fenced in yard for our pups, easy parking, nice peaceful neighborhood. Street parking right in front of the house was very easy. Loved the house itself, it’s very charming!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed this beautiful home.
Jen and Nate sent clear instructions via the app.
This home reminder me of the house where I was raised. It was exceptionally clean and had everything our group needed for our two night stay during our road trip from Michigan to Pennsylvania.
I would definitely stay here again when I plan another trip through the area."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was super nice and spacious! Very peaceful neighborhood. They had everything we needed and more. Would recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit the area!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a quick stay at Jen's place. We wished we would have been able to stay a little longer. The house is beautiful, comfortable, and clean. The hosts knew we were coming with small kids so they had some small beds made up for us. Very thoughtful and helpful. Would love to stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Lovely stay in great old house in quiet neighborhood. Very comfortable with dining and living spaces as shown on site. Jennifer was super responsive and clear in communications. Would recommend and would stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We loved staying at Jennifer & Nate’s home. They went above and beyond to make it comfortable for all of us including towels, lots of toilet paper, kcups for coffee, beds (including putting together an air mattress), linens and more. If you are looking for a comfortable place to stay with a great host, stay here!!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,For the $$ this place can’t be beat. So much space and far cleaner than any local hotel. It’s in a residential area so perfect if you’re just wanting to hang out with friends and family. Very walkable (and runnable) so you can get some exercise. It’s no surprise that the location is almost always booked.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We met family here for a total of 4 adults and 3 kids. There was plenty of space for sleeping arrangements and for relaxing during the day. We loved the empty room off the kitchen because we put two big play mats down and used it as a playroom for the kiddos! Everything was clean, Jennifer was quick to respond to questions we had before our stay, and there were many good activities for kids. We went to Idlewild for a day, then spent a day at the children’s museum/heritage discovery center, and finally had some fun at the playground right by the house. We hope to stay again."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house and the owners are amazing! The house was beautiful and the neighbors were amazing. The owners were very helpful in meeting our needs such as having a crib set up for our little boy that way he had a good bed to sleep in so we didn’t have to bring one. They were quick to answer questions and were very pleasant to work with. Would stay here again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay—Jennifer did not disappoint! Clean, comfy and very spacious with beautiful historic architecture. LOVE this house!
A perfect place to call ‘home away from home’ while settling our son at UPJ. Definitely recommend for a quiet getaway with walking distance to the inclined plane (hope to ride after renovations) and Asiagos Tuscan restaurant."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful house to stay in. We had a fantastic stay and were very comfortable. They had many extra added touches that made it very welcoming.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a fabulous old house! I fell in love with the stair banister, vintage woodwork, pocket doors, fire places, soaking tub, laundry room—overall restored charm.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful old house with stained glass windows and hardwood floors.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Kids (16+17) loved exploring the place and neighborhood. Felt extremely comfortable letting them walk to the park by themselves which of course gave me a much needed break. All the exploring the kids did of the house I think I'm the only one that found the chocolates. And plus that bathtub. I was in heaven here.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here! It is in a very quiet neighborhood. The house was very comfortable with the ac units, great living room to hang out in. Overall a great stay and I’d stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing stay at Jen and Nate's Airbnb. The hosts were incredibly responsive in the lead up to my visit. When I arrived the house was sparkling clean. I couldn't of asked for a better experience. I would recommend to anyone looking for a cozy and welcoming spot in Johnstown, PA. Thank you Jen and Nate!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"OMG! A hidden gem. Everything was perfect. Beautiful home,great amenities,proactive host. Has everything to make you feel right at home. Best, keep hideaway in Johnstown,hands down. You won't be disappointed. Thank you, Nathan and Jennifer. We will be coming back."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet and pleasant neighborhood. It was easily accessible to grocery store and our family whom we came to visit. Loved the little front porch where we could sit and enjoy tea. Speaking of tea, Keith has coffee maker AND tea kettle with tea bags! These tea drinkers loved it! He also has some snacks. We didn’t need anything beyond Keith’s clear instructions so we didn’t need to contact him during our stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for our needs. We were in town for a celebration and couldn’t stay with family due to some recent damage to their home & the resulting construction. Keith’s place was tidy, cozy, quiet, & convenient. Having coffee & snacks available as we walked in was so welcome after a very long drive from out of state. The full kitchen was important & saved us from having to rely on take-out. The grocery store is a minute away & also has a gas station on-site. Keith’s place is embedded in a regular neighborhood & at the onset of a sudden downpour one of the neighbors was kind enough to knock on our door to let us know our car windows were open (THANK YOU otherwise we would have had very damp dupas on our next drive)! The WIFI was strong & allowed us to finish homework and other business stuff without hassle.
I felt safe here.
I highly recommend Keith’s place, especially for families & travelers who may have a block of downtime during their visit and need to recharge in a homey environment."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Keith was a great host. We booked this place overlooking that there was a two night minimum and when our plans changed, he gave almost a full refund for the second night. The place was very clean but I must say, very dated with dark paneling in the bedrooms and basic amenities and for that, I think it's a bit overpriced. We have stayed in really nice motels with lots of amenities and full breakfasts for less than what we paid. More photos would have been helpful but for many reasons, I would definitely recommend it. It was peaceful in a very quiet neighborhood not far from everything we planned to do, so for that I'm grateful. Thank you, Keith."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay as I visited family. Cozy, comfortable, clean, and convenient 👍"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely 2 bedroom. It is very close to a grocery store and the ubiquitous dollar store. The dining room table is a good size and the living room couch is comfortable. The kitchen is clean and had the necessary equipment for our 4 day stay.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place to stay at beautiful views I think and super clean and not to full of clutter which is nice with a little walking baby. I would deff stay here again next time I'm in town. Only thing I'd make others aware is that there is a full time tenant who lives on the 3rd floor they do not have any access to the part you are staying in so it is completely separate but just thought others might want to be made aware.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A nice, cozy place that feels just like home! Keith was very responsive with any questions I had. A highchair was set out for my son upon request which was super convenient and saved me from packing ours in the car.

I was very comfortable. We had one little hiccup with the keyless entry pad where my code stopped working. Keith took a little longer than usual to respond but fixed it and gave me a back up code in case it would happen again. Other than that he was very responsive and even checked in halfway through my stay to make sure everything was good.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was exactly as advertised. If you have any questions Keith answers quickly.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"First I want to acknowledge that the Host Keith was very informative from the very start that I booked this Airbnb. I never stayed at an Airbnb in the Johnstown area and just never had a desire to do so …but We were throwing my mom a surprise party for her 70th birthday and lot of my family members have moved out of town so my options of staying with family were limited and I definitely didn’t want to stay at the Holiday Inn due to the new management. I am very happy I booked this Airbnb it was very clean, very quiet, very well put together, it was the little touches for me that made it so pleasant (i.e breakfast bars) also, my nephew forgot his toothbrush (😤) and thank goodness there was an extra new to brush in the bathroom which saved me from having to stop at the store …As I still had some things to take care of for the party and my time was limited. When I travel I like to feel at peace and this Airbnb was every bit of peaceful. Keith was a great host… this will definitely be my go to Airbnb for any future stays."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Place
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,I think it’s definitely worth noting that this rental is located in the basement of a commercial office building! I arrived late and getting in the building was a little eerie as a solo female traveler. I had a little trouble getting in (pull the door knob toward you when it’s unlocking if you’re struggling). The space had a lot of amenities and it was really aesthetically pleasing.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place. Clean and just what was described in the listing.

2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The studio unit is very cozy and decorated nicely. It is updated with modern furnishings, appliances, cabinets, bathroom etc. this is a lower level unit, so it’s kind of in a basement with no windows. I felt very isolated. No natural sunlight. You will occasionally hear footsteps, muffled voices, and movement from neighbors above you and next door. I enjoyed having a private entrance. There is a heating unit on the wall that worked well, but because it is a basement, it will get cold. they are pet friendly and there’s coin laundry. I enjoyed the convenience of being close to the hospitals that I was working at. The neighborhood is beautiful, peaceful, and safe. However, I had a difficulty finding the location using GPS on Maps. The hosts were very helpful and called to guide me."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We fell in love with Keith’s place, we felt right at home with our puppy and bunny for the night. There was a ton of space and amazing furniture. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone and would gladly book again!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Air BNB was clean and quiet. The hosts were wonderful! They told my partner and I the best places to grab a bite to eat, provided extra amenities, and were extremely friendly. I would come back again.

We will definitely be back when we are in the area!"

2023-10-01,3,Stayed one night,No procedure for what doors to lock and how to leave items like key or sheets at checkout. No note of internet network. We were not able to get into exterior door when returning and were told that exterior door is not typically locked but not in any check in process!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"keith was more than responsive and helpful. The place matched the description and more, besides not having windows it had everything anyone needs. Close to some good restaurants, I recommend the pizzaria across the street, cant beat it for the price. I would recommend this place to anyone and would stay here again when in town."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came into town to help a family member move into her place with her children. This was the perfect location for us being as though the place that she lives in, isn’t spacious enough.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was awesome! They literally had everything you could think of in this house. Most of the things I didn’t even notice until I was checking out like the games. My favorite was they offered a smart TV with Netflix already logged in. This was a bonus for me because many of the places I stay at don’t have this. Thanks Will for your hospitality.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was very nice place and way more than expecting. Anything you think you'd need you had access to, extra heater or fan, snacks, bottle water, etc. Way more than I had expected but was nice to feel that more at home feeling.

I visit Johnstown occasionally for work, and I'll definitely check the availability here if I need a place to stay again."

Check-in was a breeze. The home is well-appointed and absolutely immaculately cleaned and maintained, situated in a quiet, safe neighborhood. Plenty of space for my month-long stay so I could move around and separate work from relaxation. Anything you need is no more than 5-10 minutes away. If I find myself in Johnstown again, I certainly hope this property is available."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Will is an excellent host - incredibly responsive and helpful! The house is quiet and is full of amenities to make it truly a home - so many kitchen condiments, plenty of bathroom supplies. Very happy with our stay here and would definitely stay again!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean, comfortable and thoughtfully equipped with everything we needed for our stay. Will promptly responded to our questions. Roxbury Park with a nice walking path is only a block or two away as is Tony’s Sub Shop and Roxberry Creamery. The house’s location off of a main street makes it pretty easy to reach other sections of town."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice two nights in a nice place. Will was very responsive and the place was clean and comfortable. Nice snacks were and added bonus. All the comforts of home. Would stay again and recommend.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to town for a 3 day convention and our rental was everything we needed and more. It was only 2 miles from the convention, 1 block from Dively's and a sub shop. Our host provided snacks, waters, coffee, and toiletries. He was so quick to respond to us, even after we kept breaking wine glasses LOL The rental is roomy and off street parking was nice. Got smiles from neighbors. The nice Alexa speaker was a perk. We would totally stay again if our convention is in the same place."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,The place was nice next to a big park with plenty to do. I played basketball often and there’s a big track and field. The house was nice clean and updated. Didn’t have to leave to do laundry a big convenience. Thanks will for creating a comfortable place for me.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is clean, comfortable, and located in a nice neighborhood that's convenient to downtown Johnstown. Check in and check out were very easy, and we appreciated the dedicated parking spot."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft was lovely. It had everything you need for coffee or tea in the morning! Fresh linens and the kitchen was beautiful with everything you need to cook and make yourself at home. It’s in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood. Easy to get your daily walk in.
It’s an old house with a lot of history. Some of the floorboards creak (expected in an old house) so you can’t sneak up on anyone!
There are two deadbolt locks on the front door. One locks to the left and the other one locks to the right. The owners were very quick to respond when I had trouble getting out of the house. Totally user error. Simple solution, lock only one deadbolt or remember they are backwards!
It’s a loft so it’s upstairs. Once you are up that flight of stairs everything is on one level and very cozy."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place was as described. The bathroom door needs fixing and windows and cabinet doors stick. Other than that the place was clean and was pleasant.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay at the Loft was the perfect place to stay for our son's wedding. I do not like hotels so this was the most cozy home away from home. Thank you Timothy.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay in Johnstown.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Winter storms did not bother us to stay warm in Tim’s house. I want to go back and enjoy it more.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying at The Loft. My family absolutely loves this place. We grew up in Johnstown and coming back to stay here is a perfect getaway. Very clean, good location to a lot, and the neighborhood is ideal for taking walks. We plan on staying here again soon!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,charming and perfectly appointed flat. Wish we were staying longer.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was absolutely beautiful, comfortable, and cozy! Timothy was the best host, great with communication and always responded immediately when we reached out. The location is in the heart of scenic Westmont. We loved that we could walk to get coffee at The Mill House, and a grab a drink at Asiago's. We even got a tour of the renovated Tioga Street Market just beneath the loft, which seems like a great space for any private event. We bought a Tioga Street Market t-shirt as a memento! This was the perfect place to stay while visiting family for the holidays. We will be back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean. Very nice host. Beyond friendly. Super clean place. I’ll be back in Johnstown and I will be staying here again!

If you’re staying with children, there are 2 playgrounds very close by, which was a plus for us!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We are very familiar with the area...still have family living in Westmont. The Loft at Tioga was a perfect location for us during our visit. We were very pleased with the the Loft; the amenities were quite extensive; and we were happy to meet Tim and Luke.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at the loft! It’s a block from family, so we parked once and never got in the car again — super convenient. Aside from convenience, it was also quite lovely and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are a family of 4 and were visiting Johnstown for a wedding. We appreciated the amenities available at this property, and the secure and peaceful location. I recall growing up in Johnstown and visiting the old corner store (Tioga Street Market) that used to be located just below this property. It was nostalgic for me to stay here- a big of a trip down memory lane. Thanks for a pleasant stay."

The renovations have made it a lovely, comfortable place to stay, and many special touches were included, like coffee (yay!) and toiletries, in case we forgot anything. Tim was proactive in ensuring that we found and got into the loft without issue and was extremely responsive to my reach-outs. He took time out of his busy schedule to meet with us at the Tioga Market so that we could purchase shirts and learn more about the history of the market and the loft. What an incredible property in the best part of Westmont. High recommend!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Timothy’s place truly is a special gem in a quaint historic neighborhood in Johnstown. It was pristine clean, charming and met all the expectations. Nicely furnished and certainly a place we would return to, 100%. Timothy is excellent and prompt with communications. We’ve been to a lot of Air B & B’s over the years… some you remember.. some… not so much.
Timothy’s place will remain most memorable!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely fantastic! We loved the apartment, the history of the building, and the beautiful homes surrounding the Airbnb."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Three of us stayed here for Polkafest, which was pretty much just across the street. Lovely 2nd floor apartment. Very clean. Plenty of bath towels.
We enjoyed playing records and the variety of seating. The sunporch was a nice bonus. The decor was amazing! Location is great."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great Airbnb in Johnstown and was perfect for our needs. It was super large and everything was clean, in great condition and had a fun, stylistic vibe. Very happy we chose to stay here and would return if we are back in the area!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leah was a FANTASTIC host and her Air BnB was WAY ABOVE and BEYOND what I ever could have expected! That sunroom and claw tub and vintage furniture is WORTH the visit! VERY well done!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as described. Love the place and cute decor. If we are ever back in the area we will book again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Leah’s place was beautiful! We felt right at home there. Loved the vibe & detail of the decor. The bed was comfortable along with all the chairs. Very cozy feeling.
This was the first Airbnb that provided an ample supply of bath towels, hand towels & washcloths! For some reason a lot of airbnbs we stay at never supply washcloths. This may sound small but it’s those little details that make for an easy & comfortable stay.
We were visiting family about 10mins from there, it’s in a good prime location easy to get around. We will definitely be booking Leah’s place again when we return.
One minor suggestion for anyone that is sensitive to sound I would encourage you to maybe bring some ear plugs, the radiators got pretty loud when the heat would click on, the pipes would bang and make a lot of noise which woke me up (I can be a light sleeper). The sound of the train however did not bother me, but it could bother others. I would still stay here again and highly recommend! 5 stars!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leah was great. Loved the atmosphere of the apartment and the sun room is amazing.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,wonderful space. we greatly enjoyed our stay!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the second time we have stayed at Ed and Leah’s Airbnb. As before, it deserves 10 stars."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A really amazing place to stay in Johnstown!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were 4 people and a toddler and had plenty of room. Areas were very spacious and clean with a funky, retro, cozy, motorcycle vibe. Only drawback is that the apartment is a bit isolated in a industrial area. We had a wonderful time and look forward to visiting again next year!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was fabulous. The apartment was clean with a cool vibe including lots of nostalgic vinyl and steampunk retro decor with an industrial accent. The location is off the main roads of downtown with the train station across the street but just a bridge away from the flood museum and amazing restaurants. Leah and Ed were perfect hosts, communicative and friendly, with wonderful attention to details to make us feel welcomed."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The owners were incredibly friendly and communicative. The space was clean and comfortable and we enjoyed the view of Johnstowns’ incline! Would stay here again.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apartment is large and has plenty of space. It's not really in a neighborhood but downtown is walkable. It is on top of the owner's business and has steep stairs leading up to the apartment. There is a nice porch to enjoy morning coffee. The refrigerator is small and there isn't a stove or dishwasher. These things didn't spoil our stay. Leah and Edward were available anytime and we met Edward our first morning. He is friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A GEM in Downtown Johnstown! We were realized surprised by how large the apartment was, and especially loved the screened porch and rooftop. Also the decor was super cool, and we enjoyed the easy walkability to downtown.
Would definitely return!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leah and Edward responded almost immediately to my questions, both before arrival and once I was checked in. The apartment smelled like fresh laundry when we walked in, beautiful white linens on the beds and plush bathroom towels, a generous supply. Immaculate and very large living areas that offered plenty of space for my husband to work remotely, while I could be in another room. We loved the sunroom.
And it was appreciated that the lights were turned on in the rooms when we got there, as it was already after sunset. Great hosts."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so fun, eclectic and unique. Tastefully decorated and feels like a throwback to another slower time. It is excellent for walking to downtown - tons of local restaurants and businesses along with a brewery. Just a short distance to the Mill Rats Baseball stadium too. If you are considering a visit to Johnstown, stay here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leah's place was a Triumph! What a unique comfy place. Our daughter loved the turntable and records:) We would highly recommend staying.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I really enjoyed my stay here! It is a high-quality Airbnb with gracious hosts who clearly have put a lot of thought and care into the apartment and the guest experience. The apartment is very spacious, clean, comfortable, and well-decorated with character. I appreciated that the apartment feels private and that it was easy to park nearby and to load and unload my car. The sunroom was a special extra space and I enjoyed drinking my coffee in the morning. I was traveling with my cat and also so appreciated that the hosts were okay to have her stay. The hosts are very friendly and easy and quick to communicate with via Airbnb messenger. I would 100% stay again if in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really nice place to stay while in town. Very easy to access.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everyone who stayed loved the place, especially the sunroom with access to the roof for some fresh air. All who stayed were surprised by how spacious it was. The record player was in use as soon as we arrived. Cool collection of music. This Airbnb is in a private area and in a great location to a concert venue, the train station and stuff downtown."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great stay that exceeded my expectations! Very clean and comfortable. Walkable to good restaurants. Would not hesitate to re-book!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay the host was friendly and the apartment was beautiful and super clean. it was uniquely decorated and was so much fun to explore. highly recommended to others visiting the area.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is great! The location, for us, was fantastic. We love trains, and they're right across the street (no crossing nearby if you don't like whistles). We were able to walk to a couple of places (brewery), and the apartment sits separate from any other residential dwellings (as far as we could tell). It's spacious and decorated in a very fun way (which made for great Easter egg hiding spots during our Easter weekend stay). The records and tapes were a highlight for the 11 and 14-year-old. Should you have more than 2 people and not want to share a bed, the couch was comfy, according to 11. We were able to easily cook with our instant pot we brought along, so don't let the lack of full kitchen deter you if you can't eat every meal out. Leah and Ed are great; this is our second stay with them, and they have been responsive and helpful when needed. Will definitely stay with them again. If you have a pet, there's a walkway along the river that served our dog's needs well."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great space to stay in. It was very comfortable and spacious, with comfortable seating and thoughtful decor, as well as an awesome sunroom! They even provided a pack and play for our 1 year old. Location is very walkable. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Large, immaculate space. Responsive and kind hosts.
Very happy that I chose this listing to book."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Super clean, rustic and REAL vintage decor, responsive and friendly host who owns the photography studio downstairs, free coffee and Kcups, and a great selection of records to listen to on their record player. Bedrooms are very comfy and luxurious feeling especially with the large amour in the primary. Very safe as well. Will definitely stay again if needing to come through Johnstown!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying with Ed and Leah. They are truly fantastic hosts. We always have everything we need, super comfortable beds, quality linens and dishes. We can’t wait to come back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When we make plans to visit family, we alway check for availability here. The owners are very accomodating. This last visit was for a funeral, they allowed me to check in early to make the viewing. That was above an beyond.
The apartment is always perfect."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and the owners were very responsive when we had questions. The house is decorated very cool and has everything we needed! Would definitely stay again if we are in the area!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place. We went to concert. Museum and ate great. Thank You
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place is spacious, comfy and well-decorated. Parking is easy, and it’s extremely convenient if you’re arriving to Johnstown by train. Communication with the hosts is seamless as well! They were very prompt to respond any time we had questions, and they even checked in mid-stay to make sure that everything was going well."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and large apartment across the street from Johnstown rail station. Quiet location except for the rumble of the trains. Many empty lots and no other residential houses in the block.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay when heading to Johnstown for a concert over the weekend! The place is a perfect location for concert goers because you can easily walk to and from the venue (1st summit arena) in less than 10 minutes! The space was exactly as described! The upstairs unit was over a photography studio, and across from an Amtrak station, and surrounded by a large parking lot. There weren’t a lot of people coming and going which gave a nice feeling of privacy to the stay. For dog owners, there’s a strip of grass next to the building, but if that’s not enough for your pups there’s some grass next to a paved walking trail right around the corner that worked well for our pups! The place was great, and the owner was very nice, and came out from the photography studio to say hi and check in on us when we were walking to our car in the morning. Fantastic place, will stay again when in Johnstown! Thank you Leah and Edward!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, comfortable unit with a lot of character. Right next to the train station, so very convenient if you’re taking the train in."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leah's place was exactly what we were looking for, a place in Johnstown that was central to our visit. I met my family at the Amtrak station which is right across the street. Huge bathroom, plenty of space, warm and cozy. We will definitely check to see if it is available next time we're in the area."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, spacious and bright! Leah’s listing was the perfect place for our young family to have a space of our own while visiting family for the holidays. The hosts were responsive and friendly and they set out the pack n play for us to use for our 3 month old daughter; it was perfect. The furniture is stylish and comfortable!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A gem of a spot in downtown Johnstown - highly recommend! This was our second stay at Leah and Edward’s place, and we couldn’t be happier with the accommodations. Clean, comfortable, centrally located right downtown, and available on short notice. They even accommodated a late check out for us - 5 star stay. Thank you for a wonderful holiday week!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I wish I could give Ed and Leah 10 stars because it is so deserving. We stayed here over Christmas while visiting family. We absolutely LOVED this place and will be staying again when it is warmer.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was beautiful, and very cozy!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Better than described! Love the stylish decor, and every window framed a story of the charming town. The apartment was nicely stocked with amenities and essentials and fluffy beds, pillows, and towels. There was an assortment of coffees and flavors. The freezer had fresh ice cubes 🧊. Great parking, and I could auto start my car from the window. There are great eats and local shops within walking distance or a two minute drive - also easy parking. All easy access. By chance, Ed was heading out from the main floor studio when I arrived, and he took the time to offer a warm welcome. I didn't need anything during my visit, but I did send a quick message to offer my gratitude for a VERY clean and cozy experience, and Ed responded in seconds. On my last day out, I stopped in the studio, and Ed gave me some history on the building, the apartment decor, and the town. Appreciate the history and time! This is a great place to stay for any reason or no reason at all. Thanks to Leah and Ed!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was such a great place for us to stay. My husband and I stayed with out 2 dogs while he had a work obligation over the weekend. It was a super cool setup with all of the older memorabilia. The location was close to local restaurants. The only thing to be aware of is there is a bus station across the street so if you are brining a pet and they bark at people this could be a concern.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, comfortable and centrally located! We stayed while visiting family and had a great experience. Edward had everything ready to go for check-in and we appreciated his hospitality! Would definitely stay there again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay at this apartment, we love the setting inside - stylish but comfortable - with great proximity to downtown. Edward and Leah are great to work with. Highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed here a couple of times. It centrally located to everything in town. Decorated with cool antique motorcycle signs and antique. The train station is across the street, so noise level goes up at times, but I’m from the city so it
didn’t bother us.
We will definitely return!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spacious and beautifully decorated apartment in the heart of town. Communication from the host was excellent and everything was perfect during my stay.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Very nice and a pleasure to stay there.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! The apartment is spacious - the decor is fun and tasteful. It was perfect for our weekend and the hosts were wonderfully kind and welcoming. We would definitely stay here again if we come back to Johnstown!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This spot is awesome! Old school cool, with a very cozy feel. Clean, well appointed, organized and old school cool."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic apartment! Very comfortable beds and rooms. The decor is incredible plus the rooftop views were amazing. We were in town for a family wedding and highly recommend- plenty of room!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fabulous experience. Convenient parking, rooms are very spacious, located near activities, and nicely decorated. Hosts respond very quickly and make the whole experience flawless. Great value for money, as hotels don't come anywhere near the experience/amenities, unless they cost $800 a night, or more!
We stopped on the way to Maine, but definitely worth stopping here even if out of the way. Amtrak station is across the street, so come by train or come by car."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leah and Ed were super nice the entire time of our stay! Our concert got cancelled and they gave us a list of things we could do, even gave us restaurants to try! It was such a cute place and the town is beautiful! We will be coming back soon."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Leahs place was really nice and unique. Very easy to find and and was very spacious. My teens loved exploring all the found objects throughout the home. For a small town there sure is rich history there and the museum right across bridge is really cool. Enjoyed this gem.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very large place…with unique decorations. Decor included a lot of American history.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Amazing!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay in, very clean and spacious."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay here. The hosts were great communicators. Decor super cute. Loved the record player. Close to some fun places. Were able to listen to a live concert the next street over on the roof top outside of the sunroom with a glass of wine. Very cool.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a GREAT place to stay. It's located right downtown and is convenient for everything. It is extremely clean, much larger than it appears in pictures, has lots of windows for natural light, and has very comfortable beds. The bathroom is large with a large supply of bath linens. The decor is unique with a lot of fun things to look at. It is located on the second floor so there are stairs to climb, but they are inside and very doable. Do not be deterred by the fact that it is directly across the street from the train station - noise is not an issue. Parking is very convenient in the lot right next to the building. Leah and Edward are good hosts and very responsive. If you're looking for a place to stay in Johnstown this is it!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts, location, size, check in/out, communication, etc. The cleanliness and size of the space was absolutely top notch. And we loved hanging out on the roof late and/or the steps in front of the studio taking in the scenes. Highly recommended for anything happening in downtown Johnstown."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great rental, great location, fabulous hosts! Immaculately clean, super comfortable. LOTS of room to spread out. We will definitely be back when in the area! If you are going to the Flood Museum, leave your car parked here and just walk the couple of blocks to the museum. The “museum parking” is closer to the rental than to the museum."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leah and Edward were amazing hosts. They were very welcoming and quick to respond to questions.
We truly enjoyed our stay at the loft. It was well designed, comfortable and quiet. It was much larger than we anticipated.
We will stay again if we are in the area."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This 2 bedroom apartment was perfect for our three day weekend in Johnstown! It was super clean, well decorated and had everything we needed. The record player was such a fun and unique touch. We would stay here again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Leah’s place. It was clean, comfortable and very spacious. I’d call it a great value. We appreciated being steps away from People’s Natural Gas Park as we were there for Polka Fest."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at this beautifully decorated and super clean apartment. Hosts are always quick to respond. Location is perfect. Will be booking for our next time as soon as we can!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"our second time staying here, and it was again a wonderful experience!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time staying at this trendy loft apartment in Johnstown! The unit is located in an accessible part of Johnstown with very little traffic. The loft apartment is above the owner's photography studio and exceeded our expectations! Check-in was a breeze- the unit is airy, clean, and the lay-out is fantastic. Upon entering, you will ascend a flight of stairs to the apartment door. Once there, you will enter and the bathroom is on the right across from the first bedroom. Large size bathroom with a gorgeous free standing tub. Hot water and awesome water pressure make for a relaxing shower and bath. Further down the hall is the second 'master' bedroom with a comfortable bed and plenty of room to relax. Both bedrooms have ample windows and light, plenty of fluffy pillows and fresh linens, and comfy chairs/table lamps. The dining room is the first room you will enter and it has a beautiful table and chairs. To the right is the kitchen and the sun room. We can't say enough about this sun room! It is so spacious and offers a sofa and two very relaxing arm chairs/chaise lounges. It is filled with light and offers a beautiful view of the city- especially the Johnstown Incline Plane! The living room sits to the front of the unit and has a really cool stereo system, records, TV and comfortable sofa/chairs. We were so impressed with this unit for its lay-out and design, but also for the cleanliness and plentiful amenities. What made our experience even better than outstanding was the kind and thoughtful hosts, Edward and Leah. They are available to answer any questions you might have and go above and beyond to ensure you have everything you need for an amazing stay and experience in Johnstown. We reached out several times to ask for recommendations and they got back to us immediately with suggestions. We enjoyed our stay in Johnstown so much, we ended up staying longer! We highly recommend the hosts and their properties!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed at Leah and Edward's home with my three dogs and we had a lovely stay. I was so surprised by the size of the apartment. It is so open and bright, yet incredibly cozy. We had everything we needed! Leah and Edward were wonderful hosts and incredibly responsive and kind."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Well worth the price of admission. the space is a true tribute to the history of the building. If you are a motorcycles enthusiasts or historian this is the place for you.
The space is huge. The rooms are wonderful and warm."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is clean, and well-appointed, and surprisingly large. It feels much more put together than your average Airbnb. It is on the second floor of a cool, old building, up an easy flight of stairs. Everything felt very well taken care of in the apartment and there were plentiful bath linens available.
We stayed in the apartment to take a class at the Center for Metal Arts, which is only half a mile away. There were many restaurants within walking distance, though many of them closed at 6:00 on Saturday and were closed on Sunday, so do your research. It is also directly across the street from the Amtrak station, so you could conceivably take the train to town and leave your car behind.
Leah was a wonderful host and very communicative. Check-in was very smooth."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful and clean space! I loved all of the natural light and unique decor/furniture this space provided :) The owners are also incredible, very kind and great communicators! I would definitely rent again!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place very roomy for us and two dogs! Close to everything in town. Draw back in winter is not everything is shoveled around the town for easy walking but the drive is only 3 minutes! Highly recommend these hosts!

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! This place is a hidden gem in the heart of downtown Johnstown.

The whole place was very clean and communication was incredibly quick. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Plenty of space allows everyone to stretch out and relax. Can’t wait to return!

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Leah’s apartment is absolutely incredible! I used this space as a venue to spend a quiet night with a few bridesmaids the night before my wedding, and a venue for getting ready the day of my wedding. Everything was impeccably clean and decorated beautifully. The apartment is spacious and there was more than enough room for everyone to spread out! All of my bridesmaids and my photographer could not stop complimenting the space and the breathtaking views from the sunroom and rooftop. We loved it so much that we did a rooftop photo shoot, even in the cold October rain! I can not recommend this space enough and how absolutely perfect it is for this purpose. Leah and Ed were both excellent hosts and were quick to communicate the entire weekend and answer all of my questions. This space enhanced my wedding experience and I am so grateful that Johnstown has such a beautiful location for visitors and locals to stay and gain a new appreciation for the city."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very nice place to stay. Everything went well from start to finish. We would stay here again if we have the chance.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Very spacious. Loved the motorcycle decor and looking at and playing some of the extensive record collection on the record player. Very nostalgic.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is exactly as described and in the photos. Very welcoming place. It's directly across from the Amtrak station, so some train noise, but it didn't bother me! I found it relaxing! The stack of vinyl was Fantastic way to relax and kick back. Easy walk to downtown Johnstown and Critchton Rehab Center. That was the purpose of my visit, my husband was recuperating there.
Very nice hosts and great place! Clean and nice. Thanks for the wonderful stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where to start. Definitely a five star airbnb. This was the first bnb that my family and I stayed at. The apartment was comfortable, clean and we felt at home. It was so much nicer than staying in a hotel and only having one room, two beds and a tv. My son is 17 years old so he enjoyed the enclosed porch and having a room to himself. It was nice to come back to the apartment and relax. We were not in each other’s way since we had so many rooms to escape to. The decor was so cool. Great place to stay to enjoy the Johnstown area. And we enjoyed the vinyl records. Had music on all weekend."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,We used this air bnb to get ready for our wedding at PNG Park. It was absolutely perfect and they were so accommodating. Will definitely be staying again if we ever need to attend another event there! Thank you guys!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was so spacious and clean. The decor comfortable and uniquely appointed. It was the perfect location for our event at The Peoples Natural Gas Park. The hosts were so flexible with our Check-in time, allowing us time to change for our wedding after traveling. They were quick to respond to all of our communication."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very clean and modern apartment that is super close to downtown! Hands down best place to stay in Johnstown! Terrific hosts!!!!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leah and Ed are excellent hosts.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Me and my family adored the apartment-the vibe of the place was so cute! We were in town for Pleasure Valley Raceway and it was a perfect place for us to stay for the weekend. I would definitely stay there again!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,A must stay location in Johnstown. It is absolutely beautiful inside and out! We enjoyed our stay very much!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying there. Love everything about it, comfort, space, location, etc."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,This was the perfect place for my bridesmaids and I to have one last girl’s night and get some photos before my big day. Highly recommend to anyone staying in the area!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful place and the hosts were wonderful. It has a great view and is in a great location - within walking distance of downtown, walking trails along the river, and the incline. I would definitely recommend the place if you are staying in town."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So glad we stayed here instead of a hotel! Leah and Edward’s place is very spacious and extremely clean. We were able to walk to the flood museum, restaurants and bars. Easy check-in and check out. Hope to stay here again soon."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, clean space, tastefully decorated.... lots of natural light, loved everything about it"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family (4 adults, one toddler, dogs) went to stay at this amazing space above a studio. It was the perfect location to visit idlewild and soakzone! That night we loved relaxing on the patio porch and enjoying the great water pressure to the shower after a long day at a theme park. Everything was clean, had all the basics, and had a great travel theme throughout the place. Would definitely recommend if in the area!! Loved our hosts- very responsive anytime we had a question about things we needed to bring!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fab spacious apartment with cool “vibe”! We will be back!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place with a lot of interesting decorations and a sun room that’s a fantastic place to hang out.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Leah & Ed's place far exceeded our expectations!
Their 2 bedroom flat looked nice & clean in the photos. In person, you get a fun, cozy vintage vibe that a photo just can't convey! Their vintage motorcycle repair parts, old oil cans, antique mirrors, turntable stereo system with a big basket of albums and mid-century mod furniture & decor is SPOT ON! The flat was very roomy with a big kitchen with mini fridge and oversized farm sink, dining room, living room and the super sunny funky sunroom! The huge bathroom was well-appointed with plenty of fresh white towels, washcloths, soap, shampoo & conditioner. I opened the vanity to look for the hair dryer and found even more supplies that a traveler might need. The shower head and water pressure were perfect! The two bedrooms were large, beds were very firm and comfortable with cozy duvets and bed linens. Our group consisted of 3 females, 1 male and 1 infant. The bigger bedroom was plenty big to accommodate the pack & play for the baby to sleep in. We also really appreciated that the dresser in each room had big mirrors attached as well as great lighting so that we could do hair & makeup outside the bathroom.
One note: the stairs at the entrance are rather steep. It wasn't a problem for us but might be if you have trouble with stairs.
The location in downtown Johnstown fit our needs perfectly. If you are going to Jtown for sightseeing, you will be just a block or two from the Flood Museum, Amtrack is across the street, grocery store is less than a mile away as are the Incline Plane and the stadium. Don't forget to pick up some Coney Island dogs and some gobs!
This space made this our most comfortable trip back to Johnstown yet. Ed & Leah were very accommodating with some small needs we had on arrival--very gracious hosts! We look forward to staying here again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! This place is so spacious, clean and at a good location. Couldn’t ask for more. Great, responsive hosts as well!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very large, clean and comfortable, second floor apartment. Beds are gel foam type and very comfortable. Decor is eclectic leaning toward art decor / modern, with retro elements. Leah and her husband were very communicative and pleasant.
I would recommend this stay, photos depict what you actually will receive."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful off-the-beaten-path condo. Super clean and plenty of space. The record player was a major highlight. And the owners are great hosts! Be sure to get the BBQ brisket pizza at Stone Bridge Brewery (a recommendation from Leah!).
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this charming apartment for my best friend Kristin Carter and her sister Dana as they needed to be in Johnstown. This was a very last minute trip and Leah was very sweet and accommodating. Kristin had nothing but great things to say about the apartment and she has booked it again.
Thank you Leah for taking care of my soul sister 😊"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is so cute and spacious. Lots of clean towels, comfy beds and a great location. The hosts always responded to any of our questions quickly. We will definitely stay again when we visit Johnstown."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leah was a great host. She responded quickly to questions. The space is bigger than advertised. There are lots of nice touches. I would highly recommend.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leah and Ed!
Best warm and warm hosts!
So pleased to be able to experience this
magical and very stylish establishment!!!!
Reggie"
2021-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment but across from train station which was frequently noisy. Owners very nice to deal with, ample parking."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly like the pictures. So welcoming, homey and much more space than we imagined. Completely clean, and they even thought of extension cords/surge protectors so no searching for an outlet. Truly felt like I was at home. The beds were so comfortable, the comforters my new favorite. The decor and albums brought such enjoyable memories. They even stocked coffee k-cups! They were quick and responsive to messages and questions. Already looking forward to returning. This will be my go to when I go to Johnstown."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leah and Ed were very quick to respond before and during our stay. The house was in a great location and provided us with great relaxation and rest! I would stay here again! Thank you so much!
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay! The place was all we wanted! It was clean, spacey and creatively decorated. The beds were very comfortable and I loved the claw foottub! The weather was perfect for relaxing on the sun porch. We will definitely be back next time we come into town!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really cool spot!
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,They were great hosts. It was very clean and the sun room was gorgeous.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice and cozy space. We met Leah and Ed and they are very nice people. Leah had tons of local tips to do around the area. It would be nice if she added those on the listing. The space was clean and spacious. We loved the sunroom and the record player with a variety of vinyls. Always happy to find a pet friendly Airbnb.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You won’t find a better place to stay in Johnstown! Great apartment with tons of space, great decor, and a great view of downtown! I look forward to staying again in the near future!!!!"
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Cool decor, easy walks to several points of interest and thoughtful recommendations from the host."
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Leah's place was super comfortable, stylish and welcoming. Communication with the hosts was easy, quick and seamless. Ed was around on the downstairs studio a few times and it was a pleasure to speak with him! The apartment was spacious, sparkly clean, had a nice LP player and a little collection of vinyl records that we enjoyed, and super comfortable beds!
If you're noise sensitive you may need to bring ear plugs because the trains run during the night as well. I don't mind the noise, which is usually not intrusive (no whistling, just passing by), but it's something to consider. We really enjoyed renting bikes from a local tubing company and biking the flood trail, as well as seeing the flood museum."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Big, spacious, squeaky clean apartment all to your self. Early 1900s architecture and mid century furnishing, with an industrial vibe makes this a fun place to stay. The mattresses are modern and really comfortable (clearly not the owners hand me down). Really large full bathroom with clawfoot tub and a dramatic 4 season porch. From the corkscrew to tons of fresh white towels, no detail is missed by our host.
The location is across from a sleepy Amtrak station (the trains are not noisy, and present only as low rumble) and super close to Main street Johnstown. You can almost throw a rock at the Johnstown Flood Museum. Minutes from the Johnstown Funicular, art galleries, shops, Heritage Discovery Center, Historic Grandview Cemetery.
Had a great meal from Balance on Main Street. Parking is metered and coin operated. 30 mn per half hour. Remember to grab some quarters, but there was plenty of on street parking or a municipal parking garage is available where you can pay with a card at the kiosk before exiting. Asiago Italian restaurant is just up the hill near the Grandview Cemetery and the top of the funicular and its gift shop. Curbside ordered dinner on second night from them. Convenient and good food to take back to the apartment. Check out the eclectic Westmont neighborhood tucked between Grandview and the top of the funicular before returning to the apartment.
Do not miss the many public parks in the area. Do not be intimidated by the hills. Stackhouse Park is close by and includes paths for every level of walk/hike ability. We were there early spring as things were just starting to green up. Great views or babbling brook, its all here. Will comeback in the high season to check out the Mill Rats play ball."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leah’s place was fantastic! Gorgeously decorated! And the sunroom was such a great place to relax 😍 They had everything there to make the stay comfortable plus tons of extras such as coffee and extension cords! They were also super responsive and kind!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very well appointed and comfortable apartment and sparkling clean! This place has it all, so close to downtown, 5-10 min walk. Mattresses and furniture are SOOO comfortable. You will not be disappointed with a stay here. The bar/restaurant around the corner has the friendliest owners. Our puppy enjoyed his stay also. Great find!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a great place to stay. It was exactly as described in every way.
2021-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place with a stylish motorcycle-themed decor. The hosts are wonderful and extremely helpful. The place is close to Laurel-hill state parks for skiing , hiking and other outdoor activities as well. Overall it was a wonderful stay at this place."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, well decorated, comfortable. I would recommend to anyone looking to stay in Johnstown."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, very stylish! Fantastic location and even better communication with the owners!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very stylish space with a great vibe! We stayed comfortably with our 2 kids and puppy. The house was bigger than we thought and Leah was very kind to leave lots of board games for our family. There is not much to do in Johnstown in winter, but we were looking for a clean and safe getaway and planned to mostly remain indoors. The kitchen is limited but worked fine for us. The old style radiators for heat can be noisy, so bring white noise/fan."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is super cool, clean and comfortable. The hosts are very responsive and we’ve enjoyed our stay every time."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding hospitality! Even better location. Perfect location, with an amazing vibe. 10/10 recommend this Air BNB"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you, Leah! Your space was just what we were hoping for. Very comfortable, clean space with fun decor and close to everything we needed."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Good location, beautiful decor with really cool vibe, extremely comfortable, warm and inviting hosts. A nightcap on the back sunroom with a view of the mountains and incline plane is a great way to close down the night. We will absolutely stay again. Thanks Leah and Ed! See you again soon!"
2020-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,Nice guest house situated next to a gare station
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay, place was very clean and comfortable! Will definitely be back! Host was quick to respond, very pleasant experience!!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We only stayed one night so didn’t get to explore the area but enjoyed our stay very much. I would stay there again.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a delight! The space itself is huge and a great value for two bedrooms in a beautiful area. We found the location to be perfect - just across the bridge and within easy biking/walking distance from downtown. It is across the street from the train tracks, but nothing extreme for those who are used to city noise. Leah is super responsive, accommodating, and has lots of great tips for the area. I would recommend without hesitation!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leah's place in Johnstown was perfect. The space is nicely decorated, incredibly clean, had great touches throughout and came with ample parking. The sun room first thing in the morning and in the evening was such a great feature. Leah was always responsive for any questions we might have and the check-in/out was a breeze. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if we are ever in Johnstown."
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,Had to come to Johnstown for a wedding I was in. We found this perfect air b&b. The house was very big and much bigger than expected. Both host were great! Answered every question we had. Very clean!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I and our 3 year old son had a great weekend getaway in Johnstown. Watching the trains and walking to town made this a great location for our trip. Everything was clean. I especially appreciated all of the extra towels provided, which is sometimes lacking in an Airbnb. Leah was very communicative and quick to offer us tips for our stay, which was very appreciated."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Leah and Edward’s incredible apartment.
The screened in porch and bathroom are straight out of a magazine!
The first night there were two trains in the middle of the night but fortunately the a/c provided some white noise. The second night there was a massive wedding outside so we were super grateful that again the a/c drowned out the sound.
We were so happy that we found somewhere that was dog friendly that was so nice. We don’t want to compromise the luxury of a nice stay, but we hate to travel dogless."
2020-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The apartment is very stylish, clean, and nicely appointed. The area is very industrial - right next to the railway and surrounded by warehouses but was very quiet on the weekend when we were there. I'm not sure what the noise levels would be like for the train when the AC wasn't running but we didn't have any trouble sleeping. The biggest issue for us was specific to our family. We were traveling across country with our toddler and all the vintage touches of antique road signs and vinyl records on the ground were not toddler friendly. We spent a lot of time chasing after our toddler when he was awake trying to ensure that he didn't break anything or try to lick the rusty signs. Overall, a very stylishly redone apartment. Best for adult travelers."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Definitely plan on returning in future.
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Very clean space! It was within walking distance of Coal Tubin’ which was perfect for our trip!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First of all, the place was sparkling clean, which is to me one of the most important aspects of a rental. The decor was gorgeous and the porch was my favorite part. The view was phenomenal. The host communicates in a friendly, professional, and prompt manner. Highly, highly recommend this space ☺️"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay at
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cool, comfortable, clean, spacious, and great communication with hosts! Expect that full flight of steep steps (handrails on both sides and non skid treads) and limited kitchen (Dorm fridge, microwave, toaster oven and Keurig). Sidewalks leading to all kinds of new discoveries Downtown- even if you are from Johnstown!!!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stylish apartment that brought back many memories looking through the vinyl records. Nicely decorated and extremely clean. We had a lot of fun playing games on the closed in porch.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to say! Check in was a breeze, the space was so roomy and comfortable. We loved our stay, and already booked again for July!!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a big and beautiful space! Amazing decor! Perfect spot for our family of four to spend the night during a long road trip.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This air bnb is so cozy, we were under the impression it was surrounded by greenery but it's definitely in an industrial location. We loved it and didn't mind as it was quiet and comfortable. Water pressure in the shower is awesome and unfortunately many air bnbs I've stayed in do not get that hot. Everything was so clean and we loved the vintage touches. Subtitles on the TV made it easy to watch as I have difficulty hearing. Some TVS are difficult to find how to place captions. I loved the patio and looking at the steep train tracks. The roof is also a calm place to relax and view everything. We did travel around Johnstown but didnt fancy the area and we were viewing homes to see if we would want to live around town. Air bnb is definitely 5 stars! Plenty of coffee and we left brand new icecream as our 6/7 hour trip back home it would surely melt. Thankyou for making it super easy to book!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved this space!! Beautiful apartment with so much character. Came for engagement photos and hosts were so flexible and accommodating for check in and check out. Dog loved it too!!
2020-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place!
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay at Leah's place. The apartment was clean, stylish, comfortable and relaxing. Loved the curated interior, especially the sunroom. Leah was also quick to respond to messages and very helpful."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was truly one of the finest AirBnb stays that I have experienced. Being a Johnstown PA native, Leah’s place truly resembled what it’s like to be from Johnstown PA! The location is excellent, you’re right off of RT56 by the Point Stadium, so it’s easy access to all points in Johnstown.
The host responded immediately to all of my messages & made the process of checking in extremely easy. The place is extremely clean & feels literally brand new. The place is well furnished with elegant clean bedding. All amenities that are needed for a home away from home are there for you. There is plenty of parking that makes access to the place extremely easy. I felt as safe and welcomed here as I do in my own home. It is decorated with a touch of Victorian style appeal for the ladies & motorcycle/classic car appeal for the fellas. Literally, it is a couples retreat for any age group. I highly recommended this stay for anyone, you truly will not be disappointed.
On an extra note, if you are to attend Johnstown’s famous Thunder in the Valley motorcycle rally, there is NO better spot in Cambria county to stay! I hope everyone enjoys Leah’s place as much as I did. I surely will be back!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a fantastic gem - beautiful space with lots to discover. Loved staying here and we will certainly stay here again when we next find ourselves in the area!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time staying at this location and I won't go anywhere else. The space is beautiful and clean. Leah is responsive and attentive to my needs. I can't wait to stay again!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family had a wonderful stay at this lovely apartment. It was clean and had plenty of space for three children and four adults. The pictures don’t give it justice. I would suggest bringing a white noise machine to drown out the sound of the trains in the middle of the night. There were also several restaurants that deliver through Door Dash. Overall, it was much better than staying in a hotel."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place! Will definitely be going back!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am a local Photographer and was looking for a place to hold indoor sessions. I reached out to Leah and she was more than accommodating! The place was absolutely amazing! The decor was so awesome, the lighting was PERFECT and everything was so clean. All of my clients were raving about how amazing the apartment is! I will defenitely be back!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a place in Johnstown, look no further. This place is awesome, such cool decor. Very clean. Wish we could’ve utilized the screened porch ( because it’s awesome) but it was cold and snowy. Family is from the area and we’ll try to book Leah’s place for now on."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and location
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little spot to stay when in town! I'll definitely look here when visiting again!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful! Leah was great with communication and the place was super clean, stylish and comfortable. Would definitely stay again. The only note us that the radiators are noisy and I'm not used to the old school steam ones. But overall great stay."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This will definitely be my go to for all trips to the Johnstown area from here on out! Super clean, great space, awesome decor and Leah is fantastic in providing info on things of interest. Really enjoyed my stay, there really isn't anything she hasn't thought of!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Like other reviewers have stated, the pictures don't do the place justice. Very clean, very neat, very cool. Big rooms, lots of room for a family to spread out. Sorry we could only spend one night here."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, beautifully decorated and spacious! A diamond in the heart of Johnstown!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is awesome. Great decor, private location with awesome views of the inclined plane. Owners are a breeze to deal with. Will definitely be returning when visiting family."

2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect for a quick visit. Everything was thought out. This is our new go to place when we are in town.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing time at our stay with Anne.. She was very nice and super accommodating. Her place is a home away from home. The food downstairs was delicious and we will be coming back the next time we are in the area ❤️
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great find in Johnstown. We were visiting family and the location was great. 2 bedrooms and another 2 beds are on the 3rd floor. Perfect little spot for kids or teens to have their own space. We will stay there again the next time we visit family. Having a deli below is a bonus as well.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Anna’s an excellent host with a beautiful rental. Always timely with responses to messages and flexible with her check-in and check out time. Would definitely recommend this location to anyone staying in Johnstown.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Very roomy and convient location.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Anne’s Airbnb was perfect. It was so cozy and comfortable, and nice having a deli downstairs to order food. We were in town for the junior high wrestling state championships and I’m glad we stayed here rather than a hotel."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tracey is one of the kindest, sweetest people I have ever met. She was extremely responsive & helpful both before & during our stay.
The farmhouse was perfect for our family getaway. We have 3 large dogs & they loved playing in the fenced in yard. The beds were also very comfortable. My husband has serious back issues & complains about the beds everywhere we stay, but he actually slept great.
I can’t thank Tracy enough for hosting us. We will definitely stay again if we’re in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome host! Like always, nice and clean house. Tracey is always responsive and super nice. Thank you"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tracy was amazing she went above and beyond thank you.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed at Tracey’s place for a long weekend as our son plays for the local Junior hockey team. Approximately 20 min to the rink which was convenient after we got used to the curvy roads.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We really appreciated Tracey’s hospitality and she welcomed our large dog without question, which is such a pleasant contrast to many rentals.
The home was just as described and we enjoyed our stay."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great farmhouse! We loved our stay! Tracey is very nice and communicative!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tracey was so easy to contact and always responded. She was helpful and friendly. I felt like home in her Farmhouse. I didn't want to leave.
It was exactly as pictured. The fenced in yard was just right for my dog. The covered porches were enjoyable to sit on and great for some peace and fresh air. 2 bathrooms(1 up and 1 down) were definitely a great amenity. The kitchen was easy to get around and cook in. There was even a radio and some LED lights! The kitchen was were I hung out the most.
There are also books to read and puzzles to do and there was even a mad libs book! There is a small pool table/foosball/hockey game as well. The little pool table was fun. I'm not a reader but I found myself wanting to read a book while I was there.
The beds were comfortable and everything was clean. I can't say enough good things about Tracey and her Farmhouse! I wish her great success and would stay there again.
The scenery up the road is just gorgeous."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hostess, very accommodating and helpful! Home is very clean and organized. Nice grill and wonderful seating at the kitchen island! The pictures are very accurate on the layout. Spacious bedrooms and comfortable beds. A beautiful area especially in the fall! Great for pets with a portion of the yard fenced in but plenty of room on property to throw a ball. I will definitely be staying here again!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cozy farmhouse with everything we needed as a young family with two children 6 and 8. Everyone felt right at home and our young pup couldn’t get enough of the country feel. The house was capable of handling much more and was very well thought out and labeled nicely.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracey is like a concierge at a 5-star hotel: so thoughtful, nice, communicative. All the amenities in a well-loved and well-maintained, old farmhouse that feels like your best friend’s home and is truly dog-friendly.
The special touches truly stand out: a detailed guidebook, firewood, first aid kit, ice packs in the freezer, books, games, puzzles, fishing poles, paper plates, extra towels, comfy blankets, high-quality pots & pans, great plates set & big mugs/glasses, big Weber outdoor gas grill, much more.
Tracey’s photos and descriptions are accurate. The rooms are spacious, the beds were surprisingly very comfortable, and the kitchen had all the essentials, including coffee fixings & bottled water.
We especially enjoyed the covered porches, the fenced-in backyard for our two (big) dogs, the fire pit under the stars, the peaceful location. Tracey understands that dogs are family.
We stayed because it’s conveniently located near Saint Francis University. Will stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was great. When they say “dog friendly” they mean it. They didn’t flinch when I said St Bernard. And they had dog bowls and a mat.
The fenced in backyard was small but was great for him to run in with us.
The kitchen nice. I really liked the dishes!
Very comfortable and clean.
Wish we had brought our adult children’s families. There would have been room. It was nice. We felt like we were at home."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"House was very clean, clear instructions & very peaceful. Tracey was very responsive and kind."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tracey's home was perfect. It was away from town, but not too far! I was a bridesmaid in a wedding at Hickston Run Farm, which is less than 5 minutes from the house. So convenient. The house was very clean and has a fenced-in yard for our very excited 100lb dog that can be hard to leash walk at times. Her check-in flexibility was great since we were unable to arrive before 10 p.m. Check out directions were easy and realistic. I would love to stay here again in the future!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just book the place, you won’t regret.
Amazing experience"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,The house is wonderfully furnished there’s more items than you could ever need there. Tracey was a fantastic host and communicated promptly. The home was clean. Organized everything was labeled and the outdoor space was wonderful.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We were looking for a home that would accomodate my entire family. Tracey's place was perfect! So much room for everyone inside and out! The setting is peaceful and way less stressful than staying in a hotel. There are restaurants and stores nearby, and it was a short drive to downtown Johnstown, Richland and Westmont. Tracey was such an amazing host and went above and beyond to accommodate my Mom's stay. She has mobility issues and couldn't go upstairs, so Tracey rearranged the laundry room downstairs so she could have her own private room, and bathroom. My family and I will definitely be staying at Tracey's on our next visit to Johnstown!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was very comfortable. It had everything I needed for the weekend. Tracy was quick to respond to me to answer my questions. Very friendly. It was a very enjoyable weekend.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tracey’s place was perfect. Definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for somewhere to stay in town.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Details for property clearly explained. Wonderful write up on the history of the farm. House was clean, organized, including draws, cupboards labeled (very helpful!). Purpose of trip was to bury my mom, glad to have such a peaceful place to rest during the difficult experience.
Thank you."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful farmhouse that was easy to find and conveniently located without sacrificing being in the quiet country. Tracy was available and responded within minutes to questions. She communicated prior to our stay to determine any additional needs we may have had, left wonderful note for us upon arrival welcoming us to explore and pick berries. Accomadations exceeded our expectations! Definitely will stay again as we have family in the area that we can visit and still have the homey feel that hotel lacks."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy was such a great host! We truly enjoyed our stay and the lovely home and environment. It was peaceful and relaxing, and we truly enjoyed the hummingbirds visiting. Had it not rained so much, we would have loved to explore the property and game lands as well. Maybe next time. until then, many thanks!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cleanest AirBnB we have stayed at yet! Even the front and back porches were very clean!! What a delightful old house that has many renovations and updates, and has been nicely maintained. This AirBnB has so many personal touches and it’s obvious that the owners love this house! It’s location is on a quiet country road which is idyllic and peaceful. The kitchen was very clean and had ample supplies. The owner/host is the Queen of labels and everything was so easy to find! We especially loved sitting on the back porch and watching many hummingbirds visit the feeder. We would definitely stay at this very comfortable AirBnB again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful for end of a busy day but close to lots of fun things to do.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracey’s place was perfect for our girls’ getaway weekend! Fresh seasonal garden flowers and a special message greeted us upon opening the door. The farmhouse was well stocked with everything we needed for a comfortable stay in this private and peaceful setting. Tracey was incredibly responsive to every question, giving detailed instructions and suggestions. She made us feel welcome and at home. Don’t hesitate to book this Airbnb if you are looking for a getaway in the mountains of PA. You won’t be disappointed!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The rolling hills and waterfalls added to the character of this delightful farmhouse. The outbuildings and the baby animals were the icing on the cake! Great spot to jump off from to get to surrounding nightlife if inclined. The stars were fabulous! Visit this spot for complete serenity, a deep exhale and the cares of the world slip away."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved Tracey’s place, it was so peaceful there. And the area was such a beautiful setting. Tracey was awesome, she responded immediately to whatever questions or needs we had. Sorry we couldn’t stay longer!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Every thing was very nice.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Tracey was an absolutely amazing host! Her secluded farmhouse had everything and more for our stay. She was very helpful and responsive with every step of the booking and stay even with flexibility with checking in early and staying longer. !Fresh eggs = Delicious! Very clean and beautiful farmhouse. Would recommend and stay again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here while filming our show, Paranormal Quest, over at the old Cresson Prison.
Tracey was very friendly and responsive to anything we needed and was even kind enough to offer a late checkout after filming all night.
The home was very comfortable and quiet with all the extras you could need!
We loved being greeted by the chickens and wished we had some feed to throw for them.
We will definitely stay here in the future if we’re in the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great rural location with beautiful scenery. Very clean and plenty of instructions plus Tracey is very helpful & responsive.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Friends of ours from out of state stayed here at Tracey's.
The entire stay was very pleasant with no problems at all.
They were very pleased and would be happy to stay here again next time they are in the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great hospitality! Hated to leave! Felt like leaving family.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great stay for what I needed. The house is as described and Tracey is extremely helpful. Tracey was on the property twice during our stay to take care of the friendly chickens but they were so discrete that we never even noticed them show up or leave or be there either time other than Tracey letting us know via a message. The house is well appointed and I loved that every room from bedrooms to TV room had throw blankets. It was definitely a house in which to cuddle with a good book! The internet was fast despite the secluded location. Tracey left water and coffee to get us started. I didn't take advantage of the kitchen as I was only there for a one night stay. I will definitely use the property again in the future when I need something in the area.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tracey was a great hostess, communicating with us and checking in to see if we needed anything. She has arranged the home to make you feel ""at home"" and we really appreciated all the extra touches. We were meeting our college age son for a visit, halfway between both our homes. Tracey's kitchen was well stoked with every cooking implement, and I cooked lots of home-made foods for his birthday & St. Patrick's Day.
The views out every window were lovely. We had great night's sleep as the mattresses were amazingly comfortable. We woke our first morning to the sounds of turkeys ""gobbling"" in the woods and birdsong. You can't beat that. Also, the home is close to many interesting places to visit. We went to the Johnstown Flood Museum, Fallingwaters, Latrobe, PA - home of Mr. Rogers and the wonderful Mr. Rogers exhibition at St. Vincent College and the Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic site. AND, there was still plenty to do - we just ran out of time. We hope to come back again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place for a family to stay
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the retro vibe.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfectly matched with the Cambria City neighborhood. Great furnishings and decor. Excellent stay for a traveler coming into Johnstown for Flood City Music Festival or similar events. Lots of room for a family.
Would stay again"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiance and I stayed here for the weekend to do some wedding planning stuff in Pittsburgh, and enjoy the nature the Johnstown area has to offer. The house itself is so beautifully decorated, and we enjoyed the cozy homey atmosphere as we put together our save the dates & other exciting things. Our only complaint is that this rental isn't closer to our venue!! If it was, we'd definitely be back again this time next year to get ready here for our wedding. The place is so cute and eclectic for pictures and feels homey. Also- the king bed was SUPER comfy and hosts worked hard to make us feel welcome in the space. They also made sure we were privy to anything we'd need to know before our stay! Definitely recommend."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Super cute house with charm. Reminded me of my grandma and grandpas house but cuter. Had some old house quirks but didn’t bother me at all. Only thing is the neighborhood wasn’t the best. I felt safe in the house but I wouldn’t go for a walk or run in the neighborhood. At one point some guy was outside on hide phone screaming obscenities. Other than that it was perfect.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So cute! Definitely staying here again

We hope to stay with Sara next time we’re in town to visit family!"

P.S. Make sure you try The Boulevard while you’re in town!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sara’s place was even better than the pics on the listing. It was such a great step back in time with retro style yet many modern conveniences like WiFi, smart TV’s and central heat and air. Sara has an awesome eye for decor and we had so much fun being surrounded by all of it. She has added so many nice touches throughout that do not go unnoticed. We even cooked many side dishes in the kitchen to bring to our family Thanksgiving, which was well equipped for what we needed. Our king bed was so comfy that we were sad to leave it.
All in all, an amazing place for a great price. We will be back when coming to the area!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, spacious home that has an awesome retro vibe with decorations and upgrades, retaining a large amount of original elements.

Sara is honest about the houses quirks being so old and having been through so much local history, but she's polished this gem up! We loved all the tiny details, and the retro theme was so much fun! Her price is great, and it's truly beyond what I thought I would find in Johnstown. We will be back if it's available for sure! (My other traveling family members now know about Sara's place, so I may have to race to book first for our future family get-togethers!)
You should definitely check this place out!!!"

The location is surprisingly peaceful in a very-well-maintained neighborhood despite its proximity to a boisterous and deteriorating Johnstown ""city."" Would totally stay there again. Note that parking for motorcycles is best on the street (very safe!) -- the driveway is very steep."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristina was so wonderful! My flight didn’t land until midnight, and yet she kindly waited up for me to greet me/show me the ropes. Her and her boyfriend were so friendly — any time I’d come down before leaving they’d offer me a drink and ask how everything was; super accommodating. Also, the room is darling and I loved falling asleep with the windows cracked listening to the rain. The best place you could stay in Johnstown, I’d say!"

She went out of her way to assist me with learning about the wonderful Johnstown area, history, and ""culture"". The room and bath was very private and I slept like rock in sateen sheets! The Internet was strong enough to do video calls and meetings for work. We departed with a quick tour of the local Center For Metal Arts school. I encourage everyone to check it out and make a donation to their non-profit!
I can't wait to return!"

2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"I had a lovely stay at this location. It is conveniently located near the Arena, flood museum and nice restaurants. You even have a view of the famous incline from the kitchen window. Antonio is very responsive and wants to take care of his guests. This is a historic building with an apartment that has been updated and has all the necessities to make your stay enjoyable. Don’t let the older outside exterior fool you. I’m glad I stayed here rather than the Holiday Inn around the corner. It is peaceful, spacious and nice to have our own kitchen."
