Definitely great fit for us doing a week long training. Thanks so much Darren."

Beautiful art work across the house, very well maintained and thought fully designed, instructions are very well laid out by Darren.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don't let the unassuming nature of the exterior of the home fool you - inside is a well planned, beautiful space with wonderful seating areas and excellent kitchen space, and modern baths. The view walking out of the front door of the Flatiron mountains sets the tone for exploring the city and environs of Boulder. Safe area with excellent breakfast restaurants within .3 mile walking distance. Darren's welcome book highlights numerous restaurants, sights, and experiences around Boulder - and he has them broken down into walking and driving categories. Small notes around home make it clear how various items work, and the overall tone of the place is welcoming and well-cared for. His guest book has numerous other how-tos for the area, and makes for a good introduction to Boulder. The home does lack a washer and dryer, but there is a very good public laundry within walking distance. One of the best AirBnB's I've ever come across."

I loved that there were 3 living room seating areas. the fireplace made it so warm and cozy. it was a great place to relax with a cup of tra and discuss what we were learning by the fireplace. The house was easy to find and close to everything we needed for our stay. Whole Foods, Walmart, and restaurants just a couple blocks away. and the artwork! It was so beautiful, in all areas of thr house, plus the doors were works of art. I can't say enough good about this place, which was 1000% better than any hotel even thought of being. We are looking forward to coming back again. And again!"

We especially enjoyed the artwork and plants throughout the home, the spacious and well appointed kitchen, the comfortable couches and chairs around the fireplace, and the neighborhood itself.

The art and plants around the house made it feel very homey with lots of neat places to gather and talk.

We appreciated his flexibility and friendly response. Thanks Darren."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay in Boulder. The space was very clean and there was a helpful binder with instructions in the kitchen. We did have a little trouble figuring out how to lock the door and the AC had been off for a while when we arrived, so it was quite warm. AC kicked in and the nighttime was a comfortable temperature inside."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Naming it 'The Gallery' is not a misnomer: Darren has 'curated' a great place to stay when in Boulder -- with beautiful artwork (paintings and photos) that livens the space!! And the numerous, large houseplants further enhance the vibrant feel of the living areas! Overall, Darren's home is open and spacious -- and he's created multiple comfortable living/seating areas that effectively provide individual mini-retreats for several people staying there at the same time. The home is well-appointed with comfortable furniture, and the cozy fireplace adds warmth on cold winter days.
The beds were very comfortable, and the bath towels were plush. The cupboards had a variety of cooking supplies that Darren graciously made available.
The House Manual was also a work of art: comprehensive in the information provided, and very nicely written with glimpses of Darren's sense of humor.
It's clear why Darren's earned Superhost status - he does a great job all-around!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Gallery is an excellent place to stay in Boulder. We had two couples and there was plenty of space for us to spread out or have privacy as needed. Since our stay was in the fall, the fire place was a perfect addition. The house is located in a quiet neighborhood close to endless hikes in South Boulder and a small shopping center with all the amenities. Darren was a very responsive and respectful host. Our space felt very private even though the host lives downstairs. We will stay again if the opportunity arises."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We needed a place to stay for one night between travels, and this worked out good for us. Good location and easy check in and communication. Only issue was the air conditioning. When we first came in it was very warm in the house, we set the thermostat down and went to dinner upon our return it was still very hot. I reached out to Darren and he said the ac turns itself up if no one is in the house, which is very unfortunate because it would take over two house to cool down again. We pulled out some fans and went to bed. I woke up two hours later and our room/bathroom was still hot, the rest of the house seemed cool so I had to leave the door open and it did help some. The yard/garden was disheveled looking but that seemed on par when comparing to near by homes."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This home was absolutely perfect and very comfortable. 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms were great. The kitchen was well appointed and the backyard space was lovely.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place worked out great for our family. We had plenty of space to spread out. The place is much bigger than it looks in the photos. We could be sleeping and not hear anything in the other part of the house. The big table was great for games and socializing. The kitchen was well set up and we did lots of cooking. The place has many interesting personal touches. We enjoyed the garden, the plants inside, the original art and the comfortable family atmosphere. I would stay there again."

We really enjoyed our week long stay and would stay here again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a place close to CU Boulder campus and this was only about 2.5 miles away. Cute and quiet neighborhood. The house was clean and comfortable with plenty of room. The rental portion was on the main level of the house. We saw Darren twice, outside working in the garden and he was fun & informative about the area. Other than that we did not see or hear him. We will definitely stay here again if we are in Boulder."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had booked Darren's place before, and it was even better than I remembered. Beautiful place, spacious, clean, easy walking distance to South Boulder and easy to bus around town if you don't have a car. Darren is a gracious host!! I look forward to booking again."

His place is clean, cozy and you’ll enjoy his personal art and succulent collection. Darren is very helpful and he communicates right away. He was very responsive and answered all of our questions right away. The house is in a great location in south Boulder with easy and close access to two grocery stores (Whole Foods and a King Soopers). It’s close to restaurants and a great ice cream shop. It’s within 10 minutes of CU Boulder and 15 or so minutes from Boulder’s walking mall - Pearl Street. This is a very welcoming and comfortable stay while on your travels. I highly recommend Darren’s house."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kid friendly place! Stayed here for 3 nights with my 2 and 4 year olds. Great local park is a short walk away. Lots of space to spread out and relax (in the house and the park!) My children loved his paintings (they are hung high enough to stay away from little toddler sticky fingers!) and the many board games. Highly recommend Darren's place to anyone looking for a nice place in Boulder! Finally, THE VIEW of the mountains when you step on his porch, WOW. Darren's place will be my first place to contact should my family and I ever find ourselves in Boulder again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay. We were there due to fires and glad to have hot shower, kitchen to cook in and separate bedroom for our kiddo. No cable which meant I could not watch the local news but forcing myself to not be glued the catastrophe was good."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an excellent house very close to Boulder. It is very spacious with two living rooms, one with fireplace, dining room, well equipped kitchen, and two good size bedrooms. Darren was an excellent host and communicated well before and during the stay. The house is outside the hustle of Boulder, but you are less than ten minutes away from downtown.
Our stay was shortened due to the horrible wildfires. Darren went out of his way to check on us multiple times during our stay and even suggested we may want to leave early given what was going on.
We would definitely look to stay here again when coming to Boulder."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Lots of space and Darren very available

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darren was very polite, and communicative. He let us know that he was there if we needed him, but wouldn’t be in our way. His place is located in a nice neighborhood near all the fun stuff, but away from the noise. Nice interior, and well stocked kitchen area."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Darren offers a lovely house at an affordable price. He was very communicative. Everything was clean and ready for our arrival.

Highly recommend staying here for your visit!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Darren's place is located in a quiet neighborhood. It is a lovely house, with beautiful artwork. We enjoyed our stay in Boulder."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Darren's home is a perfect home away from home while exploring the Denver area. It is spacious, warm and inviting. He has a thorough welcome binder with all the information you could possibly think of, but if for some reason there is not something listed in it - he is an easy text away and always responds promptly. The amenities in the bathroom were a nice touch as you never know what you might get and he has full size shampoos, conditioners and body wash available. Our kids really loved the chess table! Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed in Darren’s lovely home for 5 days while we explored Boulder as well as Rocky Mountain NP. Though we would have liked to be closer to the downtown core, we really liked that only 2 miles away were 40 miles of hiking trails that go into the Flatirons and beyond. The kitchen is well-equipped. Though the house could use some updates, it has plenty of space to spread out. Darren’s interesting, colorful art adorns walls in every room and even a bathroom ceiling. The linens are excellent and the mattresses are wonderful. Darren was extremely responsive when we contacted him about a minor plumbing issue. He also gave us some fresh-picked veggies from his garden! All in all, we had a very nice stay. We recommend his house to anyone who doesn’t need very modern accommodations but who wants spaciousness, comfort and a responsive host."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Every amenity you could think of, such a treat - thank you Darren - hopefully we'll make it back to Boulder soon!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darren was very accommodating and kept in great communication. It was very easy to get in his place. His place is clean and very nicely decorated, large, and comfortable. It was nicely furnished. Just before my stay there let us know that the water would be shut off during my stay. Daren offered to let me out of it if I wanted. I went ahead and stayed and he got me a bottle of nice wine for my inconvenience."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cannot say enough good things about our stay at the Gallery. This was a beautiful, clean home with wonderful amenities. The kitchen was very well equipped and had really nice appliances. The beds were also very comfortable with high quality linens. The Gallery is also in a super convenient location for just about anything you’d want to do in Boulder. Darren was an excellent host and very friendly. He has also created the most thoughtful guestbook I’ve come across so far in my Airbnb travels! It was also really cool to get to enjoy his artwork throughout the home."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great South Boulder location. Clean, laid back, spacious with cool art. I would definitely consider staying at The Gallery next time I’m in Boulder."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Alex
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Alex's place, it was so charming! The weather was a bit chilly when we were there, but everything was cozy in the house and we made great use of the hot tub. The beds were very comfortable, as was the sofa, and the kitchen was clean and spacious. As noted in some other reviews, the bathroom was quite small but very efficient and easy to use. We were just passing through as part of a road trip but would have loved this space for a work trip or longer stay, it was really very well set up and we instantly felt at home. Would absolutely stay here again, thanks for having us!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable and comfortable place. It has a small but very efficient bathroom, cozy bedrooms, and a great backyard.
The hosts were super gracious and accommodating. I was sad to leave!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location for a business trip/ mini vacation with our kids

Alex is great at communicating when we had questions!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I were in town to visit our son at CU Boulder and Alex’s place was perfect. We especially enjoyed the hot tub, as well as the giant TV on college football game day! Alex was a great host and the home was spacious, clean and easy to access. We would definitely stay in Alex’s home on a future visit."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Alex was a very responsive host. It was a perfect spot for a local wedding in Boulder. We had five staying at the house with one bath so that was a little challenging at times, but overall it worked out great. The studio in the back of the house and the hot tub were an added plus!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing home in a beautiful location. Alex’s place is tastefully decorated, cozy, and clean. We absolutely loved our time there and will look to stay again whenever we’re next in Boulder. Parking in the driveway was a little tricky but it would never hinder me from staying here. There was always ample parking on the adjacent side street a few houses down. I can honestly say it’s one of the nicest airbnbs I’ve stayed in. Don’t hesitate to book!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great experience and stay! Thank you!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I stayed in Alex‘s beautiful home while we were in Boulder for a wedding. The pictures do not do it justice: it was the perfect size for five of us, and both the indoor and outdoor spaces lent themselves to a truly relaxing, lovely stay. The house is just far enough from Pearl Street so that you feel like you’re truly in a neighborhood, but close enough that everything is at your fingertips. There are incredible trails all around you, the hot tub in the yard is an absolute perk, and every bed is extremely comfortable. The kitchen has everything you could ask for, as well!
Thank you Alex for being such a gracious host, we hope to stay with you next time we are in town!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay. Alex was a perfect host.
Helped extend the stay.
The house was clean, fully equipped with all that we needed.
Great location."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful AirBnb. The main house feels more spacious than it is due to great design choices, such as the shower curtain rod that rotates out for showers and then back to provide more room. The kitchen was well stocked with everything you need. The couch was super comfy with great pillows and blanket and the bedrooms were thoughtfully furnished with comfortable beds, reading lamps, even boxes of tissue. And the backyard patio was beautiful, with a gorgeous, comfortable studio cabin two could work in. Really appreciated the Aeron chairs! The only issue was being on a big noisy street, but the double-pane windows work really well and we only noticed it when we had the windows open at night."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at Alex’s cozy home in Boulder. He was very helpful in providing the necessary information upon our arrival and just before our departure. The house has a calm environment and is very well-equipped. We especially enjoyed spending some relaxing moments in the charming backyard garden!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and cozy!
Awesome communication too!
Thank you for a great weekend get away!"

Thanks!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was perfect for us!
Claire gave us great instructions/directions to get there, check in, and check out without overcomplicating things! It was very easy and the house itself is incredibly cute and clean. The hot tub was a nice addition even in the heat.
We had everything we needed and it was a nice walk to some shops and then a little further to Downtown Boulder.
We would definitely recommend this home and stay here again ourselves!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay in Claire's house. What a great location and so beautifully decorated. Claire was always friendly and responsive. We appreciated all the special touches and all the amenities. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved everything about this sweet home. The kitchen had some basics in the fridge and cabinets which was both helpful and refreshing! Why throw the ketchup away right?! The location was lovely-nice walk or short drive to everything in this fun plex of a town. The hot tub was perfect for a soak after going hiking. The towels were super soft and the shower exquisite! Relaxing sitting area out back. Very nice grill! It is a driveway right off a main road but we were warned of this and parked on a side street 2 houses away as suggested. Hope to stay here again!!!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Claire was a great host.
House is very clean. Perfect for us as a family of 5. There is a bedroom in the backyard that the fifth person stayed in and they said it was great. Close to downtown and restaurants and hikes."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Cute spot, very clean and great location. But driveway is very tricky!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great & clean place with everything you need. Some very nice extra touches, chocolate on arrival and amazing hot tub. The beds were super comfy!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! I LOVE this place!
Not only would I love to have Claire decorate my house but I want to know where she finds her inspiration.
This was one of the most luxurious airbnbs I have stayed in.
I say this because not only was the place thoughtfully designed, but the appliances and space were furnished with top of the line pieces - the stove was amazing and the cookware was high quality.
The bathroom was modern and fun! Ingeniously designed for a tiny bathroom so that it felt full sized and open.
My favorite was the backyard. It was so peaceful and the stepping stones were out of a fairy tale to a beautiful and cozy workspace with a day bed. (Note - pillows were dreamy soft and abundant!)
I spent the first night relaxing on the day bed and fell asleep to the sounds of rain and distant thunder storms; simply magical.
The simple soft lighting hanging through the backyard gave the most relaxing starlight setting - and the hot tub was fabulous after a long busy day. I will be back!❤️"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, cozy please. Just wish the weather would have been to enjoy the outdoor space and hot tub."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super comfortable Airbnb. Easy to find, easy to check in, extremely clean! It had everything we needed and the hot tub was a fantastic touch…it was also very clean and well maintained! Great stay for me, my husband, our two babies, and my mom!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an awesome time staying. The location was perfect! We were able to walk to pearl street many times. The place was clean and spacious. Bathroom was a little small, but we made it work. Having the hot tub was a great way to spend the evening after a day of hiking. Overall, great place!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place! Squeaky clean and easy to get to everything you’d ever want to do in Boulder!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ — And would give more if possible! Felt like home, very well organized, and appreciated the privacy and cleanliness of the entire home! Hot tub was amazing as well. Highly recommend and will book again on for our next ski trip in Colorado!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,We had an amazing stay at Claire’s Airbnb! It looked exactly the way the pictures look and was very clean. The jacuzzi was a big bonus with the string lights in the back yard. It’s close to downtown and some hiking trails as well. Claire sent us check in and check out information before we even asking for it and always replied quickly. I would absolutely recommend this place!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"incredible stay! the hot tub, proximity to pearl st, communication from hosts, EVERYTHING was 10/10."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful visit to Boulder. Natalie was extremely responsive to all my questions. She also gave me a great list of things to do and see and we hit them all! The home was in great proximity to downtown. We loved the hot tub and used it multiple times.
The bath and kitchen were fully stocked which was wonderful. Shampoo, hair dryer, coffee, sugar, tea, kitchenware, etc.
I highly recommend Natalie and Ari as hosts and enjoyed the property."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,I only had to stay here for 1 night for work but it was really nice to have a dedicated office and the hot tub at the end of night.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow! Ari's place is a wonderful home, tastefully decorated and equipped with everything you could need. We especially loved sitting out in the hot tub with the fairy lights twinkling above us. The kitchen had everything we needed and more, all the appliances and furnishings are new and high quality. This place comfortably slept 4 but I would come back with my whole family of 6. The separate structure at the back means the third bedroom has more privacy, and doubles as a great place for working remotely (large desk, great internet, naturally lit). Will definitely be visiting again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was absolutely perfect for my family of 5. It was spotless and so cute. The cabin in back was awesome and we used the hot tub almost every day.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend a stay here. Literally minutes from Pearl St. and its attraction. Not much matches brewing a fresh pot of coffee (Trader Joe’s provided) and stepping out onto a deck to see the Flatirons in all their glory.

2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"The stay was beautiful! I proposed to my partner and we enjoyed a night on Pearl St which was a 10 min walk from us!
The view of the Rockies and Flat Irons were amazing. We also really enjoyed the built-in record player along with their music selection!
One thing I didn't consider and I think others should know- there are little to no curtains or blinds in this unit.
The children's room has a door and blinds, but the rest of the unit is VERY open. I can't fault the listing as it didn't have curtains in the pictures, but me and my fiance wished we had just a little more privacy from any onlookers who might walk by.
Otherwise, this was a great stop on our trip!"

It is a short walk to Pearl Street and all the great shops/restaurants Boulder has to offer. Lonny was very friendly, responsive and helpful - he came up to help me get the record player working and even had his son help me carry an awkward item up the stairs. It was such a wonderful stay I was tempted to call in sick to work and stay an extra day! I will definitely be back."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Frye house was such a relaxing and beautiful location for a much needed weekend away.

The place is beautifully airy and light-filled, charming, and with spectacular views of Boulder and the mountains. You get the benefits of a spacious open floor plan and the privacy of a bedroom as well. Aesthetically-pleasing and well-maintained, you couldn't ask for a more relaxing and comfortable place to stay after a day spent exploring Boulder (you are right in town) or taking a day hike. The deck is also wonderful! Lonny is friendly and thoughtful. This place is my #1 airbnb stay!"

Waking up in the morning to the sunrise hitting the flatirons was stunning! Pearl St is a short walk and it’s close to so many delicious restaurants and the most amazing coffee shops. The house was tidy and open. We absolutely loved our stay and my husband was excited to see Lonny and talk with him about our stay while he packed our car up. We loved the rooster in the morning as well. Nothing but positive things to say about this Airbnb! We’d definitely come back time and time again here.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved Lonny’s place and hope to stay again!! Such a beautiful, charming, cozy house with tons of natural light. This is a smaller space and best fit for one or two people. It was perfect for my husband and I. It was lovely having coffee on the balcony each morning and taking in the sun rising on the mountains. The space was very clean and had everything we could’ve imagined needing. Easy to find, easy to get in and out of. Lonny gave us lots of great ideas for places to eat and visit! We loved meeting his chickens!! The house is VERY close to Pearl street where you can find all kinds of amazing food and drinks, lots of shopping, and it was great being able to walk instead of paying for street parking.

We were in town for a wedding and we were so sad to leave. there were three of us, a couple and a friends, and it was perfect. It was filled with natural light, unique touches, great shower pressure, incredible kitchen, the best views, comfortable beds, and it was stocked to the nines. The only thing that was difficult was the stairs, but they do not call it a penthouse for no reason. The location was as good as it gets. We felt like we were in a home away from home but better between the record player, landscaping, porches, and chickens. HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend. Lonny said goodbye to us as we were packing the car and he was gracious, thoughtful, and wanted to share his magical space with others. Would come back a million times, but bring a smaller suitcase."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a lovely escape for a girls weekend! Lonny was extremely responsive and his instructions for getting to the house itself and then the penthouse where we were staying were very clear. There are two very separate sleeping areas which was nice, and the kitchen was very clean and well stocked with appliances and the basics (coffee, tea, snacks, etc...). Everything was extremely well thought out for guests. We very much appreciated the easy checkout - there wasn't a long list of things to get done before we left! The view from the deck was also spectacular and the chickens in the garden were so sweet to see every time we walked by. This is located extremely close to great restaurants! Highly recommend!"

The house is located on a beautiful property with unique gardens and adorable chickens kept us entertain every time we walk through. Even though the unit is on the third level, it was a easy walk up. The views are just breathtaking, you can see the sun rise and set in the mountains. Every morning I would get up and spend a few moments drinking my coffee and meditating on the beautiful deck.
When we were their temperatures got a little hot and the air conditioning worked great. Inside the unit we had plenty of space for my husband and two children. The kitchen had so much space and everything you could possibly need. Beds were cozy and comfortable. Plenty of linens.
If you are looking for a unique space, with beautiful character and views, book it!!!"

The residence was clean and well-maintained, and I got to meet Lonny on the morning of our departure before walking to Pearl Street for some coffee. He was tending to a gorgeous sunflower garden and was very pleasant to chat with. Thank you to the hosts for providing such a great place to stay after our wedding, we would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet and peaceful escape in Boulder."

I will be recommending this stay to friends who are planning to come to Boulder in the near futures. 10/10"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our daughter said it best, “this place feels like home”.

Walking distance to tons of hiking trails or a short Lyft ride ($10). Victor day trip to Rocky Mountain NP pick up/drop off short Lyft ride away, or walk. Walked from bus station. Lovely neighborhood. Walked to WF for some food at the place. Lonny was a welcoming host when I arrived but not intrusive at all. Very private. Bed comfy, shower had strength. Totally clean. As is clear from description, you must be able to carry luggage up 2 flights of outdoor stairs. Happy! Highly recommend and would stay there again. Thank you, Lonny!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We can't say enough about our stay here--certainly one of the best AirBnBs we've experienced in terms of host communication and thoughtfulness, and how well stocked the apartment is. The location is superb--in a beautiful historic neighborhood within easy walking distance downtown (the only time we drove anywhere was to go hiking and to the nearby Trader Joe's). We couldn't get enough of the mountain views from the deck and loved the cozy vibe of the apartment, a perfect size for two adults and a child. We really appreciated Lonny's thoughtful touches, from the coffee and creamer on hand, to the record and game collection, to his suggestions for navigating road closures because of a race that was going on. Boulder is an incredibly special place and we'd certainly stay here again."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were able to meet Lonny upon our arrival and he was very gracious. Communication before and during was super smooth. The penthouse makes you feel very special being able to view the flat irons unobstructed was lovely. Plenty of amenities in both bathroom and kitchen. Loved the turn table and assortment of old vinyls. Deco was beautiful and clutter free. Lonny was super helpful with suggestions and just fun to talk with about his gorgeous house and the surrounding area. I would definitely recommend staying. One thing to be aware of is if you are real tall, since this is the top area of the house with cool ceiling angles, you will need to be more aware of your surroundings then a shorter person."

I loved the wonderful recommendations, and we highly recommend The Kitchen and Lucille’s. Even if we were not going out, they thought of our every need for the house such as a hairdryer, coffee and creamer, and much more.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful and beautiful home surrounded by well-tended flowers, yet a stone's throw from the hub-bub of Boulder. Lonny was very kind and accommodating. Love the chickens! Great A/C and airflow - the only way we knew we were on the third floor was because of the great view of the mountains. We were initially nervous about whether the ceiling height was going to make us feel cramped, but there was lot of space - enough to where everyone had the privacy they needed (though, sound will still carry some). Not a lot of ability to block out the sunlight in the AM, but that worked for us -- we woke up early and watched the sunrise. Cool and sufficient appliances and cookware -- felt like a home away from home."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very comfortable stay in the Penthouse. The rental is exactly as described on the Airbnb website. Lonny was on site and very helpful with recommendations and information for us, which we appreciated being first time visitors to Boulder! Clean, quite, convenient and comfortable.

We will definitely stay here again if we return to Boulder.

Lonny was very accommodating and the silky chickens were always happy to see us.
There is a pull-out bed in the couch if you need it. FYI: It is upstairs, which makes the views great, but something to consider if you have mobility issues."

We had a one night stay and loved literally every second. The whole property is stunning, but the penthouse is truly special. We can tell that a lot of time was spent making this space truly unique. It felt like home the moment we stepped in. The vintage records & record player were an amazing touch, we enjoyed several records. Our favorite one being the The Sound of Music, my gf was singing with it beautifully, a memory I will remember for the rest of our lives."

It’s a beautiful and peaceful neighborhood. The place had everything you’re likely to need, was clean, and comfortable. As a basement unit, it’s inevitable that quite a lot of sound travels from the main house above, but it didn’t bother us."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay with a great host. The communication was perfect and fast, location is just amazing, close to campus but also to nature! The accommodation exceeded expectations. When I visit Boulder again, this would be my first pick!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really sweet place close to Chataqua. Really appreciated the cleanliness and flow of the space. Loved location and amenities. One challenge we came across were the pillows which were quite uncomfortable for us but we are picky when it comes to pillows, so take that with a grain of salt. Perhaps more variety in pillows would be helpful. We didn't reach out to the hosts about this, and it's very possible other pillows could have been available if we did. Otherwise great stay and definitely would stay again! The hosts were flexible and sweet, friendly and responsive. Great Work y'all"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying here and we enjoyed ourselves again. Great spot close to the park and walkable to many spots.

Highly recommend staying here when you visit Boulder!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was fantastic! The location was incredible- very close to campus and the mountain hiking trails. I learned how to ride the scooters around town and it was so convenient. The neighborhood is beautiful, with cute houses and spring flowers popping up everywhere.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Colin & Virginia’s AirBNB is AMAZING. From the booking process to checkout and everything in between, it was a seamless experience. Before we arrived I had a number of questions about the area & always received a thorough & helpful response within 5 minutes. Checkin couldn’t have been easier and the place was wonderful, it was well organized, well furnished, comfortable & spotless. The bathroom was pristine and the bed was extremely comfortable and the living space was a great size. All of the amenities were great and they even left snacks for us. The location was perfect, a few blocks from the CU Boulder campus, definitely walkable and also close to town. The neighborhood was very nice and close to restaurants and the Chautauqua Park which we also enjoyed. Virginia and Colin could not have been nicer or more welcoming. It was by far our best AirBNB experience, they set the bar very high. I highly recommend this spot! Thank you Colin & Virginia!"

I wanted a little quiet time for hiking and writing before attending a conference in Denver, and Colin & Virgina's place was absolutely perfect for what I was looking for. Although the unit itself was just right, what really blew me away was how close I was to many fantastic hiking trails. Some of the best trails in Boulder were just a few blocks away. The hosts also responded immediately every time I messaged them and Virgina greeted me when I got there and was very friendly but unintrusive. I will probably stay there again!"

See my previous review for more!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for a weekend in Boulder. It had everything I needed, was super clean, and was steps from the beautiful Chautauqua Park. Checking in and out was super easy, and even though it was a basement apartment, I hardly heard any noise from above."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I gave 4 instead of 5 stars on value, but it was actually a better value than anything within miles-- Boulder is expensive, but the view of the Flatirons when you walk out of Virginia's place is priceless. The tree-lined streets are quiet and it feels safe. The place is cozy and clean--which is important to me. It is a very short walk to Memorial Center on campus, and a few blocks to Chautauqua Park. Virginia and Colin are considerate--not obtrusive, but ready to help! I would love to stay there again :)"

The Check-in process, the descriptions, the department itself - everything so top of the notch and easy that we felt directly after arriving like home and that feeling kept through all days. Location ist calm and nice neighboorhood. You are in minutes at the local hiking area. We also walked to close supermarkets, the university hood and even Downtown (maybe 25 minutes or so, but you can also take Bus) - Just in case of you don't have a car. Tons of information in the apartment and a super comfy bed after your excursions in and around Boulder - which is a real nice open minded and progressive city in our eyes. Thanks again for such a nice stay during our trip and all the best to you!!!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Colin and Virginia's place. The location can't be beat; it's within walking distance to Chataqua Park and a mile walk to downtown.
Colin and Virginia greeted us upon arrival and made sure we were able to get into the unit and had everything we needed to make sure it was a comfortable stay, including an umbrella for the weather!
They were both immensely friendly while leaving us to do our thing. It felt more like we were staying at a friend's or family's place rather than an AirBNB.

The hosts were extremely helpful and very responsive. They left a note and binder full of local information about the town. Street parking was plentiful and the hosts provided a permit. It’s a short Uber ride to downtown or a 10 minute walk to the bus stop through a gorgeous neighborhood, which made it really easy to get around the whole city. We’ve stayed at numerous Airbnbs throughout the years and we were very impressed with the hosts and this location. We love Boulder!"

Her rental unit is a basement apartment, but with plenty of windows that allow enough natural light into the house so it doesn't feel closed-in or underground. The neighborhood is beautiful and close to lots of good places to shop, hike and dine. The only negative is that the unit does not have a full kitchen- there is no stove top so cooking here is somewhat limited. But other than that it's a fabulous place to stay."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in Ashley’s guest house. Even though it’s in the basement, it has good light and it’s immaculately clean. Ashley provided everything we needed and even loaned us some water bottles for our bikes. We appreciated that the space was uncluttered and modern. And the location is phenomenal! Right next to North Boulder park and in a really nice neighborhood. Easy to walk to good restaurants, Whole Foods, Pearl St, Boulder Theater, etc. My only hesitation in recommending it is that we want to stay there next time we’re in Boulder and I don’t want it to be booked up!"

Truly is walking distance from grocery store, pharmacy and coffee shop! Also walking distance to pearl st! The streets are walking friendly, with very wide sidewalks on either side of the street. Often times we’d walk to pearl st for breakfast/lunch, walk back to the Airbnb, and eventually talk back to pearl st and back for dinner"

As advertised, it’s a great place to hike right into the Flatirons. Easy parking. Nice and quiet during our stay. And huge bonus points for having a bag of good coffee beans and the grinder to put them into action."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Ah where do I begin? So many positive things to say. For context, I spent ~4 months working remotely from Jane’s house. From the moment I arrived I felt at home until the moment I left I was saying goodbye to my new family. It was a dream for me to live in Boulder and Jane and her husband John helped me fulfill that. Their stay has everything you need from cooking to parking to the private bathroom etc. Both Jane and John were great at balancing your private space while also being inviting to conversation or dinner. There hasn’t been an Airbnb I’ve stayed at that has lived up to such a high rating across all categories like this one. Living there was easy and fun. The room gets a ton of natural light and was comfortable to work from. They’ve got four cats with all different-fun personalities too. I’ll for sure be back and highly recommend to anyone looking for either a short term or long term stay."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with Jane and John and would definitely stay with them again. They helped me with getting from the airport to their beautiful home and made me feel extremely welcome.
The kitchen is the best equipped kitchen I've ever seen, so if you like to do your own cooking, you are in for a treat!
The accommodation is extremely comfortable, and the bathroom is spotlessly clean with added toiletries. It really is a home from home. There's some fabulous and interesting art too!
Jane and John offered lots of ideas and information on local activities, and I enjoyed hiking a few of the Chautauqua trails.
The property is located in the north of Boulder and is in a very peaceful neighbourhood. It's about 30 minutes by bus bus to the downtown area and there's a large excellent supermarket 25 minutes on foot and 5 minutes by car.
Highly recommended."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much to Jane & her husband, John. They are the nicest, most welcoming people. I felt at home & was welcomed by their kitties who are so playful & fun. The home is just beautiful, well decorated. It was so clean. The bedroom is on the first floor with a private bathroom right next to it with all that you would need for your stay. The bed was very comfy. I wished I was staying longer. They also allowed me to wait in their home as my flight is very late at night. I could not have picked a better place to stay.

I highly recommend this stay in Boulder, especially being able to meet their adorable cats!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jane and John are outstanding hosts. Jane was super communicative before and during my stay. They are the friendliest people you can hope to meet, and I felt like they wholeheartedly welcomed me into their home. They really are advocates for Boulder, and they're a great asset for a visitor with any questions about the city. The location is on the North side of Boulder: it was a quick trip for me to their place from Rocky Mountain National Park, and it's a great, quiet base from which I could explore Boulder. I went for a run at the nearby Wonderland Lake trailhead at dawn. It was spectacular. I unhesitatingly recommend them as hosts and I would definitely stay with them again. 10/10 🙂"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jane and John were honestly the most kind, gracious, welcoming, and wonderful hosts. I’m super thankful for them for having me stay and for being the best hosts I’ve experienced on Airbnb. Aside their kindness, the house was beautiful and immaculate, cats super cute, peaceful residential neighbourhood, and a really relaxed environment. Then there’s the local area, jeez…I spent 4 days hiking, driving, and running in some of the most beautiful scenery I’ve ever seen in my life. If I’m ever back in Boulder (fingers crossed) then I’ll be looking to stay again. Thanks folks"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"First of all, when I first arrived at Jane’s home her husband John unlocked the door and welcomed me in. I felt right at home. Both of them were very helpful in recommending nearby activities, and Jane was especially responsive on the app. They’re very friendly people that want to make guests feel welcome. It’s not in a centralized location, but there are plenty of options to get downtown if you want (I drove and parked at a garage).
Jane and John have inspired me to potentially open an AirBnb in my own home (one day)!"

Minutes to all the great things Boulder has to offer!
Highly recommend."

It felt like staying with friends rather than strangers."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jane and John's house was large, gorgeous, and sparkling clean. It was very new, modern with tall ceilings, and beautifully decorated like an art museum. The neighborhood was classy and quiet. The bedroom was super cozy, with a variety of pillows you can choose from. These alone already made a highly enjoyable stay, not to mention their pristine communication and great hospitality. They shared their knowledge of the area with me, recommended a few places to go, and even borrowed me their hiking tools. Their 15 year old cat Simon was friendly and sweet too. It was great getting to know them and I highly recommend this place!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jane's place is fantastic. The home is spacious, modern, and beautifully decorated. The hosts (Jane and her husband John) were accommodating and communicative. The room and bathroom are very comfortable and nicely appointed. I highly recommend Jane's place!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful comfortable spot!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friend and I booked this AirBnb last minute, hoping there would still be an availability. Both Jane and and John went above and beyond as hosts, not just in providing a clean and comfortable accomodation, but also helping us with an airport transportation issue. They were incredibly understanding and flexible, and responded very quickly to all of our messages via AirBnb Messaging. If you're coming to Boulder, we would highly recommend staying here! Thank you Jane and John!
Nora and Zoe"

Absolutely will be back and cannot recommend the space enough!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would absolutely 💯 stay with Jane and John again. It was the first time I have stayed in an Airbnb in which I am occupying a bedroom in the owners house and to be honest I was feeling a little apprehensive about it. However, John helped make me feel welcomed and comfortable immediately. He was very considerate every morning to make sure I had coffee available and to also ask if I needed anything.
The area itself is filled with a lot of walking trails and is super close to downtown and only ten minutes away from Chautauqua Park .(the infamous flatirons)
I highly recommend this Airbnb."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was the best place I’ve been in Airbnb.
It’s a big and beautiful house when my room was totally private on the first floor.
They were very kind and attentive all the time. From before arriving till to help me to get my flight.
The localization is perfect. Pretty close to Boulder downtown.
I do recommend them 💯!!!!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I cannot recommend this Airbnb highly enough. Jane and John are first rate, the room is clean and comfortable and the location ideal. My stay could not have been more delightful. Thank you both so much."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jane and husband John are superb hosts. Their altruistic touch came through at every step of their Airbnb service. They welcomed us from the moment we reserved online. They outfitted us with a sumptuous guest room, private bath, and breakfast. They even greeted us upon our late return home and conversed with us as they fixed my wife a cup of tea. Experience otherworldly care at Jane and John's."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jane and John were fabulous hosts! They were extremely flexible with my schedule and so friendly during my stay. The house is beautiful in a gorgeous, quiet neighborhood, and the house itself is quirky and spotless. There are two cats in the house - I am allergic, but had no issues as the house was extremely clean and I never really even saw the cats (one came downstairs to say bye to me as I was leaving early in the morning - he was very sweet!). Hosts gave great recommendations and the stay was so nice and comfortable. Would highly recommend staying here!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The pictures do no justice for how beautiful Janes's home was. they were very welcoming and friendly
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I doubt you will find a more beautiful and affordable place to stay than Jane and John's home, easily accessed in North Boulder. For the price of a marginal, boring hotel room, you stay in a private room and bath in what feels like a modern art gallery! My favorite part was the elusive Simon the Cat, who eventually gave in to my petting skills. I spent more time with him than with his owners! They asked me several times if I needed anything, but we seldom saw each other in their spacious home as they have busy lives. Thus lots of privacy in safe, modern home! Highly recommend for women travelling alone. I would certainly stay there again - in a heartbeat!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you want to feel like you are staying with family, this is your place. Overall great experience."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Jane and John are truly great hosts. They were super flexible with my arrival time and were available in case of any needs while hiking 14ers and harder hikes that I took on solo. I truly felt like a family member during my time in Boulder.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jane and John are amazing hosts who share their wonderful home graciously. They were available for questions and conversation while offering spaciousness and, for lack of a better word, non-intrusiveness and privacy. Their place is beautiful and safe. Near hiking trails (which I didn't have a chance to get to...next time!). Though not close to the center of town, definitely within easy biking distance of all the things.

Will visit then again soon."

I did use their kitchen to make breakfast each morning, which was nice. John and Jane went out of their way to make my stay comfortable. I enjoyed our occasional chats. I was so pleased to find a banana in my room after my long flight from the east coast. They also offered to pick me up from the bus station, which was so kind. The house was spotless and very homey."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jane and John are the best hosts! They are incredibly generous and welcoming. The room/bathroom are great and have everything you need. And everything (i.e., trails, restaurants, shops, etc.) are close. Would absolutely stay with Jane and John again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Jane's place is very cozy and located at a very convenient location. I really enjoyed my stay there and would definitely stay again whenever I visit Boulder again.

I’m always skeptical of reviews because people tend to exaggerate one way or another, but this one was spot on - made even better with the kindness and generosity that Jane and John have. I ended up coming in late at night, almost midnight, and Jane was amazingly waiting up for me to show me a few things before saying goodnight.
I didn’t see them all that much because I was constantly out and about taking day trips and being around the city but my interactions with them were pleasant and helpful! I got recommended some restaurants, sights to see, and even met two of their three precious kitties 😍 It truly was like being AT home rather than just in a home. The room itself was nice and comfortable, had everything I could need, and the bathroom was just as wonderful. Their area is great, private, free parking, close to pretty much everything. I’d absolutely come back to Jane’s place when I return to Boulder (because I know I will someday!)."

One night it snowed a lot and next morning we woke up to the pathways already shoveled, including the area all around our car too which was unexpected and appreciated. Bed was super comfortable and cozy, with lots of blanket and pillow options (firm and soft). We were welcomed with a personalized note and chocolates as it was Valentine’s Day when we arrived which was nice.

We told her not to worry as we were from Wisconsin, and the snow wasn't a bother! The room was magnificent! My wife fell in love with the room, and already wanted to come back. We thoroughly enjoyed everything. The bed is extremely comfortable too! It was nice getting great sleep despite having to travel so much in 2 days. Lorna was excellent with communication too!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely the cutest and coziest studio! I was only in town for a short stay and Lorna’s studio was the perfect home away from home!
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, a good stay! The studio was super clean, looked just like the photos, and was easy to find. Lorna was also super friendly and you could tell she wants all her guests to have a great stay. The main reason for the 4 star rating was that there was just a ton of stuff in the studio - we can definitely appreciate the effort to provide as many “amenities” as possible, but for us personally it made the space feel quite cluttered and not as simple for our quick 2-night stay. It felt a little bit more like we were staying in someone’s actual home rather than a getaway room - which could definitely be something others prefer. We also had to text the host with our personal phone number for check in and check out, which was a first for us, and wasn’t our favorite.
10/10 for hospitality and cleanliness and a great place to book if you enjoy a more personal stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The studio and Lorna were both great! She has gone above and beyond to provide guests whatever they might possibly need. Very homey & comfortable studio. Highly recommend

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for a visit to Boulder. We were only here for a night but it was perfect for our quick trip and Lorna was super friendly and responsive. Place was probably one of the cleanest Airbnbs I’ve ever been in and Lorna helped us find a solution to storing our luggage after we had checked out so that we could explore Boulder before our evening flight.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very great stay! The apartment was very clean and everything necessary for a stay was available.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lorna was a great, friendly and responsive host that provided a clean, well stocked studio in a beautiful location. As a solo traveler, I felt safe in that area.

Thanks again Lorna!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I loved our time in Boulder. Lorna was super responsive and gave great instructions and recommendations! Her Air BnB is super close to downtown Boulder as well as hiking trails and stores. Staying here made it easy!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great location — quiet and peaceful— my wife and I were in town for a wedding in Boulder but also spent time in Denver and Nederland and it was easy to get to all of them from here — lots of extra detail/amenities from the owner and super easy to check in and out — we will definitely try to book this place again on our next trip
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I wish I could’ve stayed longer. I didn’t want to leave! My time there was exactly what the doctor ordered. Lorna is a true gem and really wants her guests to be comfortable. Will definitely return.

appreciated!
I will stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This studio was the perfect place for me and my friend to stay! Super clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed and more. Lorna was very responsive and reached out to make sure we were satisfied and had everything we needed. The location was nice and peaceful, and fairly close to everything on our to do list from Denver to Rocky Mountain National Park. Lorna’s guidebook had great recommendations of things to do in the area. She really went above and beyond! Highly recommend staying here."

Lots of good recs, super clean place with nice linens, adorable kitchen. I stayed here for a work event and loved that it was closer to the airport. I loved the location is a quiet suburb, near hikes."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay!
I loved my time at this Airbnb.
I had extenuating circumstances, and Lorna was very kind and accommodating. The studio is as cute as it looks in the picture, and is very cozy and nurturing. Lorna's thought of everything that one might need or want: yoga mats, indoor flip-flops, extras like toothbrushes and toothpaste in case you forgot, and a cool addition in the bathroom, a lucite shelf above the sink to store things and see exactly what's where.
It's in a quiet, pretty neighborhood, and a quick, easy trip to downtown and other parts of Boulder. I would definitely stay here again🥰!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at Lorna’s. The extra amenities (selection of toiletries you may have forgotten) were thoughtful, and unexpected. Would stay again!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My room was complete with all the ammenities I needed. She thought of every thing. It was very clean. The area was safe and secure in a new housing area. It was a few minutes to Boulder to great restaurants and hiking. I would recommend her place to my friends.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute studio! Very clean, enjoyed our stay"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Lorna's was a great experience. Her home with the two studios attached has lots of privacy and lots of woods. It was a quick and easy drive to downtown, and nice and spacious.
Lorna had great energy and was a lovely host proactive about asking for anything I needed and super helpful when I asked questions.
Can't wait to go back to Boulder just to stay there again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The best B&B room I've ever had. Has everything, tastefully well-appointed, spotlessly clean and comfortable."

The studio is brand new and was beautifully appointed; very comfortable and quiet in an impressive estate neighborhood. Lorna was very accommodating and helpful and we enjoyed our stay there immensely."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very nice, quaint Studio with easy access to Boulder and the Boulder area. Very clear instructions, easy in and out. Very nicely decorated, pristine condition, comfortable bed, and good wifi. A perfect place for an individual or couple spending time in the area but wanting to stay just outside the bustle of Boulder. We would definitely go back next time in the area."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome private getaway in the beautiful city of Boulder. Lorna's place had everything that you could ask for. It was very clean and felt just like home. You can either rent a car or use Uber and you'll be able to get to wherever you need to be. Lorna was great and very friendly. I would definitely book Lorna's place again next time I'm in Boulder.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The studio is lovely and comfortable. It was exactly as described with more amenities than listed. I will stay again!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Lorna was a great host! The place was very clean and had everything you could need!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very beautiful space, super clean, easy to feel at home!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ours is Such a peaceful little area and not far away from down town Boulder either. Lorna was a sweetheart as well and the room is cozy!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lorna’s studio is in a quiet neighborhood and she had many little thoughtful items and touches in the unit. Studio is attached to main house but could only hear when the laundry room was being used during the day so it was very quiet for being attached. Share the deck/front area with other aibnb guest if they’re there. Maybe it was off season but the value was incredibly good for the excellent location and for all that was provided in the unit.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lorna was attentive and friendly. Lorna preheated the place for us and provided little extras you may need on your stay. Her family is working on the property as they just moved in, they were respectful."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a lovely spot to stay!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lorna is an amazing host! She is kind, understanding and responsive! Her recommendations are top notch and she helped make my vacation one to remember!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even though I had a short trip, it was great staying at Lorna’s! Everything was very comfortable and felt just right. Lorna met all of my needs. Great and quiet location!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lorna's place is a 10! Spotlessly clean, bright, cheerful and incredibly comfortable with lovely furnishings and amenities. It has just been updated and is a real gem.
It's located in a lovely, quiet neighborhood yet minutes to shopping, downtown Boulder and CU. Lorna was in the midst of a move herself and worked tirelessly to have the unit ready for us upon arrival. She was immediately responsive to all questions, incredibly helpful and accommodating from start to finish. One of our best Airbnb experiences to date.
We highly recommend Lorna's delightful spot if you're in the Boulder area. We look forward to returning."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nathaniel’s place was the perfect secluded retreat with a peaceful stunning view!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My partner, toddler son, and I had an amazing experience at the Airbnb. We all enjoyed the beautiful house with modern vibe and amenities. The area is spectacular for relaxing and getting away from reality even if it is for just a couple days. I highly recommend Nathaniel's Airbnb for a nice romantic getaway or an adventure into the Rocky Mtns."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the most gorgeous spot to spend our mini-moon after eloping! Everything was beautiful inside and out. The kitchen was very well-stocked and we loved cooking and grilling! We’d had this listing saved on Airbnb for over a year and it lived up to our high expectations :) I can’t recommend staying here enough!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A stunning house in a stunning location! We enjoyed coffee in the mornings on the deck as we watched deer and a rabbit graze just feet from us. You'll feel a million miles away in this gorgeous, well-designed house, but you're only about 20 minutes from downtown Boulder. Nat was very communicative and welcoming--we instantly felt at home when we arrived. Two days wasn't enough...so we'll just have to come back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredibly beautiful home with wonderful modern appliances and a gorgeous mountainside setting.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow...
This place was stunning...
Nat went ABOVE and beyond with the hospitality. I especially loved the view from the bed in the morning, and the killer sound system to go along with my writing. I snuck away for a solo trip, and returned recharged. No detail left untouched.
Can't wait to be return!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nat’s place is amazing. It was so peaceful. We immediately felt at home. Nat was great to communicate with!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely and beautiful place to elope!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved the place and even extended a night. Nat was perfect host.
The cabin is in a beautiful remote location - we lost power temporarily due to a storm (no one’s fault and Nat was super helpful!) but recommend coming to the place stocked up as it’s a 40-ish minute drive into town for essentials!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay at!! The views are unmatched and looks exactly as the pictures are. We unfortunately were caught in a high wind storm and lost power. Nat went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and had the resources we needed. He was very helpful on giving any insight we needed and was always responsive no mater the time of day. Plenty of deer in the area, you can pretty much catch them on the patio. The Fiancé and I were in love with the location and didn’t want to leave."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow what a beautiful and breathtaking stay! Nat’s place was pristine and serene and we thoroughly enjoyed our quiet and luxurious stay. The view was stunning and it was so peaceful stepping outside to the quiet sounds of nature and watch the moody weather roll in and out over the mountains.
*A 4WD vehicle is definitely a must as the last mile is a steep drive up an unpaved road."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, amazing views, great host."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an absolutely incredible stay. Nat was such an incredible host. Not only did this house exceed my expectations but Nat went above and beyond. This place was absolutely magical. With the most incredible views from sun up to sunset. Would absolutely stay again and again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were lucky enough to ride out a snowstorm at Nathaniel’s place and had the loveliest view of the surrounding mountains and wildlife. The home was impeccably designed, clean, and comfortable. Nathaniel was a gracious host and helped us navigate our way down the driveway during wintry conditions. His hospitality was the cherry on top of a wonderful little getaway."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most stunning place I've ever stayed. The home itself is gorgeous and the view is incredible.
We had everything we needed to make delicious meals at home. We put some music on the speaker system and enjoyed cooking together. I would recommend stopping for groceries on the way up since it's a bit of a drive up the mountain.
There is construction going on behind the house so there was some banging during the day, which we drowned out with the music. It wasn't much of an issue. Though I would recommend earplugs at night as the structure can make a fair amount of noise in the wind.
The best thing was the view, but second best was heated floors. Incredible.
This was such a luxurious stay and I would absolutely love to come back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was wonderful! Very homey and clean! Loved every second and didn’t want to leave! The hot tub was amazing, with such an amazing view of Sugarloaf mountain! Nat was very quick to respond and nice. Would totally stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The pictures do not do this house/location justice! Truly an incredible house with even better views! Don’t miss out on this one!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful property. I’ll be back.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,NAT IS AMAZING!!! We LOVE his place!! He's always a great host! We'll be back every single year!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! Absolutely stunning. Just like the pics. Nat was very accommodating and responsive. Plan on making this an annual trip. 10 out of 10.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing views and vibes, exactly like the pictures and how'd you'd imagine your stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this property and Nathaniel was 5 stars. Can’t rave about this rental enough. We will definitely try to rent it again. Perfect for a romantic weekend away!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend & I absolutely loved Nat’s place! This was our first time in Colorado and it was an absolute dream! Nat’s place is squeaky clean which was a key factor for me as this was my first time ever using Airbnb! The place is very close to a few hiking trails especially if you’re new to hiking and not very far from the town which has many restaurants and shops.
I will say the drive up is VERY steep and can be scary so definitely recommend a jeep or similar vehicle."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Amazing stay! Nat was a great host and very responsive. We had the best time and the views were even better than the pictures. Can’t recommend this location enough!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Incredible. Exceeded expectations. This was a masterpiece of a home that we felt honored to reside, especially knowing Nat built it himself. Nat was responsive, helpful, and offered to go above and beyond to support us and assist us when I felt anxious about driving the steep hill in snowy weather. Phenomenal experience. Worth every penny."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved everything about this place. It was perfect for a peaceful getaway
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely gorgeous. Views were amazing. The host went out of his way to make our stay special. We felt like this was a second home while we stayed there. Bed was comfortable. Hot tub was clean. The entire place was as pictured but it was so much better in person. We will definitely be staying there again. It was beautiful.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a steeeeep climb up especially in the winter, but my, oh my, what a beautiful scene when you arrive! The place is immaculate, beautifully decorated, and so intentionally designed. Nathanial was extremely responsive for any questions/concerns we have and went above and beyond to make sure we felt safe, comfortable, and well taken care of during our stay. We are hoping to come back again soon and highly recommend this place!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the one. Everything you could want and then some—scenic, plush, and luxurious. Smaller than expected but still worth every penny. Nat was an awesome host and even took the time to plow the road for us after the snow storm. 10/10 would absolutely recommend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay at this beautiful mountain home! It was the perfect getaway!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,5 stars doesn’t even do it justice. Especially enjoyed the recommended hiking trails that were close to the house.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We celebrated our 20th anniversary and had great time at Nate’s place. The communication was super easy, quick and the place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. The place was very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home. The drive in was absolutely beautiful. It’s secluded and very quiet! Would absolutely recommend staying there!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay! We celebrated our one year anniversary here and it was more than we could’ve asked for. Nathan was really communicative and proactively warned us about the first winter storm. Thanks for everything!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The one word that resonates with me about my entire stay is “stunning”. The drive to the house- stunning. Arriving at the house- stunning. Walking in and thinking “oh my gosh this is real and I get to stay here?!”- stunning. Nat was responsive and so lovely. Any questions we had beyond his super clear instructions- he answered in a timely fashion and with great knowledge of the area. The house felt like home with just the right amount of hotel luxury to make me remember I was on vacation. Waking up to that Mountain View every morning is something I’ll never forget and on the other end of the spectrum going to bed every night after seeing the stars from the hot tub gave me the best of both worlds. We cooked great meals in the chef inspired kitchen- every utensil or spice imaginable was at the ready. We grilled out some nights and ended every night with a cocktail on the couch reminiscing about the day. 11/10 would recommend- I hope to come back next year!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nat’s description is accurate and the place is gorgeous. The home is modern and comfortable. The drive to the house is no joke and a high clearance vehicle is helpful but most cars could probably make it up the road (not accounting for snow), especially with a driver accustomed to driving on mountain roads. It is however a long drive from Boulder, so I recommend not doing a lot of back-and-forth otherwise you will definitely get tired of driving the long and windy road.
The mountains to the left (east I believe) when facing out the windows looks to have had a fire in recent years so the view straight ahead is beautiful to Sugarloaf Peak, but to the east is a little ugly and rundown due to the downed trees. Not an issue nor Nat’s fault, but should be flagged for future guests to be aware of.
The hot tub was a bit murky and gross upon first arrival but Nat was helpful and responsive in servicing it first thing the next morning, so again not an issue, and he was a considerate host."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was beautiful, clean, scenic and accessible! Strongly recommend if you’re staying in Boulder"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nat’s place is truly special, and I’m pretty sure he built it all himself in what could only be described as a labor of love over 10 years. Immaculate and modern, and yet still warm and cozy, with polished concrete floors with radiant heat, bespoke finishes, a fully stocked kitchen and high end linens and towels. It is definitely spacious for a studio but perfect for couples. The solitude and setting are amazing…the isolation from everything took a moment to get used to being from LA because we were not used to being so remote. But there is perfect WiFi in case of emergency and then peace and quiet. While only 30 ish minutes from Boulder, the drive is not for the faint of heart. When we stay here again, we will stock up at the grocery store so we don’t need to leave and can just camp out at Nat’s sanctuary the whole weekend.
You must have an SUV…the final mile or so is on a rough and rutted dirt road. Worth it, but just fyi. The place is magical and we feel restored!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can’t even explain how perfect this trip was. My fiancé and I eloped and this was the location where we stayed. It was like nothing we’ve ever experienced before. We will never forget the memories here. We hope to come back every year for our anniversary.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Nat’s property for our elopement getaway and had an absolutely fantastic time, the place really does look exactly like the photos. (Recommend All-wheel drive) Not only does it look amazing, but the house itself is full of high quality hardware and materials that really provide a premium experience. Nat made the process and communication very easy, and provided absolutely everything you might need at the house. We even had a private chef, Chef Andrew of Via Alba, come and cook us a absolutely amazing private dinner for our elopement and he complemented how nicely the kitchen was configured as well. While there, we made use of everything, the espresso machine made delicious coffee (ask if you’ve never used one before as it can be intimidating) and the hot tub on a cold night was fantastic! Overall, we will definitely be coming back, we got a chance to meet Nat and he seemed like a person who really care’s about providing the best experience for his guests. Thank you Nat! 10/10"
2023-10-01,2,Stayed with kids,"Pros-
-Good little spot for a single person needing a break
- owner nat is very nice and helpful
-modern little place and cleaned well.
-nice big windows
-quite over all (if owner isn’t building)
Cons- surrounded by burn area. So wasn’t exactly as gorgeous as I hoped.
-a scary drive on the dirt road, almost on a steep slope and ledge.
-not a kid friendly place. Or elderly friendly. (Yard/patio is dangerous, no fencing or railing on a steep cliff/ledge)
-ac wasn’t working. So owner came to put screens in so we could open windows. Still very hot. And open windows has lots of knats fly in…. I wasn’t very happy about that. (Owner did want to try to fix ac next day but I couldn’t handle another night of heat, we left early.)
- tiny tiny studio…not as big as pictures seem.
-I felt this place was very over priced sadly. I was very sad about it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was exactly as described, very peaceful and private with some scenic view. Nat was great with communication and would definitely book another Airbnb with Nat again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing view and a beautiful home! Nat was great with communication and made us feel welcomed. Definitely worth the visit!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nat’s place was truly an unforgettable stay. The roads to access the place were very difficult so I definitely suggest an suv or all wheel drive and we came in September- if you come in the winter months with snow you would have to have an all wheel drive. The place was absolutely stunning and extremely clean! The house is so modern and unlike any place I’ve ever stayed in. The views and privacy are to die for. The outdoor area with the deck and hot tub were unbelievable. I felt very safe there and Nat is super responsive, any time I messaged he answered right away which I always appreciate. There is wildlife out there, we saw several chipmunks and deer on the mountain beside us! It’s worth every penny, absolutely unbelievable. And the requirements from the guest for leaving are very minimal if any which I also appreciated. Unbelievable stay, I didn’t want to leave!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot. Would love to come back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was most stunning airbnb that we’ve ever stayed in! We eloped & it was the most amazing view. We couldn’t be happier. Our host was so sweet & we were greeted with flowers, chocolate and wine. It was extremely clean and absolutely gorgeous. Thank you so much!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic stay at nats. He made so many exceptions and was very helpful along the way. We even got to meet him. He was great.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful place with a beautiful view!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, this place this space was simply amazing! The views were breathtaking and our host had everything available and on hand that you would need to make this amazing space feel like home. Coming from Dallas, Texas this was a welcoming getaway, we enjoyed our stay and have definitely made our friends, family and social media followers aware of how great this place is. Thanks to our host for such a beautiful and thoughtfully designed home! It was an amazing experience that my wife and I will never forget! 10 out of 5 stars…..we highly recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon, and it was perfect! It is exactly like the photos. We loved the open layout, and the view you get when you wake up, and get your coffee in the morning. Our first day, the wifi wasn’t working, but I was able to reach out to Nat when we got back into town and he was very responsive and was able to get it back up shortly after letting him know! We loved the hot tub at night, and looking at the stars. Highly recommend anybody to stay here!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay at this Airbnb property in the mountains of Boulder, CO! The stunning mountain views were the perfect backdrop for relaxation. The highlight was definitely the hot tub – soaking while surrounded by nature was truly magical. The interior was spotless and well-equipped, making the stay comfortable. Would highly recommend for a serene mountain getaway."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, relaxing, spacious, super clean, and serene. Very secluded and remote, but close enough to Boulder Canyon for trips to Boulder (left) or Lake Brainard onto RMNP (right)—take the Peak to Peak route to and back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved it! It was secluded and so peaceful, the views were amazing. He had some instructions for a hike from the house which was relatively easy and fun to get some great views (though wear pants!). Place was clean and beautiful with top of the line appliances. Seemed to have everything we needed too, we bought some syrup for instance to make waffles in the morning but he already had syrup there. Loved the hot tub at night! Just great overall, 10/10 would recommend. We’d come back in an instant if we come to CO in the future."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nat was great! Beautiful place, amazing views, amazing host!!!! Would definitely recommend and would definitely book again!!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Nat’s place the week of our elopement and it was seriously beyond beautiful! The place was gorgeous and had an amazing views. Clean cozy home and had lots of little details that were amazing. Makeup wipe removers, hair dryer, great towels. It was just an amazing stay and Nat was very friend and helpful with every question we had. 10/10. Highly recommend this place!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Remote and natural beauty. Private, comfortable and had all the details right."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property and very secluded…which is what we were going for! Highly recommend and we would certainly book again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely enjoyed my time here. Nathaniel was excellent going above and beyond to make sure everything was right.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for our wedding weekend and it was incredible! The view was great and the pictures we had were incredible! Will definitely be coming back in the future for an anniversary trip!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such an incredible home and experience. So peaceful. Incredible home and design! Very inspiring. Would love to come back sometime!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, outstanding views. Highly recommended."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay and the interior and setting didn’t disappoint. Nature envelopes you. The finishes, design and beauty of everything around you is truly magical. We had a couple issues worth noting: the hot tub wasn’t clean so we couldn’t use it. The oven wasn’t working, but we improvised. The living area has no screens, so bugs become an issue if you want to let fresh air in. The A/C isn’t quite enough to cool the space. The wind makes the structure creak loudly which takes some getting used to. We had a great time and would recommend this place to others, but our stay could have been a 10 without these few things. Also- all wheel/4 wheel drive is a must to get to the house."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would 100% stay here again! It was perfect. The views were incredible. The home was clean and decorated well, had everything and more that we could need. It really was our home away from home. Our host was incredibly responsive. Zero issues at all, 10/10 recommend.
Would definitely recommend a 4wd car though!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place in a gorgeous location with a thoughtful host.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful and peaceful place. Nat is a great host- helpful communication and so many special touches in the space. We would love to stay here again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nat’s place is absolutely perfect. He definitely has an eye for design and has thought of everything a guest could want or need. The location and surroundings are equally as beautiful as they are peaceful. Deer even made appearances daily in the yard and/or surrounding hillsides.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Amazing views.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nat’s place is pure magic and you can really see and feel all of the care he put into crafting it. We were so impressed with everything and cannot wait to go back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Have to say if you are looking for a secluded stay with amazing views - this is it! Honestly was an amazing stay
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nat’s place is absolutely gorgeous. He put in a lot of thoughts into the design and it shows. The location provided us privacy and a stunning view. During our stay, Nat has been responsive and helpful. He also reached out to give us a heads up about the changing weather and we really appreciated it. All in all, great stay and great host!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I used Nathaniels zen cottage for a photo shoot and the results are incredible! His place was spotless and just like in the pictures. Totally stunning. Planning on coming back for a staycation! Nathaniel was a pleasure to message with. I highly recommend coming up here if you have the opportunity 🏔️ 🌲 ✨
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay in the mountains of Boulder, Colorado. Very private and the views from the airbnb is simply breathtaking. Would definitely book again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is stunning.
It is an architectural marvel for space and size
Expect to relax and let nature be your guide"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing! The craftsmanship of this home is immaculate and the views are just as good! Nat is a great host and provides a fantastic place to stay just outside of Boulder!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,👍🏼👍🏼
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Private location with amazing views! Nat was very welcoming and left notes on key details.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing - absolutely what I expected and MORE. The host has literally thought of everything a guest might need! The home is comfortable, peaceful, clean, and very well appointed. If you are considering this spot - book it!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cool, unique location in the mountains! I really came for the view but the house itself is also very impressive and comfortable."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a place! Beautifully designed and built. I would love to come back in summer/fall and take advantage of hiking.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful space, amazing human we will definitely be back when the weather is better!
Thank you Nat"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the most beautiful stay just outside of Boulder! Nat was an amazing host and the space was to die for!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our 3rd stay here and we will certainly be back. Nat thinks of everything! Amazing place!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If peace and quiet is your goal, this is the place. The location is beautiful. The home is the nicest we`ve ever stayed in, by far. Instructions accessing the location and home were clear and accurate. 5 stars across the board."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Most beautiful airbnb i have ever stayed in, could not have been a more perfect get away. Instructions were easy to follow, beautiful place, and friendly host. Thank you! 10/10 recommend"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this is definitely what you call a private off the grid get away. I needed a break from everything. It was so quiet and peaceful and worth the price. No service but they have wifi it works great. Wish it was a TV but the point of a vacation is no entertainment. Just peace and relaxing. I would definitely come back. Nat was such great help.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the coolest Airbnb experiences I've had. The place is stunning, the location is awesome, and everything about booking and checking in was a breeze. Highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was absolutely beautiful and exactly like the photos!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful!!! So glad we did it. It was a wonderful and restful getaway surrounded by beauty. The house is impeccable with a minimal and elegant feel. Stocked with everything we could have needed.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very good place
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is truly our favorite Air Bnb of all time and we have stayed in A LOT. It is simplistic with one main room and the bathroom but every inch was spotless and top of the line from the espresso machine to the furniture and everything about the kitchen (6 burner gas stove). It was so well stocked we were able to bake cookies and even have vanilla syrup to make an iced latte! It is all topped off by an incredible view no matter what time of day. Nat was also incredible. Super communicative and called us immediately when we couldn’t figure out the door (push don’t pull lol). Will definitely be back!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nathaniel’s place was amazing! 10/10 would book again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, with great attention to detail. The location and home are top tier. Nathaniel thought of everything."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"amazing home, great privacy, and a fun hike to Gold Hill right from front door. would recommend to anyone staying near Boulder."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nat’s place is special. The view alone is worth the trip, and the thoughtful design of his house elevates the experience even more. Nat is a great host. He came by just to show me how his espresso machine worked. The house is perfect for couples or even singles wanting a few days of restorative solitude. If you’re looking for a unique mountain-stay experience, I highly recommend."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely incredible experience. We couldn’t have been happier with our Airbnb or host! Everything we needed or could have forgotten ( like syrup) was stocked at the house! The build is incredible, the views are stunning and the house is immaculate. We hardly left but when we did, we used the provided 4-wheeler and didn’t have any problems. Could not recommend this place enough! Thank you Nat!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"wow wow and wow
this place is amazing!!!!!
we have everything we need and the host Nathaniel he is amazing very cute and helpful
we will definitely come here again we love the place ❤️"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We booked this cabin on January which the winter is very much alive yet enchanting. It is very remote so there will be no service so you have to plan out everything including a plan b in case you cannot get up the mountain. The host was very generous to lend us his four wheel tire chained buggy to go up less than a mile to the cabin. After that the drive up is very relaxing and a sight to see. The cabin does have wifi and has the basic needs for a gateway. The fridge is big enough to hold groceries so I would recommend getting groceries before going up. We definitely enjoyed the hot tub and cold weather and found ourselves in peace and at home.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far, our favorite stay in Colorado. The view is beautiful from the hot tub, or from the bed if you can make yourself get out from underneath the duvet. The entire place was so clean. This is a hidden gem. We will be back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful architecture and views and worth it for an off the beaten path porperty within driving distance to Boulder and Nederlenad. Great host.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely amazing!!
Would recommend everyone come here at least once to experience the true beauty of being on a mountain!
Nat was an excellent host!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay. It was obvious from start to finish how much care Nat put into not only hosting, but building and designing the home. We stayed pretty close to the house for our trip given the remoteness and that was easy with how lovely the home and location are. Hard to beat. My husband and I both agreed it was one of the few times that our Airbnb has actually exceeded expectations in real life vs pictures. Would absolutely stay again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location and home are amazing! Completely worth the stay. if you stay in the winter DEFINITELY have chains or spiked tires otherwise you won't be able to make it up the final road to the home if there's any ice.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house in a remote and peaceful location
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far the best AirBnB experience ever! Perfect vacation spot, amazing views, quiet, peaceful, serene, just simply amazing. Nathaniel was great and easy to communicate with and made our stay wonderful. Highly recommend and looking forward to staying here again in the future!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house and location are stunning! It snowed during our trip and it was magical up in the mountains. Nat went out of his way to be accommodating, and even picked us up in the morning to help navigate down the road due to the snow. We loved loved loved our experience here!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love, love, love this special place. We had the best time cooking and reading. The hot tub was great. Perfect little get away."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very beautiful and secluded home. everything was very clean, kitchen was well stocked, bed was comfortable; everything was perfect! Went on a nice hike that starts right on the property and enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub at the end of the day with the most beautiful view. Highly recommend!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is the perfect place to clear up and release the stress of everyday life, the privacy and feeling at home is excellent, we already miss the
House Thanks"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at Nat’s place and we will certainly be back. Beautiful hiking from the home, pristine surroundings, and amazing home. He has thought of all of everything. Look no further, book this place!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nat’s place is an absolute dream! Nat was very accommodating as well. He even came to plow the road at 5am so that we were able to make it down the driveway for our early flight out!
Highly recommend booking!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Nat’s place! The setting is stunning, and the home was built and furnished with perfect attention to detail. The kitchen was fully stocked, and we loved cooking while overlooking the gorgeous mountain view. A very relaxing way to wake up is in the hot tub looking out on the mountain! Felt like a very refreshing retreat. Boulder is 30 mins away and a fun town to explore! Would love to return someday."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was exceptional. Between the stunning views and the abundant amenities, this is the best airbnb we have ever stayed at. Nat was so receptive of our needs and was so helpful with anything that we needed. If you want to get the real feel for Colorado than look no further. This is it."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic - look no further
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Your cabin was absolutely wonderful and my husband and I really appreciated the care with which you furnished your cabin and your immense attention to detail. From the wood craftsmanship demonstrated throughout the house, to the quality of the furnishings and linens, and a very thoughtful welcome gift of locally made chocolate and a bottle of wine, we would highly recommend your cabin!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was fantastic. Pictures do it no justice. Great for a mountain getaway.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful dream place to stay. We arrived for our 1 year anniversary and it was absolutely stunning.
Nat was an amazing host! He was always there with any questions we had and his hospitality was truly un-matched.
The drive up the mountain was incredible. We did have an all wheel drive jeep wrangler and recommend a vehicle that can easily go up these dirt roads.
By far the best airbnb experience we have ever had. It’s a blessing to be able to experience nature in this fashion.
Thank you Nat for such a beautiful memory!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's just as good in person as it is in pictures. Nathaniel was super nice and accommodating. Highly recommend this air bnb.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is amazingly beautiful - the views are unparalleled from every direction and it is so private, perfect for a little getaway. We were fortunate enough to experience the first snow of the fall season, and Nat was able to have the road plowed so we were not stuck. We felt safe and comfortable with Nat, and communication was excellent. He did a great job meeting our needs and answering any questions we had. Book this airbnb right away - you will not regret staying in this immaculate home."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Breathtaking, beautiful, perfection. Nat's place is truly amazing, and he is an incredibly thoughtful host. My wife and I spent our 20th wedding anniversary enjoying the night sky from the hot tub (and even saw a meteor burning up in the atmosphere- WOW!). Above and beyond the absolute best airbnb we've ever stayed in, and we look forward to visiting again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautifully secluded spot, perfect for a weekend getaway. The house is perfectly furnished and decorated, and the details that are included really make the place special."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nat’s place is just as gorgeous as it is unique!! This place is a once in a lifetime stay with beautiful views. It’s clean, modern, and well equipped! Nat was a fantastic host; I highly recommend this place!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nat was incredible. The house was better than the pictures and truly a work of art.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning vistas everywhere you look. The drive on the narrow, cliff side road is worth the trip to this special home."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about this place… All of the lovely details from the linens to the cozy pillows to an amazing expresso machine! The hot tub on a cool afternoon was a treat, the views were incredible and we enjoyed a lovely hike around the area… For sure will be coming back for another stay!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with a great view of the sunrise in the morning. 10/10 would recommend!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Your search is over! This home is absolutely magical. Amazing views all around. We sat in the hot tub for hours and enjoyed the view and the nature. The amenities in the home are above and beyond expectation. There is everything you need to cook meals in the home, including an array of spices, oils, teas. We woke up multiple mornings to deer standing right outside the glass doors. The road to the home is a little steep and bumpy. But we were fine in a Chevy trax. Would advise staying in for the night if it’s foggy though. We are from the city and not used to the dark, mountain roads. But it was an adventure and we loved every minute. Lots to do in Boulder and plenty of hiking, biking, etc. It was a perfect vacation."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was a dream. So much thought went into every little detail of the decor/amenities/essentials. An incredible stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such an awesome place so beautiful! Had an relaxing and peaceful time. Nothing but good things to say
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location and home. Incredibly clean and modern.
All the provided amenities were clean and friendly for those with allergies.
We would come back again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Nat's home was easily the most beautiful airbnb we've ever stayed in. The architecture and the design is spectacular, and the whole experience is so thoughtfully executed. I couldn't recommend it enough. The house comes well stocked with spices, kitchen supplies, and anything else you might need. Nat is super responsive and kind, and just overall the best host. The location is incredible. Each time I woke up, or walked up the stairs and saw the view through the window, I was blown away. Absolutely incredible. I'd go back in a heartbeat."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely epic house! The view of the mountain so wonderful to wake up to each morning. Very clean. Nathaniel does a great job at helping you feel welcome and at home. 100% would recommend to anyone looking for a peaceful getaway!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a quiet and beautiful getaway, look no further. This place is magical. Everything is high end and the views are beautiful. Nat has thought of every single detail and they are so welcoming and kind. We will be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, incredible design, lot of great memories made. Has everything you need and very thoughtful design. Love the patio and custom iron wrap, really really cool. This is undoubtedly the coolest piece of design/architecture I’ve ever stayed in. Nat and Michelle were extremely responsive to our needs and when we had a question about some residue (cleaning product) leftover in the hot tub Michelle came by within 30 minutes to clean it out and explain to us. Thank you Nat & Michelle - lots of amazing memories in your place, appreciate you sharing."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is probably the most breathtaking airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. Both the house and the surroundings are gorgeous beyond belief. Although there are neighbors within hiking distance we felt completely alone in the mountains and at one with nature. On our last day we took a hike and saw a black bear on another ridge just doing his thing. We love this house so much we kidded Nat about getting copies of the plans so we could recreate it for ourselves; but of course it would never be the same. You will NOT regret staying with Nat.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When entering the door this place smelled, looked, and felt like heaven. Shout out to Nat for his incredible world class architecture. We were super impressed with the creativity and skill it took to make this place what it is today. If this place is available for you on your dates of availability you need to book this place. Should be on the cover of a travel magazine. We have never been to Colorado or any mountain chain but the drive was not bad. If you want to do it right rent a Jeep through Turo."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded every expectation we had for our trip. No detail overlooked. Seriously. If you're on the fence just go for it, you'll be so glad you did. Make sure you have 4 wheel drive or an equivalent. The driveway is no joke. A low chassis vehicle will scrape like nobody's business. Still, would book again 1000x over. We are already talking about our return trip."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would absolutely recommend staying here.. It was an amazing home with amazing views!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Impeccable idyllic place, with careful attention to details that only a 5-star hotel can provide. Great views, no one around, absolute silence. It has been a while since I've seen the sky with so many stars. From the property, we hiked to this old gold mine town which was super cool. Nat is a gentleman and a fantastic host. Zero issues, nothing detrimental, truly a superb experience."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot that was also very clean and organized.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A rare gem, nestled high up in the mountains... wonderful home with incredible views and a fantastic host who is not only friendly and attentive but has prepared his home in such a thoughtful way."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Celebrated our engagement at this beautiful property and couldn’t be happier. This is a one of a kind stay.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! This place is amazing! So clean and the views are amazing!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I are architects, and since it was our first getaway after our son was born, we searched diligently for a place that would provide much needed respite while indulging us in our appreciation for finely designed spaces. Nat's place was that and so much more. His attention to detail spans from the meticulously-designed and constructed house to ensuring the whole experience of your stay is considered.
The landscaped terrace, plateaued on the side of a mountain, is a joy. The interior materials are beatiful and clean. The massive lift and slide door within a steel and glass wall is a true feat. The espresso machine...requires some YouTube-ing...but you then quickly find yourself zooming around on way too many ""practice shots"".
It truly felt like we were house-sitting a very nice and well-maintained modern cabin/home, as opposed to simply visiting a rental property that doesn't match the look of the listing photos.
We are very grateful that Nat provides an opportunity to stay in such a quality place that isn't too far from the real world, but certainly feels like it.
Chris and Michelle"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If a mountain retreat with beauty and solitude is your goal, in addition to a modern and well appointed home being part of the package, you cannot go wrong staying here."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are done with using Airbnb after our stay here. Why you may ask? Because there is not a chance any other place out there compares to the experience we had at Nat’s. Move over Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. Get out of the way Disney World. In the many years I have stayed at an Airbnb, I have NEVER had such an incredible, amazing, wonderful, beautiful, and unforgettable experience as I had here. There aren’t enough complimentary words in the dictionary to describe how amazing this was. I’ll try my best to specify what made it so unforgettable:
1. The place actually appears bigger from the inside than the outside. The view is incredible. You can look out from the living room, the kitchen, and even the bed. We were in the mountains and we had a hard time going outside because of the comfort/view we had inside.
2. Everything in this place is top of the line - furniture; appliances; pantry items…you name it.
3. This place really has everything you need. If you forgot something on your trip, there is a good chance you’ll find it here. We needed to do a couple loads of laundry after camping for a few days. Not only does Nat have a washer and dryer available, but there was detergent to use as well. He truly makes his place accessible to accommodate your needs during your stay.
4. Small things make a difference - a pleasant surprise awaits you when you arrive (we won’t spoil it, but feel free to contact me if you want to know). Examples that stand out - the gas grill is connected to a main line, so know annoying figuring out the propane tank. There are bath robes for you and a guest to relax outside or around the place. A fully functional espresso machine is waiting for you…oh, along with a French press. There is a remote to easily turn on the inside and outside lights.
5. The craftsmanship and attention to detail are out of this world. Nat claims he built this place over a 10 year period, and it shows! The roof covers you outside if it rains. The door to the patio is ridiculous (in a good way). The floor is magical (don’t wear shoes inside please). Walking from the entrance, up the stairs, and to the open room…the theme from Jurassic Park should be playing when you get there.
6. Privacy and quick travel to Boulder. You have a ridiculous amount of privacy, so if you’re looking to escape from the world, you’ve found the place. I cannot confirm or deny that I had a coffee naked on the patio. And Pearl St was only ~25 min away if you’re looking to see some culture, go to a few shops/breweries, get some groceries…Boulder is one cool place.
7. Perfection. This place should be featured in a travel magazine.
I respectfully disagree with any review mentioning that getting up the driveway requires a 4 wheel drive vehicle. You can make it up on 2 wheel. However, you should be a comfortable/confident driver (there’s a drop off along the way; it’s an uphill drive to get there; and it’s dirt/gravel). It takes about 3-4 minutes to go the mile to get from the county road, up the driveway, and arrive to the house.
My only ask for next time would be to have a guest book so we can write a physical log on our entire experience! 😊
Thank you to Nat (and Michelle) for providing a place that gave us an experience we will remember for the rest of our lives.
To anyone that stays here - you’ll be thanking yourself that you did."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are on the fence as to whether or not to book this home; DO IT! Our stay was by far the most tranquil/adventurous/luxurious we’ve ever had! This was our first vacation with our infant and Nat made every effort to make us feel right at home, offering amenities that made vacationing with an infant much easier. The attention to detail in the home is exemplary; from amazing espresso to the jacuzzi that over looks the mountains. The house is an absolute dream and we’ll be talking about our memories for many many years to come!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down the best AirBnB experience ever. Amazing place where you can tell every construction and design decision was well thought out with love and intention. Everything we needed that we didn’t have but needed was there… toothpaste, shampoo, beer, wine and FOOD! And even stuff we didn’t know we needed like a high end expresso machine and freshly ground coffee! The views are stunning, lux comfort and privacy abound. Much appreciation."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is great! Has amazing views and great for a secluded getaway, while still just 30 minutes away from restaurants and stores. Kitchen was very well stocked with everything you'd need and the furniture was excellent."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing special place, finishing touches are top quality - a place of pure tranquility on the outskirts of Boulder. We loved the city and Nat’s house. Would love to return"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the place! There was plenty of kitchen utensils and a pretty stocked fridge/pantry. The bed was comfortable and the cooler air in the mountains allowed us to enjoy the hot tub even in mid June. There was also plenty of wildlife to see. We saw some deer, some hawk, even a few chipmunk came up to window a couple times. Ride up is definitely steep; but not nearly as hard as we thought it would be. Definitely recommend bringing slippers (or socks) to walk around Inside for the hard floors. Hosts were very communicative if we had any questions or had trouble locating anything. Cant wait to come back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very magical place that makes for an unforgettable getaway. The ride up definitely requires a 4wd and a skilled driver but once you’re up there, you’re completely alone (expect for a possible wandering moose). Won’t ever forget this trip."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. We’ve been fortunate enough to stay at a lot of Airbnbs over the years and this one is truly something special. The views, the craftsmanship and the hospitality are all incredible. If you are looking for a remote getaway in the mountains, this is the place to go. Nat is an incredible host who made check in and check out easy. The house is surrounded by nature - the only sounds we heard were nature. To that end, you definitely need four wheel drive to reach the property and should plan for a 30min drive to Boulder if you need supplies!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was extraordinary, unique, very secluded and private. All the details were well thought of and it had everything we needed for our little getaway. Nat and Michelle were so nice and they answered all
of our questions and requests. A well deserved 5 stars."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle and Nat have created a one of a kind experience at their home in the mountains. Waking up to stunning views of Sugarloaf Mountain sets the stage for a day of connection and relaxation. We have stayed in many places throughout the world, and this is easily in our top five. A bit of a splurge and more than worth it!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The residence is an excellent piece of property, beautiful views, and exquisite furnishings.
Leaving this home we feel fulfilled, renewed, and serene.
12/10 recommend."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great secluded spot just 12 miles from Boulder. Made for an amazing anniversary. All the privacy and nature you could want. The pictures don’t do it justice. Nat was a great host and took even better care of us than I could imagine.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nathaniel is an excellent host and he has built a perfect mountain getaway with impressive attention to every detail. A nice bonus was watching a moose roam around the area for hours when we first arrived. Don’t forget to explore the old mining trails in the hills!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nat was a wonderful host and his house was amazing! We will definitely be back!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In a word, amazing. Our host was incredible and went out of his way to make sure our stay was perfect and the property was wonderful. We will go back and highly recommended."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was just beautiful and thoughtfully put together for the guests. It was a great place to chill and with surprisingly good access to both Boulder for a lunch and incredible hiking.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a memorable experience staying here. The house has been flawlessly curated to immerse yourself within nature and truly take in Colorado’s beauty. Definitely be mindful of the steep hills you have to drive up to get there to ensure you plan for dining purposes. Thank for you letting us stay at your beautiful home!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is amazing and the views are lovely! All the amenities you need for a great stay and home away from home!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I booked this Airbnb for our wedding weekend and it was absolutely perfect! The outdoor space was amazing with the grass area, fire pit, hot tub, etc. the indoor space was incredible and the view from the bed when you wake up is spectacular! All in all was perfect for what we were looking for!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing view - wow. Cannot beat the relaxed, yet upscale home. The home over delivered on all our expectations!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous place at a gorgeous location. We are looking forward to coming back When we come to the Boulder area.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is Wow! We were thrilled to be here and will plan to come back when we can.
Nathaniel was very responsive even checking in on us during a wind storm that came through. The home structure itself is very impressive and they spared no expense in their furnishings, appliances, etc. We enjoyed the hiking right outside the front door. From one airbnb host to another, your home is awesome!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I like to book with super hosts/those with several reviews but this place was exactly as described(and only has a few reviews because it is new)! Amazing space and on top of that all of the amenities and little touches were top notch. Communication and checkin/checkout was seamless. 10/10 recommend
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing house, amazing host, and an amazing experience.
The only issue i had with this property was the dirt road. You get pretty close to a cliff and we were nervous to drive on road at night, so we stayed in.
Otherwise, definitely a good experience. I recommend it fully. Looks just like in the pictures. Worth every penny."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful weekend, great host, beautiful house, wishing we were already back looking at that view!!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is an absolute GEM...
This isn't just a beautiful unique house standing on a mountain... ( like its really really up there, so if you don't like rugged rocky steep roads be warned!) ....it is a living work of ART.
The design , shape, and space all feels so cozy and luxurious. I felt like i was on a movie set, or a live in spa. From the 17-foot tall window that encapsulates the entire room around a spectacular view of a mountaintop , to all of the incredible amenities & details... incredible cookware , furniture , bed linens & ESPRESSO ! Every detail was 11/10. This place is meant for a special couples get away, or even the most ultimate dinner party.
Nathaniel is a kind and responsive host, he has created a beautifully put together space and truly cares about his guests.
Can't wait to come here again for future celebrations ... and if your reading this and wondering if you should splurge on a little luxury in your life... this is the sign to do it!!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodations were great.
Modern, clean, comfortable, just as described.
Plenty of space. Nice neighborhood."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for what I was looking for/needed! Clean! VERY close to 20 or more restaurants/coffee shops. The hosts were great at communicating and were very friendly when I met them. Beautiful Fire Place and absolutely Loved the bathroom!
Was Perfect for me! I'd deff stay again!
Cheers
Toad"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thomas was friendly and accommodating on short notice. I met both him and his wife, and they were kind upon check in. They made great recommendations, and were communicative during my stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thomas was a great host & we had a very restful stay in Boulder! He also suggested a great nearby hike that was amazing & doable (Sanitas Valley/East Ridge/Mt Sanitas loop) once we got used to the altitude!! He also had bikes available, which were fun to cruise around on :)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kind and helpful host with a clean and accessible apartment. Great for an easy, downtown stay in Boulder."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Thomas is very responsive and informative. Great walkable to most things. Excellent food suggestions.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay for my wife and me. It was set up like a hotel room, as described. The hairdryer, iron, coffee and little creamers, drinking water, beers, shower soaps were all nice touches. Thomas’s personal photo art was a nice addition. The entire place was inviting, bed was comfortable and Thomas was very attentive/generous and kind. He let us store our bags early and have a late checkout at no extra cost. The neighborhood is quiet and near so much-grocery, coffee shop, pizza, pharmacy, lunch/bakery spots, ice-cream,shopping, the list goes on. Almost all of Boulder is in reasonable walking distance and the bus system is so easy from the airport(AB bus-Boulder downtown hub is 15 min walk away and only $10) Lastly, Stella their cute chihuahua is so darling. I highly recommend and look forward to the next time."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, easy walking to Pearl St. or Ideal market area. Thomas was clear and concise on instructions and the place was perfect for my stay in Boulder."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Location is great and very close to food and Pearl Street Mall. Room is quite small, but is great for 1-2 people for a night or two. Had everything that we needed plus the bed was super comfortable."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,excellent spot to hang your hat while you explore boulder.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Host was responsive and friendly. The place was clean and a great location close to the Boulder Theater if you’re in town for a show.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thomas's airbnb is clean, well-located and easy to access. It is on the smaller side with one room, but it is comfortable. Thomas was easy to communicate with and kind."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect base for my weekend in Boulder. It’s an easy walk to Pearl Street and close to some great restaurants. The suite is comfortable, private, and well-stocked. Id happily stay here again.
The lights mentioned in the directions weren’t on when I arrived, but it was still easy to find the house and the correct entrance even without them."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,5 star stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved this place! I feel like the pictures did not look as cozy as this place truly feels! The bed was very comfortable and they provided soft fuzzy blankets, I think that added such a homely feel! Not to mention the deer I saw my first night and bunnies the next day!! Also the location is pretty great! It's a 10/15 minute walk from Pearl Street, and even closer to other restaurants and stores! Very walkable area! It was my first time in Boulder and I got the best vibes from almost everyone I came across! Also the host was great, he accommodated to my schedule and replied quickly! I would highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thomas was a very friendly and helpful host, the place was absolutely perfect. Thank you!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thomas was very hospitable and kind. He respects your privacy, but is also available for help if needed! The Airbnb is near a bus route that goes downtown directly and also near many restaurants."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay for one or two people in Boulder. Walkable to a couple good coffee shops and restaurants.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Needed a place for just one night and felt right at home. Beautiful neighborhood in Boulder and I really loved the bed :)
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy apartment in a walkable location. I’ll be back!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is great to stop at if you need a getaway for the evening or even a longer term stay like myself. Downtown is walking distance and it's a very quiet neighborhood. Wonderful place!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay here was great. Easily accessed at night for late night checking in. Very clean, very well lit space. I only saw one spider my whole stay. I prefer a very private experience w my stays at air bnbs and I am delighted to say I did not feel bothered not even once by my hosts or their pup.
The only thing I would warn people about is that it is a slightly steep decline to the private entry door in the backyard of the house. The path is not paved and is challenging to climb up/down when snowy (for an able bodied 26 year old). so just plan accordingly w the proper footwear/clothing/timing and this would be the perfect location for most looking to enjoy a stay in Boulder!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy spot in a quiet neighborhood close to central Boulder. We enjoyed a restful night with everything we needed and enough space to spread out and be comfortable. The hidden fridge and microwave in the closet was especially appreciated, as fridges tend to be noisy to sleep near. Would definitely stay again on our next quick trip to Boulder!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was very clean and had the most comfortable bed!!!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Thomas' place was great. The location was very close to everything you could need and worked well for my stay while I worked close by. I didn't realize there wasn't a TV, and while not critical it would be a welcome addition. The wifi was flawless however so streaming, etc was fine.
The place is rather small and in the basement around back of the house but the space was used very well considering you only have a bed, desk and chair. The bathroom was very nice and clean, an mini-fridge and microwave hide in closet to stay out of the way and the bed was very comfortable.
I would certainly stay again though I have had other very nice Airbnb's in Boulder so it always comes down to what is the best available when book.
I would definitely recommend this to others if the review and listing is matches your needs. The only warning that I wasn't aware of is his wife works nights thus sleeps during the days so noise in the morning can be an issue, i.e. be careful about phone calls."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed my stay at Thomas's! Best location in Boulder just a few steps away Pearl Street. Plenty to do and see!
Would definitely stay again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, very walkable to Pearl Street. Super easy and nice!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,clean and efficient one bedroom
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great stay 👍🏻
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Thomas's place was exactly as described and had everything I needed. The bed was very comfortable (much more than most Airbnbs).
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thomas was very communicative and friendly. He cleared a path and made it easier to get to the door in the dark and snow. He allowed a late check-out so we could get some extra rest since we got in late the night before. The room was very cozy and had all we needed. Everything was clearly labeled so there's no confusion.
I will say it's in a basement, so it was pretty cold, but they provided tons of blankets, which helped. It also has a bit of a low ceiling in certain spots that someone of 5'10"" and above would hit their head, so be careful walking around if you're taller. My partner is 6'4"" and he hit his head a couple times. The bed is also pretty firm, so just be aware if that's not your preferred type of bed.
The place was lovely and host was hospitable. We would definitely stay again!
Thank you!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thomas was very responsive with clear instructions on how to locate the property and get inside. He was flexible with check in time and offered lots of great recommendations! I loved this location because it was walkable to the locals shops/restaurants, but he also had some bikes for us to ride too! Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely room for someone relatively quiet.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thomas was always responsive, gave us great local recommendations and helpfully brought down a second chair upon request so our party of 2 could both sit somewhere besides the bed. The space was small, clean, dry, warm, and had everything described in the listing. Highly recommend if you want to be in walking distance of downtown Boulder!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot! Not too far from downtown and close to a great bakery, coffee shop, and pizza place. Would definitely reccomend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved this rental space - the location was great, very walkable to the Pearl Street Mall region, and there were a lot of thoughtful details that the hosts provided. It's not a very large unit, but it's perfect for anyone who plans to explore the area. Also the backyard space is very secluded and peaceful. Plenty of open street parking. We would stay here again!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Thomas's place is comfortable, clean, and in a great neighborhood. I'd happily stay there again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice one room basement space. Clean, with easy check in. Good value for location near downtown. Entry is gravel parking spot with brick walkway down into lower backyard so it isn’t easy for someone with mobility problems."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thomas and his wife (and their dog!) were very welcoming, and their space was cozy, clean, and perfect for our two-night stay in Boulder. They even had a book prepared with loads of information and recommendations about the area! That came in super useful for us, although you may want to double check the business hours for the restaurants/shops (we do take blame for not double checking!). But still, a valuable tool for guests! Comfy bed, quiet neighborhood, plentiful parking, close to downtown, delightful hosts. If we come back to Boulder, we would gladly consider staying here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Thomas kept everything easy. Super responsive and friendly. Thank you!!

Just north of Pearl St. with a shopping strip one block away that included a coffee shop, bagel place, pizza, market and liquor store. I only stayed the night and it was perfect for my needs. I would definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We came from Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons. We were headed home to Iowa but wanted to take a detour to Boulder so we didn’t have to rush home. We found this Airbnb. It was a great price. We really enjoyed the bicycles and being close to the Pearl St Mall. Very clean, had everything the description said. I highly recommend staying here if in the area!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great short stay at Thomas’s place! It was very clean, in a peaceful neighborhood, and conveniently located.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent. Would stay again!
2023-07-01,3,Stayed one night,"Compared to another airbnb I've stayed in in Boulder about the same time last year this was much smaller with no kitchenette, no sitting room and $100 more."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super convenient! This is a great spot for single traveler, close to grocery, cafe and other amenities, and a fairly short walk to downtown. Not too far to walk from the bus station, so it's easy to get on RTD. Small fridge in unit and other helpful items. Backyard is nice and peaceful. The unit is part of a daylight basement cordoned of from the rest of the house, not the separate studio you see in the pics of the backyard. Had a deer and bunnies visit me in the yard while I was there."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a humble single room lower-level suite with a comfy bed, nice bath, a desk, fridge, Keurig and microwave. My wife and I will gladly stay here again. Not a place for fancy people and not recommended for those with significant mobility issues, due to the steep brick pathway leading to the entry to this suite. Very quiet and a great location."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Overall a great experience. Thomas even proactively offered to loan me a bike and lock at no charge to help me get to/from the starting line of the 10k race is was in town to run.

Our first night there, after coming back from dinner, we were greeted with a herd of about 12+ deer in the backyard just yards away from our private entrance. It was a very peaceful home in a very peaceful neighborhood. I feel as if Thomas and his wife thought of everything when it came to what you might need for a stay at their home. Overall, such a great experience. If we ever make it back to Colorado and the Boulder area we would live to stay again."

I also loved that the studio is located next to the backyard garden with a hammock and bikes for use, and I loved how quiet the neighborhood was. Waking up every morning to enjoy my cup of tea in the lovey backyard was just a wonderful experience!
The place is just a short 10min stroll from Pearl Str. and all the downtown restaurants and shops and close to hiking trails, yoga, laundry, or whatever else you're looking for.
