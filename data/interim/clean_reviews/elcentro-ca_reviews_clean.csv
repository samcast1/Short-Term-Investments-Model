It's very quiet and relaxing. Check in and out was a breeze. Karla was very responsive and was always there for any concerns that may arise. I felt extremely safe in the location. There were two host and although, it was advertised that there was parking on premises one host asked that i parked on the street while the other said it was okay to park in the driveway that was a bit confusing so i just parked on the street which could make bringing luggage in a bit difficult. There's cooking gear although, no sink besides the one in the restroom. I highly recommend booking if this fits your needs!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect for the price. Located in a nice calm neighborhood. Really clean space. Beats by far staying in motels that are equally priced.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Have stayed multiple times and have been satisfied with each stay! perfect place to stay seriously.
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"I sadly differ in my review of her place. There were small insects crawling out of opening in the plaster wall and the ground that wasn‚Äôt sealed or caulked. There were many such open features in the ceiling and around the walls.
There was a 4x6 inch dark hole in the ceiling above the bed that was kinda scary which I had to buy a white duct tape and cover it up to feel less worried that something might fall out of it in the middle of the night. I have pictures to prove this.
The other thing that was, in fact, a building code violation and needs to be corrected before renting it to anyone was that the bathroom had no window or a fan. Either or is required by building codes.
The sheets were not all that clean w spots and hair on them. I always take my own blankets and blankets w me when I go into any Airbnb. The TV set was way too small and placed low that would make it difficult to lie down on the bed and watch it.
If she wants to make it more attractive and comfortable, all she has to"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Quiet and peaceful.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Maria space is totally lovely. It is in a peaceful and quiet neighborhood. The space is completely private. I loved the modern decor. Everything that we needed was provided for us. Maria was very quick to communicate with us. The best part about this stay is the super comfortable King sized bed. I highly recommend this place, it was 100 times nicer than staying in any of the hotel options in the area. We felt completely safe and secure."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay! So cozy; absolutely loved the bed and how inviting the place is. Ill recommend Maria to anyone who's planning on visiting the area!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I needed a place for a stop during my drive back home and that‚Äôs when I found Maria‚Äôs airbnb. I was impressed of how cute they have turned their garage into. I got in late last night and Maria was very sweet to check in that I got in ok. It was a perfect place for me to spend the night and freshen up. I‚Äôm thankful for Maria‚Äôs kindness of checking in and she was kind to let me know I didn‚Äôt need to rush out. Overall a very good experience! :)

2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"There were no utensils, especially since we needed forks and spoons. Overall, it was a decent place to sleep and I had to ask for a blow dryer. Host brought me a blow dryer, however I do think the hostess should leave a blow dryer for guests."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved it! Definitely recommend. Peaceful and felt right at home.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband was traveling for work so I booked Maria‚Äôs place for him. While I didn‚Äôt stay there, I can say my husband said it was great for the couple of nights he was there. Maria was very friendly and responsive. My husband said the studio was clean and decorated well. The refrigerator and toaster oven were appreciated. The only complaint he had was that it was chilly. He said the wall unit only blew out cool air. A space heater in the winter months would be a great amenity to add. Otherwise it was a nice stay and we would book with Maria again."
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The host needs to provide pictures of the entrance to the place and not the house, very confusing when trying to get to Airbnb late at night. The place was not cleaned prior to my arrival. Trash was left in the bin, a leftover tea in the cup on the table and it didn‚Äôt seem the bed was changed. It was very uncomfortable and I‚Äôm glad it was only for one night."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, very convenient location"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy as stated. Hot plate and pot accessible for warming hot chocolate. Outdoor sitting space for 2.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I've stayed in 50+ Airbnb's now and this was top 2 or 3. Super clean, very good value, very spacious."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stop over and spend the night on road trip!
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Pros:The location is nice, with plenty of outside parking, & a nice neighborhood. Maria was attentive to our arrival. The unit was nicely decorative and the bed was comfortable. Cons:The room was very cold at night, & there was an opening under the main door which let the cold air into the room. The restroom was small, I am 5' 11"" & it was difficult to use the toilet, my knees would hit the front wall. The mirror looked dirty, & it seemed that the restroom may have not been cleaned before we arrived. The sink faucet spout needs to be replaced because it sprays water all over the outside of the sink & on you. Every now & then we would hear a loud high-pitched humming sound, possibly from the water pipes. When we first arrived the room smelled fine but later at night, we had a sewer smell that eventually went away. We were disappointed that it did not have a microwave to warm up a small portion of food & leftover coffee. It needs a little TLC which would make it a nicer place to stay"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and just what I needed. Perfect if you want your own space and bathroom. I would stay again if I need a place to stay in El Centro. Thank you!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stayed at Maria‚Äôs Airbnb she‚Äôs was very nice and I enjoyed being there. I recommend going there.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My first Airbnb experience. It was great! Very easy ,clean and a quiet neighborhood."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, the stay was basic and what I needed for a quick trip when hotels were really high priced. I had to reach out to Maria for check-in instructions which she provided promptly. However that was the last communication I had with her the entirety of my stay which was fine.
The room was spacious. It seems like someone hadn't stayed there in a while though as it was quite dusty, crumbs on the kitchenette area, and food left in the freezer. It appeared that they just changed the sheets for my stay but didn't re-vacuum wipe down the room etc from the last time it was used. As I was already in a pinch I knew I didn't have anywhere else to stay, but the cleanliness was a little below what I expect.
Overall though, it was private and convenient in a nice area. I feel like I got what I paid for."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pros: private, spacious, comfortable.
Would be five stars except that there was some kind of biting insects - I woke up with new small, itchy bite marks each night. I don't think it was bedbugs, but rather just flies/mosquitos or something like that. Don't want to make it sound infested, it was clean but poorly insulated; it was more of an annoyance."

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was good overall! The only thing that threw me off was how the kitchen stove was noticeably messy and there was crumbs & a broken nail throughout the place. I would expect it to be spotless considering there is a cleaning fee.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a cute and quiet studio with its own private entrance. Bed was comfortable, curtains were black out, a/c worked amazingly! Full size fridge was a plus! House was a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù friendly. The Bluetooth speaker in the bathroom and rainfall shower were great! We did encounter a few issues, but Jawwad was quick to respond and correct the issues. Washer & dryer was an added bonus, but due to the odor of mold in the washer we decided to not use and seek a local laundry mat in town. We absolutely loved the layout of the place, decor and quietness of the place. Jawwad was very nice, and seemed eager to make our experience great. Definitely recommend this place for anyone needing and wanting a safe, comfortable, quiet place to get some rest!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The attention to detail in this place was extraordinary. The shower is phenomenal, tons of water running at a constant temperature. The bathroom had little jars with cotton balls and swabs, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. The kitchen was fully equipped, had some food items up for grabs from previous guests, and its items were easy to find. The bed was comfortable and clean, and the TV area great to relax and watch a movie or TV show. The coffee table in front of the TV opens up to dinner table level, making it ideal to either play games or have a meal. There were games available too. The lights had many settings that you could adjust to your needs, and were of colors that matched the ambience of the place. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. Jawwad was super responsive and accommodating to our specific needs."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay here. I went to El Centro to get tattooed and knew it was going to take a couple days. This place was within a mile and very accessible. Although whoever parked their electric car to be charged at night were pretty loud and sounded loud inside from I believe the cords banging up against the house, it was a very pleasant stay.
The place is easily accessible and even if you are not familiar with the area like myself, it is easy to get back too. The host was quick to respond within a manner of a minute when my code didn‚Äôt work for the door. I requested an early check in because I drove from out of state and he accommodated my request. This is a nice cozy place that was worth it verses staying in a hotel that has a lot of foot traffic. I felt safe and secure here being a female that stayed by herself."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough good things!!! Jawwad went so out of his way to make sure my partner and I were able to check in early and was so understanding when our travel plans kept changing. The only thing that would keep me from saying good things is the hope we can keep this special gem just for ourselves! But with how beautiful the airbnb is and how kind and helpful Jawwad is as a host, he deserves to have full bookings. Definitely plan to book every Christmas (if its available). Thank you thank you thank you!!!"

The only down side is the room was still a bit warm despite the AC being on max and the ceiling fan being on and the smoke alarm will go off if you're cooking because the space is small with not much ventilation, although Raz is extremely responsive and even installed a new tv during my stay!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Raz and J‚Äôs place was perfect! Their apartment was secure, quiet, clean, and cozy and had a lot of updated features. For example, their waterfall shower is amazing! The bed was super comfortable and the kitchen was updated and spotless! You get a nice window bedside, so you can look out to the yard and get lots of morning light. But they also have blackout curtains if you want more privacy.
Overall, I was super impressed by the apartment but even more so by Raz and J‚Äôs hospitality. They were extremely accommodating, such as being flexible with check in and check out times. I got in early and was just hoping to drop my bags off, but they went over and above and let me check in a couple of hours early. Raz communicated really well and responded to all of my questions promptly.
During my stay I got injured, and just as an example of how kind hearted Raz and J are, they checked in on me to make sure I was ok.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in this Airbnb in late April, 2023. This little studio was perfect for the two of us and our two 20-lb dogs. It‚Äôs a recently created ADU, an extremely nicely appointed garage conversion. Though the unit is attached to the main house, it has its own separate, easily accessible entry door. The layout inside is efficient and comfortable, and the one and only window is large and south-facing, providing good lighting if you draw open the curtains. You would never know you were in a garage. This is a very well thought-out conversion.
The materials used are modern, minimalist and nicely used thru out so you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre just staying in a tiny box. Some of the features in the kitchen and bathroom i wish for my house!
The hosts were professional, quick to respond and friendly."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family came to town to attend a celebration of life ceremony in nearby Holtville. We came across this place and chose it based on the proximity and is located around plenty of services. Upon entering the property we were all very happy we made this choice. The entire home was super clean and very comfortable. Patty made sure we had several Kcups for the coffee machine and some of the personal hygiene items folks typically forget. The rooms were plenty big to accommodate the entire family and very comfortable. The main area was also very comfortable so the grandkids could watch TV while we relaxed. At one point we had messed up the door lock code and when I messaged Patty she got back in touch within minutes.
If you are looking for a great place to stay then look no further this is a good one.

I was traveling alone and wanted to find a space where I could get away from all the people I was going to be with for 2 INTENSE days.
Patty's place offered me EXACTLY the comfy, private space I desired close to the hotels where others were staying, the elementary school I served, and close to the Naval airfield too.
After a long travel day and driving from San Diego in minimum sleep, I slept like a baby in the uber-comfy bed.
I loved the plethora of authentic Mexican food that was within a 5 minute drive [fave was Los Cabos seafood grill] and the super comfy space with coffee I enjoyed very much.
It was very much like coming home... not a hotel experience... just my own private room for relaxing at the end of long, fun days doing the work I love as Captain Mama. I will stay here again next March!"

2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The place was nice, clean, and looked as advertised. The complimentary waters, coffee, and oatmeal was a nice touch. The negative was a sewage smell emanating from the bathroom that stunk up the living room. We were lucky that we were there for only one night, but I hope they can take care of that for future visitors. Also, the previous visitors forgot their personal belongings in the drawers like dirty underwear, socks, clothes, and even a purse. The cleaning crew should make sure to check the drawers before new visitors check in.
The location to the border is perfect and a great space to rest up before crossing the border. I would re-book if the sewage issue is addressed."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Second time staying here and it was veered than the first!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Angel‚Äôs before. This is an excellent host. We travel all over the world and Angel is very thoughtful on his guest needs. Enough towels for each occupant, shampoo, conditioner, cold water bottles in the fridge, tea bags, coffee and cream even instant ramen soups. So he goes beyond his duties as a host. I particularly like that the place was cool since he previously turn the air conditioner on!!! Kiddos for being a super host Angel. We definitely will be back! Maria Macias"

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Angel's place was well-appointed and clean. We liked the space in the bedroom and living room and were able to cook full meals in the kitchen. The carport is great to not have to park on the street and to protect our cars from the heat of the sun. The hosts were very responsive and I'm appreciative that we were permitted a late checkout. Overall the neighborhood was quiet but there was one neighbor whose dog was barky at times. The only real challenge was the reliability of the wifi but the hosts diligently worked with me to find a workaround. I hope to return to the property.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,this place was even cuter than the pictures! Very close to places to eat and to get to the border. My only downfall was the neighbors dogs barking all night. Other than that it was amazing! I will definitely be staying again
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was so clean, loved the privacy, had access to a washer & dryer, private kitchen, a back yard, very dog friendly, & the parking garage was very appreciated. What a great place for a great price. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I only stayed for a night but Angel‚Äôs listing was perfect. The space was very clean and so easy to not only find but also access with clear instructions. The bedroom felt very spacious for having two beds and the kitchen was a great size to make quick and easy meals. I also loved having private parking and not having to leave my car on the street. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Calexico.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Angel's place was very clean and super cute. Beds were comfortable and it was easy check in. The covered and gated parking was nice. The surrounding areas were a little rough but don't let that deter you. We felt very safe and would be back.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice little apartment - definitely a diamond in the rough! Comfortable, clean, reserved parking. Only issue was the WiFi was a bit spotty. Served it‚Äôs purpose to get us over the border 1st thing in the morning!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"excellent place, I highly recommend it
excellent and quick attention üëå"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Will give my honest review with my honest opinions/thoughts.
I‚Äôll start with the good and then some not quite good.
Truly a nice place. Clean enough, nice furniture, etc. I appreciated the covered parking. I believe it had ac/heater so you can get it comfy in there. Bed was comfortable enough. Had a nice, large tv so entertainment shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. If you want to be near the border, it‚Äôs pretty close. The host seemed nice and helpful.
The neighborhood seemed a little rough, but I and my car seemed safe enough. It was quiet. The total price seemed a little steep for Calexico. There was an artificial scent in the place (air freshener). Better than a bad scent, but I can be pretty sensitive to artificial. I unplugged it, but the scent was hard to completely get rid of. The toilet didn‚Äôt flush well (it worked if you flushed it just right) and was right next to the shower (which, sadly, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything that can be done about it).
Overall, I enjoyed the stay"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"excellent place, very clean and cozy as described in the photos, highly recommend."
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Reasonably well-appointed and quiet. Bed was comfortable, blackout curtains in the bedroom were a nice touch, but there was no way to turn out the spotlight outside the bedroom window.
The only real drawback was a strong natural gas smell that permeated the entire place. I don't know if it was a gas leak or what, but I had to open the windows to disperse it. As soon as I closed them it came back. The gas stove worked fine though, so I'm not sure where it was coming from."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, super host, private covered parking, spotless home, would come back. Thanks"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent comfortable accommodations. Clean, nice kitchen and living room. Spacious bedroom. Been here twice now and enjoyed both times! Consideration other options this is a true gem!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Angel's place is a great place to stay in Calexico. It's peaceful and we felt safe there. The space is well stocked, and the beds are super comfortable. We were hoping to walk our dog to the nearby park, but there were several off-leash dogs who chased us -- it wouldn't have been an issue if we didn't have a dog. Just something to be aware of if you're traveling with your pup. We appreciated the dog treats that Angel left for us! Thank you for everything!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent! Highly recommended, small but super nice place. We had a very comfortable stay! Impeccable cleanliness, comfortable beds and comes with everything you need to spend a few incredible days. A private parking space. Pet friendly.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to overnight before early appointment at Border for a Sentri pass for one of us. Hope to stay again for the next appointment in February.

She went beyond what was expected to make sure we got checked in on time and were comfortable. I can't recommend this property enough. It was exactly what we needed and I look forward to staying here again!
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The space was clean and looked exactly like the photos. It was bigger than expected. Mark was great at communicating. Our issue was the AC. It was not working. The situation wasn‚Äôt resolved when we were there so that was unfortunate. Mark was trying his best to get it fixed but due to the repairman‚Äôs availability it wasn‚Äôt fixed. It was 84 degrees in the condo, which was really uncomfortable."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,:) thank you for the recommendations and the discount to local restaurants! Funky and fun and very clean. Definitely recommend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place comfy and cozy.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot to stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing I will try to book it again next year when I come back for conference and every other year after that, one of the best places I‚Äôve stayed at so far, it had everything they said it would very nice and it feels very comfy and homie. One thing I would suggest is to have it dusted out like under the couch cushions because it was very dusty dirty..just to have it done before check in and to have a broom and mop for us to clean up our own mess before we leave and check out. Also maybe better towels like two body, face and hand towels in each bathroom that would be good, and lastly I think the patio should be cleaned and and have a new bench and chairs out there so we can enjoy the night breeze outside and have somewhere to sit that would make more perfect then it already is."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Your Airbnb was awesome and perfect for our getting ready pictures!! Very clean and close to everything‚Ä¶..Thank you again for our gift so thoughtful and such a nice thing to walk into when we arrived ‚ù§Ô∏è we would definitely stay here again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice, clean and quiet house close to everything!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay in Mark‚Äôs home. He was very responsive. His home was exactly as described . Loved the decor and design . Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in the area .
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"THIS AIRBNB IS PERFECT!!
Best Airbnb in the valley hands down. This place is fun, modern, and stylish without trying to hard. Looks like it‚Äôs a home and not something out of a Pinterest board.
They really took care of me and made my stay special. He was thoughtful, communicative and really responsive.
I would definitely stay at their homes again. They make coming to the valley worth it."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a relaxing, clean, quiet place with a host that is super responsive and accommodating, then you can stop right here. I needed to stay in El Centro for a week in October and I was looking for a centrally located place that would have excellent internet since I was going to be working via video conference from the unit on most days. I was trying to avoid a week in a hotel. I am a little hesitant to rent an Airbnb when there is a paucity of reviews, but because Mark has such a generous cancellation policy, I was able to reserve it without risk to get the exact location and correspond a little with Mark. Once I reserved it, I could see it was centrally located in El Centro (just what I needed), and I was able to get more details from Mark. He is super responsive and because there were not back-to-back rentals for my time there, he allowed me to stay a little later on my departure day which was incredibly helpful to me. The unit was easy to locate, easy to access, had plenty of safe parking and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay including an in-unit washer and dryer, a dishwasher, great AC (important b/c it was 100 degrees while I was there), and starter supplies like coffee and dish soap. His appliances are quality, unlike what you will sometimes find in a vacation rental. His furniture was comfortable ‚Äì couches a nice size, beds just the right softness and a nice sized kitchen table. He also had SMART TVs in every room, all of which were in terrific working order. We arrived late at night, but Mark left on the outside light and a couple of interior lights, so it was easier for me; he also left the AC on, so it was cool not hot and stuffy when we got in. In other words, the small thoughtful things that make everything more pleasant! The internet was as advertised, super-fast so there was no lagging in my video calls. So, the verdict, a terrific place with an amazing host that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for an alternative to hotel living for an extended stay. Thanks Mark!!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mark was an extremely great host. The space was perfectly located for the needs of our trip. Mark gave suggestions for local businesses and was very attentive during our stay. I would definitely stay at his home again. Thanks Mark!!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful! Mark‚Äôs home is beautiful and was very clean. Mark was also very attentive to any questions we had. The beds were comfortable (a very important detail for me) and the extra touches of coffee for the Keurig and a washer and dryer with detergent available made our stay extra nice. When in the area we will definitely try to stay at one of his properties.
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"I was in El Centro to work and shared the space with another nurse. Mark‚Äôs place is located on the end of a row of townhouses (or triplexes) and appears to be newly remodeled. Parking was on the street in front of the home, keypad entry. Everything is as pictured, however we dealt with some issues since we were the first guests, such as the A/C not cooling, shower warmth/flow, vents falling from the ceiling onto beds ‚Äî thankfully my roommate was not in bed at the time. It was also quite dusty and sandy on all floor surfaces when we arrived and I noticed that some cleaning products and other necessities were missing, so I spent some money at Walmart buying a Swiffer, front door rug, disinfectant wipes, toilet paper, dishwasher pods, small trash cans, more hangers, and a pedestal fan (there are no ceiling fans in any rooms) ‚Äî this was before Mark responded and told us the extra cleaning supplies were in a locked closet üòï Toward the end of our stay, the nights began to get cool so we had some unwelcome guests (ants!) in our bedrooms and bathrooms that we bought traps for and used the insect spray we found in the storage closet. My poor roommate again was the one most affected by this; I just saw a little line of them marching from the window to the interior door.
If you are in the El Centro-area for business or pleasure, this would be a great place for a family to stay and has plenty of board games, Netflix, etc. to keep everyone entertained. Once the initial growing pains of a new property were worked out, everything went smoothly from there."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It exceeded expections. Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was absolutely beautiful, Cindy was incredibly responsive. We ran into an issue with the thermostat and she had someone out immediately to try to fix it. They weren't able to fix it but came back the next day and got it taken care of. You will not be disappointed by this beautiful home. Thank you for being an amazing host."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great space, ez process"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was just as described. My family was comfortable and kitchen was well equipped. We'll definitely consider renting this place again for any future family events.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Words cannot describe the beauty of this listing. The pictures were exactly how we found the house. The entire house was clean and absolutely beautiful from the garage up to the bathroom. Truly all you need to bring is your clothes as Everything is provided for you. This house was the best option for our family vs getting two hotel rooms and the price is about the same considering all the amenities you get with the house. I cook for a living and let me tell you this kitchen was amazing, just being able to cook meals at home definitely helped with food cost while on vacation. I would normally bring all my utensils and pans to cook but not this time. This is a must stay place if you are going to be in the Imperial/El Centro area. Actually if you are planning on going to visit San Diego (about a 1 1/2 hour drive) this is still a great getaway from the big city. Cindy was the best host to have and will definitely be back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying, great location and great host."

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cindy was a great host and her home was one of the nicest places we've ever stayed in. There were 6 of us all together and we all agreed that this place was so comfortable, clean, and cozy that it felt like a home away from home. The host thought of everything to make anyone's stay a pleasant one."

This home was beautiful, very clean and had every amenity you could think of. My kids loved the bunk bed. The layout is perfect for a family. Having a garage to park in that connects to the inside of home is so convenient when traveling. The Master bedroom and bathroom felt like a resort. We highly recommend it here. We cannot wait to stay here again. Thank you!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice spot with quiet neighbors & neighborhood. Immaculate with very simple departure instructions. A great find
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend. This will be my new go-to place to stay when visiting family. Super clean place, very spacious, nicely decorated, comfy beds, lots of towels, everything is modern inside, decently-stocked kitchen, and I liked that they had plates and cups for kids that won‚Äôt break. Way better than staying in the hotels by the mall.
I grew up in El Centro and come back to visit extended family about once a year. We usually stay in the hotels by the mall, but this time I thought I‚Äôd take a chance on an Airbnb and I‚Äôm glad I did! It‚Äôs way better than staying at the hotels since you get multiple bedrooms and bathrooms, and a full kitchen for about the same price as a hotel room."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Guys had a great stay. Thanks!
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Very good

The towels are 100% cotton. Cindy was quickly responsive when we could not get the key pad to work and when we needed instructions for operating the thermostat. The showers were great; the kitchen was amply supplied; the garage accommodated both cars. We wanted to extend our stay an extra night, and the process was seamless. Highly recommended."

A large designated bathroom only for that room, your own little mini fridge, microwave, coffee and condiments. The bathroom was supplied with toiletries and plenty of linens, if needed.

I have stayed there multiple times and have never had a complaint. Look no further!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Stop looking for a place to stay in El Centro and book with Marco. Marco and Alicia are such good hosts. The house is beautiful and absolutely sparkling clean, not a stray hair or dust particle anywhere. The location is very convenient to any place you would want to go in El Centro.

2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're visiting El Centro, it's probably for business, or to visit family or friends. There aren't too many Airbnb options there, but Marco's place is a great find. A private room, well-equipped with coffee maker, fridge and really great Wi-Fi in a very safe and quiet part of town. You'll need a car to get around, since you're a bit away from downtown or the mall. Marco and his wife are very sweet people and I felt well taken care of during my visit."

,,,"Be careful when staying at this place. The place itself was great but unfortunately the host decided to make false claims of damages to her place. Is currently charging me for AC repair, garbage disposal and chairs that parts became undone.. not broken. Also claims of other damages that were already there."
