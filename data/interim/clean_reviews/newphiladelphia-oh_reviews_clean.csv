The neighborhood was really nice to walk through, and we found a Dairy Queen right down the street.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Harmony's place! Everything was neat and clean, and the kitchen had all the cooking equipment we needed. I really appreciated the little plug-in fireplace in the bedroom and the beds/pillows were comfy. There's a good bit of traffic noise from the main road, so if you're sensitive, earplugs would come in handy. Harmony was very accommodating, especially when we accidentally left something behind! A lovely Victorian stay...we'll hopefully be back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was as advertised, very clean, and host was very nice!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A charming older home comfortable and quant
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fun little stay, the wood floors in the apartment are not something you see very often.
3 beds made it very spacious. Host provided charging cords for your phones/tablets which I found thoughtful.
Don’t let the word “apartment” fool you, the space is just that. spacious.
Host was great at communicating and had even sent a message warning us of the holiday parade downtown in case we had plans in the area. Instructions to open the door were clear. I may have missed it, but wasn’t sure where to park. Under the carport seemed the right thing, didn’t hear otherwise.
The only one concerned anyone should have, the shower is tiny. If you’re a larger person, just know it’s small..
Great place, great price. Book it."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Harmony’s place is beautiful. We loved our stay. Everything is sparkling clean and the place is spacious. We were in the area to see our daughter in a musical at the Ohio Star Theatre. It was an easy commute. We were also celebrating Thanksgiving with her and her boyfriend. It was wonderful to have the space to do Thanksgiving dinner. I recommend Harmony’s place you will love it.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay, a lot of space, clean and good location.
Great for families. The only thing it would say…turning on the light in the bathroom , the fan starts too and it’s too noisy. You can’t hear anything from outside."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed here with a couple of friends for a wedding and it was exactly what we needed! Would definitely recommend d Harmony’s place for a short or extended stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This large downstairs apartment in a grand old house was really great. Perfect for our stay. The kitchen had everything we needed and it's a full sized, not just an afterthought kitchenette. The apartment has high ceilings with fans that had been reversed for winter - that helps bring the heat back down. I imagine they are great in the summer, as well. There are some beautiful wood floors with interesting architectural details. The beds were comfortable with various pillow options and there are also some thoughtful touches like a motion activated nightlight near the bathroom, universal charging cables by each bed, and blackout curtains on all the bedroom windows. The covered parking was really appreciated for loading and unloading, since it was raining when we arrived and when we left. If you come to town to catch a show at the Performing Arts Center, like we did, this is a great place to stay. Don't miss the Ernest Warther Musuem in nearby Dover, either."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at Harmony's place very much. It was centrally located, clean, and affordable. We only needed it for a night so it was nice that there wasn't a two-night minimum. We had everything we needed for a comfortable, just like home experience."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location was great and everything was smooth. There were plenty of amenities, most importantly wifi and the TV options were great. Beds were comfortable and I felt the temp was perfect.
One thing I will say for people with small kids - the apartment is definitely not sound proof so make sure you bring a sound machine if your kids are sensitive to sounds - we could hear the upstairs neighbors late and early and I can only assume they heard us.
Overall we had a very great stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Harmony is a wonderful host and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay. She allowed us to check in early and was available for the few questions we had. We visit the area often and hope to be able to stay there again. Oh, and the most comfy beds ever!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting on family business that was high stress, the apartment was quiet and clean just what my wife, kids, and I needed."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband, mom (81), and mother-in-law (88) had a lovely stay! The space was super clean. The beds were comfy. Mom enjoyed sitting on the porch with a warm cup of tea. Mother-in law raved about the spotless appliances. Lots of personal touches, including tea and coffee in the kitchen, games in the parlor, charging cords for all types of phones and devices, and (our favorite) the massage chair. We all took turns trying it out after a long drive. Had a great stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Harmony & Jessie are like family to us after 3 stays. We had a power outage during our stay and Jessie brought us a lantern and a flashlight. Everything we needed was provided and it is like having our own place while on vacation.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Have you ever stayed somewhere you never want to leave? This place was that for me. I wish I would’ve had time to stay for a week or more. You can tell they have invested well in their property which has created a very peaceful atmosphere. So all this to say you will get way more than you paid for…don’t pass this one up.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it so much had to come back already!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great night at this place. Peaceful and extremely relaxing. Enjoyed a firepit conversation together and then kicked back for a movie night. Loved the home decor and especially the huge shower. Would definitely stay here again. Hosts are very friendly and helpful.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great family
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tony and Louann’s Airbnb, Casini’s Corner, is a great place to stay. They are great host and thought of everything to accommodate our stay. They were there to welcome us and show us around their beautiful gardens and where we were staying. We loved the peaceful country setting. So much more relaxing & quieter compared to a hotel. Casini’s Corner is very clean and beautiful inside and outside . Definitely would stay again. We loved our stay ❤️"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfy, cozy and clean, Tony and Louanne have created a lovely retreat. Just five miles off the interstate outside of New Philadelphia. Altho it was brief, we enjoyed our stay."

Beautiful scenery, cozy place, comfortable furniture, excellent finishes, fantastic hosts, I could go on!
Thank you, both, for an amazing trip!! Hopefully we see you next year!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This little place was absolutely perfect! Clean, nicely decorated inside and out, comfortable furniture, and stocked with bathroom supplies, tea and coffee! We attended a wedding at The Glass on Enchanted Acres and Louanne and Tony’s place was a quick 5 minutes away! We had mentioned the wedding started earlier than check in and they kindly offered us a early check in. We were pleasantly surprised and took advantage of the offer! It was exactly what we needed to crash after a long night of dancing and celebrating. We absolutely loved staying and will definitely book if we’re ever near by again. 10/10 book it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Casini's Corner was an amazing get away location. Very quiet and peaceful. Great hosts!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice and cozy place
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful place w/ many interesting & eclectic furnishings and decorations. As others have pointed out, the attention to detail was second to none...coffee, beverages, creamers, etc. There is a patio & steps-away pond with a fire pit & logs if you have time for it. Unfortunately I didn't, but it would be great to sit out there w/ a beverage and enjoy the country setting.
There were a couple of small problems I experienced...1) a weak electrical breaker that killed the unit's power once, 2) the associated lack of hot water, and 3) dishes that were not ultimately microwave safe. But Tony was fast to respond and the overwhelmingly 5-star aspect of the location, furnishings and peace & serenity of the place made it the nicest & best value AirBNB I have experienced to date.
Bottom-line: do not hesitate to book this place and you will be very satisfied I am sure.
BTW: about 6 to 8 miles from New Philadelphia, but it's a simple drive there.
Thanks Tony & LouAnn!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great hosts, extremely clean and well maintained property"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Louanne & Tony provided us with a clean and cozy retreat, a home away from home!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Casini's Corner was a very nice place to stay. This place was extremely spacious and nicely decorated. There were so many amenities included in this rental property.

We left early the next morning to be at a wedding, but hope to return someday and enjoy this rental some time in the future. Thanks again for hosting us."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location for coming for the weekend. Easy to find and fast, friendly check-in process. Comfortable, quiet space."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay all except for the video camera on the back porch that records everything and looks like it records through the back door. Hopefully they will move that thing somewhere else other than the main hangout spot! It made me very uncomfortable
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our 2nd time staying here. When we were coming to visit family again it was our 1st pick. We absolutely love it. Beautiful area, beautiful home, decor to die for and perhaps the BEST HOSTS we've ever met."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were only in town for one night for a family wedding so we didn’t have an opportunity to fully appreciate the area but in that short time we were treated like family. The space was well-appointed, welcoming, and very comfortable."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Casini's Corner is amazing! Truly a home away from home. Peaceful, clean and exactly as advertised.
Tony and Louanne are the absolute best host!! We really appreciated the assistance provided prior to our booking. The warm welcome upon arrival and so much more. They truly have servant hearts.
While in town, we enjoyed dinner at Hog Heaven, breakfast at The Daily Grind Cafe, a trip to the Christian Book Store and the wedding we attended at The Barn on Enchanted Arces.
Thank you, Tony and Louanne. May God continue to bless you and your beautiful home."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Louanne and Tony’s Airbnb is so cute and cozy!! We wish we could have stayed longer but it was perfect for our short stay. There is everything a guest may need and they even had it decorated for Christmas! I would recommend this Airbnb if you are staying in the area!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s just such a beautiful and peaceful spot that it really feels like it’s in its own little universe. And I would think the serenity it provides is completely unmatched if I didn’t experience firsthand that even that might just have been topped by the hospitality of its hosts. Truly grateful to them both for sharing their little corner of the world with us; it’s such an incredible escape.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My family loved this venue! Modern, clean, spacious and GREAT hosts!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was the coziest Airbnb tucked away in a beautiful quiet location. Very clean, pretty spacious for 2 people and it was very relaxing place for a night away. Great communication from hosts."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Exceptional air BnB. Hosts were perfect and will definitely stay again! Highly recommend
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is an amazing place! I can honestly say it was one of the nicest places I've ever stayed - cozy, very peaceful, and CLEAN (even for a crazy germophobe like me). We stayed one night after biking along the southern portion of the towpath trail, and it was a great location for this. I've had all good experiences staying in homes when the owner is present, but each time I do feel a little anxious about whether or not I'll feel uncomfortable or ""in their way."" However, I immediately felt good about my choice when we arrived: Tony and Louanne were both so genuine when they welcomed us, but they'll also give you total privacy if you want it. I admit I laughed at how many reviewers mentioned the bathroom, but it really does deserve all the praise it gets - it's so gorgeous! The whole space was beautiful. The private patio overlooking the pond was a great way to wind down at the end of the day, and again for having our coffee (provided by the owners) the next morning. I hope to return to the New Philadelphia area - we'd definitely stay at Casini's again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hands down the best Air BnB experience I’ve had. Louanne and Tony were kind and approachable, the site was cozy and comforting, and the entire process was seamless. We definitely plan to come back for another stay!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tony and Luanne are amazing hosts. They have thought of everything their guests would need to feel comfortable and well cared for. We enjoyed our stay so much. Having a glass of wine by the pond and watching the sunset from the patio made our stay memorable. Their property is beautiful and well cared for. The space is comfortable, the bathroom is huge, and everything you need at your fingertips. We are so grateful for hosts like Tony and Luanne. They are the ultimate hosts, with a true gift of hospitality. We hope to be back someday!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is an absolutely beautiful home owned by two equally beautiful people! We received an incredibly warm welcome from Louanne and Tony during a massive downpour, and it was just a prelude to our great stay in their suite. The suite is very clean, spacious, handsomely decorated and comfortable. Their property is lush and peaceful. It stopped raining and we enjoyed an afternoon on the patio with a great bottle of wine from our hosts, and sat by the fire pit in the evening. If looking for a great weekend getaway, I highly recommend Louanne and Tony's home."

The space that they had available to us was clean and very comfortable. We really enjoyed staying with them!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is called Lil Italy 🇮🇹 The Casini’s are kind, very accommodating people. We had a wonderful visit at this Airbnb! If I can give 10 stars ⭐️ I would.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay. We enjoyed the peaceful and tranquil location! Highly recommend to anyone who is considering it.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful experience! Louanne and Tony made the entire process seamless. From greeting us upon our arrival and walking us through the unit to the check-out process. They have it down.
The unit itself is spacious with more than enough room to spread out, and the large bathroom is amazing. You also have a private patio area with firepit to take in the beautiful outdoors.
I would definitely suggest this property to anyone looking to stay in the area."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Louanne and Tony are so sweet and accommodating! They have a beautiful property and the Airbnb was just amazing. The bed was so comfortable! During the night, we went outside and sat on the bench swing as we drank the delicious red wine Louanne gave us and watched a gorgeous fireflies light up the yard. My boyfriend had never seen fireflies before, it was truly magical. It was so cozy and beautiful, we didn't want to leave! The Airbnb was so cozy with personal touches. The bathroom was gorgeous with a walk in shower and romantic lighting. The bedroom was beautifully decorated with the most comfortable bed! This is the perfect place if you're attending a wedding at one of the many nearby venues or even a honeymoon spot. I hope someone else in my family gets married nearby so I can stay there again. ❤️"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,First time at an Airbnb and I could not have picked a better first experience. Louanne and Tony were very helpful and their place is fantastic.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Casini’s Corner was delightful! Louanne and Tony have thought through everything. We loved sitting on the patio with a mug of coffee or glass of wine. The treadmill was even a nice touch for a quick workout before heading to our family wedding. We cannot sing the praises of this place enough! We hope to be back!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a true hidden gem. As a couple who loves to travel, who knew we would find such a lovely place so close to home? After attending a wedding in the area, Louanne and Tony allowed us to stay in their warm and comfortable rental. What a find! This was one of the cleanest, nicest and comfiest rentals that we have stayed at. Louanne and Tony were the ultimate hosts. From great communication to all the small details throughout the space, they have thought of everything. We would definitely recommend anyone stay at Casini's Corner."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,If you’re ever in the Dover/new Philly area make this place a priority to stay. Louanne and Tony went above and beyond to make it a great stay. What a great space you have a living room with kitchenette area plus huge bathroom on top of the super comfy bed not to mention very personable will definitely be back.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Quiet comfortable unit in a large beautiful home, country setting, extra nice amenities. Great coffee and snacks provided, everything you need for a relaxing stay. Spacious rooms, fireplaces, well stocked coffee station and mini kitchen. Large bathroom and nice shower. Great private patio with comfortable chairs. Good communication. Only negative for us was the access to the unit. To enter you need to walk around the garage, and across the owners patio, then up a couple stairs to their deck, then a few steps over to another couple stairs to go down to the lawn. From there a short walk down a grassy slope and over to the private patio. It was raining when we went dinner, and we found the wet grass and sloping landscape tricky to navigate. Be aware of this- we are in our 70’s and we did were able to do it with luggage, etc, but it requires caution."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Louanne & Tony are absolutely wonderful. We were in town for a wedding & they even waited up for us to make sure we made it ok. It was so clean & cozy. We wish we could have stayed longer!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great accommodations. Very comfortable. Loved the furniture and decor.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderul! We were in town for a wedding which was only 5 mins away. Louanne & Tony offer such a welcoming, cozy place to stay. Theres 2 fireplaces, plenty of extra linens, a coffee station, and much more. The weather ended up being snowy & cold so we didn’t get to enjoy the backyard view but it would be perfect!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This property is gorgeous! It was a perfect stay. We got in later than I'm sure they expected but stayed up to welcome us. Very courteous hosts!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"10/10 would recommend the space was very cozy and inviting, Louanne and Tony greeted us with smiles when we arrived and showed us right where to go even had a fireplace on the tv and nice soothing music, hospitality was an 11/10, I have nothing but kind words to say"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My daughter and I spent one night at Casini's Corner, and I am sad we were not able to stay longer. Since the area had just experienced snow and ice, Louanne and Tony had to have spent countless hours cleaning and treating surfaces so that we had a clear place to park and a pathway to the entrance. There are so many thoughtful touches such as this that we noticed immediately upon arrival. Louanne and Tony were there to greet us and to make sure we could get in, which was lovely since we arrived after the sun went down and it was dark. Stepping inside, we immediately noticed that the area was tastefully decorated, warm and inviting. There was soft lighting throughout, the TV was showing a beautiful winter scene and there were two hot chocolate bombs and farm fresh milk in the mini fridge. The hosts have a gift for decorating and making guests feel warm and welcome. We noticed an abundance of fluffy pillows and blankets, two electric fireplaces for ambiance and added warmth, an enormous bathroom with plenty of fluffy towels, extra sheets and pillows, and winter country decor adorning may surfaces. We both spent time relaxing and finishing up some reading before turning in for the night. We had to get up for an early start the next day, so the selection of coffee and tea to start the day off right was perfect.
It is worth mentioning that we felt very safe, which is important to note since we were two females traveling alone. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, even single travelers.
Louanne offered to share their dinner with us; they had made pizza and had extra. A very sweet offer, but we had just eaten before leaving home and I knew we both had reading we had to finish. I do believe the hosts would be open to connecting with guests, if you are interested and able, but also will leave you to be if you have a full schedule or perhaps just prefer to not socialize.
I hope to be back someday with my husband. I would love to spend some time there in the warmer months when we can enjoy the beautiful back yard, patio and pond. And perhaps we can get to know the hosts a bit :)"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Louanne and Tony were nice, attentive hosts. Hope more people get the chance to stay at this lovely “corner” of the neighborhood."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Casini's Corner is such a gem! Louanne and Tony are very responsive hosts and communication was great prior to and during our stay. They have taken such care in creating a warm and inviting space for their guests. My husband and I were in Ohio to visit the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton for his birthday and just enjoy a relaxing time afterwards. We found this space to be perfect for our needs. Everything is just as pictured..and more! It was beautifully decorated for Christmas at the time of our stay and there were so many cozy and thoughtful touches throughout. We enjoy being off the beaten path a bit so it was well worth the drive over from Canton for us and we found everything we needed within a 15min drive to town. Our time spent at Casini's Corner became the highlight of our trip and we feel very blessed to have been their guests!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow!! My hubby and I absolutely loved this. Beautifully decorated AIr BnB! Very cozy and clean. Loved the private entrance, privacy, quiet room, kindness of this very nice couple. We will definitely be back!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We were visiting from the Dominican Republic and Our American friends chose this AIR BNB.

We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another nice stay at Michael and Jennifer's. It is a lovely space, with extra beds if you need them. It is very clean and welcoming. It is thoughtfully set up with little snacks and coffee, games, and other items. They obviously put a lot of care into making a comfortable space. Great communication and helpful instructions.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We will definitely be booking with them again. It was a fantastic stay. Very peaceful setting but close enough to anything you would want to do. They were extremely friendly and helpful. An absolute must stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved staying here, and definitely would again! Felt right at home in the very cozy yet spacious spot. My only complaint is that we weren’t there long enough to use the basket of board games that was set out in the living room area! Highly recommended."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I was scheduled to arrive early morning while still dark out! Micheal & Jennifer left the lights on for my family. I have a 10 months old who is independent and crawls everywhere! I was so worried about getting an Airbnb because of her. But Michael & Jennifer’s place was spotless! We are a family of 5! It was so spacious! There were games, a large TV, comfortable beds, waters, coffee, dishes, and snacks (one being popcorn, my 5yos fav) literally a moms dream! My favorite thing was the openness of the space! My 5yo and 3yo sons ran around and played with everything as my 10m old daughter followed behind lol and it’s so kid friendly there was nothing for them to get hurt on or break! So I was able to sit on the couch and relax and always see them! Loved it! It’s also so Private! I never had to worry about them keeping it down! After the kids were asleep me and my husband played fact or crap that the host provided in the comfort in our own room! It felt like home! 10/10!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"very comfortable-perfect fit
super clean"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect one-night stay location. We had an extremely busy weekend planned out due to a wedding. Since the basement apartment was part of their home I felt it was important to communicate with them about our busy schedule of coming and going. There were a lot of storms the day we arrived so we was quick at entering and leaving and did not get to meet the hosts in person. Overall it was a great cozy, quiet, and peaceful place to rest for a busy weekend of events."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Jennifer offer a great value in a peaceful, quiet neighborhood location. The apartment was immaculate. With them living on site, they made themselves readily available for questions or concerns, of which I had none. They provided clear instructions for all the devices, appliances, bath and shower use, and guidelines for checkout. My favorite, the hand held light dimmer (while lounging in the recliner with my iPad!)"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If your traveling to Tuscarawas County, this is by far, the best place to stay!

Fireplace, sofa, recliner, rocker, daybed, and table complete the living area. Large enough to be an apartment!
If we are ever in the area again, this would be a must stay! Thank you for sharing this space with us!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,VERY NICE PLACE TO STAY! NO COMPLAINTS.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friend and I had a great experience. The rental was just far enough away from the main Amish country towns to be quaint and private with beautiful woods. The host was friendly (and their cute little dog as well!) The space was very clean, open, and had everything we needed. There were helpful instructions for everything that could possibly need instructions. We had water and coffee for the morning and a refrigerator to keep our delicious goods. I have already recommended Michael and Jennifer's place to family members who also visit the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Jennifer’s place was very relaxing, extremely clean, and the bed was comfortable with lots of pillows and blankets! Overall a very nice remodel probably done professionally. Nice floors and trim work throughout. Didn’t try the fireplace since it is July. Be aware there is no kitchen, but does include a medium size refrigerator and microwave. We enjoyed kurig coffee in the morning and breakfast bars that were supplied . There were instructions on how to use everything and we had no problems whatsoever. Very spacious and accommodating!
Very good value. Recommend 5 stars. Oh and Mazy their little dog is very friendly!"

They had games we played, piano, treadmill, small weights & a yoga mat for us to use. They also had food for snacks or breakfast, water in the fridge stocked & coffee, tea, hot cocoa.

experience!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying with Michael and Jennifer! The basement suite was welcoming and very pleasant, and we had a wonderful time! The fireplace keeps the entire basement suite well heated, so we were never cold, even when it was snowing outside. Included all the modern amenities you could hope for in an Air B&B.

I stayed four nights and wished my schedule would allow me to stay longer. I look forward to a return visit.

2021-09-01,4,Stayed about a week,"The place was very spacious, exceptionally clean, nice location. It was great having the grab and go breakfast items and bottled water. The television service is a smartTV with streaming capabilities so be sure to bring your passwords for the additional channels you may be desiring. The internet service was fast and adequate.
There is a small dog on the premises but it barely barked and was contained to the back yard and owners space. The entrance is through a side door in their garage and then down a flight of steps and although it isn't considered a private entrance it is very close as it is separate from the owner area. I would certainly recommend this location to family or friends."

By the time I left I almost felt like family.
I could write on and on about them if you are traveling to the Dover area and they have availability this is the place you want to stay do not look any further.
Thank you Jennifer and Michael for your warm welcome and making me feel so comfortable and secure in your home you are both wonderful people and I will absolutely contact you if and when I return to this area."

Very clean and cozy as well as a nice kitchenette that had everything from dishes, to a microwave and fridge. They provide each guest with water and snacks! If you were to forget your toiletries-to not worry! They provide some! Very friendly and you are welcomed with a lovely sign upon entrance.

My family thoroughly enjoyed the spacious main room and we slept soundly in the very comfortable beds. Coffee, tea, cocoa, cold water, popcorn, granola bars, and oatmeal were a welcome late night snack and breakfast the next morning. This was by far our best experience with any rental on Airbnb or VRBO. Michael and Jennifer were very responsive and helpful. We hope to be back again!"

2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful place to stay. It has its own private entrance, very comfortable surroundings, beautiful fireplace, and the price can’t be beat.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Michael and Jennifer were amazing hosts. They gave us our privacy and were willing to meet us when we asked.

We would definitely stay there again."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Daughter had a volleyball tournament at Eastern Ohio sports camp in Sherrodsville. We wanted to spend the night before without spending too much. This place helped us do that not much further than some hotel options. We couldn’t get the shower to work which was an inconvenience. We pulled every lever but maybe we missed something. Other than that the space was perfect and much more comfortable and spacious than any hotel. Giving my husband and a space to hang out in when my daughter went to sleep at 9pm.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Have used AirBnB six times in the last two years. Absolutely the best one yet. Michael and Jennifer did a great job finishing that basement. Felt like home. That space could host a family of four without a problem. Excellent value for a lone traveller. One half hour north from my route of travel (I 70 East), but well worth the extra drive time. All the extras were a very nice touch. You'll see what I mean when you stay there. Will definitely book again."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was a great stay, had many thoughtful touches, the space was well decorated, and very clean! Definitely exceeded our expectations!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Michael and Jennifer are stellar hosts. They are kind, efficient, thoughtful and extremely friendly and communicative. Their space exceeded our expectations. It was a large open space perfect for this Lil Bow Wow Road Trip Crew (of 3) to relax and unwind after 12 hours of driving on our road trip. I loved how everything was labeled. I love the amenity stations, the bright blue fridge. They have instructions on everything making it so easy to navigate the space. It was so cozy and warm after the guys I am traveling with froze me in the car ha ha ha. I highly recommend this space for anyone who is passing by or staying long term. It was exactly what we needed."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is better than the pictures! The lights in the room will dim and there is a remote-controlled fireplace and a nice sized smart TV mounted on the wall in front of the couch. The bed is comfortable and has just enough lighting to wake up but enough to sleep in if you need it as well. The location is ideal on the end of a street next to Woods and the hosts are very knowledgeable about the area and very friendly
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was wonderful stay, loved a large living room besides separate bedroom and bathroom. There were so many personal touches numerous snacks, bottle water, coffee, hot coco, even all different kinds of tea bags were provided. Especially a treadmill for those guests, who love to exercise and Netflix were a big plus. The place was very clean, pleasant, and inviting; it is being located in a very quiet and nice community just 3 minutes away from the Harley Davidson dealer and less than 30 minutes away from the heart of Amish country, Berlin, OH. The host provided map and information of all of the Amish town’s interesting places for us to use. The host was extremely cordial and made us feel at home. This Airbnb is a bargain for the price. We will definitely be back and staying at this Airbnb again in the future."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to say. Totally recommend it
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,nice place with great location
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,By far one of my wife and I’s favorite place we’ve ever stayed. The tranquility of the lake as well as how beautiful the property is made for an extremely relaxing trip. Will definitely recommend this place to all of our friends and family.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed the A-frame cabin. It was very clean, bed was nice and it was a cool place. Great scenery, very peaceful and quiet. Lake was beautiful, fishing was decent as well. The cabin was cozy and exactly what we expected from the pictures. We loved sitting on the deck by the fire pit during a thunderstorm.
There was a nice grill for us to cook steaks on as well.
Really nice shower and bathtub…. Beware water comes from the ceiling for the tub scared my wife ha ha.
Overall we would definitely stay again in a heartbeat. I do like the fact that leaves were on the trees which provided more privacy."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"So relaxing, beautiful, and had such a great time! I love how it’s a gated street and it is in the middle if nowhere but there are other cabins next door that made it feel even more like a little neighborhood but once you are in the cabin you don’t know there are others around. Bed was very comfy and bathroom was clean. Would 100% stay here again and I am looking forward to staying in another one of David’s cabin! Thank you!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed here for my wedding weekend and I loved it! It was so nice to step outside and overlook the lake. This was probably cleanest Airbnb I’ve stayed in. The shower and bathtub were SO NICE.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,My fiancé and I had a great night full of great views and peaceful sounds. Everything was very clean and top notch. It was well worth the stay.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place off the beaten path. Small but roomy. Amazing deck and fire pit and king size loft bed. Stairs are a little steep for someone less agile but nothing that would make us not enjoy our stay or want to go again. Amazing and well worth the price.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was our first A- frame experience and we loved it! There isn’t much to do around the cabin but we made the 40 min drive to Salt Fork State Park for a day of hiking and really enjoyed it.
While the cabin is small you don’t feel cramped thanks to a well thought out floor plan. The kitchen was well stocked and was easy to use. The bathroom was awesome with the extra deep soaker tub. We loved the cozy two seater lounge chair on the deck with the fire pit. The finishes in the cabin are really cool and definitely match the photos. It was an awesome stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this stay. Wish we would have known how close this unit was to other units (we were looking for more seclusion), but overall a great spot to get away."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of our most favorite places to stay The place is beautiful, modern, and cozy! So many amenities you never have to leave the place. Definitely will be back!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I had a wonderful peaceful weekend getaway before the birth of our second child. It was the perfect place to escape and get some peace and quiet. I feel this would be a good place to come back with the kids in the future. Going on a hike, or getting on the lake would be a perfect relaxing trip."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my wife booked The Bella for a Valentines getaway a little skeptical if the price was worth it but from the moment we arrived we immediately fell in love with the place it was exactly what was described and the location and privacy is excellent it was just so peaceful and relaxing, having the coded gate to go through to enter the property gives it the added feeling that your entering into a magical place, plenty of beauty and nice walking area the price was well worth it I would highly recommend The Bella from the porch with the cozy oversized chair and gas firepit to the bathroom with the soaking tub in with the shower and the cozy loft that is basically just a bed to the comfy living room made for a nice relaxing time we felt right at home. And Thanks to all those who put in the work to create such an amazing place for others to enjoy ."

They couldn’t stop talking about the amazing details of the place, the blankets and most comfortable bedding they have ever slept on. The tub is large enough for two, and there is nothing that was missed when building this home; everything was top of the line. They even had me ask where the bedding and pillows were from! Amazing response time and hosts. :)"

The beds are comfy (although some of our party found them a little too firm) but wonderful comforter. New appliances, comfortable and stylish recliners in the living room, and enough seating for everyone there and in the dining room.Tiffany responded quickly on one question we had about the heating system and checked in with us during the week. We will definitely stay here again on a future visit."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tiffany was an amazing host!!! The house was in beautiful condition, exactly like the photos (but better). So many thoughtfully provided items in to house too:
Bedrooms are park themed with all the local landmarks on display.
We got to watch the fireworks from the house and the kids really loved how close we were to the park and pool.
Tiffany provided plenty of towels, dishes/glasses/utensils, pillows, and throws!
There are side tables with lamps that have usb outlets everywhere you need them so you don’t have to go behind furniture to just to charge your phone.
The provided grill on the deck out back was such an awesome perk for us to celebrate my mom’s birthday.
And so much more!
Just book it. It’s amazing and will be perfect."

She provided pretty much everything you need as far as the basics go and even gifted us a box of chocolates, and a bottle of local wine. Definitely recommended and wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are staying in the area then this is the place you need to stay. Randy and Tammy were amazing hosts. We were staying here for a wedding that was hosted at a venue just 5 minutes away. This was extremely helpful considering we have two young children so it made it much easier for us to get the family to and from the wedding. Tammy was very proactive when communicating this us throughout our stay. Their place was extremely clean and we felt right at home when we came in. They even provided a pack n play for our 8 month old daughter. They left food out so that our 2.5 year old can feed their chickens, which we absolutely loved. I took advantage of our coffee bar both mornings and enjoyed sipping coffee each morning as the sun rose over the hills."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful house. We had an absolutely delightful stay. The rooms are clean and tidy, and exuding a cozy ambiance that truly made us feel at home.
Although the house is next to the road, it is very quiet and there is beautiful hill around and you can see beautiful sunset. I also like the sunlight in the morning.
Randy and Tammy are excellent hosts, displaying genuine kindness and attentiveness. They just live next door. We have a very happy chat, which added an extra layer of warmth to our experience.
One of the highlights of our stay was definitely interacting with their adorable chicks - both our 2.5 yr old daughter and we loved it! The joy of feeding the chickens became a wonderful memory our time there.
Oh, Randy and Tammy also generously share with us the delicious fresh eggs! The eggs come straight from their chickens and are absolute delicious.
All in all, our stay at Randy and Tammy's house was wonderful."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, great experience!!!!
Tammy & Randy thought of everything in providing such a beautiful property and home. We lacked nothing.
Beds were so super comfortable that everyone had the best sleep ever.
Really enjoyed the two spacious yet cozy living rooms and the front porch was lovely.
Unfortunately the weather didn't cooperate for us to use the other two porches, grill or fire pit. Next time!!
Some of our favorite moments were meeting Tammy & Randy and hearing about the history of the house, watching the chickens, seeing the horses across the road, relaxing with friends, playing games, enjoying the peace and quiet and warming ourselves by the fireplace.
Loved the country atmosphere and being so close to everything Amish country has to offer.
Our favorite sights were seeing the World's Largest Cuckoo Clock and all of the animals at the Farm at Walnut Creek.
We decided before we even left when our return trip will be.
Hope to see the best hosts in February."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boys & I enjoyed our stay @ the Zen Garden ! Paradise lake is absolutely a beautiful place to relax & kickback ! It was a great way for my boys & I reconnect with one another & God!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We chose this spot for my wife's birthday. This was the nicest AirBnB we've ever stayed in. We were excited to see the place based on the pictures but the reality far exceeded the pictures. It was impeccable and full of thoughtful design details. I can't recommend it enough. If you're looking for some peace and quiet surrounded by birdsong and a beautiful lake view - book this or any of the other A-Frames at Paradise Lake.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carol’s place was immaculate and beautiful. We were very impressed with the beauty of the house. Many amenities that you would not expect in a rental. She was very friendly and helpful with places to go and nearby restaurants. There was also a lovely welcoming gift. The animals were an added treat. I would very highly recommend this rental.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The word to describe this property is exceptional. We are two seniors staying for a weekend; we cook all of our own meals. The home was as described; it was clean with ample supplies/ equipment. The kitchen had an abundance of dishes/utensils/appliances that were in good working condition. It was QUIET. There were no sounds from farm machinery, cars, animals, or people. It was relaxing just to look out the windows at the hills and trees. The home had good safety features including handrails on stairs; walk-in shower with built-in seat, night lights, door locks. The beds and furniture were high quality and in excellent condition.
We enjoyed petting and feeding the animals with the provided treats but they could easily be ignored if one is interested in this activity.
Carol has thought of all the little things that make a home comfortable e.g. drinks in the frig, extra linens, night lights, and even flip flops for the Jacuzzi. Thank you Carol for making our stay memorable."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay was fantastic! Carol was an excellent and responsive host and made sure our stay was great. She provided snacks, a coupon to their farm stand, and food for us to feed the animals on the property. The property was beautiful and peaceful and the house looked brand new.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"As a family of 5 we have stayed in many Airbnb and rentals around Ohio, Kentucky and Michigan. This was by far the cleanest and most well laid out for our family. It’s a lovely little peaceful setting for relaxing. There is working farm out window a couple fields over but nothing that will disturb you (except for the occasional loud cow moo!) There are sheep and donkeys just behind the house to pet/ feed. There are generous yard and porch / patio areas around the house as pictured (all clean and inviting) . Although this is rural farm with great views it’s one of the first just out of town so it’s 5 minutes to convenience stores / grocery. The host is very accommodating (we had last minute possible changes) and responsive. She left special and thoughtful treats and advice for us. The well stocked coffee station was a real bonus!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, very welcoming. She thought of everything. Left us with a few snacks. Very very clean. Would definitely go back. Enjoyed her farmers market and got a pizza for dinner. The animals were very friendly and fun for the kids. We especially enjoyed the hot tub after they went to bed."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a wonderful experience staying at the Hummel Farm! Carol always goes above and beyond to check in with us before our trip and see if we need anything.

The barn animals were adorable and friendly, my kids loved feeding them! The weather was a bit cool for our weekend but we weren’t sad being in this awesome home. Lots to do close, we drove to Sugarcreek and Dover and hit up some antique stores near by. Carol was the perfect host and was very responsive. We definitely enjoyed this long weekend on the farm and are already planning to come back in warm weather."

As always, their farmers market has so many goodies and you can’t beat the quality of their meat. Their home is beyond cozy and peaceful. The hosts are so friendly, flexible, and go above and beyond. I can’t say enough great things about this gem!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carols home was amazing! Myself along with my 2 mom friends had a weekend getaway and had such a wonderful time! Clean, comfortable, and STUNNING.

If you are looking for a property in a beautiful farm setting this is it, the animals are an added bonus! The fall foilage at this property is going to be AMAZING!!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Carol was the perfect host down to leaving a personal note to the groom on the eve of his wedding. The groom and groomsmen all enjoyed the hot tub and the cookies:) Everyone said how beautiful the house was and will definitely be back in the future.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay at the farm! The house is absolutely gorgeous and so clean! We felt right at home. We came to the area for a wedding, there was a storm that came through and Carol messaged us and made sure we were all ok. We felt cared for and looked after! The power was out in the area but we would have never known because of the whole house generator. We are looking forward to visiting again to take in the amazing views and seeing the cute animals on the farm! We can’t wait to visit the market again too! I highly recommend a staying at Hummel Valley Farm! Thank you Carol for being a wonderful host!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family really enjoyed our stay and the beautiful farm location. Would love to return some day.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay here! There are plenty of cow, goats, donkeys, chickens and more! There is even a super friendly barn cat that we named Thunder Bolt (a.k.a. Boltz for short) who adopted us and greeted us each morning!
Carol is a wonderful host who went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and welcome. She gave us a tour of the farm and told us all about the history of the area.
It is a working farm, but everyone gave us privacy. The hot tub was a wonderful evening ritual we had during our stay. And the goats and donkeys came out each night to join (watch) us!
Definitely worth the trip!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"I cannot say enough great things about Carol’s home! First off, this home is newly renovated and absolutely STUNNING. Second, it is SO serene and peaceful on the property. We spent a lot of time just relaxing outside. The goats and donkeys are SO SO sweet and friendly. We loved feeding them! We also had a visiting barn kitty who was the most precious, sweet cat ever! We even got to see some farm work with the cows our last day! The market they own is a 5 minute walk down the driveway and we got our dinner supplies for both nights we stayed. Cannot say enough good things about the produce and meat! We met the owners and they were so so friendly and informative. We felt right at home and never wanted to leave! Lastly, although the hot tub was not working, we had a fire pit so we still got to enjoy the outdoors. Stores/restaurants are super close. You had EVERYTHING you could need in the kitchen. Can’t wait to come back here and enjoy some more time away!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"After a wind loss at our primary residence Jim & Carol were the first to reach out & tell me about their Airbnb. I am forever grateful for that phone call & our family could not have been happier with this property! The home, location & being surrounded by farm land took me back to my childhood every single day for the past 3 1/2 months! This home gave us the true farmhouse experience & the farm animals were so fun to watch! We had the pleasure of being there the day the baby donkey was born & have watched it grow!!! Carrots were on my grocery list every week & we really enjoyed feeding the animals! Carol is a fabulous host! I would recommend this property to anyone wanting that country scenery, the farmhouse feel & georgeous sunsets! It's absolutley beautiful!!"

Kitchen came stocked with all the amenities we would need (hand mixer was broken and didn’t turn on but that’s okay) and the WiFi was speedy.
Hot tub was clean and bathrooms were spotless.
The upstairs bathroom does not have a shower so the downstairs bathroom had to be shared.

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"I would stay here again. We had a couples weekend (3 couples). We were able to go out and have adventures in Amish country and come back to the cabin in the evening and enjoy all the amazing amenities and views! Super close to 2 of our favorite wineries (8 min drive). There was an oscillating fan on premise, which sounds like a silly thing to mention, but it was a nice thing to have on site. The garage was a great feature, too. Having the garage doors open while being able to have a tv, couch, ping pong, etc. was really enjoyable. You were able to have indoor amenities while enjoying the outdoors at the same time. 3 Smart TVs there were easy to sign into your favorite streaming apps. Wifi was top-notch. Everything was super clean, smelled nice, decorated tastefully, and was very organized. Oh, and there is an ice maker and water on the fridge, another bonus."

The house and surroundings were beautiful and there was plenty of space for all of us. We really enjoyed having the full kitchen as well as the outdoor areas. The game room was also a huge bonus. My 8 year old also loved the memory foam bean bag upstairs. Overall almost perfect vacation spot for our family.

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"I booked this place for myself and 4 of my friends for my best friends bachelorette party. She loves amish country so we were looking somewhere close. I honestly don’t think we could’ve chosen a better place to stay, everything about the house was laid out perfectly, the beds were super comfy, the hot tub was awesome, and everything about the vibes of the house was super cozy. Def would stay again just for fun some other weekend. Lindsay was super attentive and quick to respond when we had questions! If I had one singular complaint it would just be that the shower was very slippery 😂 other than that, it was such an awesome stay with a gorgeous view."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,We booked the air bnb for the bridesmaids in my daughters wedding. It was the perfect place! Beautiful setting and they all enjoyed the hot tub. It was very clean. The game room was fun. I would definitely book again. One of the girls left her glasses and Lindsey was quick to reach out and let me know. She also allowed us an early check in which was super helpful.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was my first time ever using Airbnb and Lindsey was so helpful and clear when I had questions. And the actual property was stunning. It absolutely down poured rain my entire stay here but there were so many fun things to do inside as well!
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home with awesome features like the hot tub, ping pong table, and more. Ideal for a getaway or a bachelor/bachelorette party. There is a farm across the street and the animals start making noises around 6:30am. There was also large a bird feeder about 15 feet from the hot tub. Both nights around 9:30pm 8-10 raccoons would show up to eat the seed. If that issue is corrected, the outside space would be even better."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Very clean, and very friendly. The hot tub was great check in couldn’t have been easier. Overall great experience."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,location was great. the cabin was fabulous! we definitely enjoyed the hot tub. will absolutely be back!

Quick 10 minute drive to anything you need while still being peaceful and secluded. It was very clean, well stocked with utensils, linens, anything you could need. There was even wood provided for the fire pit. Lovely for a weekend trip, would definitely stay again"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is beautiful!! Gorgeous sunrises and stellar views from the hot tub or the cozy living room with fireplace. I am looking for excuses to come stay here again!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed our time there. Very quite neighborhood and wanted something in the country away from traffic and noise. Very easy to find. Hot tub was great! Clean place and very good wallhouse coffee was there which I appreciated. Lindsey was very communicating, and beds and sofas were comfy. Only one thing , and this can be expected with a high ceiling like a cabin, we had the heat on and upstairs was comfortable but then each morning it was a bit chilly downstairs. Other than that no issues at all!"

The garage is converted into a giant game room which is also pretty cool; we spent a good bit of time playing ping pong and darts."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely awesome stay! It was exactly what we needed as a family! We were so close to Amish/Swiss country with Berlin/Walnut Creek/Sugarcreek in close driving distance so the shopping and enjoyment was great which we planned on but we were just as close to the public with New Philadelphia/Dover area for the essentials for shopping like Walmart and Giant Eagle. It was a great combination of being secluded yet still being everywhere distance wise where we wanted to be. Our host Lindsay was so responsive to all our are questions as it was the first time we had visited this area. She gave us great recommendations on which places to eat/shop at in all the areas close by and provided simple, detailed instructions on how to access/maintain the property. The kids loved the game room with the ping pong and foosball tables. The biggest treat was seeing my city kids and wife’s reactions watching the deer crossing the property from the hot tub. They were so close to us and didn’t mind!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is in a beautiful location. Everything we needed was furnished and it was immaculate. And I'm picky! Everything looks new! The landscape was pretty and provided outdoor dining space, hot tub, grill and a great porch to sit on and enjoy the view. The kitchen has everything you can think of! Game room was so convenient. So spacious and well appointed. It is only a few miles from town but felt like we were miles away! It was so quiet and serene. We enjoyed watching the wild turkeys stroll around in the evening. Lindsay was wonderful to deal with and so responsive to any questions. I definitely recommend! You will not be disappointed!"

2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Lindsay was great to communicate with. She had gray place! We got enjoy the living room with the fireplace. The game room was a nice touch and gave us something to do at night. Her location was secluded enough that we felt like no one was around. It’s a bummer that it rained so we couldn’t enjoy s’mores on the fire pit. The hot was nice. She did inform us ahead of time that there was a problem with it.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really beautiful property…great amenities! A wonderful place for a family getaway. We spent a long weekend there with my husband, girls, and parents. We all really enjoyed the game room (stayed up way late playing ping pong and darts!) and the hot tub. The layout of the house was ideal for our situation. The upstairs opens up to a loft that is set up as a little play area, there are too connected bedrooms and half bath up there. It worked well for my husband and girls to have the upstairs area and my parents stayed in the downstairs bedroom. The kitchen is stocked well with all you need to make home cooked meals. The house is very close to Sugarcreek, and a little farther from the heart of Amish country, but only 20 or so minutes. If we go back with my parents, we’d definitely stay there again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We all had an excellent time. It’s a new and very well maintained property. The beds were super comfortable. The house as a whole is made with quality materials and the rooms are quiet. There’s a garage with ping pong tables, dartboard, and fooseball. We had a baby and it was really kid friendly with toys and other kid items. The hot tub was so relaxing. The home is within minutes of anything you need or would like to do. We took a walk out the lane and never met a car. We made smores on the fire pit. We just really had a relaxing time in Lindsay's home.
We loved it and would absolutely come again.

Our 5 children and their better halves along with 11 of our grandkids spent the weekend and it was amazing. Plenty of space, well stocked kitchen, and comfortable sleeping accommodations for all. We use Airbnb numerous times and this was one of the best supplied homes we have stayed in. Beautiful Christmas decorations were an added bonus. Would highly recommend."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our entire family had a quick trip to relax and unwind. The house was perfect in that we didn't have to leave to do anything if we didn't want to. Even though you are just outside of town, it feels like you are miles away- when we realized we were missing a few grocery items, we left and were back in no time. Perfect retreat for our family. Hope we have to opportunity to come back in the future."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Spent a long weekend with a group of 12 and loved the house! There were plenty of bedrooms and spaces to be so we weren't on top of each other. We really enjoyed the pool and hot tub! The house was clean and fully stocked with whatever you would need. There wasn't much to do in the surrounding area but we knew that beforehand. Definitely check out the local breweries and wineries! We would stay again 🙂
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was beautiful. 13 people stayed in this house and we never once were over crowded. There was lots of things to do at the house so the kids were never bored. 10/10 experience!

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We rented this space for a weekend getaway and could not have been more pleased! The house, pool, and land were even more beautiful in person than online. The space was amazing for keeping everyone entertained and for breaking off into smaller groups to play games, use the hot tub, or watch a movie. 10/10 would recommend and would absolutely book again in the future!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing!!! Our party of 10 had a great stay. Plenty of activities here and lots of space to do them.

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our family had the best time together this weekend. Liberty Lodge is very nice.
We would visit again. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the most well stocked vacation home we’ve ever been to! There was plenty of bedding, blankets, kitchen supplies and stuff to do to keep our clan of 6 adults and 6 kids aged 4-14 happily occupied. The pool and fire pit and hot tub were wonderful for the days it wasn’t raining and there was still plenty to do inside when it was raining. It’s in a pretty rural area so a bit of a drive to buy groceries but we came well prepared and used the grill and well stocked kitchen for our stay. The house is definitely on a hill so no great opportunities for evening strolls but it was great for keeping the kids close and safe even after dark. It was a fantastic place for our family reunion and plenty of space to spread out and even plenty of quiet nooks away from the chaos for those that needed some downtime. While there is a first floor bathroom and full bath, the entrances into the house all have a couple steps so it’s not fully accessible."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We chose this location for our yearly vacation with our kids and grandkids and, boy, it didn’t disappoint. We loved the total rural setting while being close to grocery stores, restaurants, etc. The house is HUGE! So much so that for the first two days we kept getting lost. The backyard was AWESOME and afforded everyone the chance to be outside without always being on top of one another. We took a few quick side trips to The Wilds, the Football Hall of Fame, and discovered the Warther Museum in Dover and its hand carved trains, and we also enjoyed walking on some of the local trails. I would definitely recommend this place if you love the comforts of home and nature at its best."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hello Jonna and Lori,
Thanks for allowing our family to stay in your beautiful home. We have 13 people in our family from ages 64 to 3 years old. Your home accommodated us all very easily. It is exactly as seen in the pictures. We all had a blast. We will carry good memories from this trip and look forward to come back and stay again.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect for our family Birthday celebration!!
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"We used the house to view a live women’s conference online. The hosts were so responsive making sure we had good internet and ability to hook up the lap tops to the TVs.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A fabulous home, well furnished and equipped, for our group...including two young children! My family especially enjoyed the lovely pool, and area for outdoor dining! Liberty Lodge was very clean, wonderfully comfortable! We would enjoy returning! Highly recommended!"

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Lori’s place is wonderful! There was plenty of space for our large group to hang out comfortably and plenty of activities to keep everyone entertained. I would recommend Lori’s house to anyone traveling in the area!

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Highly recommend this place! There’s so much room, so many sleeping arrangements, and so many things to do. The pictures don’t do this place justice. The backyard is amazing. House had everything we needed and more!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We chose this idyllic countryside spot as a place for our family to getaway, relax, enjoy the end of summer weather and simply be together. We spent hours in the beautiful, huge swimming pool and sat by the firepit making s’mores and talking into the evening. Everyone loved the huge game room, and my granddaughters have become avid pool, ping-pong and foozball fans. Lori and Jonna were extremely attentive and communicative. We would recommend Liberty Hill Lodge to anyone looking for a private family or group getaway. You won’t be disappointed."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This rental was everything it was advertised to be. Pool was fantastic, as was hot tub. Grandchildren had a wonderful time, and were completely exhausted each night. Scenery was beautiful, as we saw deer, fox numerous times. would absolutely stay again. Thanks"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We can't say enough good about this place. It was perfect for our 7 adults and 3 kids, ages 2, 4 and 7. Spacious, clean, every home-like amenity you would need. Comfortable beds and very quiet, too! The pool was perfect and enjoyed by all of us. Would give more stars if I could."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was amazing. We had a party of 11 ranging in age from 9-64 and there was something for everyone. The kids loved the pool, hot tub, game room and basketball court. They played numerous games of corn hole and ping pong. The adults enjoyed the pool and had bonfires 🔥 every night. There was plenty of room so no one ever felt like they were on top of each other. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful get away. The owners were great and even though there was a slight prob with the cooling system they made sure it was all good to go and communicated it so we knew was going on."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful home/ property. It exceeded our expectations! Will be coming back again.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family rented Lori’s home for four nights and I wish we had stayed longer! The house was very clean, comfortable and well-appointed. The heated pool was fantastic and we spent as much time as possible in it. The hot tub was a nice way to relax at the end of the day, as was the rec room. The place is huge with plenty of bedrooms as well as seating nooks so people could find a quiet corner to relax in if they wanted. We had everything we needed in the kitchen to prepare meals. We enjoyed sitting peacefully outside and listening to birds, seeing butterflies & fireflies and making s’mores by the fire. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect size for our family get together. The kids loved the pool and hot tub. Lots of room for the kids to run around and play.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying at Lori's place. Our family really enjoyed it. It was very clean and comfortable.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Can’t say enough great things about the place! Everything was just so easy!! The house is beautiful but the outdoor space is a real standout. Lori was very responsive and just so nice!
We had a power outage for a few hours but we almost didn’t notice because the generator kicked on - a worry free weekend to just enjoy the company of friends!! Highly recommend & we hope to return soon!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful. House is very large with lots of separate space. The outdoor space alone is worth the price. Great hosts and communication. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful, clean house with so many stocked ""extras"". It comfortably housed our four-family family with occupants ranging from age 1 to age 74. It feels like a relaxing, ""middle-of-nowhere"" getaway while being within 10 minutes of major grocery stores. It is extremely kid friendly with toys, books, baby gates, booster seats, etc. and extremely adult friendly with a beautiful pool and hot tub, nice showers, and plenty of space to hide and read a book. All communication from the host was extremely clear and helpful and questions were answered promptly. We would definitely recommend this property to others and plan to return for family getaways in the future."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Liberty Hill exceeded our expectations in every way. The home was immaculately clean and had every amenity that we could have imagined. We were there during a horrible storm that knocked the power out throughout several counties and a generator turned on and one would have never known that the power was even off, other than hearing the sound. We enjoyed the pool the most during 90° plus weather. There are lots of steps just in case someone in your party has trouble walking. This was not an issue for us. There are so many fun activities to keep everyone entertained, lovely country views, and plenty of privacy. The hosts were absolutely wonderful and made certain that everything was up to par. I highly recommend Liberty Hill!"

2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Our second annual girls trip to this house was another winner! We wouldn’t consider any other place to stay in this area. Perfect amount of space for a large group. Perfect outdoor area with pergola seating, hot tub, fire pit, and heated pool. Perfect host. Can’t wait until next year!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,The pictures do not come close to showing the beauty of this place. We stayed here for a girls' trip and had ages 33 - 73... there was something for everyone.

I can't say enough good things about this entire Airbnb Home experience!

The communication was easy and Lori was very responsive. I would totally recommend."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lori was a wonderful host; very responsive to communication both before and during our stay. Liberty Hill Lodge was exactly as shown in the pictures. The instructions for check-in, stay, and check-out were detailed and very helpful. The house was very clean and well stocked. We could not have asked for a better place to enjoy our family get together. Overall a lovely place and great value for money that we would recommend to anyone."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Pictures do not do this place justice!! Plenty of room and every accommodation was thought of. Our grandchildren were so excited to see the toys!

Flooded with sunlight and a room fit for every need, Liberty Hill will quickly become your happy place for family, friends, and gatherings large and small. Lori has thought of every last detail, creating not only the most user-friendly space but leaving you needing nothing more. Liberty Hill will be our new go-to spot when visiting friends and family in the area, with amenities perfect for all seasons."
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"Great huge house, clean, easy communication. Great for large group, no complaints!"
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"We booked Liberty Hill Lodge for my 22nd Birthday getaway. There were 11 of us and the space accommodated our sleeping needs perfectly! The house itself far surpassed our expectations, when we first arrived it was almost as if we were going through a maze. We loved that so much stuff was provided from any kitchen essential to shampoo and conditioner, it made our lives so much easier. The hot tub was the hit of the weekend by far. It would reach down to 35 degrees at night and the hot tub was the best place to hangout. It was also very easy to maintain and prepare (with the great instructions from the hosts) The game room was a sight to see and we loved having our own pool table. The dining room table was perfect for our big group (we cooked two huge meals) and the house was big enough to where we could all be together or have our own personal space. I stayed in the master bedroom and it was the most incredible experience. When I tell you every single person came to my room to shower I am not exaggerating! The views from the tall windows were stunning and the sky at night was something out of a movie. The driveway was a bit steep but nothing unmanageable. The boys loved the basketball court in the driveway. The location gave us quick access to so many things, grocery stores, gas, activities etc. The communication with the host was insanely quick and so helpful. If there was one thing to complain about it would be that our stay wasn’t long enough! Throughout the whole weekend we kept saying that we can’t wait to come back. Giving this place 5 stars would be an understatement. Liberty Hill is a must stay and our group plans to make several trips to come back again!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"The pictures don’t do this home and the surrounding property justice! Everything was gorgeous, the perfect place for a large group to get together for the weekend for any event."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Property is gorgeous rural setting, two very pretty sitting areas with tons of natural light. House is 8-9 minutes from the Bella Amour on Enchanted Acres and in route to the hotels so shuttle service could pick up or drop off there if needed."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pictures didn't do this house justice! It was better than advertised and we had a blast. Pool was very nice, evenin early October. There are many areas to sit and relax or entertain a group of people. My kids played hide and seek and had a hard time finding everyone because of how many rooms there were! There was so much room to spread out, relax and enjoy the amazing views of the house. Decorations were great, with rooms having different travel themes. We loved every minute and will be back."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Be ready to be pampered from the size of the house and bedrooms to the outside great fire pit super hot tub unfortunately did not have time for the pool next time for sure

Very quiet and intimate location if you want to just get out of the city for a while and enjoy the countryside."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Liberty Hill lodge is a beautiful place to stay. I was celebrating with my siblings and mother. I am cancer free for one year. They helped take care of me and I wanted to treat them with a few days of rest and relaxation! We picked the perfect place. They had flowers waiting for me with a sweet note.
The kitchen is well-equipped for cooking, however we ate out every night at local restaurants. They’re very close.
We spent most of our time in the comfy bonus room. Played games and just vegged out.
We found out the first night that the hot tub power jets were not working….however….they jumped right on it and it was fixed next day. The communication was great!!!
It is a great place for family get togethers. Comfortable, clean and roomy.
I highly recommend Lori and Liberty Hill."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,A beautiful house that was super clean with awesome accommodations! Highly recommend 😊
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed with a group of 7 business people. There was plenty of room and the space was clean and well kept. If you had a small business gathering or need a large space for a family gathering, I would recommend it."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"Great place for a girls weekend! We enjoyed time outside the whole weekend. We loved the pool, the hot tub, the patio and the fire pit. There was enough room for all of us to spread out. Far enough out of town to be peaceful, but close enough to town if you needed anything. We enjoyed going to Hoodletown brewery and Huffy's for lunch and a drink, but we spent most of our time by the pool and enjoyed every inch of the outdoor space! Great hosts!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lori's place is so beautiful and clean we had an amazing time!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We just got done enjoying our second trip to Liberty hill lodge and it didn’t disappoint! We spent each day out by the pool enjoying ourselves and the beautiful view. During the evening we sat by the fire and ate too many s’mores. I have children that range in age from 1-15 yrs old and everyone had activities to enjoy while we’re there. Lori has everything you could want or need already there for you, from games and toys too cooking supplies. We only needed to pack our clothes and bring food with us. We always all look forward to going back again and you will too!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a great place to stay. We had 4 families there and it still felt very spacious. The outdoor pool/hot tub with the rolling hills in the background is very relaxing. The house has everything you need and very clean. I highly recommend Lori’s house. We had a blast!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This is an excellent property for a larger group. The outdoor area and the pool are excellent. The property is close to town, but is situated such that there is quite a lot of privacy. The hosts are very responsive and were easy to work with."

The kitchen had all the cooking supplies we needed. Highly recommend!!!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my first stay at an Airbnb and Lori made it so easy! She was very easy to communicate with. The house was stocked with anything/everything you would need, so we really just brought our food and clothes. She had plenty of games and toys for the kids. But most of our time was spent outside enjoying her beautiful pool, hot tub and views. We are happy to say we already have our next trip booked!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend! We stayed with 3 children under the age of 4 and found the crib, blackout curtains and closet full of toys to be so helpful. The house and the yard is a complete dream! The home was clean as can be, stocked full of everything with needed and the owners were very helpful!"
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"Theplace is remote and is veryfar from what would be consider “normal” civilization however, the peace and comfortably of the house made it worth it."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely wonderful! Can’t say enough good things about this house and property. Five stars all the way!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Leaving my rating... evidently review will not move forward without a private message. You and I have communicated back and forward, so you are aware that my family was happy with our stay. One of my sons is a policeman and Air Force Reservist, he noted that your overall organization and very detailed handbook demonstrate your military background. Much appreciated... Thanks for your service!!!"

2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Have already recommended this place to so many people! It’s the perfect getaway for your family. The heated pool was amazing! We had normal Ohio cold April weather and it was still amazing! The hot tub was a great bonus. The Rec room provided tons of fun for the kids. And the 3 car garage provided a great place for the kids to skate, ride bikes, and hangout when it was raining. TONS of space to spread out. We never felt like we were on top of one another. And the crib and bed rail were added bonuses that really helped our young children feel at home. We hope to come back again in the future as this house was perfect for us!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay, this was the perfect place with everything we needed for our family and parents to enjoy their weekend, all of the kids enjoyed a completely unplugged weekend without once hearing the words I’m bored, the older kids, (11,12,12 and 5) loved the pool and foosball table, and with the use of the baby gates my twins (1.5)loved the Rec room and the toys in it. You have an absolutely beautiful home and property and we will definitely be booking another stay in the future, it’s the perfect place for a “staycation”. The hot tub is amazing and the pool was heated warm enough to enjoy on a 55 degree April day. Best of all is the home is big enough to space out and not feel crowded even with 6 children and 6 adults"
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful views from every window and so relaxing in every area of the home.
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,It is a great place to stay and it is very much spacious for a at least 15 + people. Very much clean and well equipped. I really loved the hot tub and pool area.

2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great ... the shower is stressful but once you figure it out it’s not that bad.., let’s just hope you figure out how to use it before 2 days later like me lol"
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"Great location. It's outside the city, so it's pretty private, but it's close enough that you can easily go get groceries. Enough beds for fourteen people. Plenty of towels for both showering and hot tub use. Tables inside and outsdie for playing games. Plenty of outdoor space to play frisbee, basketball, and cornhole.

The house is secluded, surrounded by fields and trees, has amazing views.

2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"We were two families meeting in the middle for some much needed fellowship and Lori's place was perfect. The house is large and well set up. It was very clean withou smelling like chemicals. She was excellent in communicating with us. We did go on a couple hikes but I can't really speak to other activities since we kept to ourselves but it was perfect for that. There was plenty of space for 2 adults to work in different spaces, 2 children to do remote schooling and still not be bother by others playing. Amazing!"

2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Liberty Hill Lodge served as the perfect retreat for my family while we were in town for a wedding weekend. Owners, Lori and Jonna are very friendly and extremely prompt with response to any questions. Their beautiful home on the hill is spacious, pristine, a great layout, and beautifully decorated. Our family members were thrilled with the accommodations! Beyond the four comfortable bedrooms (with amazing views) are the additional living spaces designed with everyone in mind; spacious living rooms, sunroom, even an upper rec room complete with foosball, pool table and large screen tv. The outdoor space is equally amazing with patio, grill and fire pit that we all enjoyed. (I can only imagine how awesome it becomes in the warmer months when the in-ground pool is unveiled!) Highly recommend Liberty Hill Lodge for the perfect group getaway. We had a wonderful stay, hope to visit again!!"
