Don‚Äôt plan to do any complicated food preparation ‚Äî it‚Äôs a very limited set up. Bed is up against the wall, which may be inconvenient for anyone with limited mobility. Overall, very glad we stayed there."

We really loved the front deck and spent a lot of time there listening to the birds. Quincy gave very detailed instructions to find the place, which we definitely needed.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Quincy's space is charming and centrally located - it's one block from a river trail, and convenient to a grocery store and other shops. It's got cooking equipment and a really special, enclosed porch. Quincy was really helpful and responsive for us as well."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The lication was tricky, but basically its behind grocery outlet. I wish that was more clear without the instructions. Great porch. The location Was near A cool baseball field, community garden and aponsored river restoration walking path. The living room bed is HarD as a rock, but the bedroom bed is better. How to use the cooktop- not clear and no instructions. I did appreciate the stay, but for the price there is a bit of spiffing up. Its very quirky and squeaky floored, but I did like the rustic peacefulness and privacy. I think its a good fit for my needs. Also my dog liked it."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was very clean and that is very important to me. Quincy was very responsive and flexible. The queen bed was so comfortable and had great pillows and bedding. A small smart tv would have been nice because I am very low tech and didn't attempt to run the hdmi projector. The bbq area on the front porch is a comfortable place for meals and the grill is a very nice one. Thanks to Quincy for a great place to stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is great! Definitely the best place to stay in Susanville. The hosts are very kind and have excellent communication. Highly recommended! We‚Äôll be back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome work that they have put into the place. Excellent craftmanship and attention to detail. Definitely a little gem in Susansville. We were sad we could not check out there workshop! Will try to next time we are in the area.
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host is very responsive, though he did point out my issues were things anyone else had mentioned. Like smelling cooking ealry in the morning.
I can only speak from my personal opinion, the flat is exceptionally clean. The decor is pleasant. I personally did not find it comfortable. It was too dark for me. The futon was the only place to sit which comfy at all, with the exception of table which had also two uncomfortable chairs. I found myself not wanting to be there after work. Quincy did try to meet my personal needs, though I was felt a bit awkward by his responses. I asked if there were other pillows and a lightweight blanket( middle of the summer so the heavy comforter was way too hot for me) Anyway‚Ä¶. This is just personal taste. There was nothing ‚Äúbad‚Äù about this place, just not my personal cup of tea."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyed our stay in this charming, art-filled home, a quiet and peaceful space with urban amenities close by. A 3-minute walk took us to Bing‚Äôs, a Japanese restaurant, where we had a great dinner of yakisoba noodles and tonkatsu ramen. They also offer good sushi. This and other nearby restaurants, services, parks and sightseeing opportunities are listed on a white board in the house; very helpful! After dinner, we enjoyed a quiet evening on the front porch, then got an excellent night‚Äôs sleep. Looking forward to a return visit!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We are so happy for the introduction to Susanville and the comfy place that felt like home on our road trip from Seattle to LA. We did a quick one night stop, and the space was private, had all the extras like nice soaps and lotions, and welcoming tips on things to do. We‚Äôd happily come back and spend more time. Thanks for sharing your home!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Love the space and you can see the passion the owners have for the area! We arrived late at night and had a little trouble finding the space since it was dark. The little details and decor in the space are just beautiful. The floor is REAL wood and that comes with squeaks, so if you have light sleepers with you keep that in mind before you traipse off to the bathroom around midnight. üòÇ"

Quincy was really responsive in all communication. The place was comfortable in winter (heater, warm blankets) even without the woodstove on. There is no washer/dryer or full kitchen, but we had everything we needed to make easy meals and coffee.
The local art/pottery in the place was fun! Our kiddos liked the benches and porch for watching quail and deer. We'd love to stay again when we are in town!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a great place! Everything was clean and well-appointed and comfortable. The mattress and pillows were super fancy, maybe memory foam? Susanville is small and dining options are limited, so plan carefully since this in-law unit doesn‚Äôt have a kitchen. We came to town for one night to attend the symphony, so this wasn‚Äôt an issue for us. We will definitely be back."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great alternative to the local hotels. Cozy space, great aesthetic, thoughtful touches throughout, and friendly communication."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was in Susanville for a couple of days on business and decided to go Airbnb rather than a local hotel. Was not disappointed.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay. Quincy was incredibly inviting and helpful. His enthusiasm for Susanville is awesome.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great little place to stay. Walking distance to shopping and centrally located to visit any location in the Susanville area.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Quincy and Cortney's place for three very cold nights in February. Quincy kept us supplied with plenty of firewood and was extremely helpful in connecting us to other people and places of note in Susanville. The apartment was cozy with a great shower and very comfortable bed. Would definitely recommend staying here if you're planning on coming to Susanville!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great space and very clean. We felt very welcome and enjoyed our stay!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Quincy made us feel very welcome and comfortable soon after booking. After driving 10 hours it was so nice to have such a great space to spend the night.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a treat! This place was well beyond expectations. The property was beautiful and serene, with plenty for the kids to explore. The home is large and had more than enough room for our family of four. We really appreciated the games (both arcade and board!). The kitchen was well-appointed, better stocked than any AirBNB we've stayed in. The bug spray and sunscreen were thoughtful touches as well! We hope to return for future visits."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was great the power went out a couple of times but the generator started and comfort was back. Was not used to hearing water roar just outside the house. This was due to heavy rains prior to our stay. I‚Äôm sure that had it been later in the year the creek would have been a calming sound. The house itself was very nice and comfortable
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The house worked well for our family.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second stay here. This is a lovely and peaceful home. We look forward to renting this Airbnb again soon.

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is absolutely stunning. We arrived to a Winter wonderland by way of a nice, long driveway away from the road.
The driveway is one property over from where our GPS tried us to pull over, but the thorough description that the hosts provided made it easy to find regardless.
The cabin is cozy and has bedrooms with beautiful views. The corner bedroom was a special treat, with stunning views of the pond. It's a perfect getaway kind of place. The peaceful property and comfortable cabin just makes you wanna stay for a while. Unfortunately we only had one night.
Thanks to overnight snow, we had a hard time getting out of the driveway the next morning. I texted John and he had it plowed within an hour.
I would give 6 out of 5 stars if I could and hope to return here one day, just to relax rather than just coming through."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice place My family really enjoyed our stay and want to comeback in the near future
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a nice home surrounded by lots of trees and was completely peaceful.

The house was as mentioned in the description and pictures. It was well maintained and clean. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils and spices/oil. They had printed the recommended restaurants and places to visit in the house. The place was surrounded by trees, streams, etc giving the extra nature feel. I would recommend this place for anyone who want to visit lasse national park, Burney falls, etc. Thanks, Jon and Lisa for hosting us."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location that's perfect for a quiet weekend getaway
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our whole family absolutely loved this place! So peaceful, tucked back in the trees. The worst part was that we didn‚Äôt have the time to stay longer! None of us wanted to leave. The house is adorable. We especially loved the fire pit out back!! We would love to stay there again some day."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Cottage was absolutely beautiful inside and out, better than the pictures and description. The kitchen was loaded with anything you need to cook/bake and even had some extras in the pantry. The decor was perfect for the Cottage and the outdoor areas were incredibly relaxing.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jon and Lisa‚Äôs cabin in the woods is an incredible getaway. Super clean, beautifully decorated (including work by a local photographer!) playful kids space.

We will be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place . Extremely quiet and peaceful . Everything was 5 star . Comfortable beds great amenities ‚Ä¶
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a very enjoyable time at this gorgeous property in Susanville. The home was very clean and well equipped with strong wifi for those who worked during our stay. The property itself had trails, a hammock, fire pit with access to a shed full of firewood, a mini obstacle course, old school arcade games, outdoor games, board games and books. We experienced a very rainy day, and all of the things we could do on site made for a fun experience and a little digital detox.
Meal time was also made easy with a fully functional kitchen and plenty of cookware, tableware and flatware for a large group. Also, the hosts were very easy to communicate with and highly responsive."

2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The grounds are lovely. Lots of room to roam. The house itself is fine. Bedrooms and living spaces comfortable and functional. Kitchen could use some sprucing up as well as more cleaning supplies. Overall feels like a high turnover, not especially loved place: calibrate your expectations accordingly."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful stay we had at The Cottage! Our family of 7 was blown away with how quaint, clean, and comfortable this place was. Our boys enjoyed the arcade games available, while we enjoyed sipping a glass of wine and taking in the beautiful scenery outside. We brought our own food to have a homemade dinner and breakfast for Easter. The beds were very comfortable! One of our boys stated that this was the best night's sleep he has ever had. Truly a home away from home feel! Our stay was way too short this trip, but we hope to come back again soon."

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is magical! Seriously if I'm ever in the area this is where I will stay. the entire property is gorgeous with plenty of gathering places.

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This cottage was my childhood home, and it was such a wonderful experience showing my adult children where I grew up. Great memories!

We loved it! We‚Äôll be back."

Quite simply an amazing location, and a very clean and charming cabin. If I could give 6 stars, I would. Thanks again!!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We prefer to use Airbnb because we know that the hospitality of a hotel could never compare to some of the host here on Airbnb. Jon & Lisa not only fully embody that but, they go above and beyond for their guest. We couldn't have asked for more compassionate and kind host. We loved our stay; their home is real neat and cozy! It was a short trip but, just what we needed."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"excellent place. the location feels remote even though it is near town and there are neighbors. It was quiet, and just lovely. Highly recommend"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don't hesitate to book if you are looking at this cabin retreat! We absolutely loved sitting on the deck overlooking the pond while watching the butterflies and deer. Yes, there are mosquitos - but nothing that the owner provided citronella candles could handle. Our Goldendoodle especially loved watching the squirrels. The home provides multiple seating areas and a well-stocked kitchen. The air conditioning was a definite plus considering the unusual heat wave of over 100. We were pleasantly surprised by the s‚Äômores supplies. It is a short drive into town. We will definitely stay here again!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is wonderful and nicely combines a modern feel with a cozy cabin in the woods. While the house is lovely, the best part is the property. Nestled in the woods, on a creek with a pond a small streams, we enjoyed sitting on the swings by the fire pit, in the hammock by the creek and in our chairs in the creek. It was a lovely respite from the 100 degree plus heat at home. The kids loved the zip line. The host was very responsive to a small wifi issue but once fixed the internet was amazingly fast for such a mountainous location. Work from home? No! work from the cottage!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved the privacy and space to spread out. A beautiful area for walks to the creek. Lovely outdoor areas to drink your wine or coffee üç∑‚òï.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This little cottage in the woods was so perfect after a long drive from Cali. No noise pollution except wind and stream, which was perfect!

We enjoyed everything about this place and wished we could have stayed longer."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful cabin with loads of space both inside and out. Very clean and accurately described, it was the perfect place to gather multiple generations of family to enjoy time under one roof.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Talk about a true gem of a property! If you are seeking a serene escape this property will satisfy and then some! We were sitting around the fire pit and a few deer were about 30 feet away by the pond. The sound of the babbling creek was amazing. Doing dishes could never be more enjoyable with an open window watching and hear the water flow. Driving through Susanville we were shocked that this place existed. The home was comfortable and these hosts truly understand hospitality providing high quality coffee among many other things. Highly recommended! A++++++++
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the NICEST AirBnB I've stayed at and I use the service all the time.
If you can stay here, don't miss it"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place is worth for the money we pay. I would recommend it for people who would like to do a weekend gateway
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Fantastic house on a serene property. There‚Äôs a pond, a cute little creek that runs along the side of the house, as well as another, larger creek on the other side that you can hear from the house. It‚Äôs quite peaceful."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time. The house was lovely, clean, comfortable and well stocked. We enjoyed the wildlife around the pond and stream and being able to hear the stream at night. On the last night we had a nice fire in the fire pit, roasted marshmallows and had s'mores. After that we enjoyed watching the bats come out as the sun set and then watched the stars after it was fully dark. We would definitely stay here again if ever in the area."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolute bliss. This place was plucked out of my mental images of my happy place. Surrounded by trees, flowers, a pond, a thriving creek, a picturesque entry over a bridge and into a hidden oasis in the forest. We will come back time and time again. Can‚Äôt go wrong. Wonderfully upgraded with loving attention to detail and guest comfort. Can‚Äôt miss this one."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great! If you‚Äôre looking to go camping but want to have bathrooms, a shower, and not sleep outside on the ground or in the cold this place is amazing. Out of the city but close enough to order a pizza or go get dinner somewhere. The creek runs right next to the place and adds an incredible sense of serenity. We can‚Äôt wait to book again! The amazing local wildlife photography they decorated with from randy robins photography enhances your sense of the habitat you‚Äôre staying in and somehow makes it even more exciting to stay there. Highly recommend! As with any mountains, cell reception can be spotty at times but the WiFi worked great. If you‚Äôre looking for a great outdoor adventure destination with great trails within driving distance as well as an 18 hole golf course with amazing views of the mountains, this place will do the trick. The hosts were also very quick to answer any questions we had. Very well decorated and accommodations were very thoughtful. I‚Äôd put 6 stars if I could."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We‚Äôve stay at Gold Run many times over the years. With the new remodeling it‚Äôs beyond a dream: Quiet, serene and stunning.

2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved staying in the Cottage! It‚Äôs spacious. My husband and I stayed in one room; two teens got their own rooms; and the final teen stayed on a surprisingly comfy pull-out couch. Since there are two living areas, the one he stayed in was basically his room. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and so peaceful. We sat around the fire pit and made s‚Äômores one night. Love this place and would absolutely come again!"

The property has amazing hills for sledding and a zip line for the kids. The fire was so easy to use and kept the place so cozy warm. The kids loved the bunk bed and the layout of the house was perfect. I felt close to the kids but also could find privacy. The property is very private! The long driveway makes you feel you are going somewhere special and is perfect for walking the dog in the morning. There is a creek and pond and I bet it would be wonderful in the spring or summer. If you are looking to take the kids to the snow for a few days to sled and play on your own private paradise this place is it!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was one if our offgrid living experiences, we booked it long back. the epic snowfall amidst our stay made us a bit nervous but hosts made sure that we were comfortable enough.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came with our two kids (3 and 7) and had a great family weekend. We hiked around the hill and creek in the day and during the rainy night, we played games and talked in the cozy living room with hot chocolate.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My unit crashed at the Cottage during the Dixie Fire. It worked out really well as a quiet retreat away from the command post. I wish we had had the opportunity to enjoy the property. It looked like a really neat forested get away. Be prepared for cattle moving through periodically (watch where you step).

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The only surprise with this rental is that it's as beautiful as it seems in the photos and in the descriptions. We originally had a different Airbnb booked but were informed that there was a double booking with less than 24 hours before we left for our trip. We found John and Lisa's place and thought it may be too good to be true. There's no way a place that looks this beautiful available on that short of notice. It was and we loved our weekend. We'll absolutely be back again. Thanks Jon and Lisa's for sharing your home with all of us.

Our kids loved the bunkbed, board games and outdoor zip line and we loved the patio, porch swings and fold out couch and digital satellite. Little touches abound at this place!
The Susanville area is a high desert with multiple lakes nearby, Lassen National Park has scenic views and active volcanic activity and the Lava Tubes are easily accessible and don't require an expensive permit. Hat Creek has phenomenal fishing too!"

Definitely would stay again with our family. Beautiful grounds too! Do your research on outdoor activities before you go!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We spent one week at The Cottage to get away and relax.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I stayed in the cottage and we were both pleasantly surprised at how secluded the place feels, even though it is just minutes from town. The space is dog friendly which allowed us to bring our two dogs with us - they loved being able to run around freely in the snow! With it being so cold out during our visit, we were worried it might get unbearably chilly while we slept, but the cottage has heating and it stayed cozy throughout our stay! The hosts had great communication and notified us when the wifi went down, which was a bit of a bummer but it really allowed us to unplug for the weekend and enjoy the views and relaxing sounds of the creek that runs through the property. We can say so many great things about this place. It really is a rare find! We would definitely stay again."
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful parcel of land with many trees and a musical creek running through. Cute place with a bit of a funky layout, but it proved to be comfortable for our family of three plus doggo. Kitchen is well equipped, everything you need to make a meal (and I cook a lot!) including herbs, spices and condiments. Jon & Lisa were kind enough to leave hot chocolate packets and cookies! Just wish the pellet stove had been hooked up when we were there, looks like it's just being installed. Thanks so much!"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay with hosts that make you feel right at home. Quick to reply back and very friendly. The cottage was beautiful! Our favorite thing to do was sitting on the couch, get a hot cocoa pick a movie and chill on the couch and looking at the beautiful view outside while our dog was laying by the fireplace, so cute! Stayed during a snow storm on my honeymoon and absolutely loved it here! Lisa and Jon went above and beyond and even had a special gift delivered to us which was very thoughtful. Will definitely stay again. Plus, we got there earlier than expected and then let us do the check in. We really appreciate that!
We had our dog with us and she had a blast! Thank you so much guys! We had the best stay!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house and great location. It was a little way out from city, which is what we were looking for, but easy to find with the directions they gave. We stayed during the early fall and met some friendly deer for their dawn and dusk forages. The property is so so pretty and the main bedroom is so spacious we kept our little one and his crib in there with us. We only stayed one night on our way up to Oregon, but it was cozy and would be great for a little getaway with time for hikes and enjoying the scenery."

I will personally stay here again when I come back to see my grandson and his family.
The cottage is a hidden gem nestled in the mountains that anyone looking to get away and relax can enjoy.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan and Denise‚Äôs
Cottage is our families peaceful, serenity. It‚Äôs not only our go to place to spend quality time with our family and grandson. Each area of this property has special meaning. The deck is our hangout to catch up, the pond our dog uses as his own swimming pool the whole time. The strolls around the property and to the bridge are just a stunning piece of nature. You feel alone in the wilderness, with the calmness, with these, you are able to refuel and relax. Have a renewed sense when leaving.
The deer love the apples off the back tree. The turkeys out and about early.
The cottage has an amazing bed InThe master suite. Love it. Plenty of room for family members thought the house.
Ryan and Denise
Are really great hosts.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cabin is very spacious with beautiful decks. We loved the setting in the woods with the creek and the pond. Very relaxing. We enjoyed waking to see the deer right next to the cabin grazing.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another wonderful, relaxing stay at Ryan & Denise's. Thank you! The cottage is very comfortable, especially the master suite. We had a great time grilling and reading on the deck amongst the trees and deer. Hope to return again!"

2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a charming cottage and beautiful surroundings! It was great to have a full kitchen and to be able to take our dogs with us, they had a great time too. Grocery stores, restaurants and gas stations were not too far and easy to get to. Our hosts were great at communicating with us, when we had questions. A hidden treasure and a great deal too."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice place to stay. Very clean. Kitchen was well stocked with equipment and the beds were comfortable. WiFi work well. We would be back. A/C worked mostly well does take a couple hours to cool the house on the very hot day we were there but it did work well.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a family retreat to the mountains. Everything you need in a lovely setting.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful. Great value for the money. We had tons of space, beautiful, peaceful setting.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very tranquil. Great place to relax. Lots of room.
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great, quiet location with good potential for seeing wildlife. We enjoyed seeing the deer, birds and little creek‚Äî and the evidence of the bear (we presume?) delighted us! Had a very comfortable stay and enjoyed cooking out on the grill. House is cooled by a swamp cooler which, even in the high August temps, cooled the house amazingly. The only discrepancy between the listing and our experience was that the pond was empty at the time of our visit. We so enjoyed our two nights and recommend this location!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a gorgeous and cozy home. We had the best time. My husband, myself and our four children had way more than enough space to be comfortable and have a great time.

Can‚Äôt wait to go back!!"

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This a wonderfully located property! ! We visited in Sunsanville with family and for a loved one's memorial. This property is close to town and far way enough to feel very close to nature. The setting of the cottage is beautiful and the cottage itself is quaint and clean. All the amenities were great and the space in the cottage was perfect for a full house of 7. This place was simply perfect. We hope to be back to visit soon!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a secluded place to stay surrounded by trees and wild animals this is it! There‚Äôs a small creek that runs through the property that is beautiful, lots of deer, and wild turkey on the property as well. The Cottage is very spacious and has everything you will need for your stay. Grocery stores are about 5 miles away, there‚Äôs a little family owned smokehouse that you pass on the way to the cabin that was excellent, I believe it was called GL&L Smokehouse. We picked up a tri tip and some bacon!
We had a great relaxing couple of days, would definitely stay again!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"To say our stay was enjoyable would be an understatement. My daughter lives in Susanville, and I would never stay in a hotel again. Thank you Ryan and Denise. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè"

2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The location is beautiful and peaceful with a nice creek to enjoy. The cottage is where we stayed and has great potential. They would make their place much better if they invest in new pots, pans and knives, as the ones they have right now are nearly unusable. Focusing on guest experience would also increase the value of this great location."

As a fellow Airbnb host myself, I appreciated all that Mindy has put into this place. I have so much to say about how amazing this place is, but I am not sure I can do it justice! I was in town for work and it sure was a great place to ""come home"" to.

Mindy was very responsive and so kind."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful stay at Mindy‚Äôs place. It was a harrowing experience we were going through with the Dixie Fire, but having an Airbnb really helped settle our nerves somewhat. We had to be evacuated for almost three weeks. We had my 98 year old dad with us, so staying in a shelter or hotel would not have worked for us. Luckily, as the sirens were going off and the firemen were going door to door to get people out, we found Mindy‚Äôs place on Airbnb!!! It‚Äôs in a great location and was just right for the three of us. We‚Äôre thankful for being able to return home and find our homes are still standing. Many of our friends weren‚Äôt so lucky. Mindy checked on us regularly to make sure we were ok and to see if we needed anything. She‚Äôs a great host!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As evacuees from the horrendous Dixie fire in CA, words cannot accurately describe how wonderful it has been to be able to stay in this cute, comfortable AirBnB home. We have my 98 year old father with us and we needed to be sure this evacuation was the least disruptive to his life as possible. (Ours, too!) So far, so good, due to the fact that there is a recliner for him to chill out in, just like at home.
Our host, Mindy, is absolutely the BEST! She‚Äôs checked on us several times to see if we‚Äôve needed anything. The house comes fully equipped with everything you could possibly need. It‚Äôs got all the comforts of home and then some! Mindy has made sure of that. You‚Äôll find all kinds of little surprises she‚Äôs provided for her guests. All you need are your clothes and your toothbrush!
You will want to stay here.
Terianne, Jim and John."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We‚Äôre evacuees from the horrendous Dixie Fire. The day we were evacuated, we were extremely lucky to find this little gem of a house in Susanville, CA, through AirBnB. We have my 98 year old father with us, so it was important to us that he be as comfortable as possible, as we may have to here for awhile. This fire is out of control!
Mindy, our host, couldn‚Äôt be any more awesome as a host. She made sure we had everything we needed as we got settled in.
She has checked in on us a couple times to see how we‚Äôre doing. She knows we‚Äôre shell shocked from the devastation of the fire. We have several friends who have lost their homes. So far, ours is still ok. However, everything around Lake Almanor has burned, including two of our favorite little towns so far.
The house is decorated with a wonderful collection of interesting pieces of furniture and has all the amenities you need to be comfortable. It‚Äôs in a quiet neighborhood with really nice neighbors on both sides. All you need is your clothes and your toothbrush, because Mindy has taken care of every detail. Just in case you forget something, it‚Äôs not a problem because you‚Äôre conveniently located near grocery stores, drugstores, restaurants, and fast food places, as well as gas stations. Susanville is a small town with a lot to offer.
Mindy has prepaid a wonderful book that tells you about lots of things to see and do. You will love her!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Doria's home is one of the best airbnb's I've ever stayed in. We went to Susanville so that we could tour the local college where our young adult plans to attend.
Doria is a lovely host and communicates well. Her home is superbly neat and clean and just a very welcoming space. It was nice chatting with her in the kitchen whenever we saw her there. For us, it was like staying with family. That said, you could socialize as much or as little as you wanted with her and come and go as you please without any awkwardness. It is a quiet home and we enjoyed and respected the quiet time between 9 pm and 8 am. We look forward to staying there again."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our review is based on a short, one night stay. Quite happy with the find, as the price was comparable to nearby hotels. However, I would say you get a better deal staying here, because you can tell that the owners go out of their way to make your stay comfortable and convenient, not to mention clean too. The place was easy to find, even late at night in the dark; area to the room was well lit. The layout of the room provided us with enough space for our stuff and ourselves. Some of my favorite things I really appreciated was the washer/dryer, the extra amenities, and the high water pressure and temperature of the shower actually got nice and hot. Overall, we slept well, the night was peaceful and quiet. We give this place a 10/10!"

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A very nice, clean and comfortable studio. Andrea was a friendly and responsive hostess. Please note you are requested to park out on the street rather than in the driveway - it seemed best not to leave anything out in our vehicle. As mentioned by others, the stairs down to the studio are made out of uneven stones with gaps between them. We navigated them fine but they could be a problem for anyone with balance or mobility issues - especially carrying your bags."

Didn‚Äôt get to meet Andrea or Sam in person but she was responsive and proactive in her communication. Would highly recommend it anyone passing through Susanville!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay at Andrea's place. It was really quiet and private there. My only small complaint is that the sprinklers were on when we were packing up and leaving and it got me a little wet because I had no other way around them.

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, quiet, and beautiful garden surroundings! The entrance is not paved- driveway is stones and there are uneven 'rock' steps to get to the door. If you have mobility issues or have a lot to carry, it will be difficult for you.

My back was acting up from the drive and I really didn't want to take a chance at a local motel. I'm EXTREMELY glad I made that choice. Andrea's place was incredibly comfortable, convenient, and peaceful. Plus, she was a very accommodating host who made sure that I felt safe with most of my valuables still in our vehicle. Next time I'm traveling through, I'm 100% going to book Andrea's place to unwind for a night."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If it is possible to be s Super Superhost Andrea is easily that. She was very responsive to text requests and flexible for our early check-in and later check out during our work-vacation in Susanville. The apartment is so lovely with a spacious and beautifully decorated bedroom, living area and spacious bathroom. The BEST stocked apartment that I have ever been in with everything in bathroom, kitchen, utility closet with washer-dryer. Just amazing. The view of sunset and gorgeous outdoor gardens were so restful and enjoyable. I had a volunteer 3-day session at the high school and the location across the Susan River and a 2 minute walk to Main Street was a delight. The cabin is right down the street from the Bizz Johnston Nature Trail that we used daily after we were finished with work. WiFi was excellent so that my husband could work and not take any days off for this pleasant vacation. Everything about this stay was just wonderful. Andrea goes above and beyond with the many thoughtful, useful things stocked in the apartment. 10 stars!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Andrea was a good at communicating everything we needed. We met her on the way out and she‚Äôs super nice.

The patio table & chairs was a lovely place to have morning coffee & listen to the bees droning in the lavender! The house is fully accommodating with many amenities. Added washer/dryer combo came in handy. The rock steps to the cottage might be tricky for someone with mobility issues but we had no problems.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great place, I loved my stay at this Susanville 1 BR apartment! The setting is beautiful, quiet and private, I wished I could have stayed longer. The inviting and extremely comfortable bed looks even better in person than in the photos, and a pull-out sofa is a nice addition. Host Andrea was very helpful, responsive and accommodating as well. I missed my check-in email and she happily helped me in.
The garden setting with a patio and amazing views is also beautiful, but involves a set of stone steps down to the front door that could be a concern for some people.
Overall this place is very comfortable, I felt quite at home. I wished I could have stayed longer to explore the nearby town and trails -- I will be back for sure!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved it. This private, clean apartment was very warm despite extremely cold temperatures outside.

2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"Enjoyed gathering with friends and family at Sarah‚Äôs place for the weekend, we were in town for a wedding at a nearby ranch. The house comfortably fit 12 (the upstairs rooms are a bit small). The kitchen was lovely and well stocked, and the area was peacefully situated among tall pines. Sarah was very flexible for an earlier check-in and a later checkout. Note that there is only one shower upstairs, and the downstairs shower is in the master bedroom bathroom. The furniture and beds are a bit dated but get the job done. We had a few issues (some beds were missing linens, there were no spare trash bags) but Sarah was quick to rectify these issues. Overall, great value for the price and a great place very convenient to Far Far Away Ranch."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great stay! The house was lovely, very clean, modern, equipped with everything we needed and was an easy drive to town and all the sites we wanted to see. Truly appreciated the small details like the hand written welcome note, bottled water in the fridge, and full coffee bar. The house also had tons of board games, some outdoor games including corn hole boards, and even had a small karaoke speaker our kids loved! The deck was so peaceful and has a small charcoal grill and propane fire pit that allowed us to enjoy a great home cooked dinner and s‚Äômores outdoors. The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. Host was very responsive, caring, left helpful notes, instructions, recommendations and even offered us a late checkout if we needed. My family loved it and we would definitely stay here again!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing location!! Beautiful view from every window and 2 huge decks to enjoy the fresh air. Very spacious. We were expecting a group of 12 for the weekend but ended up with 8, the house would have accommodated more no problem. Loved how you are nestled in the woods but 5 min from town. We enjoyed the 2 lakes, the river and hiking which were all a short drive! Upon arrival there was a wonderful gift basket full of snacks and drinks in the fridge for my family to enjoy! Definitely they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. We will be returning!!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was the perfect winter escape during the onslaught of atmospheric rivers in California. If you‚Äôre looking for a secret place to stay connected while hoping to explore Lassen County (yes even in winter), then look no further. Not only did the amenities here provide Wifi, a comfortable rest, and ideal privacy, but the home also happens to be right next to the lake and the famous Lassen County. If you haven‚Äôt seen the snow capped mountains located five minutes away, you‚Äôd be depriving yourself of the hidden gems of California - some things are almost sacrilege to share! One of the unique places about this AirBnB is the rear loading lane. Arriving late at night in the dead of winter, there is no better amenity than unloading your gear that leads you nearly into the home, ensuring convenience and comfort at the same time. We‚Äôre absolutely returning as a winter home base!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space, would love to come again!"

It was quiet and private and we enjoyed the sitting area in the front yard. We were able to ride our bikes to the Biz Johnson rail trail from the cottage. The recommendations for Ironsides BBQ was terrific. We would definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wish I could have stayed longer! Very clean and the owners made it very easy to locate and use the keyless entry to get in. There are a lot of windows, but luckily they all lock. The front has a built in deadbolt in the keyless lock, but no secondary/manual deadbolt that can only be unlocked from inside. Just sharing those details for those who it matters to :) if I'm passing through this area again, I would definitely look for this place."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This casita was adorable, clean and peaceful. so much that we wanted to stay in all day.
My husband and I, stayed three nights and loved everything about it.
It‚Äôs close to down town Susanville and about 2-2.5 from Redding, Lake Tahoe and an hour from Reno. Easy access to highway and all together just Wonderful.

The place feels very cared for. It was very quiet and fortunately cool at night, so I didn't have to turn the AC on.
If you're extra sensitive, you may notice the mini power substation about 300 feet from the cabin. It didn't bother me, but I know people that may notice it.
I would definitely choose this place again if I'm in the area."

laurissa went out her way to be helpful, after I checked out , when I need her to check on a lost item.
Loved the pillows.
If you plan on cooking you will need your spices etc.. as this place is brand new. Cooking items were there. I was sad I couldn‚Äôt enjoy the outside, BBQ or just sitting out in the front due to the never ending winter. I hope I get a chance to stay again.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing as always- has everything you need! Love this Air BNB
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was quiet and comfortable. It is in a rural setting with trees and animals in the surrounding area. It was a nice stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had another great stay in ""our"" cabin. We enjoyed the ducks and goat, and especially the joyful voices of the small children who live next door. It was 100% silent at night, being that deep in the woods. As usual, we had all the supplies and equipment we needed and we appreciated the upgraded heaters."
2023-11-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ian was a kind & responsive host with clear instructions to get into the place. Unfortunately the photos were misleading as they didn‚Äôt portray the actual place. There was no stove only an old heating pad to cook on which included a heavily used with stains water kettle, microwave turn table broken so it doesn‚Äôt turn, bathroom failed to show the tiny shower & broken shower door which made getting into/use very challenging. We also didn‚Äôt realize the bathroom was in the master bedroom making it hard for bathroom use while someone‚Äôs sleeping. The pellet stove was not working which Ian acknowledged and gave a small credit towards our stay. The host gives multiple instructions to be courteous & quiet throughout our stay only to find out you can hear them the whole time, I was awoken by a crying baby at 12:30am along with the hosts overly noisy family cheering for a football game on Saturday night. So if considering staying here bring cooking device, ear plugs, and low expectations."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very lovely stay and a beautiful property. We really enjoyed petting the goats. One thing we felt could have been portrayed was that the unit shares a wall with the host‚Äôs house‚Ä¶ and children. The noise- while understandable- was unexpected and made our couples getaway a little less immersive. Overall though it was a wonderful stay at a wonderful price and the hosts were very responsive and respectful of our privacy.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place couldn't have been any better for my trip to visit my relatives in Janesville. It is surrounded by fragrant and beautiful pine trees with wonderful views from every window. The master suite is amazingly well appointed. A basic kitchen was all I needed for this trip, so it had everything I needed to make coffee in the morning and other snacks. Lassen County is an under appreciated gem for anyone who likes history, small town life, or outdoor activities. I will continue to book this place for further trips."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful house nestled in a small town. Everything is available within 30 min, the local gas station/store has all the basics. Large property with a nice deck for morning coffee or a spot to watch the local wildlife."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"excellentexperience, excellent service, excellent host."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay in Janesville. It was nice to relax at a comfortable place in the pines.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"this was a outstanding stay, quiet, clean, host is the most. Ian was responsive when I called him. this was a great stay. looking forward to more future stays as I'm up here on business."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ian and Natalie were wonderful hosts. Our young grandchildren stayed one night and loved the playground equipment. We would visit again!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ian and Natalie are wonderful hosts. We were guests for two peaceful, quiet nights and found everything that we could have needed in the private and comfy apartment.
It was quite cool outside at night (32 degrees) but with the electric heater made available, we were nice and cozy.
The property itself is gorgeous. Towering pines surround the property with a well-maintained, yet natural-feeling lawn area. We enjoyed sitting outside watching the chickens, turkeys and ducks walking around the property. The playground beneath the tress would be a wonderful space for young guests to spend some time.
With a shortage of quality lodging in the area, this affordable apartment in the forest is a place we plan to return to on another visit up north."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome home in a great location. has all the amenities and the heated floor in the bathroom was very nice! Comfortable beds and the hosts were on top of everything. Would suggest anyone to rent!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot! Great host.
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Ian‚Äôs place was a good home base for us while visiting Janesville for a wedding.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Guest quarters spacious and comfortable. Unreal Sierra campsite-like location with amenities. A great low-key, 4-acre, fenced Sierra pine filled property with a legit playground for children during the day and, for seniors (or younger adults without kids) like us, a great wake-up perimeter (rooster accompanied!) walk or jog. Ian and Natalie are vibrant and friendly hosts. We'll be lifetime return visitors.
As a side note, we were there during the Dixie Fire, and super appreciated the calm of Susanville, Janesville and the Rio Dosa neighborhood (especially our hosts!) in the midst of a very troubling (and smokey!) situation. We understand that the day of our departure some tireless Cal Fire firefighters used Ian and Natalie's airbnb, for at least one night, before the general Janesville evacuation. God bless them all! Thankfully, from afar on the internet, we could follow the day by day drama of the Dixie Fire and Janesville situation. It seems that after a close call, favorable winds and valiant fire fighting, much of Janesville (and Ian and Natalie and kids!) are now back, safe and sound.
We hope to see them all in the future as they carry on in this beautiful location."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Owners are EXTREMELY helpful and nice. Had safe and clean accommodations for us when our world was turned upside down. The home was overall very clean and comfortable. Was a little dusty, but guessing no one had stayed in it a while, which was ok for us for what we needed. Would stay here again. Such a quiet and charming hideaway!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,2 of my employees stayed here for 2 months. No complaints! Very close to Susanville and they had a positive experience.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We stayed at Ian and Natalie‚Äôs place for 3 months for work. The place is perfect for a small family or couple looking for short or long term stays. The property itself is absolutely beautiful. The backyard provides views of incredible snow covered mountains. Ian and Natalie provided pellets for the wood stove in the winter and standing heaters to keep us warm. They allowed us privacy and still managed to check on us to make sure thing we‚Äôre going smoothly. There were a few fixes to be done in the first few weeks and Natalie and Ian handled everything promptly. I highly recommend checking this place out if you plan to visit the area!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,What a view! Ian and Natalie are so friendly and helpful. We feel very fortunate to have been able to stay in this darling place.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Ian and Natalie are wonderful hosts. They are quick to respond and always helpful. The location is perfect for local travel work and is in a beautiful area.

I know exactly where I will be staying when I am traveling that way again."
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cheap accommodation but without privacy, we cannot close the room from the outside, and with the feeling of not being welcome.
We love dogs very much, however this american staff dog has random behaviors that have made us doubt our safety in the accommodation.
In addition, a lot of people came to the unit and we attended an unsavory conversation, we hesitated to leave from day 1.
We don't recommend it."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The room was clean and comfortable. Amanda was a very kind and helpful host. There wasn‚Äôt much of a town. I had to drive to Chester (15 minutes) for restaurants and stores. The location was convenient to Lassen Volcanic NP.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stopped here while visiting Lassen National park, it is about 40 minutes to the entrance of the park, but a beautiful drive. This is like when air Bnb first started and you knew you were in staying in someone‚Äôs house. This is an extra bedroom off the living room area. The room is very clean and the bathroom is clean with a great hot shower. The bed was comfy and I loved the flannel sheets with the chill at night. The room is used to store or display the urns and ashes of deceased pets, so just be sure you‚Äôre ok with that. I was told they were not people when I asked. This is a good spot for a solo traveler. I felt the area was safe and peaceful and I was able to park my car in the driveway. I didn‚Äôt find much food in the area, the coffee at blue ox was ok, but I couldn‚Äôt eat my food from there. There is a pizza place in town, but not much if you have dietary restrictions, so get some groceries. Mandy is a nice host and great tot all to."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amanda‚Äôs place is comfortable with everything you need and more. It‚Äôs a darling home with beautiful decorations and an amazing yard. She is a terrific host and I‚Äôm grateful I now have a place to stay when ever I‚Äôm in town.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,100% recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amanda and her cohost have both been in Lassen/Almanor/ Chester/ Westwood for decades.
They know the insider details of what is going on in their hometown and region. They know reality and not current advertising. They know where the best sights are versus the on-line ads.
The home they share w AirBnB guests is quiet. Neighbors are quiet and nights silent except for train horn from miles away.
The room is a bit small for a big couple, but perfect for a solo visitor. Queen bed and linen were refreshing. Adjoining bath is verging on luxurious. They know how to cater to guests. The front patio is as calm and beautiful as their back yard.
They also know how to leave you space if that is your preference.
Their big dog (Tilly) ... she is a barker at new arrivals, but within two- minutes shewas bringing out tennis balls for fetch sessions.
If you are heading to or from Quincy or driving Almanor, this is a great layover without the hustle and traffic noise of Chester."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amanda really knows how to make someone‚Äôs stay feeling like they are at home‚Ä¶ even it‚Äôs on the other side of the country!
My wife and I used this as we were in between locations for our road trip. Amanda was super flexible, welcoming and her communication is top notch. She welcomes you in like it‚Äôs your own home and everything she has listed is 100% accurate. On top of that, Amanda has added little things into her airbnb that make it even better and make it evident that she really cares about the people who stay there.
Highly recommend if your passing through the area. It‚Äôs beautiful, down the street from Blue Ox Coffee which was FANTASTIC and makes travel simple with an awesome host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amanda's space was exactly what I needed: a comfortable room with a comfortable bed for an overnight stay before my visit to Lassen NP. Check-in was easy, the neighborhood safe, and I slept like a baby."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was exactly what we needed on our road trip! Amanda made us feel right at home and her home was lovely and very clean.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amanda confirmed us last minute and allowed a very private check in when we needed it most. The bed was super comfortable I slept like a rock and enjoyed a fantastic shower in the morning.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amanda was fantastic. The home and accommodations were better then described. It was like a mini vacation but better. Don‚Äôt hesitate. Reserve now but make sure you don‚Äôt take my weekend spot. Thanks Amanda.

Tilly & ‚ÄúHerc‚Äù will keep you entertained for hours, love to play fetch, so bring your throwing arm!
Their home is immaculate; from the garden to the flannel sheets in your room! Just a couple places to eat or grab a beer in this small town, but excellent all around‚Ä¶ fresh air, peace and quiet!
Love it, love the host and can‚Äôt wait to return!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amanda (Mandy) was a welcoming host. The bedroom and its private bath are just off her living room. Mandy headed to her upstairs area after I arrived. My room felt private and was very quiet. Mandy has a good-sized dog, Tilley, who can be energetic but is not initimidating. Mandy prepped her coffee maker in the kitchen so that I just had to push the ""on"" button in the morning to make a pot and fill my go-cup. I was grateful to find this very comfortable, clean, and economical lodging in an area that does not have a lot of lodging options."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,No shortage of characters at Amanda & Jen‚Äôs! They lived us like family and we felt most welcome!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amanda is a super host. Feels like home. We were given a comfortable private room with a washroom attached. However, the hall and kitchen were accessible for us too. She is also willing to help you with providing certain items that you missed to carry. Her dog Tilly is such a good girl sweetheart.
This is a great place to do stop by when visiting Lassen volcanic national park, lake Almanor, subway caves, Burney falls, lake Britton, and mount Shasta.
Tesla/EV owners: Supercharger available at Susanville (25 miles from host). The host provided us with a 110v regular outlet for your 5-15 Tesla mobile charger. This was a generous support from the host as we were able to charge 10% of our EV battery every night of the stay.
Overall, this is a great deal for a couple of folks. I would be happy to stay at this place in the future as well."

We became friends with her .
Amanda gave us free to use her kitchen, sit in the living room to watch movies and everything we needed to make us feel at home.
We sat with her sometimes in the evening . Sometimes even with friends who came to visit . We had a stunning experience getting to know her and would highly recommend to anyone interested in being friendly and enjoying a local and human experience."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A cozy delight. As a solo traveler, I felt safe, comfortable, and relaxed. The bed was incredibly comfortable, the water pressure in the shower was amazing, and I wish I had time to meet Amanda and her dog Tillie, Yet I had to get on the road. The value was excellent. It is by far a much nicer experience than trying to stay at a simple chain hotel and never knowing what you will end up with. at Amanda‚Äòs place, you kind of feel right at home, and everything was simple and perfect."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy place with lovely hosts. And the dog Tilly is adorable.

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amanda is a very welcoming host and made us feel comfortable fully utilizing the kitchen, living room, and other spaces during our stay. The bedroom and bathroom were clean and beautiful. Tilly (Amanda‚Äôs dog) was also a fantastic host! Tilly is so sweet and loved to show off her talent of holding two tennis balls in her mouth at once. I was very impressed.
We did have a little concern about the security of our items, however. There is no lock (from the outside) on the bedroom door and Amanda left the doors to the outside open throughout our stay (even at night or when she wasn‚Äôt in the house). I‚Äôm sure Amanda has great judgment and the neighborhood is safe, but it‚Äôs still something that is slightly alarming to a visitor unfamiliar with the area. We were also a bit out of the loop with who else would be in the home and when. No problems arose, but if this sounds like something that would be a deal breaker for you, make sure to communicate that to Amanda ahead of time."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amanda is just the best! She is absolutely lovely and so easy going. Her home is amazing, she knows how to decorate which makes you feel home. The garden is so awesome and beautiful. You can relax there, eat dinner or just look at the wonderful walls and flowers. She lets us stay the day we had to check out as long as we wanted.
Just one thing. The lovely Tilly is really cute when you get to know her but she is barking if you are coming in. We needed some time to get to the key because we where a little afraid of the barking. But everything turned out well and we had such a good time, nice talks and the best host ever! Thanks Amanda"

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Amanda's. She was 250% accommodating and all the more friendly. Checking in and out was a breeze, and the place had everything we needed after a long day out at Lassen. Thanks Amanda!"
,,,"My experience with this host was terrible. She contacted me the day of to confirm my arrival. She never mentioned any concerns and then within hours of me getting on the road she cancelled on me. I'm a runner and I spend a lot of time training for Long distance runs. I enjoy running in Susanville, it's beautiful. She just about left me stranded. Terrible experience. Luckily I was able to find a last minute room at a hotel, but I spent more than I wanted. Be careful when booking with this host. Airbnb customer service was great in hearing my concerns."
,,,"Amanda has since apologized a lot about all this. She sounds like a very person, but when I arrived the dog mentioned in reviews (which looks more like a pitbull to me) was barking and when I tried giving her a dog treat, she growled. Having had very bad experiences with dogs in the past, I wasn't going to take any chances. I tried sending several messages to Amanda, but didn't receive any reply (she said later that was work and had leave her phone in her car). It then took over an hour to get an Airbnb rep on phone and by then all I could do was cancel the reservation. When Amanda was finally able to respond to me, she apologized and offered her place for free if I still needed one. But by then I was quite some distance away. If you choose stay here and have any issues with dogs, make sure something is done with the dog before you arrive."
,,,"Says pet-friendly but we communicated what pets we would be bringing - of which she agreed to well ahead of time. When we arrived she yelled at us and was unwelcoming. When we were leaving she yelled at us and was extremely aggressive - even going as far as slamming cabinets and stomping around. It was a very uncomfortable experience for all of us, including our pets. We ONLY booked because it said pet-friendly, we communicated with her about the pets ahead of time, AND we followed extra instructions about kenneling our pets."
