2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"MARILDA = SUPERB HOSPITALITY!!! She didn‚Äôt feel like just any host but more like a friend or family. She has a warm and welcoming presence and her home is presented the same. It‚Äôs super clean and everything you need is perfectly placed so you don‚Äôt even really need to ask. I checked in and immediately I found myself sitting and chatting with her for hours then before I knew it, we were eating dinner together. My 18yr old son and I stayed there for just one night but if he ever heads back to Delaware alone for any reason, I‚Äôd feel 1000% comfortable with him staying with her."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have never stayed at a someone house in a private room before so I was kind of hesitant before booking.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul & Erma‚Äôs little place was a gem! It had everything we needed and was an easy drive into downtown Dover. We enjoyed the quietness of this location, being set in the country among the Amish. We especially enjoyed the porch swing where we had our coffee each morning and being greeted by their gray kitty every time we stepped outside. We most definitely will return!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, couldn‚Äôt have been more convenient"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was as described. Very clean. Great location. It was close to stores, restaurants, and the race track. There was a chicken that welcomed us and a beautiful kitty that came to see us off. I would definitely stay here again."

Paul & Erma are very responsive. When unforeseen circumstances required us to leave early, they were understanding and adjusted our balance accordingly."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a wonderful stay here at Paul & Ermas. The home was very clean and welcoming. Plenty of provided amenities to suit everyone's needs. My only complaint was that the listing did not mention the upstairs tenants. Not a huge deal as they were quiet besides normal walking around. The chickens were a welcome sight each morning but unfortunately we did not get to meet Smoky! Maybe next time!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul and Erma were great hosts.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed twice at Paul and Erma's and it is a very quiet and cozy space. It's a rural location but downtown Dover and Smyrna are only about 10-15 minutes away. Appreciated the delicious handmade baked goods waiting on the counter, and having all amenities right there in the efficiency apartment. The bed is comfortable and there are extra space heaters/fans if you need warmer or cooler air in the room. You are in someone's house, so you do hear people moving around upstairs, but the space itself is very private. Very homey and comfortable."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I am a travel nurses who‚Äôs done two contacts in Dover and I‚Äôve stayed here both times. Such a warm inviting place to call home while away.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts were great responding and accommodating. My guests were coming to visit from across the country and I was allowed to go and make sure the place was ready.
Only main thing I was not pleased with and would recommend changing is the free roaming chickens. They were always at the entrance to the apartment. Even though I love the countryside, other visitors may not. They were constantly chasing after my son and guests trying to get in and out of their vehicle.
I would also suggest cleaning up the outside entrance area; seemed messy/dirty. Also could be
related to the chickens.
The house is in a very quiet Amish area which is very nice.
Thanks again for opening up early so I could look over the apartment."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed staying here. We brought our 4 month old baby and were very comfortable. We wanted an inexpensive, cozy & private place and that's what we got so we really did enjoy our stay. Hosts were very kind and responsive whenever we needed anything. They have chickens and at first we were wimps and ran when they chased us but then we got some courage and with the host's advice clapped back üòÇ We would recommend staying here."

This will be our place to stay when we're in the area forever lol"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place and location! Fresh baked cookies awaited our arrival in this cozy basement stay. The place is nothing spectacular, but it was great for the night. The best part for us was the free range chickens right outside our windows and door."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Staying at Paul and Erma‚Äôs was fantastic. I was doing a clinical rotation for school at a nearby hospital and their place was the perfect location for a long term stay. The hosts and their family that live above were friendly, welcoming, and responded to anything I needed. I would definitely recommend this place to others! Being greeted by the chickens and adorable cat everyday was a plus üòä"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I had a nice short stay for the weekend. It was so nice to meet Kim and her daughter.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved seeing the Amish carriages being pulled by horses n bc of my love for horses of course I drove like 20 mph but the others or locals didn‚Äôt seem to do that, think you would mention to future stayers to respect the horse dream carriages and slow way way down for them. That‚Äôs all and there was no conditioner so I bought a bottle n left it there! Thanks for cookie/ and pound cake!!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Cute and cozy, in a very quiet country setting minutes outside Dover. Easy to get to Dover and nearby towns.
Erma and Paul were excellent hosts. Communication was great, and they graciously allowed us to extend our stay at the last minute when my husband became ill. Erma even kindly offered to shop for us if needed.
Best for a couple, as it‚Äôs a small place, but super comfortable. Would book again."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I came to this airbnb for a little weekend getaway and it was perfect. It‚Äôs a very calm and quaint community which is perfect if you need peace and quiet. It is about an hour away from Rehoboth which was great because you weren‚Äôt close to the hustle and bustle of the beach. The baked goods upon arrival were amazing and made us feel so welcome. We also got the pleasure of sitting and chatting with Kim for a while and she was so kind. The kitty (Smokey) that was hanging out was absolutely adorable and would hang out with us when we sat on the porch swing to have coffee in the morning. This place is perfect for the price and it really helped my husband and I reconnect and find each-other again. Will definitely book again in the future.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful spot! Clean, quaint, and quiet. Delighted to be there.
Guests should know the mailbox is on the other side of the street. Arriving after dark, I couldn‚Äôt see house numbers and turned into the wrong driveway and was confused where to go. The owners were quick to respond to my text, so we resolved it quickly before I knocked on the wrong door."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely and cozy! The surrounding grounds were so green and lush, I wish we could have enjoyed the yard a bit but we were in town visiting family. The bed is very comfortable and so were the couches. Check in was super easy. It was nice to have the smart tv so we could catch a show and relax. We enjoyed it here very much and hope to stay here again! Could use a fan at night as it did get a bit warm at night (summer). But we are from Colorado and are wimps in hot humid weather. The fan in the room works as a partial heater so that would be great in the winter."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts and easy to work with
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was a lovely place to stay, and we only regret that we couldn't stay more than one night, in order to enjoy the porch swing. The space was comfortable, especially the bed, with plenty of space. It was wonderful to have a washer and dryer; however, the washer didn't use cold water. Erma was quick to respond, and even sent her son-in-law to us to explain how to use the Ninja coffee maker. It was super helpful to be directed to a local florist. Very hospitable!
The gravel area means you'll need to carry your bags inside, versus rolling them."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A nice walk out basement apartment with a beautiful backyard with tall trees surrounding it, a fire pit and Adirondack chairs. Lovely to sit outside with all the birds singing. Inside space was very comfortable and stocked with everything we needed. We got to meet Erma who is a very friendly host and all communication went very smoothly. A nice place to stay in a rural area."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful country setting bargain! The apartment was clean with a private basement entrance. The bed was very comfortable and there were nice touches by the owners. We unfortunately had to cut our stay short as my mother is handicapped and had issues with getting her walker to a few areas in addition to difficulty with the shower. The unit is on a lower level but no stairs are needed to access. There is a gravel drive that may make it difficult for access via wheelchair or walker and shower is walk in but small if there are mobility issues. There is not a thermostat to control temp in unit but we were able to request from the main occupants to adjust the temperature. The location is beautiful and not too far from town but definitely in the country. The hosts gave a refund for the last night upon request and were very pleasant and easy to communicate with. All in all a great place if you are on a budget and do not have mobility issues.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Paul & Erma‚Äôs!! The house was so cutely decorated, the bed was so comfy, and they welcomed us with amazing sticky buns and homemade cookies! It‚Äôs in a beautiful, quiet, country area - if you‚Äôre looking for a get away with lots to do/see, this may not be your place - but it was exactly what we wanted/needed! We spent a lot of time riding our bikes around the countryside, and shopped and found some goodies at Byler‚Äôs Store and Spence‚Äôs Bazaar & Farm Market. One thing readers should be aware of is that it is in the basement below a residence. So we could hear footsteps above us at times but it was never bothersome to us at all. We had an excellent weekend here and highly recommend it!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul & Erma are great hosts. The apartment has everything you could need or want. Great location and the backyard is a lovely space for a sunny meditation.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paul and Erma's place was a great, quiet little stay in the greater Dover area. Lots of Amish fellows riding their buggies and scooters and plenty of beautiful countryside scenes to explore!
We only stayed for one night and were thrilled to find cinnamon rolls and fresh baked cookies on our arrival! Score! The room itself was well furnished and clean and the linens smelled fresh and were soft. The large queen sized bed was perfectly suited for our needs and we woke up to a misty morning among the farm animals and chirping frogs in the woods. Around 5 minutes drive is a cute little sausage house where we got some breakfast. Overall it was a sweet little getaway and if I find myself in the area again, I'll be sure to contact Paul and Erma for another stay!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place suited my needs to watch my grandsons while my daughter attended a wedding in Dover - it was within 15 minutes to the venue and had a bedroom and living room area. There were a variety of snacks, water, and paper products provided as stated. The place was clean but warn. It was a short distance to the main highway; however, I was not comfortable with the neighborhood. Just be mindful that there is a step up into the home and there was a small step/lip up to the kitchenette and the hallway that leads to the bathroom. The bedroom is large and easily accommodated the pack and play. The blow-up mattress worked well; however, the living room area is small, and you needed to move it to go down the hall to the bathroom or get out the door. Host was very responsive which I was appreciative."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn‚Äôt have found a better place to stay recently in Dover, Delaware. All descriptions were accurate and even more was provided, like a basket of munchies, bottled water in the fridge, and all the toiletries one could ask for. Nikki was super helpful with some questions I had beforehand, and when she found out I was attending a sad family event, she left me a card and plant to take to the services. Check in and out were easy and Nikki messaged every day to make sure everything was okay. It was!"

Nikki thought of everything! It was like staying in a hotel room with all the amenities: like a toothbrush! She even had snacks to welcome you into her home.
Nikki was also very good at making sure my stay was perfect. I went during October where the weather would be chill during the night, but kinda warm during the day. She was very accommodating in making sure I was comfortable.

They are both gracious and hospitable hosts. They represent what the Airbnb experience should be: the opportunity to stay in a home, feel like a guest, and get to know another caring person. As far as I am concerned Renate and Bill are the gold standard.
If I ever decide to become an Airbnb host, I will definitely model myself after them. Thanks for all of the little things you did to ensure I was comfortable. Thanks for such an amazing experience. James"

So many little details like leaving coffee ready for me, among many other things, went such a long way in making me feel welcome. As someone who loves to run trails when I‚Äôm on the road, Renate suggested the Bombay Hook wildlife refuge. What a gem! Gorgeous run (drive or bike ride) ‚Äî Perfect for anyone who likes to be outdoors in any capacity. The place was a straight shot (about 40 min) to Rehoboth/Lewes. I hope to stay here again next time I‚Äôm in town!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly highly recommended Airbnb stay was beyond my expectations. The owners are great Christian people who were personable with me in reference to my stay there, and the recent passing of my son. They made my stay very comfortable and unforgettable. I have been through a lot prior to my trip to Delaware and my stay with them. And my reasons to come into town was to handle affairs. I had a very tight schedule and limited time. In the evening, when I would check in each night during my stay, they made me feel like family by talking with me. It made my time there, pleasant given the circumstances. The area in which the house is very nice and the house itself. It‚Äôs like something out of a magazine or a dream.. these individuals were definitely sent by God."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Renate and Bill were wonderful hosts. Before we learned about American history from them, we played pool in their amazing pool table, had some wine and enjoyed the beauty of their house. The house is an unique log house built by the Amish and Bill himself, which makes the place so special. Renate‚Äôs antiques and style makes the place warm and welcoming."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay with Renate was amazing. Her home is beautiful, down to every detail. And spotlessly clean.
Location is great. We needed something to eat the evening that we arrived, and there were several restaurants less than ten minutes away. Yet when you were at her home, it was as if you were in a cabin in the woods.
Communication was perfect and everything was well-explained and easy to understand.
Breakfast in the morning was like something out of a fairy tale. Warm coffee, bagels, fresh fruit, homemade brownies and a delicious German cake were all waiting for us when we came down the stairs. I've never felt so pampered.
And above and beyond, the host and her family made us feel right at home.
Highly recommend!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Renate and Bill‚Äôs log cabin home for one night, driving down from Philadelphia to volunteer with Delaware Wild Lands in Townsend. Since we needed to start early in the morning we looked for a place nearby. Their log house and wood paneled walls were so much more charming than a hotel room.
A few days before our trip, our friend Lynn wanted to join us, and our host Renate was extremely helpful to accommodate this last minute request.
We enjoyed our stay and slept well.. Their home felt very comfortable and safe. We could have privacy in our room, or join Renate and Bill for a nice conversation the next morning at the breakfast table.
Lynn loved it so much, she kept saying she wanted to come back here each week!
Renate and Bill were such great hosts.
Highly recommended when in the Dover Delaware area!"

They were very hospitable and were wonderful to talk to. Renate had coffee and tea ready for us in the morning, and even offered breakfast. I believe they have multiple rooms available; ours was perfect size for a quick one night stay, but if you‚Äôre staying for an extended period of time with them, you should definitely ask about her larger room.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had an amazing time staying at Renate and Bill's wood log home. They truly made sure I felt comfortable and welcomed home. I must say what a beautiful charming log home. The house was clean at all times. I will definitely be staying with them again. You got to meet their son Carlton such a welcoming and respectful person. I must say they are very classy family. Don't hesitate to meet them; I gaurantee you will end up forming a friendship for life. 
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Renate and Bill have once again been warm and wonderful. I had a chance to spend a little more time with them and enjoyed my stay even better. Looking forward to my next stay and their winter holiday event.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a welcoming and comfortable place Renate's place was to stay! Between the comfortable bed, cozy room, very clean facilities, awesome cabin feel, thoughtful eats and lovely table setting, and above all the sweetest host! Felt right at home, as if I've known Renate and her family forever. Great stay, and would book her place again in a heartbeat!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying here and it was just as wonderful as the first. Renate and her family are so welcoming and thoughtful, and their home is beautiful. We love to stay at their inn whenever we‚Äôre in the area!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay, beautiful and extremely well stocked. They were so thoughtful in the amenities and made sure we had everything we needed. Heads up if bringing pets be careful when opening the garage door - the cat Clarabelle is very quick and ran in the moment we opened it and attacked our pup who was in the kitchen, don‚Äôt take your pet through the garage as the cat is only people friendly."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If Renate‚Äôs & Bill‚Äôs home is ever available BOOK IT. They will not disappoint! Super thankful for my amazing experience with them. 10/10 would recommend! üòá
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a fantastic stay! The hosts made me feel so welcome. They took the time to inquire about our preferences and plans and adjusted accordingly.
The location was perfect - close to lots of things yet with a feeling of a remote log cabin. And the entire house is worth taking the time to examine. Historic artifacts and antiques make it a time capsule yet all the modern conveniences await.
Renate prepared a lovely array of breakfast items (we mentioned she could call her place Ed an actual B and B!)
Her outdoor kitty (20 years old!) ClaraBelle was the perfect welcome committee. I sat out on the porch, rocking with her and a glass of wine for ages.
The cozy loft was both comfortable and snug - and super affordable!
I can‚Äôt wait to come back and will definitely return for a longer stay!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is by far one of the best Airbnb experiences. The hosts are extremely hospitable and made me feel comfortable and right at home. The house is meticulously maintained and super clean! I highly recommend Renate's place!

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Due to a medical emergency, my wife and I , were unable to keep our reservations. Without hesitation, Renate stepped up, and after the end of the day, I can truthfully say, Customer Service goes a long, long way with this Amazing Host ! We are just waiting on full recovery, and my wife and I , plan on making Renate's Airbnb, a yearly staycation !"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at this home for 1 week, the J room was very clean at checkin and Renate was available to answer/address any concerns. The home was so well organized there was very little to complain about. The family is beyond hospitable and welcoming."

Hosts are fantastic, home is spotless, beautiful log house with charming interior. Renate communicated through text to let me know their plans so that I could come and go as I please. 5 starts for sure!!!"

The Black Horse Inn was the perfect log cabin getaway."

It felt as though we were just another part of the family. My college roommate and I will defiantly be returning for future reunions!
Described as listed and more!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I felt so comfortable here. Every touch was made with thought and did not want for anything while staying here. The house is beautiful and the room was comfortable and cozy. I loved the breakfast that was left out for my friend and I with a note. It is touches like that which really made me feel at home and special. I really enjoyed the conversations I had here and I even got to watch the Euro cup soccer games! (that made me very happy). This is a wonderful place to stay both in terms of the comfort of the home and the warmth of the people. I enjoyed the conversation as much as going out to see the horseshoe crabs. I hope to come back and I highly encourage anyone to come stay here and experience the comfort and warmth that i felt. This was truly a memorable stay.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The stay at Renate's place was wonderful. their home was beautiful and squeaky clean. The only thing you heard in the morning was the various birds in the woods making beautiful sounds. Renate, Bull&Carlton were very hospitable for me and my son visiting Kitts hummock. We would definitely stay again if we were in the area."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and set up!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Renate‚Äôs house was lovely in every way. Of the many Airbnb places that I have stayed this place ranks at the very top. Top notch cleanliness and comfort. Certainly fit for a king.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Renate's home was perfect for a low-budget trip to Dover! My girlfriend and I made the trip down from Massachusetts for the NASCAR race weekend, and the house was in a perfect location within 10 minutes of the track. Renate and her husband Bill were great hosts, who helped set us up with whatever we needed throughout the weekend. I would 100% recommend staying here if you are looking for a low-priced place to stay in Dover!!"

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hospitality and beautiful place
So nice and clean."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, great communications, easy in and out. Comfortable."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable home in a quiet neighborhood. For us, nice and close to Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge, as well as restaurants and grocery stores. Margaret is a very responsive host."
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,This house was clean enough and located close off the highway. The dog fence is mostly a tough plastic. It held the dogs but flexed when dogs stood up on it to see the neighbors cats. The grass in the fenced area was a little high. We were just passing through with a one night stay. I slept on the day bed and it was not comfortable for an adult. The window sills and baseboards were dusty. (I needed to open windows upon arrival to air out the house as is smelt like lysol). We did not shower or cook. The neighborhood was quiet. The Pad Thai as the local Tai restaurant was good.
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We certainly had more space than a hotel room offers and the location was very convenient to where we wanted to visit. The carport was nice. The three TVs were each different and not easy to navigate. The A/C kept the house very comfortable. The heater appears to need a check-up. The living room ceiling fan would unexpectedly, periodically stop running, pause, then start running again. There were four towels, no hand towels and no face-cloths. The coded-locks on the front and back doors were very easy to operate."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Margaret was responsive, hospitable, helpful, and had the place spotless. She even let us check in an hour earlier and left materials to help us clean up. The dog was very happy and felt right at home. I highly recommend this location for a weekend getaway, it's easy to get to and so easy to love!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you‚Äôre planning to go to the race this is a great house!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Margaret was wonderful and very helpful with ensuring we had all the items we needed while traveling with kids. The space had everything we needed and the neighborhood was quite but active!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location. We just came to Dover for one night and Margaret‚Äôs place worked perfectly for us.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"check in was anytime after 2 we got there at 4:45 and they were still inside cleaning. afetr cleaners left we noticed there was no toilet paper so used out own we had from our travels, tv wasnt connecting to netflix and there is no other options bno local or antenna so unless your streaming you dont get anything. quick note to margaret and we got that fixed.
drip coffee maker was only a 2 cup maker so we chose to not bother with it. yard is somewaht fenced in but 2 sides are just zipties to a plastic snowfence so we opted to just leash our dogs for potty time.
living roomwas dark just had 2 lamps. Livingroom furniture very comfortable. beds were very comfortable. heat worked well. neighborhood was quiet and very nice.
overall we had a nice stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay on long ride from FL. Very quiet, no hotel guests coming and going , no loud TVs. Nice fenced in yard for pets. Felt safe and comfortable. Thank you Margaret !"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Comfortable house. Easy to get to
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home was perfect for our family and pups. Made a long drive from up North and it was the perfect halfway point for us to rest. Traveling with 2 dogs, we wanted a residential area that we could have some privacy and a place to walk the dogs between our driving. It was the best spot and will return next time we do this drive. We travel to the Outer Banks in North Carolina from Massachusetts, so Delaware is a good pit stop. Margaret was very quick with answering any questions I had. This was my first experience with AIRBNB and was very pleased how smoothly it works. Thank you so very much Margaret!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent house was nice n clean

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Margaret's home was lovely, clean, and made us feel right at home. We found the Valentine's themed decorations to be a pleasant surprise and so thoughtful. We really appreciated the amenities for our dog, as well as the fenced in yard. Our dog felt right at home, and that is something that is very important to us. The beds were comfortable, and there were quite a few very soft pillows available. The kitchen included all the necessary items for cooking. The television included Netflix, and it was great to be able to relax on the comfortable couch and watch television after a long day. We also appreciated how spotless the bathroom was, and we could tell great care was taken in ensuring the home was clean for us. It is very clear that this home is a passion project for Margaret, rather than just a source of income. We enjoyed our stay and would return again if in the area!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I've enjoyed Margaret's homes many times and will stay again if circumstances warrant.
thanks for your hospitality!
Bert"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A very nice and clean home in a quiet area. We enjoyed our stay and Margaret answered any questions quickly. I highly recommend!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Margaret was a fabulous host, even making sure the walkway was shoveled after Old man Winter dropped a few inces of snow on the town! You can tell Margaret puts a lot of thought into her guests experience! Thanks so much!
The home is also easily accessible to Dover's ammenitites. We will definitely stay again next time we're in town!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the second time I've stayed at Margaret's and it is a great place to call home when I go to Dover on business. I will definitely stay there again!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quite stay.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Margaret was quick to respond to inquiries and the place was as described. My wife and I would stay there again if we ever are in the Dover area again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay. My family enjoyed our time there.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for a wonderful stay. It was so easy to get in and out. Wonderful place.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was super clean and well kept! Even better it allows pets. It has an enclosed area in the back so it was perfect to let our doggie run. Overall it was a nice stay for a short visit during Christmas time!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to find and get in. The beds were very comfortable so we did sleep well. However, there were a few odd things - there was half-eaten food in the fridge. Half full orange juice, half full coffee creamer, and a carton of eggs with 5 eggs in it (?). And some opened chocolates. We did take a risk and use the creamer but still felt odd. I'm used to condiments in the door, but regular food was strange to see and made the presence of the previous guest very known.
There was also a chemical smell in the house. I could not locate the origin. The furnace is very loud, too! The bathroom could use some love - screws right into the drywall (hanging out from being stripped) and the caulking has seen better days (those are easy fixes). Two outlets in the 2nd room did not work. And a lamp in the living room was broken (no bulb, broken switch). Overall the house was fine, met our needs for a quick weekend but some of those little touches could level up the space."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Margaret‚Äôs home was simple, clean, and had everything that I needed for an easy stay. Would come back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house was cozy right outside the busy city but right off the main road.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice clean place. Great for pets!! Enjoyed our stay
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! Margaret's house is so cozy and inviting, and as a host she is very generous, communicative, and accommodating. The kitchen is a good size and well equipped for cooking group meals. The water pressure in the shower is great, and it was so nice that all of the living room furniture had the ability to recline. We were in the area for the DE ren faire, and it was really nice to be able to put our feet up after walking around all day. We would love to stay in one of Margaret's homes again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is pretty comfortable. This is an older home that is in the process of receiving some much needed love. With that in mind the furnace is LOUD, expect to be startled if you are in the kitchen and it turns on. The bathroom could use quite a bit more work, but everything functioned properly and there was plenty of hot water. The beds were clean and comfortable and lots of soft good sized towels were provided in each. Be advised if you are scent sensitive, some powerful air fresheners are employ here, but it is easily remedied by unplugging and a little airing. Margaret is wonderful; very responsive and helpful. She anticipated our needs as out of state guests and had recommendations for us. There are also many little touches that if you are travelling with kids or pets you will very much appreciate. Easy entry and wifi info readily available. The most well stocked kitchen and bathroom I have encountered. Checkout was simple and she only made reasonable requests of us."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay with Margaret, and she always makes things easy. Nice place, good location, excellent value. Super quick to respond to questions, we enjoy staying in her places!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There were a couple of boxes I did not check because we were only there overnight so we spent maybe 8 hours at her home. So did not get to see much of the area except for the Downriggers Festival which was the purpose of our visit. The home was immaculate, the neighborhood was quite, and wish I had the time to enjoy the surroundings. I do recommend if you are in the area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We would stay again, certainly! It was very comfortable and easy to navigate Dover area. (I love the magnolia tree -- it was blooming and lush and gorgeous.)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Margaret‚Äôs place was fabulous just like the listing stated, she was very responsive to any question I had and was very quick with responding. Great place, great host and I plan on returning!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I kept saying how it felt like we were staying at home. This AirBnB was absolutely perfect for us!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Margaret was very responsive and contacted me the next morning to see how our night went and if we needed anything, she was only 10 mins away. The location is close to many stores, restaurants, gas stations and not far from the beach. The yard was good for our dog. Two sides are chain link fence and the other two sides are flexible plastic fencing secured to sturdy posts. Met the neighbor in the back, very friendly and has a very friendly little dog. The house was spacious and very clean. I felt safe walking my dog around the neighborhood. I really liked the carport and the rear entrance from the driveway, very convenient."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Felt at home and it felt like vacation. I especially loved the outdoor swing and fenced in backyard. It was perfect for our dog and young children. One end of the block was a bit sketchy with neighbors who didn‚Äôt maintain their property so I didn‚Äôt especially feel safe walking the sidewalk there. Margaret‚Äôs home felt completely safe, comfortable, and clean. I would return especially if there‚Äôs a discounted price off-season."

Margaret, our host, was incredibly responsive and facilitated a smooth and effortless stay. Her attentiveness and care added an extra layer of comfort to our experience.
Our stay was nothing short of wonderful. We were able to relax and recharge before continuing on our journey, which made this Airbnb a crucial part of our trip.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! It was clean and comfortable. One small detail that I appreciated were the pet accomodations! I didn't have my good boy with me at the time of our visit, but a food bowl, water bowl, blanket, and pet bed were all made available. Furthermore, we needed quick access to the airforce base, and this was a great location for that! We would return."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It hit the spot for us! We were passing through en route to NC. It was a perfect stop over. THANKYOU for the pancake mix our son and granddaughter loved them!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Margaret is a super host. I stayed with her last year at another of her Airbnb‚Äôs and will return again! Great for the humans and the fur-babies. Great fenced in yard for our 2 year German Shepard.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place and very Clean. Margaret was an excellent host.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was easy to get to and matched the photos.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Margaret is a friendly, responsive and accommodating host. Her home was a comfortable, spacious, affordable home base for us- our 2nd time staying there and we hope to return."

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Quaint little place in relatively good location. Odd little fix ups here and there throughout the house but overall a nice place. Would recommend a guest sign-in ledger or memory book for guests to fill out.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at this house, Margaret was very welcoming. She made sure we felt comfortable during our stay. Everything we needed was available and easily accessible. Highly recommended!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Margaret was very accommodating to my guests and I. She was responsive to all of my comments and is an incredible host. 10/10 would recommend and hope to come back again soon!
2023-04-01,4.0,Group trip,The location of this home was great just a quick drive to where ever you would want to go. We were a bit frustrated with the ‚Äúthird bedroom‚Äù since only 2 bedrooms are pictured it leads you to believe the 3rd is relatively the same. Well it is not. It‚Äôs basically the laundry room with a trundle bed in it so you‚Äôre sleeping next to the washer/dryer as well as a bunch of shelves with storage on it. This would have been fine if we had kids sleeping in there but it was 6 adults so I would say this home comfortably sleeps 4 adults.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Margaret‚Äôs home was very comfortable and has everything you need for our stay in Dover. Wish we were staying longer!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice renovated ranch house in a development near many restaurant choices.

It is in a nice neighborhood that we felt was safe to walk around. Margaret answered our questions in a timely manner.
Major roads were easily accessible to pick up groceries or get to restaurants, beaches, and Dover Air Force Base and museum. Very convenient location. Would definitely use Margaret's house again when we come back to Dover."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I booked Margaret‚Äôs place for an author my church flew in to speak at our Women‚Äôs conference.

Close to stores and restaurants. Older but quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Great value for the money, would highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,good place to stay
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Magnolia Tree Chalet is a quaint little home just outside Dover, DE that suited three adults, one child and one dog perfectly. The neighborhood was peaceful and easy to find, just off Route 13 in DE. The home itself was very clean and quite comfy for our stay there. The kitchen appliances and TVs were super easy to use just as described. Margaret was super easy to get ahold of and extremely responsive with any questions we had ahead of our trip. We would recommend this place to anybody looking for a getaway to the Dover, DE area. We plan to stay here again when we travel in that direction in the future."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Such a cute and homey house. Very clean, organized and located in such a relaxed neighborhood. I would definitely stay again. The host was very accommodating. Location was perfect as it was really quiet yet not too far from town/businesses."

We will certainly return to her home when we are in the area again. Thanks Margaret for sharing your home with us.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was great for the proximity to DE Turf. We had a quick overnight stay. Host is hands off but is there to answer any questions. Beds were comfortable. The twin bed room is a trundle pull out and juts up right against the washer and dryer so the layout is strange and super tight so be aware. Our family of 5 was pretty cramped in this house. There is a really cute office room that we didn‚Äôt use but would be nice for a workspace. Carport is nice for parking under. We didn‚Äôt like how there were opened drink and food containers in fridge and freezer so cleanliness could have been a bit better. Coffee maker is single serve but not a Keurig. Shower was hard to operate to get the temperature right. Fairly quiet street in a peaceful residential neighborhood with really nice, quaint fall decor and would consider staying again when going to DE Turf."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Margaret's place was a great place to stay. The neighborhood was close to everything we needed and the house had comfortable accommodations.

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Really beautiful inside! There was a lot of room and was very homey. Just be careful when you‚Äôre pulling in or out of the driveway, there‚Äôs a dip that my car didn‚Äôt agree with. But besides that everything was good!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,To start off this was my first time using Airbnb. From the beginning the whole process was super easy and they were super helpful and friendly. We arrived later in the evening and were greeted by a cute cat and they texted us everything we needed to know beforehand (including a breakfast menu!) We had a long trip with a bit of traffic and they greeted us very friendly and welcomed us to their home. The room was even more spacious than I expected and very clean. We settled in and after getting under the covers my boyfriend and his father unfortunately had a reaction to the detergent or fabric softener and we could not stay. We did have to leave but they were very understanding and helpful to refund us. Definitely amazing hosts and wish we could've stayed!

There are so many special touches to this beautiful home/space and so much kindness from this host. When they told me that they had not been doing this very long, I was astonished, because there is such a hospitable feeling to every part of the stay here, you would think, as I did, that they have surely been at this for a very long time.

I would recommend that if you have a disability or if you‚Äôre elderly you may want to consider another location simply because you do have a great many steps to climb to get to the room and bathroom. We were not aware of the stairs prior to checking in. I guess I just didn‚Äôt read closely enough at the information listed. But because of this Iv was very helpful helping us get everything to our room.
As far everything else I would definitely return to use Iv‚Äôs home."

‚Ä¢They take the time to communicate with you if open to it
‚Ä¢Their home is decorated beautifully and the photos just cannot do it justice
‚Ä¢Their cats are cute and friendly and like to cuddle even with guests and honestly I was more a dog fan prior to visiting but I enjoyed their presence around the house and I allowed one or two to cuddle with me
