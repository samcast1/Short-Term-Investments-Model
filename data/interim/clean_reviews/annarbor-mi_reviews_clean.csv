2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We appreciate you giving us a place to stay
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is my second time staying at Goldilock’s property and the hosts were always the most helpful and responsive! Definitely would stat with them again when I visit Ann Arbor next time
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay, Karen was very helpful and responsive. The apartment was clean and tidy.The location is fantastic , walking distance from UMich, Kerrytown marketplace and wonderful restaurants. I can’t wait to be back ! It felt like home away from home!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an excellent place to stay and I’d love to stay here again the next time i am in town. The host was extremely responsive and helpful. It’s very walkable, close to downtown and campus. Very close to the Amtrak station. All in all, I really loved this property and the folks managing the property. Mahalo nui for a lovely stay!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Host was very responsive, great location. Recommend"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location and responsive/kind host. Will look forward to staying with them again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay while exploring Ann Arbor. Impressively well stocked kitchen, walkable to U-M and downtown Ann Arbor. Host was super responsive and nice about being as flexible as possible with check out time. It is a little loud on the street at night, just from cars passing by, and the walls are thin but everyone else in the building was very quiet and respectful while I was there. There are ear plugs available which was a nice touch!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic apartment walkable to tons of restaurants etc. Great location. Having a parking space is super! Clean apartment - perfect place to “live” for a week while in town for business.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,No complaints. The place is clean and modern. Everything works. There is some light traffic noise but it didn't bother me. Great location.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Better than a hotel in that there’s a full kitchen, bed was more comfortable, bigger tv, better furniture, more homey feel. Cost was very reasonable for the area and season. Kitchen and bathroom renovation upgrades are quite nice, relatively high quality feel. Has dedicated parking spot which enhanced the overall convenience. No long walks with luggage or groceries. Great place overall. No complaints"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great deal and a fantastic stay!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Fantastic location

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for a great stay! Loved how walkable the location was--lots of shops and restaurants around. Nice, clean apartment! Appreciated the off-street parking as well. I would stay there again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay - it's a perfect location for any Ann Arbor visit!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I had a great time at Goldilock's place in Ann Arbor. She let me check in early and store luggage after I checked out. The location was great (although there are train tracks behind the property -- I thought the sounds of the train was picturesque but very light sleepers might be turned off) and very walkable to the UM campus. It's near Zingerman's, the farmers market, and other attractions. The building is not an architectural masterpiece, but don't worry, the room is solid and Goldilocks is a great host."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect and simple place to rest and relax away from home. Highly recommended for the solo or couples traveler. Very well done.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay — fantastic location for a reasonable price! Just steps away from downtown Ann Arbor and a short walk to the Michigan campus.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I try to stay here whenever I am in Ann Arbor because it is simply the best!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"hosts are super responsive and always ready to solve the issue, space is in center location, clean house, good parking.
Some noise, as expected due to location at one of the main roads."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved my stay! Perfect walking distance to all the fun things in Ann Arbor. Will definitely be back!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed here before and will stay again - it is a great location and great space. The only down side was that the air conditioner in the bedroom was noisy. Otherwise everything was great, and the host was super responsive."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is super close to Kerrytown, downtown, and all that entails. We stayed for art fair and it was super convenient. This place is super clean and has everything you could need. The only issue we had was with the TV and the host was super communicative. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and nice. Great location and parking ! My only complaint is the air conditioning unit in the bedroom was so loud my husband and I could not get a good nights sleep.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot right downtown. Clean and comfortable.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute place with lots of extras. Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Met expectations! Great place to stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In Ann Arbor to visit some friends, just needed some place simple, and it had everything we wanted/needed."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great neighborhood, clean rental, easy instructions. Hope to be back!"
2023-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"Nice little apartment, very close to downtown which was nice. Unfortunately the pictures were just a tad different than what the apartment was. In the pictures it had a nicer looking carpet & bedding. The carpet that was there was more of a shag carpet that felt a little dirty. The AC unit also needed it’s filter cleaned which caused my husband who has chronic allergies to sneeze a lot when upstairs close to the unit and unfortunately the unit is in the bedroom near the bed. Also a storm knocked out the wifi the night we were there so we weren’t able to use the tv. Which that’s out of their hands. But overall it was a easy stay , great hosts and still a nice apartment besides those minor flaws."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were super responsive and made everything easy. The furnishings were comfortable and the place was very clean. The best thing about this place is its proximity to campus and downtown -- super easy to walk everywhere and a dedicated parking spot. Fantastic! The downside of this place is almost constant car noise during the day and well into the night from the busy street it faces. In addition, there was a very noisy wall A/C unit in the bedroom upstairs. It kept the place nice and cool during our late June stay, but my husband and I both struggled to get a good night's sleep because the unit is right next to the bed and loudly turned on and off every 5 to 10 minutes all night. It particularly jarred us awake when it seemingly went into 'roar' mode at times. Anyway, we drank extra coffee all day and overall enjoyed our time in Ann Arbor!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is my 2nd time staying here. Still great! Will be back.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've been this place a couple of time. It's a nice place in the Kerrytown and had a great time! Highly recommended.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Smooth experience and as per expectations. Good communication from the host.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a find! We really liked this place. Easy to check in, clean. No crazy fancy. But, it's definitely just perfect - and, a lot of space! - for two working travelers that just needed a great bed, wifi, and a bit of space to spread out. It was that and even better. For that price? So perfect."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place! It’s very walkable for restaurants and groceries. I would definitely stay there again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was in a perfect location, just a block from all of the shops in Kerrytown. It's a beautiful apartment that is well stocked for short or longer stays. Perfect space for a couple! The apartment was very clean and everything was in good repair. I would definitely highly recommend this for anyone looking to stay in the area. I know my partner, and I will definitely be keeping this spot in mind for future trips to Ann Arbor area!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent place! Such great instructions and had great places nearby. The design and function of the place was immaculate.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was the perfect spot for my 5-day conference visit from Texas! Super walkable , cozy space, fluffy bed, good AC and water pressure/temp; most importantly, even though I was staying by myself, I felt totally safe and at home the whole time. It also sounds like my spot was WAY better than my colleagues’ rooms at nearby hotels. :) I’d absolutely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Micah and Alicia’s place was perfect. Space was the right size, amenities met my needs, and bed was comfortable. I enjoyed the natural lights that entered the space as the sun rose. It’s in the heart of Ann Arbor which was perfect for me to adventure."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was attending a conference at UofM. This location was perfect for anything happening on campus. It was super close and easy to walk all around to restaurants. It was very late when I arrived and I was able to easily gain access to the space. I felt safe and comfortable. This unit is super cute and clean - exactly as the photos show!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,beautifully curated space in a wonderful location! would book again in a heartbeat.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apt was clean and exactly as described. Very convenient and centrally located to UMichigan and everything we needed.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location in the heart of Ann Arbor! The place was easy to find and get in. Very comfortable with modern, artsy decor. Recommend the spot for a quick get away!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Micah and Alicia were amazing and responsive hosts. The place was such a cute and aesthetic home away from home. It’s close to Michigan’s campus and only a 20 min walk from university hospital. There are many restaurants all around and the location is unbeatable.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location and the facilities are the best. It is located right next to the central campus, and there are lots of stores and restaurants to visit near by. Also the facilities have great quality. Especially, the heating system is nice and all the kitchen facilities works well. If it is possible, I will reserve this place whenever I visit Ann Arbor."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location. We were able to walk to everything we needed. Hosts were great. Restaurants steps away. Lovely place to stay.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place! Stayed here for a last minute overnight. Perfect location, and exactly as described. Great value, too."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute space right off campus and State Street. Very clean and nicely stocked kitchen. Comfy bed. They provided fantastic coffee. Stairs into the building are steep so be prepared to carry up your luggage. A small inconvenience for the perfect location.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay! Close to everything and very walkable. Exactly described, we would definitely stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location and hosts! The communication and instructions were excellent. Highly recommend this place and the hosts.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My stay at Micah & Alicia's listing made it feel like I was in the comfort of my own home. They were very responsive and always around to assist if I needed anything and were very kind. The apartment was even better than I anticipated from the listing (and my expectations were high to begin with!). I look forward to my next visit to Ann Arbor because of them and the stay I had!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Perfect location.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I’ve stayed in other properties that they manage and everyone of them has been great, including this one! I thought the cleaning fee was a little steep for a one night stay, though we were happy with everything that the unit had to offer ￼
I would definitely stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The room is great. The space is well decorated, and oriented so that despite being small, it has a great homey feel"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,It was a great place kitchen area was nice bed was comfortable. only two things I didn’t like was it was a little noisy but not bad and the hair in the shower drain.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This is the perfect location when visiting campus! ￼ The hosts were super friendly and very responsive.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our stay with Micah and Alicia. The location is perfect - you're in the middle of everything! Walkable to Kerrytown and UofMich - we didn't have to use our car once.
The space is clean and cute and has anything you'd need. Bed is comfy and has plenty of pillows!
I would book this space again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice location
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place in Ann Arbor, perfect location. The apartment is cozy and clean. The host was friendly and gave very clear instructions. I would definitely recommend this place!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Retro Nest was a perfect space for my partner and I to spend a few totally relaxed days exploring on foot, walking campus, walking to restaurants & shops. Super appreciated the new, clean kitchen with nice dishes and silverware for some meals in. I love Micah & Alicia's design eye. The color palette creates peacefulness and spaciousness with just enough creative, eye-catching pieces to make it fun:) Everything super clean, location felt very safe, and hosts were super responsive and friendly."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is a cozy and well furnished apartment that is equipped with everything one could possibly need for a comfortable stay. I stayed for nearly a month and found that from kitchen equipment to coffee powder, from sugar sachets to laundry detergent, Kathy had made sure that I could start living in the apartment right away without the need to stock up on many essentials that are rarely provided in airbnbs. The city buses are easily accessible from the apartment, and the surroundings are beautiful and quiet. The famous Zingerman’s Deli is a short walk from the apartment and so is the walking trail along the Huron river. I look forward to staying in Kathy's apartment if I ever visit Ann Arbor again and I strongly recommend it to everyone."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at this home for Graduation and having the family there as well. It was comfortable cozy and clean. The location was a short walk to all the restaurants and shops ! Kathy was responsive gave great directions and a
Pleasure host!!
Great place to stay for a UM visit!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely house in a great location!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely little nest for our visit to U of M! Kathy was terrific, and the space is just beautiful. We especially enjoyed the fireplace and shower. It is as good as all the reviews claim. The kitchen was well stocked, with everything one could need. Bed is super comfy. We liked the location with it being just a short trip to campus. It is walkable, but our weather was terrible (loved the fireplace on a cold windy day) so drove instead. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly, and we briefly heard one Amtrak train all weekend. I don’t understand that whiny review.
Book it. Book it now. You will not find a better accommodation."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Kathy’s airbnb was so warm and comforting. Parking was easy and free. The location was perfect for me to walk downtown and experience the liveliness. I really appreciated Kathy’s communication and felt like I was able to fully enjoy my vacation while here. I highly recommend to stay in this Ann Arbor beauty!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathy was very responsive and communicative. Home was clean and as advertised. Would definitely stay there again. We enjoyed our stay and felt right at home.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathy was very attentive and responsive. Great location. Great stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy was great. Very quick response timr and very kind. Made sure to help make our weekend trip better and more suited for us. The house was great, a cozy living room, a small but useful kitchen area, a nice bathroom and shower and a nice bedroom with enough space. 15 minute walk from downtown as well. Thanks Kathy!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful stay and wonderful host!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The apartment was immaculate, quiet, cozy, and comfortable. Kathy responds in micro-seconds."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect 10 in every category, and then some. This is best airbnb I have ever stayed in, and I have traveled throughout the country."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a nice little place to stay with a very responsive host.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very enjoyable stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were there for four nights and very much enjoyed the stay. Tastefully decorated and spotless. Short walk to the cental campus and surrounding area. Highly recommended!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location in walking distance of Kerrytown and downtown Ann Arbor. Kathy’s place has everything you need for a great stay, including a comfy bed, luxurious bathroom, and kitchenette. The welcome basket was a wonderful touch! The neighborhood is quiet and we had our own off-street parking space."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Kathy's space was cozy and clean with thoughtful charm. It was affordable and worth the price. We would stay there again when in Ann Arbor!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy’s place was perfect for my short time staying in Ann Arbour for work. She was a great host, super responsive and friendly. The place itself was lovely with some nice personal touches. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy's place was exactly as described and absolutely perfect for our overnight for the UofM football game. The apartment is perfectly clean with a very comfortable bed. It is in a very quiet and peaceful part of town, in a home with an upstairs unit and basement unit (this listing). We loved being walking distance from everything, so we never had to worry about parking downtown. Future guests should keep in mind that it is at least a good 10-15 minute walk to downtown restaurants and shopping, and then another 15 minutes further to get to The Big House. We are active people, so for us this apartment is definitely ""walkable"" to all of downtown Ann Arbor, but folks with mobility issues may want to plan on driving if staying here. For anyone planning on walking during your stay; bring good walking shoes and take a different street each time you venture out--there is so much to see! Kathy was a very kind and responsive host. We definitely would/will stay at Kathy's again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place. As described and in photos. Walkable to Main Street and Kerrytown.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy really is a super host! She was communicative and very friendly. The unit was really nice. Very comfortable, quiet, and super clean, with fantastic amenities. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice and cozy place, Kathy prepared the place nicely in great detail that makes me feel like at home"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy's place was perfectly located and meticulously cared for. We already looked into booking again soon, but will have to settle for a bit less as her place was already booked."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice basement apartment under a house north of downtown. Short walk to Kerrytown and Main Street.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My spouse and I were in town for a wedding and really enjoyed staying at Kathy's place. The neighborhood is very walkable, we had a dedicated on-site parking spot, and the apartment is one of the rare AirBnBs that feels like a home instead of an afterthought rental. Kathy gave clear check in and out instructions, and was quick to answer the couple questions I had. The welcome basket was also very thoughtful. Definitely recommend Kathy's place for anyone staying in Ann Arbor."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Kathy was incredible from beginning to end. House was perfect with all elements needed when away from home. Exactly what we needed, with our loved one at UofM Hospital. Absolutely will stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Kathy’s cozy Ann Arbor apartment is super cute and convenient to walking around downtown! Highly recommend and will likely be back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great home base during my week on campus for an event. Kathy was very pleasant and helpful. It was great to come in and find a basket of helpful info on Ann Arbor and some treats. The shower is truly luxurious with two shower heads. The place was very comfortable and clean. Unfortunately there was a storm which knocked out the electricity (apparently it’s common here in the summer), and Kathy was quite kind and helpful with updates. I would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at Kathy's place. We stayed during the Ann Arbor art fair and her place was easily walkable to the art fair and also all of the wonderful restaurants that Ann Arbor has to offer. We went to the Kerrytown Farmers market twice. The apartment was incredibly cozy and made us feel right at home. It was very clean and everything worked well. Whether it was us cooking for ourselves or relaxing on the couch it felt like it was our place. That was exactly what one would ask for in an air bnb. Anyone going to the Ann Arbor area would do well to look up this listing. It was certainly a special getaway for us.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great time. Thanks Kathy!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy's place was perfectly clean and the little ""extras"" (like small packets of chips and sparkling water) that I really appreciated were the little snacks that she hard out and encouraged us to eat so that I did not become hangry and I didn't have to rush to find a place to eat. It was unexpected and much appreciated! :) I will definitely be looking to stay here again,"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location (walkable to downtown), super clean, and had everything we needed for our week stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for us. Convenient to all things. Gold standard for cleanliness. And lovely hosts!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice and well equiped place. We enjoyed our stay and appreciate to walk in this nice city
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the nicest air bnbs I’ve ever stayed in. The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and a 5 minute walk to downtown. Kathy was communicative and flexible when we needed to drop off our car earlier than our check in. The amenities in the space were so much better than we expected. If you are staying in Ann Arbor, this is the place to stay. Our only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy was responsive, and her place was just as stated! We walked easily to Kerrytown Farmers Market and met friends for lunch further down town. Enjoy your time in Ann Arbor with Kathy."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Kathy’s place is wonderfully maintained and the location is great for walking into town. Kathy was very communicative as a host.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy’s flat unfortunately had a power outtage the day I was to arrive. So we agreed that I could find another place to stay. She also made it easy for me to receive a full refund, given the circumstances. Kathy was always quick to respond and helpful in her communication.
Airbnb has asked me to leave a review even though I never made it here! Kathy does seem like a good and attentive host though, and I would recommend her based on my experience."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy’s place was absolutely lovely. It was just as described and better. The airbnb looked exactly like the photos and was in walking distance to downtown which has a lot of neat spots to explore. Kathy was very friendly and responsive with anything we needed. It is very clear she takes great pride in her beautiful airbnb, the house rules are clearly written out and very easy to follow. All together this apartment was squeaky clean and comfortable, I will definitely stay again when in the Ann Arbor area. :)"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and the perfect space for 2 people. The apartment is within walking distance to Zingerman's, the farmers' market, and lots of shops and restaurants. Kathy was super responsive to our questions and even made sure we arrived safely. We had a wonderful stay and hope to return in the future!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy's apartment was great - super clean, very comfortable, and walkable to downtown. Would highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay! It was extremely clean and well furnished. The bed was very comfortable and amenities very updated. Kathy was a great host to communicate with, very responsive, and flexible. We definitely recommend this place for anyone traveling to Ann Arbor!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Truly lovely place to stay. Highly recommend! Thank you Kathy!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great accommodations. This is our second time there. It’s very clean, a full kitchen if you want to cook & spacious (loved the shower!). We walked everywhere. AA is one of favorite places to visit."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed here and loved it. Although it was a short stay, it was perfect! That shower was amazing. Parking is easy for my sedan car. Kathy even had snacks for us. The fireplace was perfect for more heating. comfy bed and clean. Thank you again! strongly recommend."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay. It is very clean and quiet. Kathy clearly takes great pride in making sure you’re comfortable. She provided detailed instructions and even checked in during my stay to make sure I had everything I needed. The location is great for getting to U of M and downtown. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was cozy, well appointed, and very comfortable. We were in Ann Arbor for Graduation and it was the perfect spot to walk to Kerrytown and a pretty easy walk to downtown and campus in decent weather. I would highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay and beautiful suite. Less than 10 minute walk to Zingermanns was bonus round.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Near Campus Campus of Annaburg University with great surroundings!Easy to get around, you can cook, there is a supermarket nearby, it is very convenient to buy ingredients, we are not used to eating western food, so it feels great to cook by yourself!It's also very close to the campus. I was going to stay for more days. Later, the room was booked, so I had to move out. I will come back in the future!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great airbnb
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy's place was just as described. The shower is incredible, the bed was comfy and cozy... loved the fireplace and kitchen. We had no issues with parking and Kathy was responsive and checked in on us a few times to make sure we had everything we needed.
If peace and quiet is what you're after, there might be better spots for you due to the nearby railroad tracks/trains and that you can hear any movement from the above apartment, but that wasn't a deal breaker for us and with all the other pluses, we really enjoyed our stay. Kathy even provided earplugs by the bed because she's aware of the noise transfer. There was also a basket with sparkling water, snacks, single use slippers, and tons of information about the local nightlife and hotspots."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay. The neighborhood was great and easily accessible. We have a small child and probably wouldn’t recommend this rental for people with small kids - nothing wrong with the place, just not super kid-friendly. We did have a great time though."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,The parking was not easy to get your car out of. We ended up walking to our event.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best airbnb places I have stayed. It was clean, private, had high quality towels and well equipped kitchen. The bed as well as the sofa was comfortable. The host is super responsive. I stayed here while visiting my daughter and the location was great. Being able to turn on the fireplace when I came home at night and then when I woke up made it super homey."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Kathy was a great host! We felt very comfortable in the airbnb and enjoyed our stay immensely. The La Croix was an extra plus for me! ;)
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy’s Airbnb is amazing. Highly recommended. It is everything the description states. A perfect size, spotless, welcoming and wonderful level of coziness. Thank you for the treats!! A guest previously noted there was no parking, I just want to clarify there is parking in the driveway. Kathy is a gracious host, wanting to ensure guests are happy and comfortable. I will definitely stay at Kathy’s place if I’m ever back in Ann Arbor. Thank you Kathy for sharing your Airbnb with us."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We will comeback for sure! Wonderful responsive host and beautiful place.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is very nice and very clean
The area very safe and the the location is great .
This is my second time to rent Airbnb with sane host Kathy who is very nice and very helpful she responds quickly to my messages .
I definitely will rent again her properties ."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, clean, charming- perfect! This is just what we needed. A peaceful little getaway, we ordered sandwiches from Zingermans and cuddled on the comfy couch while watching a movie, then slept like zombies in the extremely comfortable bed. Tons of lovely little touches and the place is fitted up beautifully, lighting sets a great peaceful mood, washer and dryer tucked away. The shower...!!! Made me start dreaming of finishing our basement but I'd need Kathy's help getting it just right. :)
Bit of a walk to Kerrytown and just be aware there is no parking onsite which Kathy is super up front about. We are happy as can be and will definitely be back...thank you so much for offering such a gem at such a do-able price!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy was responsive and helpful. Great location. Very clean, tidy and well organized."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,A nice location in Ann Arbor. Spacious and cozy
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Kathy was wonderful about checking in with us, and the Airbnb was so clean and welcoming! We recommend and would stay here again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great and perfect to visit our student at U of M. Convenient to bars and restaurants, great communication, nice place—so far one of the bests stays in AA!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fully-furnished separate lower unit with comfortable queen size bed and en suite full bath in ideal location near Kerrytown and UM Hospital campus. Very modern amenities and updates throughout with thoughtful touches like a care package waiting with snacks, water, etc. at check-in. Kathy is also a very responsive host and made sure that I had anything I may have needed during my stay. Would definitely return."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and comfortable, great bed, walking distance to Kerrytown which has some nice shops coffee shops in market. Convenient location just a few minutes drive into Ann Arbor into the university."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved the place! Perfect for our family of four for a weekend in Ann Arbor for Michigan games. Our daughters slept on the comfy sofa bed. The shower is amazing! And Kathy was so helpful with checkin and any questions we had.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host and great Airbnb!! Would absolutely come back, loved my stay here."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy's place was perfect for me -- cute, cozy, and inviting, and a short walk to downtown Ann Arbor. A welcome basket with local information, snacks, drinks, and slippers greeted me when I arrived. I would happily stay there again. At the same time, those sensitive to movement from the floor above (people walking around, showers running) should take note of this."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredible space. Sub level unit that swallows you with cozy comfort.
Communication was prompt and thorough, Kathy is great!
Walkable unit to downtown, you couldn’t ask for more."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this Airbnb, from the elegant bathroom to the user-friendly kitchen, Kathy clearly took time to think about what guests might need - extra towels (including dish towels, which so many Airbnb don't have), ample hooks for wet towels, an umbrella, etc. We found a panini maker (maybe not necessary with Zingerman's an easy walk away but still, a nice touch), extra toiletries, more pillows than we would ever need, and more. The location is good, an easy walk to the Farmer's Market and a longer but still quite manageable walk to campus. We would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy’s apartment was incredibly clean and her communication is fantastic. We didn’t spend much time there but it seemed full of amenities like blankets and kitchen supplies, and the location worked well for going to Main Street and nearby neighborhoods."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Kathy's unit a long time ago in anticipation for this trip. The description is very accurate and what you see is an accurate depiction of the unit. Kathy was a very good communicator. She provided answers to all of our questions. Centrally located right outside of the core of the city we had no problems walking to downtown Ann Arbor. Kathy's unit is very centrally located. There was more than enough toiletries, towels, sheets and other supplies to make our stay as stress free as possible. The washer and dryer also came in very handy.
Lastly, I ran into a situation in which I was put in a precarious position from an older Ann Arbor local who expressed his displeasure that I was in his presence. I was pretty shook. Things were said to me that tjo me were very disrespectful. I called Kathy once I arrived at the unit and she let me vent. She assured me that was not the norm and after a short talk with her the rest of my vacation went extremely well and Kathy's unit had a big part to do with it. She gave me peace of mind as well as a very nice place to stay. I highly reccomend anyone staying in Ann Arbor to look up Kathy and her unit."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I truly have nothing negative to say about Kathy’s place. The unit is adorable and very centralized. It is well appointed and cozy, with new appliances and updated decor. We were very comfortable and enjoyed our time in Ann Arbor."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a clean, cozy, and comfortable unit! Nearby to Kerrytown and convenient to U of M. Well-outfitted kitchen, designer bathroom, comfortable bed. Would happily stay here again and definitely recommend to others looking for accommodations in Ann Arbor."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay. It was a very clean, cute space in walking distance of down town Ann Arbor."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy’s Airbnb in Ann Arbor is absolutely beautiful! It is well-appointed (the best we’ve experienced) and it is warm and welcoming. Kathy is an amazing host, readily available and accessible and a delight. The location is convenient (within walking distance) to Kerrytown, Zingerman’s Deli, and the Farmers Market. The apartment feels like home."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A cute and quaint airbnb. Kathy's place has a well-stocked kitchen and is in a really excellent location. 10-15 minutes walking will get you just about anywhere downtown, even less will get you to Argo Park Canoe and Kayak. Spent just a few days here and will absolutely be coming back again in the future!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 3 enjoyed our stay. Kathy's place is in a great location, convenient to walk to everything. The interior of the unit was beautifully designed. As many called out, the bathroom was especially special. The amenities provided were very well thought out. We were pleasantly surprised by the slippers and bathrobes particularly. Our 8-year-old raved about the side table with charging outlets and the Cheetos :D Kathy was great at communicating with us before, during, and after our trip, making sure our experience is as good as can be."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy’s place is outstanding. My two parents and husband and I (4 people total) stayed in her downstairs unit while visiting my sister, who lives a little north of Kerrytown on the other side of the river. Kathy’s place was the PERFECT home base for our stay. Everything we wanted to do in AA was walkable from the unit (15-20min tops). The couch in the living room (separate from the bedroom) pulls out to a very comfortable air mattress. The kitchen area is very well appointed and was clean and pretty. The bedroom gets very dark at night (thanks to some excellent shades), which is fantastic for light sleepers! There were plenty of fresh towels in the bathroom and the shower is so beautiful and unique. Additionally, there were great snacks and treats waiting for us in the unit plus a nice note from Kathy when we arrived! These thoughtful touches plus a VERY smooth self-check in process and A+ communication every step of the way from Kathy just made our stay absolutely top notch. If you want to stay somewhere that feels like home in AA, look no further than this fantastic place!"

Very comfortable in all respects and was in a great location to walk to all the restaurants and main shopping areas (don’t miss the farmers market!). I would recommend this place and a real thanks to Kathy for all her attention.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little place in Ann Arbor.
Kathy is a super friendly host who responds to queries super fast.
Only took one star off because of how noisy the apartment can be when the upstairs airbnb is rented out - you will hear every conversation and every footstep will sound like the roof is going to collapse."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent accommodations within easy walking distance of the shopping and eating areas of downtown. The quarters were well kept, comfortable, and most importantly cozy. The bathroom was absolutely gorgeous and even had a rain shower head! We will definitely be visiting again!"

2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The high level of pride and care for this property is evident. It is well constructed and appointed with guest comfort and convenience in mind. Kathy was extremely attentive if we needed anything. Otherwise check in and out and communications were very efficient and seamless. Well located. Fair priced. Due to the fact the apartment is on the lower level, we did have some issues with temperature regulation and some sounds from upper floor. Kathy was very responsive in addressing these issues."

All in all, this was a lovely AirBnB. Kathy was also a fantastic communicator. From the time we first made our reservation through our stay, she responded kindly and quickly whenever we had questions. While we did not experience any problems during our stay, I feel confident she would've been responsive if we had."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location... lovely accommodations. And Kathy provided a gift basket!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place has great amenities and the host is nice and responsive but there is a few things to note:
-you don’t have a thermostat. You have to text the host and tell them what you want the air set to and they change it remotely. There is a fireplace in the living room.
-this is a finished basement. There is a dehumidifier that the host asks you empty yourself if you are staying more than one day and they want you to run it while you are gone.
-there is off street parking however it is very tight. If you have a truck you might not be able to get back there. I had a hard time.
-there is a unit above you, the noise from it woke me up and kept me up before my alarm went off but they mention that in the description as an issue so I already knew about that going into it.
Good things about it are the host is super responsive. The bed and bedding were comfortable. They use nice paper goods which I always appreciate. There’s even 2 bath robes which I appreciate. The interior design is really bad but that’s whatever lol at least the things are quality.
I’m not sure I would stay here again but there’s nothing wrong with the place, I just don’t like staying in basements and the minor annoyances I have trouble not caring about.
Super nice host! The price is reasonable!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful accommodations and location. We appreciated the extra little touches...heated towel rack, coffee pot and coffee, great shower! We will be back!"

2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location of this place is EXCELLENT. It was a very easy walk downtown to all of the restaurants / bars and to the Stadium. Also, it was very clean. The one down side is that the apartment is in the basement of an older house, so you can hear everything from the people living upstairs (walking, talking, music, etc)."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great private place to stay in Kerrytown with all the amenities you could need! Kathy was a responsive host and everything went very smoothly with checking in and out. It’s about a 25 min walk to UM so would recommend driving if you plan to go to campus everyday.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Kathy's Air B and B is exactly as described, maybe a bit better. Wonderful shower and the kitchen has everything one needs to cook. Loved everything. Kathy is truly a Super Host! Suggestions for visitors: Ann Arbor is hilly and many driveways dip quickly into the street. Watch your speed as you leave the drive as your car may scrape the pavement."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! It was very clean and was a great place to stay! I can tell that the owners took extra time to make us feel welcome! They even had a gift basket there! I would highly recommend this place!

I would go back again, the host was very nice and the place was designed/ decorated really well. Everything you need was provided, from extra blankets to utensils to shampoo. It is located in the basement of a house, but it doesn’t feel like a basement at all, it feels like a newly renovated apartment. The entrance is separate and the host gives good instructions about checking in! Overall a great experience and I’m so glad I chose this listing!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean an nice space! Kathy is very helpful an has great communication.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is a gem! My husband and I had an excellent experience with Kathy's place! The location is amazing, the neighborhood is very safe and quiet (except for the occasional train as it close to tracks) and it's a ten minute walk to all that downtown Ann Arbor has to offer. Also close to some great parks along the Huron River. The apartment was very comfortable, the bedroom got nice and dark and the bathroom was beautiful with a large shower. I'm kind of a clean freak and I was completely comfortable at this place. Everything smelled great and felt clean. I would 100% stay here again. Thanks Kathy!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy’s place is great - immaculately clean, very conveniently located, and stocked with anything you might need. Kathy was easy to communicate with, and check in and check out were both very easy. Highly recommend."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy was highly responsive from the start, from parking accommodations to adjusting the temperature. The welcome package and magazines for guests was an excellent touch. The instructions set around the rooms were helpful in clarifying expectations and where everything was stored. Also, the walk to Kerrytown and downtown were close enough that I never needed to drive anywhere."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy's place was so clean and so nice to come back to after a long day of running and kayaking in Ann arbor. The location of the house was perfect walking distance to Kerrytown and all the great dining options there. We loved the beautiful bathroom, good coffee and comfy bed. Kathy was an amazing host and really went the extra mile to make sure we were happy with our stay. All the snacks were nice too!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathy's place was very nice and in a wonderful location.
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very clean, well furnished, and an easy walk to Main St and UMich. The kitchen was particularly useful for meals. As the description mentions this is on the lower level and there may be noise from above. Overall a good value for a private space."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, as advertised. Easy access to a beautiful walking/running/biking trail along the river, and also just a short walk to downtown/Main Street. It was wonderful to be able to walk to get lunch at Zingerman’s, and dinner at a wide selection of Ann Arbor’s best restaurants.
The apartment was very clean, and modernly renovated. It matched the pictures exactly. There were many conveniences provided: clean towels, bath robes, light snacks, and coffee. It was also nice to be able to do laundry, if necessary.
The check in process was a breeze.
Overall, Kathy’s apartment is a great value."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Extremely beautiful apartment, very clean with wonderful amenities. Great location and value, easy check-in, Kathy was tremendously communicative - we had no issues but I'm sure she would have been on top of anything that came up. Would absolutely stay again!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy's place was perfect for a quick overnight for Michigan's graduation. It is in a great location, easy to access, adorable, and clean. I forgot my Kindle (fell asleep with it in the big comfy bed) and she contacted me the next day before I left town so I was able to go back and get it. Now that is service!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Kathy's place was awesome for a host of reasons. Kathy communicated immediately during our 8 day stay and the description was accurate and pointed out some things that normally might be left out. The space was more than comfortable for 2 people, although I think 4 might be a stretch. The kitchen was very well equipped and the counter and stools comfortable for eating -- and we cooked 2 meals on most day. The ""living room"" was equally comfortable and nicely warmed up on several very cold nights by a gas faux fireplace in front of the sofa. The separate bedroom was highlighted by a very comfortable bed, super important to us, especially on a longer than one or two night stay. The bathroom was very clean and spacious, generously stocked with towels, with a Greek-style walk in shower that we loved. We want to get a towel warmer for our house after seeing the one in the apartment. And last, but not least, the location can't be beat in AA, especially with no car, within walking distance (as described in the listing) of the Kerrytown market (the best chowders at Monahan's Fish Market that I've every had), downtown, the U and even Argo nature reserve. We'd highly recommend Kathy's place and will come back in a heartbeat on our next visit to AA."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy's place is very nice. It is clean, comfortable, and the shower is amazing! We had a great stay!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting our 93 year old mom after 14 months of isolation. She lives independently but is connected to assisted living so visiting there was limited. We picked her up each day and spent a LOT of time in the apartment (since covid rates in MI were spiking) and found it very comfortable. We cooked all meals in and the kitchen was well equipped - much better than most Airbnb’s. Comfortable beds, responsive host. BUT if you DO went to get out and about, it’s a terrific location. Easy walk to Kerrytown and downtown, as well as quick access to bike/ped paths along the Huron River."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, cozy, and stylish space close to downtown restaurants and shops. Would definitely stay here again!"

2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Kathy's place was clean and close enough down town we could walk. The only down side of the unit was the temperature control was controlled for the whole house and the guest have no direct control of it in the basement which was quite chilly. With that being said though Kathy was quick to respond and adjust the temp for us and make it warmer so very good host on that!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathy's place is beautiful and in a great location! Kathy was very helpful and easy to communicate with. I would definitely stay here again!

The apartment is very comfortable, and full of thoughtful touches - robes and slippers, lots of snacks - that we weren’t expecting. The kitchen was fully stocked with spices and herbs, which was really convenient for cooking. The location is absolutely brilliant! Tons of great restaurants, cafes, breweries, and the University were all easily walkable. Kathy was a great host, super responsive and was even flexible on our check out time. We would absolutely recommend this place, and will certainly be staying here again when passing through Ann Arbor in the future!"

Highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best Airbnb stays I’ve ever had. The home was beautiful, equipped with anything you could possibly need. It was right by Michigans campus, but removed enough to not feel caught up in the energy. The restaurants in walking distance were so cute!
The hosts were immediately responsive, and even left delicious pastries for us at check in. We wish we were staying longer!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb is definitively one of the nicest that I've ever stayed at. The beds were firm and comfortable, the amenities were top notch. And the brownies and coffee they left for us was, well the brownie was amazing. I'm not much of a coffee drinker.
It is walkable to a few places but for the most part a drive would be necessary to go to restaurants and other activities. The porch and upstairs living room were definitely the highlight of the space. I highly recommend this spot for anyone wanting a relaxing space in Ann Arbor."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best booking I have done on AirBnB so far! Josh and his co-host were excellent to me and while I didn't physically see them, they left us welcome gifts and responded quickly to any questions I had. They blew all my expectations of AirBnBs out of the water and I now have a higher standard to expect from future BnBs."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here, and are already thinking about renting for next christmas. My parents and sister kept commenting on how much they liked the house. The house looks smaller from the outside, but we were blown away with spacious it was on the inside!! Also the hosts are great with communication. Overall it was great stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family has traveled and relocated several times over my 25 years in the military; which required us to live in a number of Airbnbs, and many other types of lodging all over the country, including a few locations outside the US.
This home is incredibly clean, and relaxing. The hosts are just amazing!! Their level of hospitality was something rare to find. I can’t speak enough on how wonderful Josh and Cat are; they make you feel like friends from the start.
They have also done a great job considering the needs of their visitors who are on travel!
We would stay here anytime we come to the area!"

It was clean and cozy and we enjoyed every minute spent there! We will definitely be back. Thanks again Josh and Cat for the great stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house many many updates. Cozy mcm in a nice neighborhood. I can’t wait to revisit this place and many will like the layout and serenity. The one downside imo is that there were no window coverings. Aside from that, everything that you need is right here. Right here in Ann Arbor."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Lisa's beautiful home in Ann Arbor in mid February (which is winter in Michigan) and we were completely satisfied with the comfortable room (with dedicated bath), and the convenient neighborhood where we could visit a relative, accomplish the business we traveled for, and enjoy restaurants and live jazz music nearby. We would love to stay again, perhaps in warmer seasons and would definitely choose Lisa's home.
The house is a well maintained, charming older home in a quiet neighborhood of charming and eclectic homes. The upstairs bedroom itself was nice: clean, calmly decorated and we could change the heat although we didn't need to do that. The description and photos are accurate. The bathroom was modern (heated tile floor?) and attractively designed. We are generally quiet guests and our hostess and her son were not intrusive. Frankie the dog was cute. We spent some time walking around the friendly neighborhood after our long drive and we enjoyed it. A positive time."

I was so tired when I got to her place and it was such a treat to be staying in a home that was so clean, comfortable, and spacious. She was truly generous with the amenities she provided for my stay and I had absolutely everything I needed. She was communicative, kind, and accommodating. I was actually sad to be leaving so soon (was only staying for one night before flying back to NYC)! The value for the price of this place is unbeatable and if I come to Ann Arbor again I will definitely be booking with her for another stay!"

I will definitely be checking this place’s availability first on any future trips to Ann Arbor."

The upstairs bedroom is huge, with a high vaulted ceiling, as well as ceiling fan and air conditioner/ heater. It has a private bathroom as well, with a deep bathtub. It's very quiet at night too.
Lisa is super responsive and kind and has lived in Ann Arbor since the 70s! She's interested in getting to know her guests. The house is full of plants and has great natural light. Even though there are other Airbnb guests and Lisa lives on site, I still felt I had a lot of privacy.

Her place is relaxed and very nice and located in a green leafy neighborhood outside of the center of Ann Arbor but within easy walking distance to the center of town (about 35 ninutes). We stayed in two different rooms, the upstairs room was larger and roomier and the bathroom was across a little hall; the downstairs room was smaller. Both have a very comfortable two-persons bed and a separate bed for a third person or two children. Lisa's set-up gives you your own refrigerator, water cooker and coffeemaker, and she provides coffee and tea. Depending on the COVID situation, she allows you to use the kitchen if you wear a mask, and also there is a great garden and back deck. We did this without a car, and rented bikes from Campus Student Bike Shop at 336 Maynard and Lisa's house was then 10-15 minutes biking to all of downtown. She also let us store the bikes overnight in her garage. Highly recommended."

It's a quite street, as well as house, which backs up to some nice woods with walking paths one could enjoy in nice weather (snow during my stay). The house has a nice character, the room is spacious and has good amenities inc. personal AC/heat unit, and the bathroom is nice too, especially the heated floors. Lisa was accommodating, providing a nice folding table to work on when I mentioned needing a desk, offered me garage space to store bikes, and granted a 1hr late check out to work around an appt.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second time staying at Lisa's. I enjoyed my time there so much the first time that I immediately rebooked during my first stay when I knew I would be great. Great amenities and close to Downtown Ann Arbor. I walked everywhere and it was totally fine.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a super cute, clean, and quiet home in a wonderful neighborhood. I give it the HIGHEST recommendation and will be sure to stay here again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Lisa's place was great! This particular room is in the second floor which you pretty much have to your own and a private bathroom next door. The room was spacious and there's a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker to your disposal. I didn't have a car, so needed a place that was walkable to UMich (30 mins) and Downtown (20 mins). Would definitely stay here again (which I will next week)!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place to stay in Ann Arbor. Walkable to everything. Made for a perfect graduation weekend! Will definitely come back.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cynthia was quite kind and responsive. There was a problem regarding the code for the building but she responded quite quickly and we had no problem getting in the unit. A great location in Ann Arbor!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying at Cynthia’s place. It’s now a favorite! The location is ideal for downtown activities and easy access to the University. It’s very comfortable, and Cynthia is super easy to communicate with and responsive."

2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Centrally located and near tons of coffee shops and restaurants. Inside amenities were minimal.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Cynthia's! It will be our new ""go to"" place when in Ann Arbor. It is a great location, clean, comfortable and better than the photos. I was a bit worried it would be too small and cramped from the photos, but it isn't at all. Space is really well used, and the kitchen and bathroom are well stocked. Highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,awesome place!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cynthia's place is an outstanding downtown loft. Its big windows look down at the center of one of America's best college towns, with great restaurants, shops, and the University of Michigan's central campus within easy walking distance. The loft, moreover, is certainly the best furnished Airbnb rental I have ever stayed in. Not only are the appliances and fittings high-end, but the furniture is an eclectic mix of old and new selected with taste and care. The recently-renovated building is quiet and secure."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had a great stay in this beautiful apartment. You couldn't ask for a better location to experience the restaurants, shopping, and night life in Ann Arbor."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying here for work. It was walking distance to restaurants, shops, and work spaces. The unit has a desk with extra monitors which was perfect for work. Cynthia was very helpful and quick to responded. I’ll be staying here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great for our needs. We are here for the race and it ran directly by the balcony. Nice treat. Also the windows open over the street. Which contains great restaurants and music. The lighting system was high tech with dimmers on all and remotes for them. We didn’t watch the TV but it looked nice. They have done a great job on their remodel. Those are all the positive things I have to share. Definitely would stay again. Oh the host was very quick with response on any questions I had. Thank you Michigan our 49th state to visit.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was exactly as described. Great location with plenty of people, shops and restaurants nearby. Host was very responsive. Easy check-in."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot to take in all of what Ann Arbor has to offer! Right in the center of Main Street. Able to walk campus - truly a perfect location! Cynthia was very responsive and helped us find parking. Will definitely be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cynthia's place was the BEST airbnb I have stayed at in Ann Arbor. The location was incredible with a gorgeous view out the window/on the rooftop patio. In addition, the apartment had awesome amenities with dyson fans and the peloton."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was an absolute gem! We were walkable from tons of stores, bars, restaurants and parking garages. We were less than a mile from the stadium. The upstairs deck is amazing and the apartment itself is very comfortable, clean, and has everything you might need. Bring your workout shoes as she has two pelotons - a tread and a bike! There’s also laundry which was great to freshen up our stuff during our trip. Thank you for a great stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice stay! It is located in the heart of Ann Arbor's downtown, everything is within walking distance. The place and amenities matched the description, it is a decent size apartment for 2-3 people with a spacious living room, cozy rooftop patio, and a great window view. The host was very friendly, responded fast, and was very helpful when we had questions about the stay or the area! The place was clean and had everything we needed. One downside is that this location has no dedicated parking spot but there are multiple garage parking locations that were free over the weekend and had open gates, our host helped us locate some of them. We highly recommend this location if you are planning to spend your time in downtown of Ann Arbor."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, convenient, and in a great location. Would definitely stay at Cynthia's again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You could not ask for a better location!! Walkable distance to all the shopping and dining you could ask for. The apartment was nicely furnished and had an amazing view. We stayed for two nights just to explore Ann Arbor in the summer, and this was the perfect getaway for my husband and I. The spiral staircase to the rooftop patio was a super fun way to enjoy the beautiful view and hear all the bustling going on below. We will come back again!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t hesitate to book your stay here! Beautiful views of Ann Arbor, and very clean and neat unit."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, near lots of bars and restaurants. The apartment itself was perfect in terms of amenities. Also, had a nice workstation and a small gym set up which was very handy. Host was responsive and proactive in her communication. Will use again in the future!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent apartment. Clean. Spacious. Walkable area. But construction now on all surrounding streets makes access and parking tricky. And a LOT of construction noise starting very early before dawn. Not ideal for sleeping.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location right in the middle of downtown Ann Arbor! The location is super walkable, lots of restaurants nearby, and a quick walk to campus. The condo was gorgeous. Amazing sunsets from the rooftop deck!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment in the heart of downtown Ann Arbor. You couldn’t choose a better location. Great view and furniture. I gave it 4 stars because it should have been cleaner and I had to go get sugar for my coffee. There was a lack of basic amenities that is expected, i.e there was only salt in the unit and the bedding could have been nicer.
But, overall it was a fine place to stay."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We love Ann Arbor and we couldn’t have had a better place to enjoy it. The Peloton equipment was a nice touch too! It was a beautiful, spacious space location in the middle of all the eateries. We very much want to return if we are lucky."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful space, great location!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great price for a great location. Everything we needed was right at our fingertips. Vegan options within walking distance. Great shops, great ambiance! I highly recommend Cynthia's place, perfect for 2 people, great secure location, and has great amenities. I'm sure it will be my first choice if it's available next time I'm in town to visit family. The weather was brutally cold so we parked in the lot right there, a better option was a few feet away across the street ($5 a day) but I didn't know that until the last day. Cynthia did give recommendations on parking but I didn't research it very well, she recommended the lot basically attached and a parking structure a block or so away... we wanted to be as close to the door as possible since we were in from California. I wish we could have enjoyed the rooftop deck, guess we will have to come back in the warmer months to take advantage of that! Great first experience with an Airbnb!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice location and comfortable setting… everything we wanted
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place. Definitely will always try to stay here when visiting Ann Arbor.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very nice and conveniently located place. Coffeeshop just downstairs is the icing on the cake.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cynthia’s condo is in the perfect location - steps from everything in downtown Ann Arbor. The condo itself was immaculate and modern and to our surprise included extras like a Peloton bike and treadmill and Dyson fans in both the living and bedrooms. It was nice to unwind in the evening and have access to cable and streaming channels. The bed was really comfortable and the bedding was nice and cozy. We couldn’t recommend this property more, and Cynthia was also a great host. We can’t wait to come back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location is perfect. Right in the middle of anything you might need. Everything is in walking distance.
The apartment/condo is gorgeous and very tidy with everything we needed.
Pro tip: eat at Frita Batidos. It’s amazing and I wish we had one in Cleveland!
Parking was a bit hairy but that’s kind of what to expect when in the city. We paid to park in the lot behind the building and it was slightly expensive but worth it being so close to the car if we happened to need it."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location on campus. Beautiful apartment. Clean. Easy check in.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great location. There were lots of places to eat and super easy to find. The place itself was very clean and comfortable. We will be staying there again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time visiting Michigan. I came up to run the Ann Arbor Marathon and it was in great walking distance (only 10 min on foot). The location was placed perfectly in the heart of everything… restaurants, bars,the university and etc. On top of that the views from the roof top entrance from the spiral staircase was a perfect way to end the evening. Don’t feel like running a marathon? There is a Peloton inside!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was fantastic! Perfect location, we were able to walk to the big house for a football game, the diag, and all the restaurants and bars downtown. The roof deck was amazing!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredible find! Went into town for a the weekend to go to a game and the location could not be better. Walking distance to everything and literally steps to multiple strips of bars and restaurants. A manageable 20-25 mins walk to the stadium. The space itself is awesome. Well stocked with everything you would need in the kitchen and bathroom. Roof deck was great to hang out on before heading out. Host was accommodating of our slightly early arrival and was a quick responder. Was exactly what we were looking for. Highly recommended!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you! Was a perfect place to stay for a perfect weekend:)
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve been coming from Oregon to Ann Arbor for a couple of football games each year for over a decade. This is the first time we’ve ever stayed in downtown Ann Arbor and it was like an entirely different experience! The unit was so perfectly located and it made everything about our trip so easy. Along with the convenience factor, we particularly liked the rooftop deck. Highly recommend this well equipped unit in the heart of downtown!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place in the heart of downtown Ann Arbor! Full of lots of tech extras (the light switches were especially fun). One word of warning, carefully investigate the street parking rules as they are a little different than we were used to. I got a ticket before I figured them out!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, well-lit space in the center of town with a great view. Can't ask for more!"

2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely recommend this condo! The location is fantastic next to many restaurants and shops.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a truly delightful space. The roof deck is very fun. Everything is clean and uncluttered. You cannot beat the location. The kitchen is new and nice. Everything works beautifully. There’s a great work space and even peloton bike and treadmill and free weights in the apartment. The bed is comfortable and there’s a very nice new washer and dryer. It’s really an unbelievably nice air bnb for the price. Perfect for a couple. The manager is very responsive. There’s an easy keypad lock system and the building feels secure and is pretty quiet given the location n downtown Ann Arbor.

Great apartment set up! Great artwork in the rooms!
Very responsive hostess!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was fantastic! It was well-stocked and clean. The only issue (not worth docking a star over for sure) was that it was BOILING hot. It was late when we got in, and I didn’t want to bother Nina, but we couldn’t turn the heat down. I’m literally always cold, but we woke up in puddles of sweat! Otherwise it was perfect—cute and comfy beds, perfect location, quieter than I was expecting!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nina's Tranquil Farmhouse was the PERFECT place to stay on our trip to Ann Arbor. It is centrally located in walking distance to literally everything—especially Kerrytown, the Farmer's Market, and Zingerman's! It is beautifully decorated and appointed with thoughtful touches throughout. The space was very comfortable for me, my husband, and our two children. Nina was timely and communicative whenever we needed anything. I highly recommend staying there and look forward to our next visit!!"

Definitely would come back to stay again!
Q"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed in Nina's home while visiting my son at the University of Michigan for his performance at the Power Center for the Performing Arts. We could not be happier with our stay! The home is so conveniently located that we could walk everywhere we wanted to go. When we did decide to drive, it was literally minutes to get anywhere we needed to be on campus. We enjoyed being steps away from the Kerrytown shops and Farmer's Market area. The home itself was super clean and very spacious! Nina was a fabulous host and gave extremely clear instructions on everything we needed to know before we even arrived, and was easy to contact when we were in need of a flexible check in time. We appreciated the way the rooms were divided and the curtain separating the living area from the dining area. We did not need to use the couch bed but the curtain was a nice addition to make it feel more private if needed. We will definitely be staying here again in the future!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stylish home in a great location. Will definitely stay there again
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here! It was perfect for our family of 4. The house was immaculate, which is always extremely important to me.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed here with friends and we loved the location of this place! It’s only a short walk away from everything. Three of us stayed here but you could definitely fit 4 or 5 people. I would definitely recommend staying at this place! :)

As mentioned in signs in kitchen, need to be careful with food as there were ants that came out if you left out anything. We just stored everything in the fridge.
The beds were cozy and nice. It was warm and not noisy even though on street level. Overall a nice place to stay in Ann Arbor."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful spacious place in perfect location. Very responsive host! Water pressure not great in shower but other than that, perfect stay! I would stay here again for sure."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Cosy quiet and central. Some nice touches.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect location for our short stay in Ann Arbor. Three minute walk to Zingerman’s, and very close to Central campus and downtown Ann Arbor. We were pleasantly surprised by how spacious our unit was. The photos do not do it justice!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nina’s place is in an amazing location right in the heart of Kerrytown with lots within walking distance. Decent amount of space inside plus a nice little patio to sit in the sun. Would recommend.
Warning on the bathroom/shower - zero water pressure in the shower (basically a dribble) & hot water was instantly scalding hot and could burn easily."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place if I could of stayed. Had to cancel, but Nina was very understanding."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, I recommend it to others"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,As advertised! Great location. Thoughtful and responsive host
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place especially for UMich parents visiting their college kids. We were able to walk to most locations and across the street is the farmer's market and adjacent market and coffee house which was just lovely and convinent. The place was comfortable and spacious and Nina the host was so accessible and very helpful with our check in and check out requests. We will stay here again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nina's apartment was a fantastic place for our group of four to stay while we were at a conference at the University of Michigan. Nina had clearly been very thoughtful about the decor, with original artwork by a local artist and other design accents like pillows coordinating with the art's color palette. Besides being tasteful, the furniture was very comfortable--I slept in the extra-comfy king-sized bed, and my friends took the two single beds in the other bedroom and the sofa-bed in the living area and we all slept well. The apartment was a good size for all of us being there together. The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed. There was a very comfortable dining area for us to all have breakfast together. The bathroom had lovely original tile, a hairdrier, and plenty of towels and toiletries. Nina had thought of providing some nice extras like earplugs, coffee and tea, and clorox wipes. The location next to the Kerrytown shops couldn't have been better. It was only steps away from beloved Zingerman's Deli, where we got coffee and amazing pastries every morning. The apartment was spotless, quiet, and easy to get into using the lockbox. Overall we were thrilled with our stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at Nina's beautiful guesthouse. The beds were very comfortable and the location was incredibly convenient. Our family of five had an excellent time and we recommend the property to other families with young kids.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect weekend! Next time in town we will look here first for availability.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Nina’s place was the perfect stay to get a restful night’s sleep after a long day of travel. Best part was waking up and getting yummy breakfast so quick at the farmers market right across the street!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little cottage in a great location. Really enjoyed our stay!
2022-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"At the right price, we would stay at Tranquil Farmhouse again. It is a walker’s paradise immediately next to Ann Arbor’s farmers market and it was a place where we and our rented bikes could stay for a 24-hour “tourist in your own town” visit. The room darkening shades served great and the self-check-in was a breeze.
At the $281 price we paid ($159 + $75 cleaning + $33 service + 14 tax), it was a bit disappointing to have the building fire alarms in some other unit go off two times after 11:20 p.m., when we had tried to observe the posted 10:00 p.m. noise curfew. We appreciated that Nina comped us $10 after that night and after our discovering a roach on our bedroom carpet in the morning.
While there was no health concern in the unit, we were glad that we’re covid freaks and had brought our own Coway HEPA filter – it took some of the cleaning chemicals (and maybe some long ago marijuana?) out of the air in the time that we were there.
As the profile acknowledges and as other reviewers have said, the water pressure and toilet draining speed was in the low range that you would expect for 180-year-old house. But it was adequate for the purposes of the two of us. We would stay again if the out-the-door price was $150 / night."
2022-08-01,3,Stayed one night,Gorgeous updated place close to many neat areas of Ann Arbor including the Main st area recently closed to traffic with music and food every Thursday night. Bed is SOOOOO comfortable.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great location in historic Kerrytown. Thanks for having us.
2022-08-01,3,Stayed with kids,Great location for Ann Arbor stay
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a very comfortable stay for the two nights we were in Ann Arbor. We especially loved the super-comfy beds (both the king & twins) and the perfect walkable location. It feels like it's tucked away from the busy streets just enough to give privacy (loved the cute little patio). Of course, as one would expect with such a convenient location in the city, there is understandably some noise (from upstairs tenant, and early morning trash truck), but earplugs were thoughtfully provided by the host and the noise really wasn't a big deal given how comfortable we were otherwise. The nice design of the window shades allowed sunlight in while maintaining privacy and at night the black out curtains were helpful. Shampoo and conditioner provided were salon-grade (thank you Nina!). Bathroom, including tub & shower curtain were very clean, which we greatly appreciated. The tub had great water flow from faucet, but just wish that the hand-held shower wand would have had more pressure. The decorations are beautiful and so the carpet throughout, which is showing its age, could stand to be replaced to match the beauty of the rest of the decor. One safety issue that guests should be aware of is that the hot water is scaldingly hot (this warning is provided in the check-in info) but also be aware that while showering, if someone flushes the toilet, you can get potentially be burned by the water because the cold water is diverted to the toilet. Overall a wonderful stay and we would love to return again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, accommodation, and hosts. Such a wonderfully charming place - will be back next time we visit A2!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I thought the place was lovely, but I had to plunge the toilet the first time I used it. The water pressure in the shower was almost non existent. The windows were dirty and cobwebs, kinda made looking outside at the beautiful area a little harder. For 250.00 per night I think those things should be addressed. I did enjoy my stay however."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect Ann Arbor location for walking to almost everything connected with Ann Arbor!!! We spent Sun-Th at Tranquil Farmhouse in August 2022 chosen for its proximity to Zingermans Deli and Kerrytown. The apartment was spacious for the 2 of us, kitchen and bathroom stocked with plenty of essentials (including plush towels). Comfortable furniture and beds, 3 window air conditioners that kept the place cool enough we needed to turn them down at times! (A welcome respite from the summer heat) We chose this specific place for the 2 bedrooms, kitchen, living room, dining room space. Very satisfied."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,LOVED the adorable farmhouse! Amazing location. So much fun and great outdoor space for lounging.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great location to Zingerman’s , small shops and wine/Market. Good size for a family of 4 to adventure in for a few days."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,we loved the area. we were in town for a wedding. we were within walking distance. Ann arbor Street fair was going on we walked around. we went to the farmers market and breakfast at keeryyown shops. great location
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice location! There is farmer’s market on Wednesday from 7 so if you want to visit make sure to plan well (we didn’t know so lefy at 8, thought we managed to visit some stalls that opened early).
Homey vibe, I liked how there is a room with two beds, which was very convenient for my family’s sleeping arrangements (2 twin beds, 1 big bed (king/queen size?), 1 sofabed)."
2022-07-01,4,Group trip,The place was very nicely located and served our purpose perfectly.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,The tranquil farmhouse was in an excellent location and comfortable. Directions for parking and check-in were precise and easy. We'll be back the next time we are traveling through Ann Arbor.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cool spot to stay in Ann Arbor. We enjoyed the farmers’ market, the shops, the restaurants, walking, walking, and more walking. We particular enjoyed sitting on the patio watching the activity at the farmers’ market and on the street. Such a comfortable stay. Would love to be able to come back and stay at the “Tranquil Farmhouse” again!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great place, clean and safe. Great location"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Exactly as advertised.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nina’s place is comfortable and conducive to hanging out. The bed is comfortable, the kitchen is great if you want to cook, and it was very quiet. Even better, you can’t beat the location. You have access to Ann Arbor, and everything is a one to fifteen minute walk. Two thumb’s up."

2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay at the guesthouse. It was super clean, and thoughtfully decorated. The bed was comfortable and all of the amenities were easily accessible.

Thank you Nina!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the nicest AirBnBs we’ve stayed in. So many thoughtful amenities (lots of fluffy towels, coffee creamer, Q-tips!), extra comfy bed, perfect location. Great communication and easy check-in and -out."

2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nina's place was in a great location, convenient to shops and dining and close to downtown as well. My son was auditioning at UM and we enjoyed our stay!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is starting to be our go to place when visiting AA. It’s our second time in the house and we loved it for all the same reasons we did before: fabulous location, well appointed and relaxing environment."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,My co workers and I stayed at Nina's place when we travelled to Ann Arbor for business. Nina's place was very comfortable and had all the essentials we needed. the house was also close to restaurants which was convenient. Nina communicated everything in details too. I definitely recommend Nina's place.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! You cannot beat the location and the bed is really comfortable. Nina was great and flexible. We will definitely be back if we are ever in Ann Arbor again!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely first floor apartment in downtown Ann Arbor. This listing was clean, quiet and comfortable. There was a well equipped kitchen and also a designated off street parking. We also appreciated the contactless check in and check out. Happy to recommend to other Airbnbers."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location and proximity to campus, comfortable bed and lodging!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful and lives up to its name. This tranquil farmhouse is full of artfully decorated charm and super cozy! Walking distance to everything you could want or need including an awesome yarn store and farmers market across the street! Main Street is just a couple blocks away and there are tons of stores to explore along the way. Will definitely stay here again next time we are in Ann Arbor!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing artful place to stay!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this property and wish we had discovered it sooner! We will definitely recommend it to our friends.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,super cute location in ann arbor! check in/out process was easy. only stayed for one night but there was plenty of room for 4 people.
2021-10-01,3,Group trip,"Nina was very nice, responsive, and accommodating as a host. Her Airbnb is in a good location for exploring Ann Arbor - it’s right by Zingermans and a 15 minute walk from campus. While the property comfortably fit all 6 of us, it was not the cleanest/most up to date place. We felt like the apartment had a bit of a mildewy smell and some guests’ allergies acted up because of dust. The bathroom is also not updated and doesn’t feel well kept. That said, the kitchen is updated and stocked with basic needs which we appreciated. Depending on the purpose of your visit this could be a good place to stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Woke up to the Ann Arbor Farmer’s Market on our doorstep. Easy walk to all the shops and restaurants in downtown Ann Arbor. Easy parking. Two comfortable bedrooms, a cozy living room, a homey kitchen, and a reading room/dining room."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as advertised, clean, and welcoming. The location is ideal and the space is lovely."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a delightful home away from home in the heart of Ann Arbor. Everything is an easy walk away and very convenient, but it’s very peaceful and quiet. Easy access, free parking, and Zingermans is just around the corner. What could be better?"
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very nice place in an excellent location. The beds were all very comfortable and the communication with the host was great. There were lots of little perks, such as soap, shampoo, etc lots of soft towels and even eggs, bread and orange juice for a quick breakfast! Very thoughtful."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"location .... location ... location! If you are on the ground floor you can hear the residents upstairs if they are noisy. However given the age of the home, that is expected. Still gave it 5 stars."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"10/10 location in Kerrytown. The place had plenty of room for me and my partner to work. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook nightly. We really enjoyed our stay here.
One thing to be aware of is that the ceilings are thin. If the people staying upstairs are loud, you’ll hear it."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Nina was so easy to communicate with and the stay was excellent! The location was right in the heart of Kerrytown and made everything super accessible!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was born and raised in Ann Arbor and this was such a treat to call home for a few days. Highly recommended! Close to so many fun things to do!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Central location to restaurants and to the university. Cost comfortable clean house.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Location can't be beat. The unit was comfortable with very comfortable beds. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. the only reason I didn't give 5 stars was they did have a cable technician there on my second day and that was kind of annoying. Other than that it was great.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here so much! We easily walked to local eateries, farmer’s market, and unique shopping from this location. Beautiful potted plants, flowers, bird baths, and Nina’s colorful artwork were found throughout the property. The Concert Hall next door filled the air with amazing jazz music one evening. Hiking and Matthei Botanical Gardens nearby- highly recommend! Susan, the property manager, was quick to respond if we had any questions. This was a trip with my mom and daughter- 3 generations and this location fit us all! We will miss it!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nina’s ‘farmhouse’ was very comfortable, tastefully appointed, and in a great location to appreciate Ann Arbor’s downtown amenities. Check in was easy and communication was good. I would definitely stay there again, and hope to be able to do so!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nina and Susan took great care of us. There was a pack and play as well as a high chair for our toddler, and he had plenty of room to roam. Excellent location across from Kerrytown as well as downtown Ann Arbor."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Just stayed one night and enjoyed the space. Was great location and had what we needed to relax after exploring the town.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay with a stylish interior and excellent location for walking around town! The building is older, but charming."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay here. If you have the opportunity to stay here, take it. Nina and Susan are thoughtful and responsive. The place is cute, comfortable, and clean, and the location can’t be beat. We loved seeing Nina’s artwork on the walls. The kitchen was really nice and well appointed. We hope to return some day!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A perfect Ann Arbor location, in the heart of Kerrytown, next to the farmers market, Zingermans, cafes, shops, and a short and beautiful walk to campus. The apartment was spacious, spotless, and full of thoughtful touches which made us feel so welcome. An absolutely wonderful stay, can't wait to come back!"
2021-06-01,5,,Location is great for access to lots of restaurants and shopping. Easy to find. Well-appointed and charming.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We are a family of five and booked this for a Father’sDay getaway. My children loved the place! They asked if we could live there lol. The garden outside was absolutely beautiful. The location was perfect. There was even a farmer’s market across the street Saturday. We would absolutely stay here again!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great central location. We enjoyed our stay.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nina was very helpful and reached out to me about a parking question before my stay. Susan was also very responsive and helped with the check-in process. Great property as well.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and comfortable digs to tour Michigan campus! Would recommend.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a lovely time at Nina’s. The location can’t be beat and the house is cozy and well cared for.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nina was a wonderful host. She was very attentive and responsive. The guesthouse was very clean. The location could not be beat!! Walkable to all shops and restaurants!! Literally the perfect location!! The floors are very thin though and there is a tenent below and a guesthouse above. We also accidentally left are car unlocked overnight in the lot and someone did rummage through it. So be sure to lock your vehicle. Overall it was a great place and the host went above and beyond!!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were in Ann Arbor for a day. This listing was perfect for us: very clean, very pleasant and great location. Thanks!!!!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What's not to love about this place. Susan and Nina are amazing hosts. The location is within walking distance of U of MI and so many local shops and restaurants. And the house had some many lovely unique touches. We felt right at home
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. This guest house is in the perfect location for exploring Ann Arbor for a college trip with our daughter. The beds were super comfortable and the house had great style. I would recommend this property for your visit to Ann Arbor and Go Blue!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Quaint place in Kerrytown. It is old but has a comfortable farmhouse feel. Kitchen was well stocked and enjoyed walking around Ann Arbor. Is close to shops and restaurants. There is a rental on the 2nd floor which may or may not affect the noise level (renter had a dog with them when I was there). Overall, comfortable and would give 4 out of 5 stars for location and comfort."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely adored our time spent the Farmhouse. As we are moving to the area we utilized the place as a jumping off pint each day and it always felt like home when we returned.
Situated near the heart of the city, we were never too far from any of our destinations. While we took advantage of the local cuisine when we just needed to chill, the kitchen provided every amenity to make a home-cooked meal.
We would recommend this home to anyone visiting Ann Arbor."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charming house. Can’t beat the location. Nina and Susan were very accommodating with the big snowstorm.
2021-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This cute apartment is in the perfect location in Kerrytown. The hosts have thought of everything in terms of amenities— lots of cooking supplies, make up removal pads, earplugs, extra towels, etc. The art and decor was the best I’ve had in an air bnb. Everything was just so cute and well-curated. I kept taking photos for inspiration for my own apartment :)
The blackout curtains in the bedroom really work— it was great at night. During the day there is tons of natural light. The side entrance is also wheelchair and stroller accessible.
Sometimes the people at the hair salon next to the apartment swipe the assigned parking space, but we were able to park on the street or a lot nearby when that happened.
The floors are quite creaky so you can hear the people above you (and I tried not to bounce around at night for fear of bothering the man who lives below the unit). The water vacillates between hot & cold pretty rapidly so it takes time to fiddle with the knobs to get it right.
Also, the cleaning lady comes right at 11am for checkout, so make sure you don’t dawdle. We were running late because of our toddler, which is classic, and the cleaning ladies were standing outside in the cold waiting for us to run out the door."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect. Everything I had hoped for, and more. Quiet and comfortable and located right in the heart of the City."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is an adorable guesthouse in the perfect location. The host was very nice and helpful. She even provided a pack n play for our baby! We would love to come back.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay! Location in the heart of Kerrytown is only one of the best features. The place is clean and wonderfully decorated! Could not have asked for a better place to stay.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Within walking distance of anything in Ann Arbor. House in general is quite nice. Very pleased.
2020-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nina's place is in a fantastic location, right in the middle of kerrytown with shops across the street. We walked everywhere and loved it. The apartment is very nicely decorated and arranged and we were quite comfortable. The memory foam king room with black out shades was wonderful. I slept better than at home! It was raining the day after we arrived so Susan dropped off umbrellas which was so appreciated. My sister is in an electric wheelchair and was able to visit since there are no steps to enter (although the bathroom is not handicapped accessible, ie not bars or raised seat but that was okay for us)
However, the place is smaller than I expected and really is an apartment while I was expecting a ""farmhouse"". We had neighbors upstairs and downstairs and could hear them walking around on the creaky floors at 1am and talking (muffled) but otherwise the airbnb neighbors weren't a problem, thank goodness. The other thing is we didn't have control over the thermostat. Susan has the unenviable job of keeping all apartments happy with a single thermostat setting. We rarely, if ever, were granted our requested temperature. We were charged $195/night which was too high considering the challenges but if you really want the location, then I think it'd be worth something close to that."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Well thought out layout. Helpful notes throughout.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in a great location
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and convenient with onsite parking.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had booked one night here in the middle of a longer trip north, and a night on our way back home. How nice to so look forward to what we thought might just be a place to sleep while road-weary. Everything you need in a well-designed, comfortable space. Beautiful artwork!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place excellent location
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"A perfect place to spend a night in the middle of a long car trip. So perfect we’ll stay again on our way home. 30 minutes after we arrived, dinner from Zingerman’s was on the table, so there’s also that!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous location and exactly as expected! Hope to stay here again!
2020-10-01,5,,This is THE best place to stay in Ann Arbor. Perfect location. Gracious host. Quick response if you need something. Stylish and homey at once. Book it. You won’t be sorry.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and amenities.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent location. Nina's place gave us a nice taste of Ann Arbor. All went well and we didn't have any issues during our one night stay.
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,Great location and place
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"One of the best I've stayed at! Great location, comfortable, cute.... I will be staying again for sure! If this is open on your dates, don't hesitate, book!"
2020-10-01,5,,This house is in a great location! There are many restaurants and shops that are walkable. Nina was very responsive and the house had everything we needed (and then some!).
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The location was great and the directions for parking were very clear. We also enjoyed the original artwork. We would highly recommend this place for an Ann Arbor visit.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Easy, Clean, Cute in the heart of Ann Arbor"
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,I had a great stay at Ninas guest house in Ann Arbor! The location was excellent and in walking distance of downtown spots. Would recommend booking your stay here!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place! We really enjoyed our stay and had a lovely weekend in Ann Arbor with our baby! Thanks for hosting us, Nina!"
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location - we walked our biked everywhere and the AMAZING farmer’s market is directly across the street. Very old home but comfortable. No fan in the bathroom made it a little less than ideal.
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,Our stay here was fabulous. A great location !!!Every detail has been thought of - eclectic and comfy!!! We plan to stay here again!!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great guesthouse with really nice furnitures. The host and manager are really kind and helpful. And there’s wonderful paintings.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect location and is super charming and comfortable. The host was very responsive. Everything was immaculate and modern. No tv in the bedroom was my partners only complaint, but there is plenty to do in the area to not need that."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place just two blocks from Zingerman's deli. Bed was super comfortable. Place was quiet and restful. We were here in summer during pandemic so town was pretty quiet.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location right in the heart of Kerrytown and an easy walk to both campus and Main Street. Guesthouse was clean and spacious and had everything you would need for a weekend stay.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was fantastic. The location was perfect, the place was very well decorated, was spotless, and had all of the amenities we needed. Stylish, comfortable, clean, and unique. We would love to stay here again!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I value clear communication, and I got that consistently from Nina and Susan. The place could not possibly be in a better location, and I had a wonderful stay."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"This little farmhouse was full of character and made our stay in Ann Arbor feel very authentic. The location couldn’t be better. Inside the house is simple yet full of character, from the eye-catching artwork to the tasteful furniture. Enough space to socialize and enjoy privacy when it’s time to sleep. Ann Arbor is one of my favorite places in the whole world, a very special town for me, and farmhouse is so classically Ann Arbor. So thankful we had the chance to experience the farmhouse."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, clean place in a great location next to Kerrytown and the Farmers Market."
2020-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Such a cute place and great communication!! Highly recommend!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, easy walk to shops and food. The hosts were easy to communicate with and left detailed instructions about check in prior to leaving for our trip so everything went smoothly. The place is super cute and quiet (except for 7am trash pick up on Monday mornings which is obviously out of their control but still a bummer.) The kitchen was well appointed. I would definitely return and recommend it."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Good location and well kept. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farmhouse is a charming and contemporary design, old and new mixed together. Everything is new and great condition. The locatin can't be beat, I loved everything being in walking distance. We requested a very late check out and they worked with us to accomodate it, helped me with the lockbox and the heat. Thanks Susan and Nina"
2020-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The location is ideal, right across from the Kerrytown shops and an easy walk to Zingerman’s and most anything downtown. The house is rustic, though comfortable and stylishly decorated. You will have upstairs and downstairs neighbors and you will likely hear them."
2020-02-01,4,Stayed about a week,"This charming guest house is ideally located and well appointed. There are plenty of dining and shopping options steps away and the location is quite convenient to Main St and the university. Be aware that it is located on a fairly busy street with guests both upstairs and downstairs. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen and bathrooms are well supplied. We experienced some issues with sudden and intense fluctuations of water temperature in the shower which we were told is due to the age of the plumbing. The owner/host offered to move us to a more modern rental which, though we didn’t accept her kind accommodation, was very hospitable."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Location is great for Ann Arbor. You can walk to great restaurants, like Zingermans. There is a small grocery store right across the street. In the warmer months, there is a farmers market right outside your door."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful. You can't beat this location. It's close to Farmers market and ahopping. The house was very quaint and comfortable. We appreciated the full kitchen and coffee as well as Netflix and beautiful artwork. Thank you!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can't beat the location - in the heart of Kerrytown and literally steps from the Farmer's Market. It was so easy to walk across to get groceries, simply prepared food and most other things we needed during our stay. The host was super responsive and helpful with local information. The only mild inconvenience was that the thermostat is controlled remotely as it is connected to the upstairs unit and set at 75 in the evening and early morning. It would get warm so we had to open up windows. Definitely not a dealbreaker but bring cool clothes for lounging around inside. I would stay here again."
2019-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay if you’re coming to Ann Arbor for a weekend. Walking proximity to pretty much everything in town including the University. My coworkers and I chose to stay here while we filmed over the weekend. Having the parking spot in the back is very helpful and keys to enter from either side was a nice add too. Will suggest this spot to friends and family in the future.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Nina's place, and it was consistent with the first time, excellent. Great location, apartment, hospitality. It would be hard to beat in Ann Arbor..."
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"Such a beautiful space to spend a few days. The artful touches, and original artwork on the walls, made it especially lovely. A terrific location with so many places to walk to: shopping, coffee, restaurants. Really loved this place and recommend it."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place to stay! Super cute and easy to walk to things! Loved the space!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Amazing host and place. Highly recommended!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Lovely space in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood. Maria is warm/friendly and responded to our request immediately. I will at Maria’s during my next visit.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kyler’s place was spotless clean when I arrived. The apartment is cosy and is as described on the listing. Kyler is an extremely responsive host (I believe he wrote back in 5 minutes or so). The apt is located in a quiet residential area, about 30 mins walk to restaurants etc. I don’t know Ann Arbor much but the neighborhood also felt safe. Check in/ check out was very easy."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very cozy place with nice neighborhood
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place. Enjoyed my stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,My wife and ten-year son spend a weak in Kyler's place. We had a lovely time. The place is cozy and very well located. Kyler was welcoming and responsive. We would love to come back.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,2nd year I've stayed here. We even added a third sibling this year and it worked ok! It's an easy walk into downtown. The shower is fabulous. We ate several meals in the kitchen/dining area. Kyler and Maria responded in 5 minutes or less to our occasional request. And always had what we needed. It's squeaky clean and feels like home.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location that was a short distance to downtown. It was a cold and snowy weekend, so we either drove or got a ride share, otherwise it would be walkable to places like Jefferson Market and Union Rec.
Cozy, simple and had everything we needed."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Such wonderful hosts! They were flexible with our check in and the space was just as described. Very clean and the neighborhood was lovely.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little apartment...super clean
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cool place near Ann Arbor downtown. It’s a 5 minute drive to downtown area which was great for us and our small weekend trip. The neighborhood was great too. Definitely recommend this place when visiting Ann Arbor.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super helpful hosts and a great place to stay for our trip. Close to downtown and easy/comfortable set-up.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cozy space to stay in beautiful quiet neighborhood…would 100% recommend!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Really cozy spot in a great location. Had a really nice stay, would definitely return!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kyler and Maria have a beautiful AirBnB. It is a clean and very comfortable place. The location is also great in the Old West Side (a beautiful walking neighborhood) and a 10-min walk to downtown. Kyler and Maria are both very responsive. We have stayed in their place multiple times and would highly recommend it to anyone!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was as described and it worked out well for us. We enjoyed being able to walk to town and the football stadium. We would stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"super easy, fast communication, thanks for a great stay in ann arbor. we loved your place!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely apartment located in a great neighbourhood. A 20 min walk downtown, even closer to the big house.
Apartment was clean, bed was super comfortable. Hosts answered questions promptly and were accommodating.
You can hear noise from their house below but it was nothing bothersome."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very good place , host is great"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kyler's place is in a peaceful neighborhood that was also close enough that we could walk to downtown and the UM campus. We enjoyed a meal at The Jefferson Market, and Argus Farm Stop was both fun to visit and a good place to get food for breakfast. We were visiting family who lived nearby, so we didn't cook anything beyond breakfast, but the kitchen was just as pictured in the photos."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cozy bedroom, nice kitchen, clean bathroom, and a decently big living room with TV. Same/better price and value than a hotel but muchhh closer to UMich. Would definitely stay again!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very pleased with the place. Would love to stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kyler was very proactive and responsive to texts via AirBnB app. I told him we would likely be arriving late so he said he would leave the light on for us. Little did we know after a 4.5 hr flight delay and 1.5 hr wait at the rental car counter, just how welcome that light being on was at almost 4am when we finally got in. Cute place. It is a converted attic so be mindful if you’re significantly taller than 6 feet because of the sloped ceiling in the bedroom."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Incredible location for those looking to enjoy all Ann Arbor has to offer. We had an amazing trip staying at Kyler’s place, with quick walking access to downtown for dining and shopping, and easy walk back from the Big House after enjoying some Michigan Football. Would absolutely stay here again, we hope to soon!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the stay very much.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a first time visit to Ann Arbor and I felt like we couldn't have picked a better location. The neighborhood was very quiet and relaxing. Parking was never an issue and it was an easy walk to downtown and the football stadium. Felt safe walking and everyone we encountered was very friendly, even though we were opposing football fans! :)
We easily were able to control the temperature and used the kitchen a few times. The space was very clean and the bed was comfortable. If we ever came back, I would book again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A really cute place in a nice neighborhood! Check in was easy and the place had great WiFi. My partner and I stayed and we were both able to video call/wfh. No problems!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place in a nice quiet neighborhood. It's close to downtown and walkable to almost anything you might want to go to. The apartment is clean, cute, and cozy with plenty of space. As others have noted, there's a full flight of stairs up to the unit, something to be aware of if mobility is an issue. Also, for tall people, the bedroom and living room both have lower than average slanted ceilings. This is shown in the photos and wasn't an issue for me, but for some it might be. I would definitely stay there again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This really is a charming place with everything you could possibly need for a very pleasant stay including a very comfy bed. It's a delightful space, quiet, in a lovely location and walkable to downtown, parks, restaurants or just an enjoyable walk in the neighborhood. We'd be happy to stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kyler and Maria were great hosts. We had a storm and the power went out for two days. And they did there very best to make sure we were all right. AAA++ rating for friendliness and flexibility and we loved the place.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The house was so cute! It was perfect for my daughter and I. It was very clean and comfortable. The location was great for the art fair. We were close enough to walk, but far enough away that there was plenty of parking. The hosts were also very responsive. I would stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely space in a gorgeous quiet neighborhood which is close to two parks; felt safe walking anywhere, downtown and around U of M campus. Very cozy place that left us well rested."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for an event at U of M. The proximity to campus was convenient as we were back and forth several times a day from campus to the apartment. The area is safe, walkable, with ample street parking. The apartment is upstairs with a separate entrance. It was quiet and we had our privacy. I had a couple of questions at check in which were promptly answered. The unit was very clean. It’s best suited for three people. Our teen fit perfectly on the futon bed. It was nearly 90 during our stay. With the window air conditioning and array of fans the unit stayed cool and a comfortable temperature. Kitchen had everything we needed to prepare simple meals. The tv is available, but requires a guest to use their own streaming services. We don’t have tv at home so it’s always fun to watch movies when we travel. We are definitely in the minority on this one. We would stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place! Great host! I highly recommend it!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect for a solo traveler or for a couple. We were in town for a wedding and would gladly stay here again. Very charming, with all the amenities we would want. Excellent location too!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is cozy and clean. Roomier than we expected. Kyler and Maria are excellent hosts.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Best Airbnb I have stayed at! Very clean and at home feel. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. Walkable to downtown AA and the big house. Ten min drive to grocery stores. Maria and Kyler are excellent hosts. Very friendly. Will definitely be back again!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was in town for a few days for a conference at UM and Kyler's place was the perfect location for walking to campus and just far enough away for it to be quiet and peaceful. There were tons of great places to eat/drink within walking distance as well. The unit was clean and well-appointed and the bed was super comfortable. Loved the thoughtful touch of the Keurig for morning coffee. Would highly recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a two people. Easy walk into downtown. Quiet old west side neighborhood. Shower was excellent.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay while visiting my daughter at the university.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much for your quick responses when we were confused about the door entry. You helped us get in right away and it was very helpful!
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very quaint and clean in great neighborhood. Easy street parking.
Only note is that it is on 2nd floor with exterior stairs. Hosts did a great job to keep clean/free of ice but might be difficult to access if mobility is an issue."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've been staying at a few places around AA to try and find a spot to stay - and Kyler's place made me fall in love with the Old West Side! Interesting space but comfortable and exactly what I needed for a short stay by myself.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, very clean, well-stocked with extra sheets pillows etc, check-in very straightforward, hosts are friendly and responsive.
Only issue was that acccessing the unit requires you go up a set of UNLIT stairs. In the evenings I circumvented this issue most of the time using the phone flashlight but this was especially an issue on check-out where I had to descend an unlit staircase with suitcase in tow.
Location about 15 minutes from town, definitely walkable but would not describe as central."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, clean and comfortable apartment. Nice quiet neighborhood 15 min walk downtown, 8 min from convenience store and a few restaurants."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"It was the perfect apartment for me for my week working on the UM campus - very convenient, very well designed, clean and had the essentials. Kyler and Maria were very helpful and responsive hosts. Great place!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kyler’s place is lovely & clean & warm. It was our second time visiting and I would book Kyler’s place again next time Im in town if the place is available. It’s located in quiet neighbourhood with downtown couple of minutes away, and kitchen being fully equipped."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying in this airbnb. The bed was comfy and everything was clean and cozy. The pictures don't do the space justice. We will definitely be back when we are in town next.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place in a lovely neighborhood.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of our best AirBnB experiences. Lovely apartment with very cozy and charming feel..the location cannot be beat. Truly felt like a local neighborhood vibe but a short walk to the stadium and extremely convenient to campus. If we return, no question we will try to book this place again."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kyler’s place was fantastic! Walking distance to campus with a couple of places even closer (market, cafe, etc.). The place itself was great and Kyler was an incredibly helpful host. Would absolutely stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Maria and Kyler's. The apartment is on the second floor of their family home on a beautiful residential block on the Old West Side. It was warm, comfortable, and had everything we needed. We appreciated all of the extra supplies that were provided just in case. They were friendly and checked in with us once in a while but otherwise gave us our space. Check in/out was easy and there is plenty of street parking directly in front of the house. If you are looking for a super-modern space, this is not that. But if you appreciate the traditional homes on the OWS and want a cozy home experience that is walkable to downtown and the campus, this is perfect. Highly recommend."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice quiet neighborhood to stay in, about a 15-20 minute walk from downtown. Clean with a comfy bed. Not too expensive. Plenty of room to stretch out, make a little food, and relax."

Kyler and Maria are fabulous hosts, and I hope their apartment is available whenever I come back to Ann Arbor."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely quaint stay in a quiet and beautiful family-filled neighborhood. The weather was great for opening the windows at night to let in the breeze.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great listing, will definitely be back"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,We stayed for a week and really enjoyed it. It was a pretty great location (near a park and easy access to downtown) and a comfortable place to be.

A cute space with everything you need and the location is great because it is close enough to downtown to walk but far enough to be quiet and private and outside of campus shenanigans. Bless 🙏.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! So glad to get the chance to stay at their home for a short stay. Their space has a super serene aura and the neighborhood is so interesting. Everything was well thought out along with being neat, tidy and very clean. Beds were very comfortable and the environment so peaceful. The view out the window alone makes you feel like you're really away. The hosts were super nice, responsive and accommodating."

I would definitely go back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful relaxing stay at Ro and Oksana’s place. Lovely decor and thoughtful touches made this stay extra special. Also they had tasteful landscaping that was in bloom for spring. We hope to stay again so we can explore the near by parks more!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a quick, one-night stay at Ro and Oksana's. Everything was as described, the place was very clean and comfortable and had everything we needed. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here longer -- it would be a great place to use as a home base for a longer stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is such a nice stay , I recommend if you can at least find one night to book do it. Instruction were very clear and host let me know asap as well as left me with a contact number if I needed to reach.

I love this little getaway joy . The host did amazing with this and I will be booking again . Thank you ."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This rental looks like it was designed and decorated by an architectural artist. Everything was new, like we were the first guests. Beautiful artwork, everything you need in utensils and furnishings, and for me, it's important that the bathroom was right outside the bedroom. A separate office, a dishwasher and a washer and dryer in the unit, and the surroundings were beautiful with nice woods walking trails a stone's throw away. Great restaurants and shopping and Planet Fitness nearby. It would be easy to live there long term. Definitely 5 stars on everything."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was great, comfortable and clean!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing getaway experience we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of wine which we were not expecting.We felt right at home.

The space was immaculate, they offered toiletries, fresh towels, dishes and light snacks and everything you need to make yourself at home away from home.
We will be back!
Thank you!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was lovely staying here and they are fantastic hosts! I really appreciated the kindness they showed when we met in person (I went to their door to deliver a package that was right outside my front door). I would love to stay here again next time I’m in Ann Arbor.

We hope to come back."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed at many rentals over the years, but I don't think any of them were as well furnished and stocked as this place. You could pretty much bring your clothes and move in for an extended stay. If we need to stay in Ann Arbor again, I'll check here first."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's clear our hosts Ro and Oksana put a lot of thought and care into making the place functional, comfortable, and welcoming. The rooms were very clean. The furniture and appliances were conveniently placed, and the kitchen was kindly stocked with snacks, drinks, and coffee. It's now one of our favorite places to stay here in Ann Arbor."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Best AirBnB we’ve stayed in. The hosts were amazing. They were very attentive and responsive. The location was great, quiet and beautiful surroundings. Close to downtown Ann Arbor as well as groceries and restaurants (short drive). The finishes were well thought out and high quality. Towels were super soft, bedding was very soft and it was well heated with the weather being so cold out. Even the toilet paper was high quality. The unit was well equipped, I was able to make Thanksgiving dinner with no issues. We would absolutely stay again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts thought of all the little details that make an Air bnb experience so great, not to mention all the necessary amenities. Felt quite at home in this clean and welcoming space."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can’t say enough about this Airbnb and the hosts. Will def be back.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! It was very peaceful and quiet: the property is on a hill surrounded by trees with a great view. The house itself was very clean and bright with great decor. We loved all the thoughtful touches of the extra toiletries and towels, as well as the snack and wine basket. Check out was very easy. The owners were very responsive and even made a bed on the couch for our son which we really appreciated. Would be happy to stay here again :)."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very comfortable apartment in a lovely wooded neighborhood. I don’t remember feeling so at home on a trip. The bed was comfy and place is calming and clean. It’s also easy to find this place and so easy to get to Ann Arbor destinations, so glad we the had opportunity to stay here."

We were very warmly welcomed and the communication was very good at all times. We loved all the amenities we found in the apartment. Everything was perfect. Ann Arbor is worth a trip and we highly recommend the apartment. We thank our hosts for this great time."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have never seen a nicer Airbnb before! 😍 everything was lovingly designed down to the last detail and Oksana and Romaikel are wonderful hosts!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderfully secluded location surrounded by old growth trees in an upscale, woodsy neighborhood. The flat is a conversion of the lower floor of a nice house which is built into a hillside so it isn't like a basement. It's newly remodled and well furnished with all the needed utensils and functioning appliances. It is not walkable to downtown or to any shopping area. You would really need a car. The hosts live upstairs, they're very quiet. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was very nice. It was clean and well taken care of. Well furnished with little welcoming extras. Ro and Oksana were welcoming and friendly but were unobtrusive. Lots of privacy and the settings was gorgeous. Would definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, clean apartment in a quiet neighborhood near Dolph Park. We had everything we needed. Grateful."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay! Beautiful & peaceful location nearby Ann Arbor. Ro & Oksana we’re proactive & helpful with their communication & the place looked great when we got there.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect stay and getaway for two. So tranquil, serene, and nicely appointed. We immediately felt at home. We both repeated multiple times during our stay, ""We could live here "". So comfortable, cute and the natural setting with squirrels, butterflies and cardinals was a great way to relax in the morning with coffee and tea. The bottle of wine and snacks that greeted us was a first at any Airbnb we've stayed at and definitely hit the spot; certainly A+. The location is ideal for getting in, around, and out of AA. #GoBlue. But the pièce de résistance was the hosts' friendliness, helpfulness, and willingness make our stay just what we needed and wanted. And also not a lot of rules; not that we are opposed to those but very clear, simple, and sensible rules we kinda LOVED that too. It would be hard to find better hosts or stay in Ann Arbor in our opinion. If TEN stars were an option we would give it. When we come back to AA, this will be first on our list. Thanks, Ro and Oksana."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There are many special touches to this Airb&b. Creative folding of linens, wine, water and snacks upon your arrival, great coffee and toiletries you may have forgotten. The place is quiet and has peaceful and mindful appointments. The wooded lot is tranquil. The hosts were very responsive and gave great restaurant advise. Overall a 5star experience."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful apartment setting in the woods, but also a short drive to downtown. We truly enjoyed our stay and all of the help and responsiveness from our hoists during our stay. We look forward to a return trip!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We LOVED Ro And Oksana’s Airbnb! So much attention to detail in this beautiful place.
Very well stocked with anything you could ever want during your stay. We especially appreciated the bottle of wine and fresh coffee which we enjoyed on the covered patio. The setting is so peaceful with many huge trees and shade. We were also very impressed with how immaculate every room was in this Airbnb. The colors and decor are also a plus. Communication and questions were answered quickly as well. We are looking forward to visiting again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Not an exaggeration to say there's an up-north feel to the property. You are free to begin every day with a beautiful walking-distance hike through a woodsy area & come back for breakfast or a quick jaunt to 19 Drips for coffee. Your next decision is whether you want to visit Argo Park for water sports activities (kayaks for rent or bring your own water tubes or paddleboards) OR move on to the next level hiking spot (Maybury State Park 1/2 hour drive) OR spend the rest of the day enjoying downtown Ann Arbor cultural street life -- great food, street performers, botiques, bookstores, bars, U of M campus museums. And finally, the lodging itself -- perfect for 2 or 3 people. Kitchen set-up was 100% intuitive and well-stocked with pots, pans, dishes, tin foil, coffee/coffee maker, etc. Storage/hangers, laundry facilities ample + the open-air porch for evening relaxing and reading. We are considering a fall-color stay with our gracious, hospitable hosts Oksana and Ro."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed almost two weeks. This is a lovely apartment in a very quiet neighborhood. It was modern and extremely clean.
Oksana was very helpful.
We hope to stay here again.
Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ro and Oksana were great! We've stayed there before, so we rebooked during a different season so that we could experience summer there. It's a beautiful location that is surrounded by trees and simply lovely greenery.
We came in during an uncharacteristic storm and Ro and Oksana worked with us to try and mitigate the impact on our stay. We appreciated all their help and communication. They promptly worked to help us find the best solutions to issues that were out of all of our control. They are great hosts!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay was great - the space, location, and communication. The neighborhood is pretty with lots of trees and foliage and we sat in the front area in the morning. The place had everything we needed for a short stay and it was easy to get anywhere in the city from the Airbnb. Nice artwork and furniture and we had what we needed in the kitchen. The communication with our hosts was fantastic - thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely stay! Very comfortable and easy to get to downtown Ann Arbor from the house.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was exactly as described in a very nice neighborhood. Very close to the highway and downtown. Very clean and comfortable as well.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oksana and Ro were wonderful hosts. I really appreciated the details - snacks, water, and bottle of wine - to welcome us after a long trip. The place is very well designed, cozy, and clean, with all the basic necessities for a family. We felt at home immediately.
The location is also quite beautiful with walking/running trails nearby. It is peaceful and quiet, but also very near restaurants and cafes and with close access to I-94.
We experienced a storm during our stay that resulted in a power outage for many parts of the city. Our hosts were responsive and proactive to ensure that we had power, keeping the generator constantly going and checking in with us. We did have to end the stay prematurely due to the outage, but these hosts were so helpful in providing options for us in a situation entirely beyond anyone’s control.
I would definitely recommend this place and these hosts to anyone visiting Ann Arbor."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was even better than expected. Everything listed was provided plus a few extras! Super clean, easy to check-in and out, and the hosts were very responsive, friendly, and understanding. We loved how quiet the house and neighborhood were and enjoyed the nature areas nearby.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place and great location. We arrived early but were not able to get in the place yet. Ro and Oksana worked hard to make sure we were able to check in early, it just showed how responsive they were to our needs. Thank you again! Beautiful place!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay. Stylish, clean, modern place in a lovely, peaceful neighborhood. We loved using the walking paths near the lake. Highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This might have been my favorite stay yet. The pictures of the place are accurate but still don’t do the gorgeous scenery of the neighborhood justice. So peaceful and tucked away yet still so close to everything we wanted to do. The home had everything we needed and was very welcoming. We cannot wait to visit Ann Arbor again. Thank you so much for our stay. ❤️
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and quiet place to stay! Ro ad Oksana were responsive and thoughtful!

This is the best Airbnb I have stayed at."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ro was very helpful and attentive and easy to communicate with. Sitting on the front porch area for coffee/tea in the morning and taking walks in the lovely, nature-filled neighborhood ---made this a very special spot to stay in."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to unwind after touring local universities. Quiet, calm, comfortable. House had everything we needed and more- coffee, tea, snacks, comfortable bedrooms and a very chill living room to unwind in. Everything was spotless and plenty of linens. We will definitely be back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best AirBnBs we have stayed at. The rooms are exactly as pictured, very clean and organized, stocked with everything you need. Very thoughtful extras - snacks, a bottle of wine, even slippers and bathrobes. The neighborhood and nearby nature area make a peaceful environment. There is a little deck to sit outside which I wished we could have taken advantage of, but it was still too cold. We were visiting friends and family so were mostly out and about; they are just 10 min away from the university so it was very convenient. Ro and Oksana were very responsive hosts, accommodating with our late check in and early morning check out needs, and we felt very welcomed. Highly recommend this rental if you are visiting Ann Arbor."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home is in a very cute residential neighborhood, very woodsy and quiet. The apartment is beautiful and is the most well appointed with the most amenities we’ve ever had at an Airbnb. The welcome basket was such a nice touch and we had plenty of blankets and pillows and towels.
The hosts were very communicative, proactive, and responsive. The check-in and check-out process was easy.
The location could not be beat for our tour of UofM and exploring Ann Arbor.
We look forward to renting from Ro and Oksana again in the future."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My best stay yet, in beautiful Ann Arbor. Ro and Oksana’s place was absolutely perfect. The rental unit was spotless, cozy, and beautifully updated. The peaceful surroundings were an added bonus. I loved drinking my coffee on the comfy couch while staring out at the wooded setting. Ro and Oksana have outdid themselves in creating the perfect home away from home. The added bottle of wine and basket of goodies was a generous touch. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be returning."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a fantastic, restful place to stay. Great responsive hosts that messaged me multiple times to check in. Gave lots of local recommendations and were very accommodating. Would definitely recommend."

The neighborhood is beautiful, and so perfectly located to restaurants and shopping in Ann Arbor and Chelsea. The apartment was just wonderful, so thoughtfully furnished, comfortable and pristine. It felt like home. I almost wish I hadn't had things to do while I was in town, just so I could relax in the apartment. Ro and Oksana, thank you so much for your hospitality. I am already looking forward to staying next time I come to Ann Arbor."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was great and as described. Our family of 4 stayed comfortably (we had a 1 year old and brought our own crib). Ro and Oksana were very responsive. Would definitely recommend.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would stay here again! It was spotless and they thought of everything. It is in the bottom floor of a home, but we never ran into the hosts except when we were greeted with a key during check in. We rarely heard noise from the hosts upstairs except for some kind of appliance that kept us up at night for a short time at bed time. Wouldn’t be a problem if you’re not a light sleeper.. and one of the many things they supplied were some earplugs in the closet! Host gave lots of restaurant recommendations.. our personal favorite was Anna’s House. Overall it was a great stay and I wouldn’t hesitate to book if we are ever in Ann Arbor again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was the perfect place for us to stay during a week of house hunting in Ann Arbor. Ro and Oksana’s place is a master class in how to be an exceptional host. Every room was spotless, thoughtfully appointed, and full of useful amenities without being cluttered. The neighborhood is a short and easy drive to other parts of Ann Arbor, and parking is very easy. Wifi was fast and reliable. Sometimes we heard muffled sounds of talking or guitar playing from upstairs during hours when we were awake, but this didn’t bother us. Highly recommended!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely quiet place with friendly people.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ro and Oksana's place was the perfect spot for a short writing retreat! We had easy access to lots of good food and had all the amenities we needed to feel at home.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ro and Oksana’s apartment was perfect for our trip to Ann Arbor. It was easy to find, and when the bad weather on our drive made us very late they were so flexible and helpful with us arriving much later than we had expected to. The apartment was clean, comfortable and with so many nice little touches, from pairs of slippers to a bottle of wine. I hope I can stay here again when I’m in town!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have booked several AirBnbs and this one was the best experience thus far! The apartment was beautiful, private, and had amazing scenery. I couldn’t ask for a better time. Thank you Ro and Oksana!!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ro was an amazing host, very responsive before and after my reservation
I wanted a late check-out and he was so kind to make it possible,
The neighborhood is so peaceful and quiet, this place is good as a getaways from the busy downtown, the apartment had everything a person needs from kitchen, bathroom, living room, bedroom and a study room, and all looked as it is brand new
Altho I booked it in January meaning it is winter but I’m so sure rest of the year this place would be gorgeous with the green surroundings
I definitely recommend this place
It is a hidden gem in Ann Arbor"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great stay! The area is very pretty, and it's a nice place to go for a walk to see the lake. The gift basket was a super nice touch, and everything was truly spotless when we arrived. We gave advance notice to our arrival and it was nice and cozy when we stepped in. They offer a nice selection of cleaning products, laundry detergent, etc to save you a few trips as well. I was grateful!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Ro and Oksana’s place was wonderful. It was quiet, peaceful, clean, and comfortable. I really enjoyed being there. It was a great place to stay while I was in town for work. I highly recommend it."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a really very nice, modern designed apartment with new furnishings, in which there is nothing missing. The surrounding area is very quiet and you can take nice little hikes. By car, you can also get to the city center of Ann Arbor very quickly. Ro gave us all the necessary information at check-in."

Very close to bus route, but it is also walkable to the Uni.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lovely place and just the right size! It had everything we needed (and hadn't even thought of!) and all was well organized and tastefully placed. It had a relaxing setting that was just tucked away enough. If you're looking for a peaceful, relaxing stay, yet conveniently close to great grocery stores, charming towns and lots of dinning diversity, then this is he place! =)"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment with all amenities…even laundry facilities. Very clean, lots of space…could easily live there!"

The location is great. Very quiet and close to nature, but you are also super fast in e.g. Downtown. The Airbnb is super suitable for longer stays. Nothing is missing and is furnished with a lot of love for detail. Should I travel to Ann Arbor again, I will definitely try to stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this place was just perfect! The communication with Oksana & Romaikel was nice and easy. Both are so lovely and caring, we felt extremely comfortable at the whole time.

For us it was one the best AirBnB experiences we ever had."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I'll echo what so many of the other reviewers say. The apartment is beautifully decorated, comfortable, and quite functional. It has everything you'll need for a short stay including a full kitchen and in-unit laundry. One of the bedrooms was set up as an office making it perfect for the ""work from home"" days. The neighborhood is well established with tons of trees and nicely landscaped yards. It's conveniently located to just about everything you'll want to do in Ann Arbor without being stuck in the thick of things on game days. The hosts were very friendly and not intrusive. Always happy to answer a question and acted with a sense of urgency when issues arose. In our case, we only encountered 2 problems: one turned out to be an area-wide internet outage; and the other was a minor issue with the TV streaming service. We'll definitely consider staying here again on future visits to Ann Arbor. Book early... this place is popular."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A truly beautiful Airbnb! We loved the house and the neighborhood--a wonderful example of mid-century modern architecture tucked away in a lovely wooded area. Ro was a wonderful host and the apartment had everything we needed and more! We also loved that it was so close to Zingerman's, one of Ann Arbor's best places for brunch."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Oksana and Ro are the perfect hosts. The apartment was perfect and as described. I was taking a few days for a mom working vacation and the desk area was great to set up my mobile office. Great location in a quiet wooded neighborhood and one of my favorite places I’ve stayed!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment served us perfectly for our visit to Ann Arbor and graduation weekend. It is situated close to campus (short drive) in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. The apartment is bright, clean, and modern and has everything you might need and then some in a well-organized space. Spacious living area, comfortable beds, great shower, work desk, kitchen with all amenities. Would definitely return. A favorite of our Airbnb stays!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous location! Nice set up. Very serene and beautiful. Hosts super nice and communicative. Had a great experience.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As a family, we travel and use AirBnb a lot. By far, Oksana and Ro's place is one of the best places we have ever stayed. They think of all the little details to make the guests feel at home. Nothing is missing in the house. The kitchen is well stocked (coffee, tea, sugar, milk, spices, salt, pepper, oil, cleaning supplies, paper goods, etc). Oksana and Ro welcomed us with a bottle of wine, a tray with a variety of snacks, juices, water and soda in the fridge. The bathroom has everything you need. If you forgot something, they have it. The rooms and beds are comfortable. The house is extremely clean (very important for us); furniture and appliances are all new. Great decor, neutral and pleasant. Washer and dryer inside the house, very convenient for longer stays. We stayed for a week and felt like a home-away-from-home.
It's about 10-13 minutes from downtown Ann Arbor by car. The neighborhood is quiet. Multiple supermarkets, pharmacies, etc closeby.
This place is perfect and we hope to stay here again when visiting AA. We highly recommend to anyone travelling to the area, you will not regret.
The communication with the host was great. We ended up taking the keys of the house with us by mistake when we checked-out. The hosts were very polite and nice about it even though it caused them a huge inconvenience of having to change the door locks in prep for their next guest. Thank you so much Ro and Oksana!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay. The place was clean, cute, and airy (we loved all the windows and the nice swing outside). The location was great (about a 10 min or less drive to everywhere we wanted to go: a quick/easy 5 to 10 min to downtown Ann Arbor and to a few breweries right outside downtown). We also loved the neighborhood. Everyone was so nice and welcoming and we (and our 2 yr old son) enjoyed walking around the streets to the pond and through the nearby trails.)"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, well equipped, and good sized private space to relax in, plus a beautiful natural setting, too. One of the best AirBnBs we have stayed at. Thanks, Oksana and Ro!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Magnificent place with everything you could want! I was greeted right away with a smile, and showed around by the welcoming host. It has a cute office attached to the large and welcoming home. Everything was neat and tidy, and perfectly placed. 10/10 would stay again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oksana and Ro have such a lovely home and we had such a pleasant stay here! They were great with communication, which is really important to us, and overall super accommodating. I’ve never had an Airbnb have (literally) everything you would need for a great stay. We would recommend this to anyone and definitely stay again in the future!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, great location and value. Can hear hosts walking/talking upstairs."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great space to stay. We weren’t sure what it would be like staying in a home with the hosts living up top but it worked perfectly and we both agreed we want to stay there again. It was a very cozy and welcoming space. The decor was great. We were met by Ro when we arrived. Thank you for being so accommodating with our late arrival. The basket of snacks and wine and beverages in the fridge were a welcoming touch.
The location was perfect. There were plenty of restaurants and stores nearby. We took a walk around the neighborhood and it was a wonderful, quiet area."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great little oasis during our trip to Ann Arbor. Everything was impeccably clean and just as described. Would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely apartment, well-stocked, very clean. Well laid out! Location is amazing, walking distance to nature paths at the sister lakes. Super close to downtown Ann Arbor, less than 15 min to UofM campus and multiple free museums! Comfy beds, warm shower, love the smart tv. Would stay again in a heartbeat."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is always a home away from home for me and is a respite in the absolute perfect location. The nature trails within walking distance are perfect for daily strolls. Right off the highway, everything you could desire for a getaway is accesible. Museums, fresh local foods, and spas are all within a 20-min drive. We especially liked checking out the local shops of Ypsilanti: like Blackstone Bookstore, Love at First Try and Gentle Vibes Vintage. Returning to such a clean, bright, welcoming space with everything you need is such a comforting thing that makes the trip so much easier. The personal touches of a little gift basket and quality toiletries were a welcome surprise! We can't wait to return!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing hosts! Cute place to stay!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This airbnb is terrific and definitely one of my best visit experiences. They are always available to ask questions and go out of their way to help and make you feel comfortable and at home. The apartment is beautiful and very close to the city!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oksana and Ro were amazing hosts! The place was charming, clean, well put togther and very welcoming. It was also close to downtown with plenty of things to do in the area. Highly recommend and I would totally stay there again in the future."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice and clean. Love all the amenities. Very convenient yet secluded location.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was only lucky enough to meet Ro but he was very kind. Easy check in, beautiful place in a beautiful neighborhood. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family and I had a wonderful time here! We were impressed with the cleanliness and the thoughtful space. We had all of the comforts of home! The hosts even had a couple of sandwich dinners waiting for us. That made us feel so welcome!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a beautiful apartment in a great location. Everything in Ann Arbor was a super close. The hosts were so sweet and communication was great! The apartment itself was beautiful and clean and perfect for 2 people. I was even able to get a little work done one day comfortably in the spare room that had a nice desk. We will definitely be back next time we are in Ann Arbor!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great quiet get away. Osana & Ro were very good at communication and the AirBNB itself was above and beyond with kitchen utensils, streaming services, and Towels. Also the place was pleasantly larger than it appears in the photos, extra bonus. Would stay again and recommend to anyone spending a long weekend in Ann Arbor."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The only regret I have about this place is the fact that I didn't book it for longer. It's simply a beautiful house with plenty of solitude, silence and privacy. The little trail that leads out to the lake was so beautiful with the snow that it almost felt fantastical. If you think you need an amenity, open a few drawers and you'll find it. I wish I could stay at this place for much, much longer if I had the time."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oksana + Ro have such a beautiful home! We initially considered staying downtown, but are so glad we ended up staying here. Ann Arbor is really small, so it’ll only take you 5-10 mins to get anywhere. If you like taking long walks and feeling like your on the set of a Christmas movie, this is the place for you. My girlfriend and I both worked remotely one day and the internet and spare bedroom/office were perfect for us."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oksana and Ro were wonderful. I had not informed them that my partner and I sleep apart and upon them learning of this after my arrival, they converted the sofa into a bed quickly and neatly. They are so friendly and their space is BEAUTIFUL!
They left us snacks and wine as a welcome gift, the beds were very comfortable, and the kitchen was wonderful. Honestly, I plan on going back for a writing retreat because it is in a beautiful neighborhood and with a beautiful view from the front room. Lots of light and truly as picturesque as you see in the photos they used. If you’re there in winter, do enjoy the frozen lake. Overall, this was a nice short getaway for me and my boyfriend."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oksana and Ro’s place is a 15 out of 10. The hosts are SO friendly, helpful, and responsive. The place is immaculate, cozy, and smartly decorated. It’s a close drive to everything, and a close walk to a nature trail in the neighborhood. The bed is incredibly comfortable! We absolutely loved every minute of our stay here and will definitely be back!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to live and work for a few days during the holidays! Hosts were accessible and friendly and the place was clean, comfortable, and full of thoughtful amenities."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location with great access to the Sister Lakes. Exceptionally clean and spacious. Hosts are very communicative and incredibly gracious. Would rent from again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb set the bar SKY HIGH! Our hosts went above and beyond to make our stay so relaxing and effortless. Thanks to Ro and Oksana's thoughtful touches throughout the apartment, we felt simultaneously right at home and like we had a pampered spa experience - the perfect combination! All the amenities you could possibly want. We didn't want to leave and we definitely want to come back! Conveniently located minutes from Ann Arbor while being able to forget you are near a city, due to the beautiful woods and natural scenery. Highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oksana and Ro were wonderful hosts. They reminded us of the romantic bygone era of Airbnb… they greeted us personally, gave us a tour of the space, and made us feel like welcomed guests! It was super clean, great location, had loads of amenities, and was real comfy. We highly recommend."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in Ann Arbor. Apartment is very clean and as shown in the photos. Very little noise. Hosts met us when we arrived. Apartment is close to restaurants and shopping. Probably a little better with a car or bike. Strong internet connection.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great location in Ann Arbor with great host! The place is private but accessible. If anyone is looking to take their vacation to Ann Arbor, I would both hands down recommend this place. (Needless to say, you would need a car to go around in Michigan) The location is right off from the highway that wraps around Ann Arbor so super easy to get to the other side of the town if needed to, near a big groceries market on Jackson Rd which also has many restaurants around (also bowling and a movie theatre if interested), but also has easy access to roads that leads right into the downtown.
Oksana and Ro are also great hosts who will accommodate your needs and be available when needed. Very clean and neat place with everything we thought we needed already equipped - very thoughtful! They truly made this trip very enjoyable for both myself and my girlfriend :)"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This spot is absolutely great! I loved it so much!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time to Ann Arbor and what an incredible find! Oksana and Ro's home is situated in a beautiful, lush and quiet Lakeside community minutes from Downtown Ann Arbor.
The accomodations are exactly as pictured and our hosts were available to answer all of our questions and make recommendations.
It was a much needed get away to relax and enjoy the many offerings in Ann Arbor...nightlife, nature, bike trails and the U of Michigan!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Their house was extremely clean and organized. 11/10 stay. If you are coming to Ann Arbor, you MUST stay here. They are the best."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"From the moment we laid eyes on the listing for Oksana & Ro's apartment we knew it was the one! The cozy apartment is surrounded by trees, nature, and cute chipmunks. Upon arrival, we were greeted immediately by chirping birds, sunny skies, and Ro!
The apartment is nestled in a cute quiet neighborhood that is still close to everything. My family enjoyed bike rides, taking photos, and the beautiful weather. The full kitchen made it easy to prepare meals and spend time together. I was able to work remotely during our stay using the desk in the 2nd bedroom. The internet is extra fast too : )
If you are wanting to disconnect from the world this is the place. A major highlight of our trip was reading in bed whilst fresh air flowed in through the open windows. Everything about our stay was perfect.
I highly recommended Oksana and Ro's apartment for single travelers, couples, and small families.
It has everything you could ask for while giving a comfortable minimalist vibe."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,We really enjoyed our month long stay in Oksana and Ro’s wonderful basement apartment! We walked everywhere and loved the nature preserve behind their home. They are lovely hosts. Everything was clean and tidy. We highly recommend this cozy getaway.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oksana and Ro were such wonderful hosts for our week stay in Ann Arbor. They gave us local recommendations and were so friendly! The place is absolutely gorgeous; perfect space for my wife and I. If you're looking for a spot to stay, this is perfect!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Airbnb. Pictures are very accurate. Stylish space and nearby shopping and restaurants. Hosts were very kind and left chocolates and wine. Overall, would recommend."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time in Ann Arbor and enjoyed this apartment, which was in a good location for walks with our son and had easy access to the rest of the city. Thank you!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a bright, open space with little touches that made it unique. The apartment is very cozy, with everything you need for a full stay and nothing you don't. The location is incredible - highly recommend the Bloom Wellness Spa, The Chop House & Seva's amazing breakfast - all less than 10 minutes drive! Even closer are the gorgeous trails in Dolph forest preserve, with more opportunities for hikes nearby. All of this is sweetened by the kindness and hospitality of Oksana and Ro, who did not hesitate to ensure everything was to my liking, that any problems were addressed swiftly, and I knew the best spot for dinner! I really appreciated the treats provided and the artistry of the chalk writings. Truly felt like a home away from home. I will be back again very soon!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a very nice stay, Ro was very helpful with everything. The room was very clean, and the neighborhood is a very nice. We got everything we needed."

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place !
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oksana and Ro’s place was perfect for my wife and I. The place was clean, modern, comfortable, cozy and peaceful. The location is outstanding. Easy to get to Ann Arbor and various sites around the area. The place is situated in a wooded neighborhood with the sister’s lake a short walk away. We enjoyed walks around the neighborhood and the sisters lake as well as just resting in the apartment and preparing a nice meal in their fully equipped kitchen. We plan to come back."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice space to spend a few day get away. The office space was perfect for getting some work done.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Apartment in Sister Lake woods. A beautiful place, perfectly located, and has everything you need! Check out the Dolph nature preserve which is super close to get a great breath of fresh wooded air! The neighborhood was also super dreamy."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I'd absolutely move in if I could. Oksana + Ro have an intentional, well-designed guest space below their house, nestled in a quiet, enjoyable neighborhood. I'd recommend this house to a couple, solo traveler, or small family. The kitchen, office, living area, bedroom, and bathroom are each great. Comfortable bed, great wifi, easy-to-use kitchen (bonus treats upon my arrival), clean bathroom with a great shower. Inside is lighter and brighter than expected - I got a fantastic view of the snow outside.
I was doing a precautionary quarantine during my stay, and my privacy was respected as I stayed indoors and awaited grocery, take-out, and package deliveries. The neighborhood and walking trails were perfect for my solo excursions.
Here, there is great attention to detail, great communication, and a great home."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"lovely folks, the house is absolutely beautiful. loved my stay so much"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely stunning and the hosts are very kind and helpful. Will definitely be staying again!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was the perfect winter respite away from our kids! Clean, stylish, and comfortable. We had everything we needed. I used the extra room as a yoga studio and my husband used it as a workspace. The house is located on top of a hill (pretty views!) in a residential neighborhood that's a short drive from downtown. There are several nature trails and lakes a few minutes' walk from the front door. The host was friendly and communicative."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place - clean, modern, it had just what we needed and enough space in the living room for our 1 and 3 year olds to play with their toys. Ro and Oksana were very responsive and kind in their communication. Highly recommend!!!"
2020-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Ro and Oksana were responsive and kind hosts. Their place is stylish and in a sweet neighborhood that is great for strolling with nature trails nearby.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was sparkling clean, comfortable and the perfect size. Oksana and Ro were very accommodating, and the location is perfect for anyone wanting to stay in Ann Arbor but hoping to get away from the downtown scene a bit as well. Beautiful place and beautiful location."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ro and Oksana are incredibly gracious hosts and I will absolutely stay there again. Their space has a wonderful energy, and I felt cozy, safe and comfortable. It is very clean and tastefully decorated with local Ann Arbor flare, inspirational messages and also offers extra space and storage. The area is nice for walking, is near a couple of lakes and is a great location near fab Ann Arbor. They offered some nice extra touches including bottles water, bubbly waters and the most amazing hand sanitizer I've ever used. They're communication was perfect and I felt supported should I need anything. In addition to their kindness, they were very respectful of my privacy. I would absolutely stay there again, and will recommend them to others!"

2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Romakiel and Oksana were the most amazing, considerate and gracious hosts that my girlfriend and I have encountered thus far using Airbnb. The apartment was so well decorated, super comfortable and very well sanitized and cleaned upon arrival, anything and everything that one would need to make themselves at home was available from the moment they check-in. They were also perfectly accommodating to anything we needed. The next time we have to plan an extended stay in Ann Arbor, we will definitely be making it a priority to book with Oksana and Ro. Thank you guys for everything, and we will be back soon! :)"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an gem of a space tucked in what feels like the middle of the woods. A gorgeous few minute walk can take you to more than one lake, a magnificent restaurant (try the prime rib sandwich at Weber's with a negroni), and the Songbird Cafe. A short few minutes drive will get you to Kerrytown and State Street. The hosts are very friendly and personable, and are responsive to needs (though you won't have any!). Comfortable bed, cozy space, beautiful and convenient location, lovely hosts. It is both too good and true!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"When we first found this place we thought it was too good to be true. It truly was an affordable, spacious, and aesthetically pleasing apartment close to downtown Ann Arbor. We were able to make all our meals in their home, do laundry, and work from their place."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Hosts were communicative, friendly, and very thoughtful. Space was very clean and comfortable. Highly recommend."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When I first came upon this apartment on Airbnb, it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. The style of the home is comfortable yet chic. Ro and Oksana are the most thoughtful, gracious hosts. Located very close to a nature area while also within 12-minutes of downtown Ann Arbor, I definitely hope to stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Our fourth time staying here…we LOVE this place and will definitely be back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Older Ann Arbor home at the edge of downtown near Kerrytown. Excellent location for walking / biking around town. Enjoyed the back porch and lovely garden in the evening. Well-equipped kitchen. Just to underscore: Largest bedroom is upstairs, in case steep, narrow wooden staircase presents a mobility problem."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location. Easy waking distance to all downtown Ann Arbor had to offer.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great home base for an adventure in Ann Arbor. We really appreciated the books and toys that gave our young kids something fun to explore in the home. For a family that prefers to talk rather than drive being close to a park, corner stores and easy talks into town made it the perfect place for us."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the location, very close to the campus. House is a bit creaky, but suited our needs perfectly. The host was super responsive - we only had one trivial issue, and they fixed it in 10 minutes! Highly recommended. Was expensive, but this was graduation weekend, and other places were even more expensive."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were very comfortable in this cozy home. There were many thoughtful touches and we had everything we needed. We especially appreciated that Franziska set up a pack & play before we arrived and there were baby gates for the stairs. The toddler in our group loved exploring the box of toys. This was a very family-friendly home in a beautiful neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again next time we're in the area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was the perfect place for our stay in Ann Arbor. It was an easy walk to destinations downtown but also a peaceful and quiet place to return to each day. We especially enjoyed time in the beautiful backyard garden!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Super cute house right near main Ann Arbor! We comfortably fit the whole family and were able to easily walk into town.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just loved the stay at Franziska's place! This was the first time we had spent any time in Ann Arbor and I can't imagine staying anywhere else now. There were so many great parks, restaurants, and fun weekend activities happening nearby that we didn't have to get in our car the whole time. Franziska's house was exactly as it is listed and she was an awesome communicator throughout. Would highly recommend and can't wait to come back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family had a wonderful stay at Franziska’s house. We had family in for our son’s graduate school milestone. We could host the whole family - The house itself is very cute, extremely well-equipped, in a great neighborhood. Very quiet, but within easy striking distance of great spots in Ann Arbor.

But pretty standard for the house and truly was a wonderful place to stay."

My daughter discovered the garden and hammock early on, while I worked in the library (I love that room!!). Great wifi that worked throughout the house, and an air conditioning system that worked like a champ upstairs and down, which was very impressive given the heat wave.

Check-in is easy, and Franziska communicated information accurately and promptly. Although it may be obvious from the description and photos, guests should note that there is one typical stand-up shower located on the main floor in the bathroom next to the kitchen, while the second-floor bathroom has a clawfoot tub with a handheld shower attachment - not an issue for us, but wanted to point it out. No issues at all with our very pleasant 2-night stay, and we would happily stay again at Franziska's home."

My now husband and I were staying at the house for our elopement and Franziska left us chocolates and a note congratulating us. She even left a small cake from zingermans in the fridge for us! We ended up decorating it later and using it as our wedding cake:) The house is stunning, with many original details intact. Everything we needed was in the house already! We couldn’t have asked for more and would love to come back for our one year anniversary. Thank you for your hospitality Franziska and Dan!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Franziska’s home was spacious, comfortable and ready to accommodate the needs of our stay in all ways. There was a ton of space, a beautiful yard, a convenient location, and she was extremely thoughtful and communicative during our time."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very well maintained, comfortable, and clean . Franziska
and Dan have done a great job providing a lovely place in a great
location with full amenities in the kitchen and bathrooms. We felt
like we were in our home away from home immediately."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This lovely home is the best of both worlds: a old-fashioned country retreat within walking distance of many shops, pubs, and other features of A2, one of the most vibrant college towns in the US. Step back in time while having every modern convenience discreetly tucked away. And don't miss the claw-foot tub! Franziska and Dan have thought of everything and are very accessible in case you find the one thing they haven't thought of. If you stay here once, you'll definitely coming back."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charming home in a great neighborhood! It felt like home away from home. The wonderful hosts answered all questions and accommodated our requests. We enjoyed our stay and will try to stay here again the next time we are in town.
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"Highly recommend! Spent a girls weekend with some friends in this home. Franziska is a lovely, generous, and responsive host, and the house is truly charming and in an unbeatable location. The backyard includes a hammock and a fire pit and feels reasonably private, despite being in the city. The beds are comfy, the kitchen had what we needed for cooking a couple different meals. The place was clean and welcoming. I'd love to stay there again in the future!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, so charming and clean. We had a great time staying here!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved staying at Franziska’s home. The house was at such a convenient location for us - walkable to coffee and a neighborhood park, and very easy drive to campus. We had two toddlers, so we drove to most places, but it would have been an easy walk if it was just adults. Franziska was very easy to communicate with - very kind and generous! Totally recommend this home and host!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here was wonderful. The location is perfect for those wanting to be walking distance to downtown. There is a cute bakery at the end of the street and your a ~7 minute walk to Zingermans.
This home is well appointed and we didn't go without anything. It was spacious and comfortable. You can tell it is well tended and cared for.
The only thing I'd want to point out to future guests. This home is built in 1901. With that, it comes with all the charm of a 120 year old home, which includes some of the quirks. While they didn't negatively impact our stay in the LEAST, be prepared for some flooring that has some mighty squeaks and cracks. Doors that don't love to close or stay closed and bathrooms that are not as spacious as modern bathrooms. For those sensitive to these things, this may not be the home for you.
For everyone else, enjoy the home and the lovely space. We sure did."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,All the comforts of home! We loved stay here! Thank you!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice quaint home right in downtown Ann Arbor. We appreciated the nice touches throughout making our stay cozy and helping us feel at home.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This comfortable holds a lot of old world charm. Location is primo. Just a short walk to Kerrytown shops and restaurants. Beautiful neighborhood. Would return for sure.
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,This place was amazing! Perfect for a friend’s get together. The photos don’t do this place enough justice. Everyone loved it.
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,This is a great spot to stay and visit downtown Ann Arbor(easy walking distance). And for a wedding in Dexter which was the case for us. Many amenities and nicely outfitted kitchen if you plan to do some meal preparation. We didn't have a chance to sit around the fire pit but it looked inviting.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location with a secret garden style yard and tons of antique charm. This is the quintessential AA experience. Loved the bakery on the corner with gluten free and vegan treats and coffee! Super convenient to everything fun in Ann Arbor and lots of space for a family or group.
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful old Ann Arbor house in a great location, convenient to downtown. Franziska was very helpful and reachable. Great place to stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Franziska made check in incredibly easy and her place was amazing. We were able to walk to town and the neighborhood is beautiful. We would definitely stay here again.

2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Host and house were both great - thank you!!
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,We had an incredible time at the house!! It was much larger than we had anticipated from the photos and the hosts were so kind to set up the air mattress for us beforehand. There were plenty of towels and shampoo/etc on hand. We plan to stay here next time we come to AA :)
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cute and spacious house is a perfect place to stay when visiting Ann Arbor. The house is very peaceful with lots of green outdoors space, yet very close to my favorite part of town (AA's Kerrytown). There is lots of room in the house, and it is perfect to work from or just relax with some family."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay. Very clean and comfortable. Franziska was very responsive. I would absolutely stay again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay and the location was perfect! Our kids enjoyed playing with some of the toys that were their and we all enjoyed watching a family movie on the comfortable couch. Will be planning a stay here again in the future I’m sure!

2021-08-01,5,Group trip,This house is a great stay for college students — very clean and nice!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely older house with fun period details. Excellent location for visiting our U -M student, walking distance to Kerrytown farmers market and restaurants, and a cute corner bakery/ice cream/coffee place on the corner. Very good central air and a lovely back deck we’re both appreciated during the hot August weather."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is best place to stay in Ann Arbor. Walkable to everything, lovely back yard with a porch. The hosts are lovely, gracious, and welcoming. This is the 3rd time we've stayed here and hope to be back next year!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A home that feels real, complete with slightly creaky wood floors, windows that rattle just right in a thunder storm and fantastic central air. Much better than a brand new house of plastics and matchsticks, for folks that value that sort of solidity in their lodging."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this house!! The pictures are accurate. Host is very attentive. It worked great for this corona virus time period because of the large deck facing beautiful green space, where we met with friends, and a nice kitchen so we could isolate from the general public. Also ground floor bedroom and bath worked for our 91 year old mother. We look forward to coming back again."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"The house is conveniently located in a residential neighborhood near downtown, and just a short walk away from a market and a bakery that serves coffee & ice cream too. Ideal! The home is also very clean, spacious and well-stocked."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Charming is definitely the correct word. A beautiful old west side Ann Arbor home, that is very convenient walking distance to downtown and central campus. Its also steps away from the amazing Knights Market, and a short drive to the Huron River and Bandemer Park. It had all the amenities that were needed and they were well labeled and easy to find. The backyard feels like a private urban oasis! Fantastic hosts. I would definitely stay again."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great house with a big yard. Location is very convenient. Service is good.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The listing gives you a good idea of what you’ll get here, a charming old house with lots of personality, a yard out back, and super-easy walking access to downtown and West Park. Great place to stay in Ann Arbor!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"warm, cozy space with everything you need...great location close to everything...nice walkable neighborhood"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really great and charming house. Location was great being both close to downtown but in a nice quiet neighborhood. Was very clean and accommodating with everything we needed and more.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Classic historic house. Quickly felt like home.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, comfortable beds, lovely living room sofa, phenomenal backyard. It's stocked with a few kids' games and toys, and was perfect for our 3 and 5-year-olds!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very enjoyable
2019-12-01,5,Group trip,A welcome and homey stay for Thanksgiving! We thoroughly enjoyed our time!!
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic place to stay for your Ann Arbor adventures!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed a cozy stay in this warm and charming home. Close enough to downtown to walk to many restaurants and bars. Completely lovely!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Franziska was a perfect host, responded quickly to our questions. Her home is charming, very comfortable, and well-equipped, including books and toys that our nearly 3-year-old grandson enjoyed. We especially enjoyed the chalkboard kitchen cabinets, which are labeled for easy location of all needed cooking supplies. And speaking of location, the house is just a few minutes walk from Kerrytown and our favorite Ann Arbor restaurants and shopping. Finally, the backyard and garden are just lovely."
2019-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This house is large and well located! It's very convenient and easy to walk to main street from here. It was cozy and warm even during the first snow of the season.
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"Just as advertised, Great location!!
Peter"
2019-10-01,4,Group trip,"Charming home and location, very clean and host very responsive. One of baths only has tub, not shower. Also very close to train tracks which cause loud noise and vibration when train passes, which can occur in the middle of the night."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quirky and cool! Plenty of space to spread out and great location.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a gorgeous house! It feels warm and welcoming, and is so cool. The location is fantastic, and it has so many thoughtful touches if you're traveling with kids. The coffee shop and market on the corner are both great, and we were able to walk to get most of the things we needed. Really highly recommend!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay - close to downtown and very cool back yard.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous location! A very hip neighbourhood and close to downtown. It is across the street from train tracks, but that didn't bother us at all (no horns at odd hours or anything). The charming house is great and has tons of character- the hardwood floors are a little creaky, which reminded me of my childhood home. We had our toddler and Franziska left us a whole bunch of toys, which really made his stay! We accidentally broke the child gate, and they immediately came to fox it- very attentive. Also provided great tips on restaurants, parks, etc."
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"Had a wonderful stay in this beautiful home and property! Very conveniently located, Franziska is incredible hospitable and responsive, and would love stay again!"
2019-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Great location being on campus but the house interiors could be better equipped or renovated
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place - Franziska was super flexible and accommodating about checking in and making sure we could fit all of our people. Location is perfect.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Franziska was a wonderful host and very responsive. Close to everything and very clean!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was absolutely wonderful! It was a quick walk to downtown Ann Arbor. There is a wonderful coffee and pastry shop on the corner. For older adults, there is one bedroom on the ground floor, which was perfect for my aging mother. There were so many thoughtful touches, from extra blankets and coffee, to great books and several porta cribs. I would highly recommend this home. Franziska was very easy to reach, although we had zero issues or concerns."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a comfortable house with amazing outdoor spaces. The location was perfect. There is room to park one car. There is a market, coffee shop and dispensary within a stone's throw. Kerrytown and Main St. Are a few blocks away. (Slight incline) The house was clean and the temperature was cool with adecuate AC. The shower is bigger than it shows in listing with good pressure and plenty of hot water. The beds were comfortable. I would recommend having white noise to accommodate different bed and wakeup times. The television channels are limited. (Not a problem for us.) The space was better than I expected. I hope to return and stay here again."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Franziska's place was great for our family holiday in Ann Arbor. The house was spacious, clean, quiet and an easy 10 minute walk from downtown. Parking was a breeze and Franziska was a super responsive host - we'd definitely stay here again!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't have asked for a better location, or a better space. The only thing we wished we had was more time to spend at the actual house."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home is amazing. We used it while visiting In-Laws for a long weekend. We brought our 2 year old daughter and Fran was very accommodating. We would love to stay here again. The location was perfect too. Within walking distance to great food and U of M campus. Highly recommend this place to all.
2019-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,First time using AirBNB and satisfied with the results.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful home. The backyard is beautiful and the location is perfect. Would definitely stay again!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a cool old home. It’s charm and good vibes made this really nice for our family.
We really felt relaxed and safe in the neighborhood. Walking distance to so many awesome things!!!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Franziska’s home is comfortably appointed and well situated. Four of us found it a delightful refuge through several days of scientific meetings on campus. Should we return to another meeting at UM, we hope to be able to stay here again!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! Was a great fit for us!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at this Airbnb for a reason - it’s just perfect for everything you’ll need. Close to everything, easy and free parking, excellent host - I just wish we could go back. But after graduation there’s probably not as much reason."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a great location. Close to everything in downtown Ann Arbor
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location and spacious! Joy was very responsive throughout our stay. Apartment was clean, comfortable and couldn't have been more convenient to local restaurants and shopping. We went to a show at The Ark, which was only a 2 minute walk! Comfortable bed & furnishings, good lighting, nice kitchen. Parking garage was right around the corner and we really appreciated the parking pass. We had a great time!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great space in an ideal location. The photos don't do justice to the tall ceilings. It's a converted warehouse and there are huge windows looking out at some excellent buildings right in the heart of hip AA. Highly recommended.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and a great place to stay,! Highly recommended"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,PERFECT LOCATION!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, really nice loft!! Super clean and she was kind enough to let us check in early as well! Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joy’s Airbnb was fantastic! The pictures don’t do it justice. It was clean, in a great location, and easy to access. The large windows in the living room overlooking downtown were so peaceful and the foosball table and dart board were nice fun additions. She provided flexibility on my checkout which was great for my travels and she was very communicative as well. Thank you Joy and will definitely book again next time I’m in Ann Arbor! If you’re debating about this place, just book it! You won’t be dissatisfied."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joy’s place was wonderful! It was tidy, even more cozy than the pictures show, easy to get to, stunning large widows that provided great lighting and a great view, and in a fun walkable area.
I was shocked at how quiet the place was, being right downtown.
Parking was much easier than I thought and I was able to find parking out front every day of my stay (I was there for the weekend so this might have impacted how easy it was.) however, a parking tag is provided for a close parking structure.
Joy was an excellent host and very quick to respond.
I had a fantastic stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"￼This was one of my best Airbnb stays ever. Joy’s place was extremely beautiful and even nicer than the photos in the listing. The place has such a cozy yet cool & contemporary feel. ￼￼ The apartment is so well decorated and has everything you need to stay comfortable and feel right at home. The location is very central and walking distance to all the best restaurants and other shops in town.
Even though it’s located right on Liberty and Main, the windows are so well insulated that you don’t hear any street noise. I slept very comfort￼ably. I would absolutely stay here again.
Thank you Joy for a wonderful stay! I wish I could’ve have stayed longer."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location and amazing apartment. The pictures do not do it justice. Large living space and well appointed kitchen. Appreciated having cooking oil and basic spices. Lots of restaurants nearby. Can be a little cold in the winter walking to the garage but really nice having free parking. Would definitely stay here again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joy’s place is beautiful and spacious, with a great living area with huge windows. Really comfortable and tasteful. It’s also in an amazing location. It’s as centrally located in the heart of Ann Arbor, with great restaurants and coffee shops literally right next door. Campus and sports facilities also a very reasonable distance. It’s a one bedroom place so best for a couple or one person, but it’s an A+ place. Really loved it and will try to stay there again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location! Parking is offsite, but not far and we didn’t use the car all weekend because the location was walkable to everything we wanted to do. Would definitely recommend Joy’s place!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I loved this place. Perfect location for what I was doing -- walkable to everything in downtown Ann Arbor. I stayed for a week and would happily stay longer. My partner who joined me there said it was the nicest Airbnb he'd ever had!
Loved having a full kitchen, living room, bedroom. The knives were sharp (unusual for an Airbnb!) and it was nice to be able to cook. The appliances were a bit loud but we got used to it, no problem. I look forward to staying here again when I return to A2."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed at many AirBnB in A2 and Joy's place is my absolute favorite!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay! So quaint and in the perfect location. I’ve heard horror stories of difficult check-ins but the instructions here were clear, simple, and easy to follow. The place was beautiful and just what we needed!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fabulous unit in a renovated industrial building- love the tall ceilings and windows! Clean unit with comfie bed. Perfect downtown location -walkable to Big House, M campus and great restaurants. Host was easy to communicate with."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were pleasantly surprised the BnB was larger than we expected and the location was absolutely perfect! The instructions were clear and the unit was beautiful. We have already made another reservation!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place! Perfect location in the heart of Ann Arbor. A very walkable area with a large selection of eateries and places to grab a coffee or an adult beverage. The available parking spot at a nearby covered garage was a huge plus. Joy was a wonderful communicator and provided very clear directions and instructions. The space was very clean, and the natural light coming in the huge windows was fantastic. We would highly recommend this AirBNB!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Joy was communicative and straight forward. Would book again. 5/5
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joy was wonderful. Responded to questions quickly. Her apartment is perfect! Great location, easy to find, safe, better than pictured. We enjoyed our stay and appreciated Joys warm welcome. We look forward to returning on our next visit!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic, fun property...walking distance of so much! Joy was a pleasure and was responsive to all inquiries."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Better than in photos. Joy was a good communicator and the place was perfect for a weekend in Ann Arbor.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joy’s condo was perfect for our stay in Ann Arbor. The location was absolutely unbeatable! Quick 1 mile walk to the Big House as well as tons of restaurants, shops, bars all within walking distance. Though the neighborhood is bustling, the building is quiet and doesn’t allow rowdy parties/guests which we very much appreciated. The condo itself is beautiful with amazing views of the neighborhood below. It was clean and equipped with all the amenities we could need. Bed and furniture were all very comfy. The parking garage was conveniently 1 block away and came with a parking pass so didn’t have to worry about paying for public parking. Joy was always very responsive and helpful and was accommodating with our requests. We are already talking about coming back next year for another football game and wouldn’t think of staying anywhere else! Thanks Joy we had the best time!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful centrally located 2nd floor condo in a security and elevator building. Large living/dining room and kitchen with floor to ceiling windows. The bedroom only has high windows above the kitchen wall but it was not a problem. Joy was a pleasure to work with; friendly and always responsive. There is one parking space in a structure about a block and a half away. Easy walk to campus and restaurants and shops abound. Highly recommended.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve stayed at a lot of Airbnb’s but this one is definitely a favorite: the location is perfect (how can you beat being that close to everything downtown?); Joy was super responsive - within minutes; the parking was perfect - just a block away and included in the rental; and there was so much to do, including the Ann Arbor Marathon that went right past the apartment. We tried so many new places - it was just outstanding. I wish we had found this place years ago. You won’t be disappointed."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed everything about this place. It was right where we wanted to be for easy access to dining, shopping etc. Yet it was quiet, comfortable and relaxing inside. Even with the windows the bustling streets were pleasant background noise, not overwhelming! I've stayed many places in and around downtown Ann Arbor, and there are very few that match the comfort and value of this one."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 absolute perfect location downtown. Hyperion coffee downstairs, Bills/Grotto at the end of the block, Spencer up the street. Walked straight down main back from the football stadium in ~15min."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even more spacious than the pictures, really great location"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I tremendously enjoyed the apartment and our stay. What a lovely apartment! It was really perfect for us and our needs. Right in the heart of downtown, walkable to—well—everything! The apartment itself is decorated very nicely and we felt very much at home. We look forward to another stay here in the future!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful time back in A2 and Joy was a great host. Unit is in ideal location near dining, shopping and central campus. Easy to enter, exit and very livable location. Would stay again. 9/10!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joy was incredibly responsive whenever we had any questions! We are so thankful. Also the space is larger and more impressive than the photos reflect!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic and absolutely the best spot right off Main / Liberty. could not ask for anything more. so many restaurants, shops and with the streets closed everything was pedestrian friendly (small downside is you do have to walk your luggage to the location from the parking structure which was only about 10 mins).
love the interior space and layout. great big open windows, super comfy sofa and lots of counter space and dining table. comfy queen bed and very nice bathroom. love having the full washer/dryer right inside. small criticism is the somewhat nosy water heater but got somewhat used to the sound.
hosts were super clear in their directions and instructions/house rules.
again a great deal and hope to have a chance to book this place again in the future."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The apartment is very beautiful. Tastefully decorated on an industrial line. The location is wonderful, right in the historic center in one of the two streets where the main restaurants are located. You can walk everywhere. The city is cute, and in the summer they close the street of the apartment and a cross to put tables on the street and live music. Joy was quick to respond to requests for clarification. Definitely recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are going to stay in Ann Arbor, this is the place to be! The loft was in the very heart of downtown Ann Arbor and super walkable to everything! There were exceptional restaurants and bars all around, it was a quiet and private space with large windows, comfortable bed. It was perfect and Joy was a great host!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place at a great location. Parking was definitely added bonus. I would use this place again. Everything was walkable and great shops and restaurants.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joy was a joy to communicate with! Everything was as expected from the beautiful photos. Happy with our stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joy was a gracious host that was very responsive and helpful. The apartment was awesome and in a great spot in A^2! We will definitely visit again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures are 100% accurate.
Great downtown location, but still quiet even on Friday and Saturday nights.
We definitely hope to stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marvelous apartment in a perfect location. Can’t wait for the next visit!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great apartment right in downtown Ann Arbor. The apartment is very nice with a view to Liberty Street. The bathroom is a bit small, but the kitchen and living room are great.
The location is fantastic! Joy was a very responsive host."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed at many airbnbs in Ann Arbor and this one was my favorite! The location is unbeatable and the space is even nicer than it looks in the pictures. Highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Large, elegant, well-furnished and clean apartment in downtown Ann Arbor. Close to the university, the entertainment the city offers and all kinds of shops. We really loved our stay. Highly recommended!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay in downtown Ann Arbor. Condo was clean and well appointed. Lots to do in the surrounding area and surprisingly quiet even in the middle of Main Street. Would definitely book again!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nicely furnished living space, large and spacious, beautiful view, apartment very clean (except for the windows), very good location. Kitchen equipment a little spartan. Entrance to the house due to current tile work very dusty and messy. Elevator also stained . Parking in the nearby underground parking very convenient."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay in this spacious, bright, comfortable, and very nicely furnished apartment. Great restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and music venues are all around -- and yet it is quiet inside. The University of Michigan is at an easy walking distance. Communication with host was easy and helpful."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spotless!
Decorated tastefully!
Awesome location!
Joy is a superstar!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful stay at Joy’s place and wished I could’ve been there longer. The huge picture windows were the perfect place to watch the snowstorm.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is awesome! Very comfortable, well laid out, clean, and ideally located. The host is very responsive and attentive."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location! Had a great stay! Would stay here again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed here while visiting my girlfriend in AA and this apartment was wonderful. We stayed in to cook dinner one night and this apartment had all of the amenities we could need. It also felt super cozy with the warm lights and dart board. I can't wait to stay here again when I visit next!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Joy's place was one of the best stays in Ann Arbor that we have had. The home is centrally located to restaurants and campus. The parking pass was an added bonus when we did need to use our car. We can't wait to stay here again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This quaint apartment was so delightful to stay in! We loved the high ceiling and great view of the snowy downtown. It was absolutely magical :)

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joy's place is nice and convenient to so many food and shopping places. I didn't need my car the entire weekend being that everything I needed was walkable. Ann Arbor is such a cute town.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Was very unique and a great place to stay besides the rodent living in the ceiling upstairs.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay .
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice area and a great stay. Definitely a place to kick back and relax.
2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re in the mood for a truly unique Airbnb experience, have I got the place for you! This place is like the Swiss Army knife of rentals!
Starting with the shower in the stairwell—ever thought about combining your cardio and hygiene routines? Now you can! The bedroom features a pool table, which is great if you’ve ever wanted to chalk your cue stick and your hairbrush in the same space. It’s a huge room that features stadium seating for cheering on your favorite player. Moving on to the kitchen, where the bathtub is right next to the stove. Imagine soaking in bubbles while your spaghetti simmers nearby. Talk about multitasking! The toilet in a closet is a bit of a hide-and-seek champion. Just make sure you’re comfortable with tight spaces and limited ventilation. And finally, the pièce de résistance: a sauna in the shower. Why choose between a steamy sauna session and a refreshing shower when you can have both. It’s eccentric and lightened the mood while attending a funeral"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Communication and details were great. Ran into a slight hiccup of the AC not working but Alyssa went above and beyond to help us with the refund options and even send us hotel recommendations. Will be looking to book this place again simply due to how proactive and kind Alyssa was. The place is exactly like the photos and is very close to downtown Ann Arbor. The neighborhood is very charming too!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,LOVEDDD THIS PLACE!! First time in Ann Arbor & I’ll be coming back but only if I can stay here!! Looks exactly like the pictures! Very peaceful ! Home is beautiful

The bed was comfy and the sauna and soaker tub were such a nice feature. The host provided plenty of information for proper use of the sauna, which I appreciated. I would definitely book again, given the opportunity."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,My family and I had a amazing stay here! We are sad we only just discovered this place as my sister was graduating from U of M. Alyssa was incredibly responsive and so accommodating. Highly recommend this stay for anyone visiting Ann Arbor!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the most unique places I’ve stayed at. Interesting layout that made no sense at all, but I loved it. I feel like there was at least 100 light switches in this place and i’m not sure what half of them controlled. Plenty to do here whether it’s board games or shooting pool. I would stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Alyssa was responsive and incredibly flexible and kind! Her space was wonderful and clean - I would highly recommend staying there if you need a place in the ann arbor/ypsi area to stay!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very fun place to stay!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for a place to disconnect for a few days and Alyssa’s place stood out to me first because of the sauna, but also because of how unique it looked. It was well-kept, everything was in good order, peaceful and quiet and made for a relaxing stay. Alyssa was friendly, proactive with communication, and responsive—a great host. Keeping this one on my list for the future!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Alyssa was extremely easy to work with and very flexible with our changing schedule. The place is spacious and unique and would be good for a family

2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Place was well kept and spacious.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Alyssa's place when we came to visit the University of Michigan. The apartment was adorable and had space both for us on the upper level and our teenage children on the lower level. They loved the pool table and the soaking tub and sauna were a nice touch. Alyssa was highly responsive when we needed anything and the location worked perfectly for us while we were there. I highly recommend this spot and would stay here again next time we're in town.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Alyssa’s place was so creative, fun, cozy, and clean! She was super responsive, friendly, and helpful. The Airbnb itself was way bigger than I initially imagined with absolutely everything we needed and more! Highly suggest to everyone looking in the area. Plenty to do right there at the home if you are looking to even just stay in and disconnect from the world. We will be back too one day! :) Thanks so much Alyssa!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot that is located right on the outskirts of the city. The sauna is a lil tricky to work with, but once you know how to do it once you shouldn’t have any other issues. The balcony’s are also show off the surroundings!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very spacious and unique Airbnb!
The neighborhood was filled with interesting architecture and was extremely quiet and peaceful.
Host was accommodating and caring!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"The pictures didn’t do the place any justice, a lot bigger than expected with lots of space. Very close to a lot of restaurants and not too far from the big house. Will definitely stay again"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for 2 nights and 1 day and wish we could have stayed longer. We preferred staying at the house rather than going out. There's lots of fun things to do here, and my wife even learned how to play pool. The beds are very comfortable. The sauna and big bathtub were very relaxing. Alyssa was a great host, very friendly, and quick to respond when we needed help. We hope to come back someday. Very cozy and homey feeling in this unique house."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place! Perfect for a romantic ski get away or small family trip, lots of activities within the home and in the area."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay. interesting place but just as described. in an area that can feel secluded but also right near everything!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely recommend for anyone heading to Ann Arbor looking for private getaway with fun things at home. The pool table was great for the night it rained, and the sauna was a great way to end the night. 10/10 in my book."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful space! I loved the large tub, sauna, and balcony. Cozy perfect getaway would love to stay here again sometime."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a very reading winter retreat for a few days at Alyssa’s place- we used the sauna, the bath, the pool table and went into downtown AA. It was a really nice stay. Alyssa was very responsive and helpful during our stay."

2023-11-01,5,Group trip,The lodge was very nice!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Remember the tree house you always wanted as a kid where it was all decked out!? Well this is your dream come true as an adult! We called this place the “tree house” we always wanted! Everything looks exactly like the pictures and it was incredibly clean/no dust on top of shelves or drawers! The shower had great pressure along with a beautiful separate bath and lots of hot water! The pool table & games would have been fun to enjoy on a day inside with your guests. We were actually disappointed because we were gone/not there at all so we didn’t really get to enjoy it! The multiple balconies were great for drinking your coffee outside and enjoying the quietness! You are “hidden” back in a wooded area , but you are right off the highway which is convenient. And even though you’re not right downtown there are restaurants and grocery stores right there which makes this “Tree House” convenient. We were just sad we never got to use the sauna! Next time we book here we’re adding another night!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great value and great location
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay!
