2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"More than we expected, there were plenty of extras. James is an excellent host, he went over and above to make us feel welcome.
Our family of 5 had more than enough room.
Lots of space outside too, we enjoyed sitting outdoors making smores, roasting hot dogs, etc.
Not to mention the big mouth bass the boys caught in the pond.
Thank you James!!
Blessings to you and yours!!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was fantastic about this Airbnb. The very kind host met me at the cabin when I checked in and gave me a brief tour, explaining the amenities and answering my questions. The log cabin itself is just perfect, so peaceful, so thoughtfully laid out and decorated and all the nice little touches. Every time I came back to this cabin I just felt at peace. The three decks looking out on the back acreage with the stream, the pond, the peaceful trees were just lovely. I came to the area for an event and unfortunately wasn't able to spend as much time in the cabin as I would have liked. This would be a perfect retreat for a writer or someone who needs a time of peace and quiet, because that's what this beautiful cabin retreat provides. I highly recommend this cabin. I want to come back again simply to enjoy the peace and calm of this beautiful little cabin."

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our time at the cabin! The log construction felt right and was what we were looking for. The pond and woods were great for our kids to tromp around. The space had everything we needed (always nice to have a washer and dryer) and was nicely kept. I didn't realize it's close to the road and planes fly low for the nearby airport - but not too often. James was very friendly and gave us a tour at check-in, and even came back the next day to get some firewood out for us to make use of the fire ring. And there were cold York peppermint patties for us in the fridge! Thanks James!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I loved my stay at this Airbnb location. I was extremely happy with the host and the cabin.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin was everything my wife and I were looking for to get away for a quiet weekend. Well stocked in kitchen, bath, etc. Open space in rear of cabin was great for walking and exercising my dog. Peaceful lower porch was great to close out the day.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was even better than the pictures! It was spacious, in excellent condition, and absolutely spotless.

The first floor bathroom is large and well decorated, The views from the cabin are great. Very comfortable bed. Cabin had everything we needed to enjoy a great week away from home. The outside sitting areas on the deck behind the cabin are great to bird watch and relax. Slightly over 15 min easy drive to the. Roberts Center. I would love to enjoy this vacation rental again"

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"James's cabin was the perfect couple's get away! It was so relaxing sitting inside the comfy cabin while watching the snow fall outside. I'm addition, the place was sparkling clean with an abundance of amenities. James was also a lovely host and greeted us as we arrived to provide a short tour."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was the perfect weekend getaway for the two of us! We appreciated the tour of the home and information about the surrounding area. The cabin itself was cozy, comfortable and surpassed expectations. The bed was very comfortable. We enjoyed exploring the property and spent time in nearby Cowan Lake State Park. Though it wasn‚Äôt the remote location we would have preferred due to its location on SR-350, the area was quiet and peaceful so it still felt like a remote getaway. This cabin surpassed our expectations and Jim was a wonderful host. We will definitely consider this in the future."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful cabin, the pictures are good but don't do it justice. We seriously could not have asked for a better place to stay! Sparkling clean, really intelligently designed interior. James gave a great tour and overview of the cabin and we just loved it. Would absolutely come back!!!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the BEST cabins we've stayed at. The cabin is big yet very cozy with lots of space. It was above and beyond sparkling clean. It has everything you may think of and may need. The land it's located on is beautiful and has many areas where you can enjoy sitting outdoors. James was an outstanding host, very quick to communicate with and provided many local tips. We will definitely come back again in the future for a longer stay."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,James‚Äô place was AMAZING! The view from the living room was incredible as we watched the winter snow fall. James is an outstanding host too! We plan to come back twice a year now. üòÅ
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful cabin & property. It‚Äôs not secluded, neighbors nearby & cabin closer to the road, but it was very quiet so still felt pretty secluded. Host was very friendly & thorough... met us on arrival for a tour and check in info. Bed was comfortable & we slept great! 5 year old was a little scared to sleep in basement/lower level, so she slept in the couch in living room adjacent to our bedroom just fine. Pond, deck, and outside area great for family time as well as our dog to run around. Some cookware could be updated but we still had what we needed to make nice meals & bake cookies. Perfect time to disconnect and enjoy time together inside a cozy cabin."

It‚Äôs not far from town or a day on Cowan Lake...you will enjoy no matter what‚Äôs on your agenda. James is a polite, informative host. We will be back, maybe a family tradition in the making!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay at when traveling to wilmington
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"James‚Äô place was a wonderful getaway! Other reviewers are correct that the photos don‚Äôt capture the beauty of the place. Incredible wood work and wooden furnishings add to the feeling of being tucked away in the woods, even though you‚Äôre near to the road and town. The view off the back is all wooded and the deck looking over the yard was a lovely place to read, watch the stars, and have meals. We enjoyed the fire pit and charcoal grill on the lower deck as well. James has really thought of everything to make your stay wonderful, and we‚Äôd be happy to go back soon!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Another wonderful stay at the cabin. James is a great host who made us feel right at home. The place was clean and spacious, and the patio and backyard is to die for!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do this place justice! I was so glad that I chose to bring my friends here and we definitely plan on coming back in the future.
Everyone felt very safe and comfortable here, the wifi is great, and you really feel like you can get away from everything without having to be in the middle of nowhere.
Side note to any musicians: the acoustics are surprisingly really good!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Such a comfortable space! We stayed for the horse show and the cabin was so nice to come home to at night after a long, busy day. The big bed is sooo comfortable and the two full baths are key! Add the washer and dryer and it was perfect for us. It has a very pretty backyard space and a great deck which in nicer weather would be an awesome space to hang out. Thanks again James!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"James is a wonderful host. The cabin is gorgeous and spotless. Everything is provided, even fishing poles for the pond. Just bring yourself and food and you will never want to leave."

2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"James is a very nice host. Very complete in his tour of the cabin. Just be aware that the second bedroom is in the lower level which is a little awkward. The toilet, shower, sink down there have to be pumped up into the septic which is loud. But it is a great property. Cute pond and room to wander around behind the cabin. It is close to the road so you hear all of the cars going by during the night."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing cabin! So tranquil and relaxing and the owner was just the best. He goes out of his way to ensure your stay is wonderful, i cant recommend this place enough!"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend staying at the cabin. Exceeded our expectations by far. Clean, comfy, well stocked, with a great setting. My husband caught a nice bass in the property's pond. We grilled out one night, and had a campfire another night. Located just a short drive from Cowan Lake, where we had a great day kayaking. James gave us a tip to try Spillway Lodge for our anniversary dinner which we really enjoyed. 5 stars!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hart's Rural Retreat is just that, a perfect place to get away and yet still have all the amenities and comforts of home! Very clean and comfortable with a full kitchen and everything you need to prepare and serve meals. The two full baths are large and again stocked with toiletries and plenty of fluffy designer towels. The outdoor space is amazing including the large and comfortable outdoor seating and dining areas. James is a friendly and helpful (with all the local information) host who has thought of all the little amenities! We enjoyed catching fish in the pond on the property and grilling burgers and having a bonfire in the evening. We spent day boating and swimming at Cowen Lake and doing some antique shopping in town. We hope we can make it back here... definately worth another visit!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic place to get away from it all. The deck is amazing for just kicking back and relaxing. James is also a great host; definitely cares about his guests! Looking forward to going back in the fall!

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect house for a getaway. James is a great host and the house is very clean and cozy!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim's cabin is a beautiful spot on 4 acres with everything you could need for a relaxing stay. He met us upon arrival & gave us a helpful tour of the cabin. There's plenty of lounging space on the 3 deck/patio areas with benches, chairs & tables. We loved eating on the little deck off the kitchen. There's a stocked pond out back & up a hill that's great for fishing & even a fire pit & little grill out back. If you plan on walking much I'd bring long pants and closed shoes. We saw deer trails, a great big raccoon, tons of birds, frogs, and a snake hole or two. The bed upstairs was very comfortable. If you're looking to get away from the busyness of life, this is perfect. It's comfortable and has all the basics provided for. There is heat & AC, a full kitchen, washer & dryer, 2 full baths, & an extra dining/game space in the basement with bedroom #2. Wifi and TV are available but it's just too pretty and peaceful to want to spend much time indoors. The cabin is just a few feet away from Route 350 so it's a little noisy with traffic during the day but the sense of space and privacy otherwise more than make up for that. And if you live in town it's still vastly more quiet than you'd be accustomed to. There was very little traffic at night.
We hope to be back! This is our favorite place we've stayed in!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All the amenities of home, makes for a perfect getaway for anyone! Highly recommend!"

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommended. You can't go wrong with James's place. We stayed here for 4 days for a pool tournament and I only wish I could have stayed at the cabin more during that time. Top notch hospitality and amenities, even a house phone with unlimited free calls back home to Canada (and USA, Mexico). Very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere, especially if you're a nature lover and/or a birdwatcher -- we even spotted a Barn Owl swooping through, along with a variety of colorful birds. I hope to come back soon!"

Not that my dog chews, but if you had to pick anything up to prevent that, it is minimal. I felt safe being here alone. Parking spot/driveway, is behind the house, just turn into the alley way. Clean walkway to back door. Once I got inside i knew I picked the right one. I brought my own pillows, but the bedding provided is perfect. Tons of closet space. Bathroom towels are so plush, everything was super clean. Kudos to her cleaning person. Coffee maker is Hamilton Flex brew, ground or keurig.

The price was good, the location was very nice - sweet little town and nice neighborhood - easy drive to Dayton, Columbus or Cincinnati for fun if you want big town stuff, but Wilmington has everything you might need as far as shops and restaurants. The decor and comfort are outstanding. We used the super unique (to me anyway) blow up bed and my grandson thought it was very comfy - it was so easy to put up and take down! The off-street parking is good, too. You can't go wrong with this one."

It‚Äôs perfect for those long horse show days where you can come back to the house to take a nap, do some work (WiFi works!!), catch up on emails etc. My daughter and I stayed there and, it was perfect.
They also have an opportunity for a ‚Äòconnecting area‚Äô to extend the space if you need it. AND, Another small cabin not connected that could also be rented. We did not see the inside of the other two places but, did read they were also available.

If you are in Wilmington for the bar exam: it is worth it to stay here rather than a hotel. Only 15 minutes from the testing center (taking peaceful back roads each morning helped my nerves a bit).

The pool is so relaxing, warm, and inviting. There are plenty of chairs & tables to choose from. When a storm rolled in, I curled up with a book in the pool house- the couch is so comfy!Karen has a speaker at the pool that she‚Äôll cast music to for your enjoyment & the house has a roku TV which I casted music to when I was hanging out at the house.
Cannot say enough about this place! Will definitely be back.
Thank you, Karen, for your hospitality."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time ! There was another family bc it was two Airbnbs but we never saw them so we got to have the pool all to ourselves
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Secluded farm, nicely renovated barn, amazing pool, and not too far from Wilmington."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a cute rustic getaway! We took long country road walks that were wonderful. Everyone needs a peaceful country retreat. We didnt even get to enjoy the pool and sauna and still loved our stay.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The barn house was such a nice place to stay in Wilmington. Out in the peace and quiet you can enjoy your coffee outside with great views and hearing the birds. My kids and I also loved watching the sunset over the fields at night, swimming in the pool, and having some of our local family over to grill out. It was also really great to have a washer and dryer - you can‚Äôt beat going home with a suitcase full of clean clothes! Karan was extremely attentive to any needs and was so sweet. I can‚Äôt wait to stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great communication and service
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our overnight stay here and wish we could have stayed longer! There were lots of great little touches to the place and everything was beautiful!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were looking for a staycation for a cold snowy weekend. This was just perfect. It‚Äôs beautiful appointed, amenities are spot on and very clean. We loved the lay out, the pass through fireplace and how relaxing the space is. Karan is a great host, easy and quick communication as well as all the details you notice in the barn. We hope to return and highly recommend this Airbnb"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the cutest Airbnb ever! Super clean, super quiet, super cozy. Great communication with Karan. The remodel looks brand new. We appreciated that there were no plug-in air fresheners, scented candles or other synthetic fragrance. We arrived in the dark of night, yet the barn was easy to find and easy to unlock. Powerful furnace kept us toasty. This was a very positive Airbnb experience."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and well-appointed. Great location for WEC. Hosts were very attentive and addressed an issue very quickly.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean and Karan was easy to communicate with through the app, text, or even phone call. Check in was easy and simple. Everything you possibly need is provided.
They ONLY potential downside was the location. There‚Äôs not a ton going on in the immediate area especially at night. We knew this going in and were looking for nice family weekend trip, and that‚Äôs exactly what we had! We will be back for our next family weekend. Cowan lake is very nice and there are some trails at the lake to walk which we enjoyed. If you‚Äôre looking for a party town look elsewhere in my opinion."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We arrived later than we wanted and it was was already dark, but it was easy to find. The farm is beautiful! We were there in winter, so most days it was grey and rainy. The two bedrooms were perfect for us and our kids. It‚Äôs cozy and has a lovely fireplace. We put together a puzzle that was there, played games we brought, although they have a few available too. We did a mix of eating out and cooking. There is salt and pepper, but you‚Äôll need to bring everything else.
The Barn is super clean and because it was Christmas week, had lots of decorations and the cutest little Christmas tree! We would definitely come back! Karen was great at communicating and check in and out are super easy."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Karan‚Äôs place is a gem! We‚Äôve stayed multiple times and each time is perfect. You have everything you need and the holiday touches are fantastic! 12-minute drive to WEC is perfect!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is wonderful! Clean, comfy, has all the updated amenities and more. It‚Äôs a place you‚Äôre excited to return to when you‚Äôre away from home! In other words ‚Äî you‚Äôll love it! Karan communicates extremely well and quick. When you‚Äôre in Wilmington or close by, this stay is an absolute must!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely place, comfy beds and peaceful surrounding but if arriving after dark it's very dark and a little difficult to find as it is off the beaten path. I would suggest a little more lighting on property to help find at night. GPS stopped working for a few minutes but eventually got us to right place. Had to call Karan to get help on opening door. She answered our call immediately and got us in. The barn is adorable, clean as can be and we will definitely come back again our next time thru this area."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cozy home! I will definitely return!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy space with a rain shower and fireplace. Great place for a honeymoon or anniversary. Its in a quite piece of farm country and is absolutely beautiful!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was very warm and inviting. It is a perfect location if you want to be out of the city and away from the hustle and bustle of every day life. I stayed there with a few friends, and attended the local Renaissance Faire. It was a great experience!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing little country gem! Went here for a quick girls getaway and it was beautiful, clean, and everything I expected and more! Karan was an amazing host, very friendly and responsive! We will definitely be back!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Relaxing, quiet, and comfortable, with high quality everything! While it felt like a resort, it was clear the family has put tons of love and thought into their home and barn!
We especially loved the warm pool, great sauna, and their sweet dog Nibbles. The kitchen is well stocked with nice cookware and there is excellent wifi in barn and poolhouse.
Communication with Karan was easy and speedy. We‚Äôre excited to go back again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family loved our stay at Karan‚Äôs place. The location was amazing - out in the middle of nowhere feeling yet convenience of stores and City Of Wilmington 10 minutes away. Being from Akron, it was nice to actually see a starlit sky.
Beds were so comfortable (wife took multiple naps). Shower was great. We loved having the washer/dryer available to us so we could go home with all clean clothes. Kitchen had everything you needed - it was nice to have two grills to pick from - a nice charcoal Weber grill (bring your own charcoal) and an amazing Lynx gas grill by pool area.
Speaking of pool area - that was the most amazing part of the trip. Initially, we were skeptical of hanging out at pool right next to owner‚Äôs house - we were wrong. We felt right at home and Karan was so accommodating. Remember - if you need something, message Karan...she responds in minutes and delivers.
Kids didn‚Äôt want to leave and we will definitely be back."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and Relaxing Weekend!
This was our second stay at one of Karan's properties. The barn is so cozy and beautifully decorated! We enjoyed every moment of the pool and fires in the evenings! Could not ask for a better place to leave all the worries of the world behind and just relax! Will definitely be returning!
Colleen"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The farm house felt like Home even better than home ü§£ i loved how quite it was my kids loved the pool so did I and my husband lol and Karan was so nice and made everything feel even more conftable for us i loved it ‚ù§‚ù§ even when we went shopping everyone was so nice üòä wish we stayed longer üò™
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karan‚Äôs property was a perfect little getaway weekend. Our friends rented both properties and there was ample space to lounge at the pool, grill and relax at the end of the long pool day. The weather was also fantastic, which is an added bonus! It had everything we needed and our group would love to come back in the future."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Mrs Karen was a wonderful host. Her place was spotless and comfy. It was a great little barn to stay in we had all the cable channels which my son loved that idea. Didn‚Äôt miss any of his shows. The pool was so refreshing to swim in we only wished we could have stayed longer if given the Opportunity I would definitely come back. When ever u needed her she was there to respond weather by text or in person if needed be. The barn house was my favorite place out of the three places I‚Äôve visited so far so don‚Äôt miss it try it for yourself.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome stay! Beautiful location!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a great place to stay - amazing views and the barn was beautiful to stay in. Thank you for allowing us to make wonderful memories.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is THE place to stay when you are in the Ohio area!! Peaceful, serene and a gorgeous place to stay!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great find this place is! It was only available for one night, but was perfect for a quick girl‚Äôs getaway from Columbus. Although the barn is on Karan‚Äôs property, the barn is a little home unto itself, with the perk of a swimming pool and friendly owners nearby. The barn is decorated so nicely - top notch furnishings and appliances, but at the same time it is welcoming and cozy. It is in the middle of Ohio farm country so the views are lovely, yet Wilmington is close by for a quick trip to Wal-Mart for dinner goodies and a set of pajamas for my friend who forgot to bring hers along! :)"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a place to just relax, unplug, and unwind, this is the place for you. The barn itself was one of the cutest AirBnB rentals we have stayed at. You feel like you're in the middle of nowhere, but there is a small town ten minutes away that has restraunts and grocery stores. The kitchen is fully functional and practical to cook in. Our kids (three under 8 years of age) all loved the pool, playset, and just roaming around."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Karan is the best host I have ever had at an Airbnb. The barn is so lovely and beautifully decorated. We love that it has all of the amenities that we do at home! The beds are super comfortable. This is our second time visiting the barn and we love every minute of our stay! 100% recommend!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Karan‚Äôs place is beautiful, great location if you are looking to disconnect and enjoy yourself in her beautiful property. Even when you feel in the middle of nowhere you have Walmart at 5 min,.. I highly recommend it, the description is accurate and the communication with Karan was great. Looking forward to visit her property again :-)"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four stayed here for two nights as a quick stop along a long road trip. We greatly appreciated the property and all the amenities. The farm is gorgeous and impeccably maintained. The barn is stylish, cozy, and every detail covered. Our two sons loved the swing set and especially the awesome pool. We truly appreciated our stay and the hospitality!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here in 2020. We loved it so much we came back!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely place to stay, lovely location - Karan and her family were great hosts and we all had a nice few days away from everything."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful! We were lucky enough to see a fantastic show of fire flies. I would recommend in a heartbeat.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A truly lovely and peaceful place to stay. It was the perfect place to break up our road trip. We will definitely be back! Karen is an excellent host and made us feel very welcome.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazing time at the barn and the loft. We had a group of 6 so we rented both spaces, which was nice because we had the pool to ourselves then. The entire space is spectacular and everything is very well thought out and high end. Karen kept the pool warm, which was nice because it was in the 70s during our stay. We had kids with us and they also loved the tree house and swing set."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karan's listings of the barn and loft are accurately described and we enjoyed our stay. The property and pool are cleaned, beautifully maintained and so relaxing. Karan quickly responded to any questions I had and was a great host! What a great pool weekend, enjoying the pool house, playing ping pong, the relaxing sauna and enjoyed a game of corn hole! This property has so much to offer! Thank you!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely and relaxing!!!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing! So much yard for the kids to run around and play. They loved the tree house fort, the pool was perfect, and there were so many little thoughtful amenities throughout. Truly the perfect summer getaway from the city with kids. Can‚Äôt wait to come back next summer!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, clean, comfortable beds, hot water, easy to use fireplace, and the pool was amazing. Looking forward to returning someday!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You don't want to miss out by not choosing this barn chic boutique stay!!! Friendly and kind hosts with wonderful pool, located in the heart of country setting. Calm and peaceful yet drive for a few minutes to restaurants and shopping. We will be back!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great rental, easy check in and the barn was cute and very nicely decorated. Looking forward to staying again on our next trip."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The barn and Karan‚Äôs property are a real treat! Luxurious, clean and comfortable, the barn is located down a short drive that is close enough to the pool, but far enough to feel private. We spent two wonderful afternoons at the pool, which is located behind the main house but felt like our own space. The pool is shared with another Airbnb, located above the garage in the main house. But the pool area is large enough to share. The sauna was clean and stocked with towels. Just a lovely stay. We‚Äôll be back!!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautiful. Really loved the decorations and overall design of the barn. The pool was fantastic. We had so much fun! We will be back!

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was so very peaceful and the space was beautiful. While the pictures show the space well; they really do not do it justice. Karen is very responsive to any questions you may have. Great weekend get away.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed a beautiful weekend away with a friend. The space is gorgeous and so peaceful. I have never enjoyed a space enough to care to go back because there are so many great ones to explore, but we will definitely be returning here during pool season to use that amazing area."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The barn was even better than expected! It was so quiet and comfortable!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly what we needed- such a quiet, peaceful night away. As we were pulling out we were saying how we would love to come back. Karan‚Äôs hospitality was amazing and the space was so beautiful! Can‚Äôt recommend enough!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to get away from it all. Far enough to feel like you‚Äôre in the middle of nowhere, but close enough to find cute coffee and book shop."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay. It was a perfect mini getaway. Karan is quick to respond and willing to answer all questions. Even in the middle of winter, there was a beautiful view from the barn."
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,TBP
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, stylish and clean space! Fully stocked kitchen, Netflix, what more could you need?? We didn‚Äôt get to use the pool because of the weather and time that we arrived.
Karan is a wonderful host! Search no further!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Karan‚Äôs place was a perfect getaway! After the easiest check-in, we enjoyed the sauna and pool, followed by a fire during sunset. The barn was remarkably clean, super cozy and had cards, puzzles and a few games. The gas fireplace was a great bonus to have in the middle of the room.
Full kitchen made it easy to have a great home cooked meal and relaxing night in!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karan‚Äôs place was adorable and cozy! The pool and fire pit area was gorgeous, with a picturesque farm backdrop. The beds were comfortable and she had coffee and oatmeal available in the house. There is nearby hiking and a cute downtown area with a cidery and restaurants."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was so relaxing and mind blowing quite (I'm a city girl). Everything was spotless. King bed is so comfy. Gas fireplace was a beautiful touch for our movies we watched. We didn't get to swim or use the fire pit like we planned but we utilitlize the suna and man it was a nice amenity to have access to. We are already planning our return in 2021 with the kids. (Also there is a swing set for little kids).

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There is so much great to say about Karan‚Äôs place! The accommodations are perfect for a family getaway with our college son. With no breaks this semester he was needing some time off campus to relax with family. Karan‚Äôs home provided just the place we were looking for! The decor is very well done, we had all that we needed in the stocked kitchen and the shower was amazing! Honestly, my favorite part of the entire space was the shower! Our boys loved the pool. The heated pool made for a good time on a crisper early fall day. There is so much fun poolside and we only used part of the activities. We are already talking about a future trip to return!"
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karan was great! Very responsive with all of our needs. The sauna was fantastic, pool was great, there were fresh towels everyday for our use. If you are looking for something upscale in a country setting this is your place! Wonderfully quiet evenings!"

2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Had a wonderful weekend relaxing üòä
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A unique and wonderful place. We thoroughly enjoyed our time. The quiet location amidst fields of corn, the gorgeous heated pool and spectacular d√©cor all made this stay a special one."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! The pool was awesome!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Can‚Äôt even fully express how amazing! The space is top notch and sparkling clean. The shower is a special treat, the beds are so comfy and all around very peaceful and secluded in the middle of the country. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the pool and sauna. Hands down the nicest pool and environment I‚Äôve had through Airbnb (or ever), which is a lot. Karan is also very kind and hospitable... communication was easy and responded quick! Will definitely return!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect place to getaway for a peaceful weekend. So quiet and serene! The decor of the barn is so rustic and modern at the same time. The pool was beautiful as well as the sunsets. An amazing weekend oasis!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family wanted to get away on a vacation before school, but with Covid-19 we wanted something low key. The place was beautiful and we had a ton of fun swimming, cooking out, shopping, and spending time together as a family. Karan was very welcoming and quick to respond if we had questions. Highly recommend."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing spaces (we rented both the barn & the studio)!! Beautiful property surrounded by gorgeous fields, yet only a few minutes to town. We loved the pool & amazing pool house. The barn was super clean (still smells new) & offered a great space for our family & friends dinners. The kids had a blast with ping pong, playing with Nibbles (sweet dog), swimming, making S‚Äômores by the fire, & playing in the awesome tree house/swing set. Although Karan & Steve live on the property, we felt that it was truly private. They were amazing hosts & helped us find a great restaurant in town as well. I highly recommend both of the spaces!!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved your place and really enjoyed your great hospitality. Can't wait to return some day. The pool, the BBQ grill, & the sauna were my favorite parts. My wife loved the decor and the super comfortable king sized bed!
Jim & Rachel Chandler"
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful place. Lovely owners. Expect that you may have to share the pool with others in the second Airbnb. Unique location; wonderful pool!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Having never stayed at an AirBnB we were not sure what to expect but this experience was far better than anything we imagined! The barn was beautiful, so cozy and very nicely kept with thoughtful touches that made us feel very welcome. The property overall is such a gem, secluded and quiet, our girls loved the tree house, swing set and the tire swings! The pool area makes you feel like you are at a resort, it is so beautiful, but you still feel at home at the same time. Karan & Steve give you plenty of privacy but we found ourselves hoping to see them because they are a delight to talk to. Our whole family got so excited every time Nibbles & Wilson came running out, such sweet dogs! This was the perfect quiet and relaxing escape from the craziness of 2020!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Karans place was absolutely amazing. The location was perfect for a weekend getaway! The barn was so cute and stylish! Karan was quick to respond for any of our needs. The pool and all the extras was amazing. The first night we had the pool to ourselves and the second night we shared with the girls renting the other rental but they were super friendly so it wasn't a big deal. They also had the cutest playhouse. We will definitely be back to visit!! ‚ù§
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I spent a week here and had a great time. My children loved having access to a pool and absolutely loved that it ""glowed"" at night. We did spend a couple of day trips going to Columbus which was only about an hour away. We also did some nearby outlet shopping and could have gone to an amusement park but the kids had fun at the pool so we skipped the amusement park this trip. Karan and Steve were so nice to talk with. They were always available if we had questions but gave us space to enjoy the property. Their dog, Nibbles was great to have around as well.

The accommodations are very nice and the host thought of everything! It was so nice to have a full kitchen, washer/dryer, etc. especially while in town for a horse show. Only a few min from the World Equestrian Center! We will certainly be staying here again next time we're in town!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a nice getaway in the country but not too far from town. The horses are beautiful. Very clean with everything I needed.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had one of the most amazing weekends staying at Colleen and Bobby‚Äôs Farm! We went with the intention of going fishing on Cowan Lake, but never left the farm! We loved the hospitality of the hosts. They made us feel like old friends! I can‚Äôt say enough about this horse farm. The horses, the land, everything was so peaceful and beautiful. The house was perfect,too. Beyond spotless! Colleen thought of everything a guest would need. We can‚Äôt wait to come back. We are already looking to book another weekend!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at this guest house and felt very relaxed and at home. Everyone we met was nice and welcoming, even the horses! The privacy was great and the inside and outside were beautiful - a definite retreat! We also appreciated that they were dog friendly. Can‚Äôt wait to come back and bring more family!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is nicely situated on an ex-racing horse farm and is very quiet with beautiful views of the fields and horses. Everything in the home was very functional, comfortable and easy to operate. So thankful that dogs were allowed as we were in town for a series of dog shows at the conveniently nearby Robert's Center. At the house there were lovely areas to walk the dogs and relax. The nearest grocery store is very fast and easy to get to in Wilmington. Colleen was a wonderful host...great communications and easy check-in and it was a great stay in every sense of the word. I only wish we could have stayed longer or had some shorter days at the shows as it would have been wonderful to sit on the deck overlooking the horses in the fields and had a glass of wine. Highly recommend!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To start, the communication from Colleen beginning with the reservation all the way through check out was spot on and exactly the right amount. We chose this location based upon a few factors, first it's full home experience, including the fact that it had two bedrooms with queen size beds each with its own bath was perfect for my family. Secondly we were competing at WEC and it is just a couple minutes to get there and back making it extremely convenient and when you combine that with the serene country horse farm setting and the cleanliness of the home it was a joy to come back and relax, spend time with the family and get ready for the next day of competition. This will be the first place that we look to book again on our next trip to WEC. Priced right, extremely clean, great location, phenomenal host, you couldn't ask for more if you're going to be staying in Wilmington. Thank you again Colleen!"

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Guest house on a horse farm had two spacious cheerful bedrooms and two very nice bathrooms, the living -dining-kitchen space was bright cheerful and comfortable. It was lovely being able to have coffee, breakfast and watch the horses cross the pasture behind the house. I understand that there are three other guest house spaces on premise. We would happily stay again.
For the horse show group -- this place is about as far to the south as the WEC is to the west so very convenient."

Tastefully decorated, brand new furnishings & appliances, kitchen had all including crockpot, blender, etc & even casserole dishes. Whole house was stocked! Good, quiet neighborhood & TRULY sparkling clean place. Nice host as well! Thank you"
,,,"The place was clean aside for stuff in the basement near the washer and dryer which didn‚Äôt matter to us bc we only went down there to put the dirty towels next to the washer to make it easier for housekeeping. 2 hours after leaving I received a reimbursement request from the owner asking for $50 extra for housekeeping!!???? Aside from some dishes left in the sink, and a couple tags from a new shirt as well as a bar of soap left in the tub the house was kept very clean. I received pictures from the owner of stuff that was dirty before we entered the premises. I was asked to pay $50 extra for housekeeping (on top of the agreed upon $50 I already paid) for basically something that would have taken 20 mins to clean (about 7 dishes in the sink and a few clothing tags) all in all I am very disappointed with this experience. The house itself was nice and comfortable, but I feel very disrespected and as though someone was trying to take advantage of me. I will not recommend this place to anyon"
,,,"This is very old house to start with. There was crack on top of bathroom and smelly. It was not that bad house to stay in, but the owner is horrible. We cooked twice on her stove, but she said we ruined her stove and we have pay for it. it was not broken. It might have some dust on top of it, but I paid cleaning fee. I left everything as it is. Just be careful if you guys planing to stay in this house. Owner might blame you even if you just utilize things she left it for people to use it. Personally i do NOT recommend anyone, unless you want to get blamed for ruining while just using it."
