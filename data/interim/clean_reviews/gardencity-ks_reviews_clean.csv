2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kade and Ellen's barn is my most favorite stay EVER ~ pictures cannot capture all the beauty!
The second I walked into the barn, I gasped at the wonderful smell!
Everything was pristine clean with soft linens and 5 star quality bedding. When you hop into the comfy beds, you'll once again smell the soft scent of the home.
My first night, it rained and I fell asleep listening to rain drops on a tin roof! The next morning, I enjoyed the sounds of happy birds as they dipped and dived in the nearby fields.
The cats are wonderful to watch and they are ""besties"" with the farm's fouls. But, it's the two working farm dogs I loved ~ they are friendly and will certainly greet you, but they are working to keep the farm animals (and guests) safe from the roving coyotes.
Kade and Ellen will make your stay absolutely perfect! Friendly, communicative, and just down right nice. Their family is simply darling and they go the extra mile just for you! Thank you so much for an awesome stay ❤️"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ellen is an exceptional host that made sure that our stay was great. The Barn was perfect for our stay and we would recommend it to everyone.
2024-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"Everything about the place was great! The only concern was there were dogs loose when we arrived, which surprised us, and they barked until we were fully in the Airbnb."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place is beautiful and roomy. Hosts went above and beyond in every way possible. Definitely stay here if you’re in the area, you won’t regret it !"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay! We were in town from Colorado with our dog for the dog show and wanted to catch up with some friends who live in Kansas and this was the perfect place to meet up! The barn is out in the middle of the country, not very many amenities around so plan ahead and bring groceries and entertainment as needed - but can always make the drive to Dodge city. There is a large amount of open grass space to play corn hole and other provided yard games, grill and relax! The interior of the barn was fantastic - what a fun way to remodel a milking barn into a living space. We had a great trip and if ever back in Kansas would stay there again!
Ps the hosts even offered us fresh eggs from their chickens! The hosts are fantastic, extremely responsive and welcoming without being around too much either! (Host live in house on property away from barn)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Unique and comfortable accommodations. It made a fantastic spot to stop and refresh on our cross-country road trip. Ellen was friendly and gave clear instructions.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"""The Barn"" is really nice. Very modern, updated and clean. The area is remote but quiet and tranquil.
The only issue we had was it was really hot upstairs. There were fans which we used but with one cooling system for both levels it is difficult in such high temperatures that we had to cool the upper rooms. If outdoor temperatures weren't so high I think it would probably have been fine."

Ellen was always responsive to my questions and very accommodating. Definitely recommend this place!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is exactly as pictured and very comfortable for our group which included 3 families. The beds, linens, and pillows are comfy and clean and the kitchen and living spaces gave us plenty of room to gather and enjoy our time together. We also really enjoyed being far away from any cities and feeling the peaceful ambiance of a farm setting. There are windmills all around which provided a charming flicker of light at night. We were here visiting family and would stay again if I have a future visit."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect! A great escape from city life. Quiet, peaceful and relaxing. Ellen and her family were great. Highly recommend."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We just loved the peaceful, rustic BNB. The only regret is, we wished we could have stayed longer. We hope to make it back someday.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hotel 2nd floor was amazing; we were suddenly in a past era, surrounded by early Victorian charm that must have astounded travelers even back then! The grounds around the hotel were a welcoming, cool shady oasis of ancient lilacs, big cottonwood and pine.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Kathleen is wonderful to work with. I stayed a few nights while working nearby. I got great sleep and would recommend Cimarron Hotel to anyone passing through.

A Must stop if you are nearby!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suite included personal living room, bedroom, bathroom, and all amenities you will want. Host responds fast and is qualitative. Everything was great, but do expect creaky fixtures expected of a historic building (particularly the light fixtures when traffic flows thru)."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kathleen’s place was welcoming and very homey. I really enjoyed staying here and got a really good nights rest.

Lots to say within an hour of driving distance and lots of quaint little restaurants and good food.
Rhonda and Rob"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful! Quaint and quiet.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I would return to this lodging “in a heartbeat” if we travel back to western Kansas/Dodge City. We indeed felt that we were briefly time traveling when we entered the front door of the hotel. The suite itself is a comfortable and spacious three rooms (including bath) with bookcases and soft oriental style carpets on old wood floor. At every reading area there is a lamp, both in the living room and bedroom. The sofa is long and looks new and welcoming for falling asleep reading on a rainy day. The climate control equipment worked well on a very hot summer day. There is great lighting in the bathroom also.
I appreciate good lighting and as these ceilings are exceptionally (such as 19th century) high this is important. Morning sun lights up the front room through lace curtains. There are privacy curtains for night. Quiet ceiling fan in the living room. The table in the eating area is perfect for computer work as well. Coffee for the Mr. Coffee, creamer, water in the fridge, and a small breakfast cake were much appreciated.
Owner Kathleen has been a steward of this remarkable property for decades and will share her knowledge of the 1886 hotel and all things Kansas. She is, as others have written, lovely and personable."

Also don't miss the bakery/coffee shop!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,5 satrs
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,What a fun and relaxing time we had at Kathy's place! The history of the Cimarron Hotel is so rich and one really feels a part of that history staying there. I needed a place to work out of for about 10 days and I travel with dogs for work. The hotel was everything I needed and more. It really felt magical staying in such a beautiful and historical inn. The apartment was spacious and cool even with weeks of over 100-degree heat. The bed is super comfortable and the couch is too. I was able to get a lot of work done in the space while I was there. My dogs felt like queens of the Cimarron Castle. Kathy is a serious dog-lover too. And the yards and grounds of the hotel are gorgeous. So much shade and green grass. I am hoping to return in the fall!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy! Loved it
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was quaint and as advertised. Fresh cinnamon raisin and blackberry bread, a coffee maker, a basket of snacks and cold drinks awaited us. Our hostess was kind and quite knowledgable. We simply loved our stay!!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Hotel is so beautiful! If you love history, or have a well behaved doggo, this is definitely worth the stay! We didn’t plan to sleep in, however we did because the bed was so comfy. We went to the local bar and grill for carry out, and my partner had the chicken fried steak which is a must. We then got a nice Cabernet Sauvignon and enjoyed a glass while reading about the history of the place and browsing the books. I added some Chopin Nocturne for some ambient music while we unwound from the long drive behind us and the long drive ahead. Our dog loved Kathleen’s place and immediately took to napping after his supper and walk. He enjoys some Chopin as well. Kathleen has a very nice dog who greets the guests as they arrive. I would totally stay here again, as the place is cozy for the book lover, quiet, historical, and the hostess is inviting, and very lovely to talk to."

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kathleen was very quick to respond to our same day reservation and was very easy going in terms of checking in and checking out. We loved the old charm of the late 1800s hotel with all its character and even its quirks. We would definitely stay again if given the chance. Less than 20 minutes from Dodge City too.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space is incredible!! It’s like you are sleeping back in time. The room is much cozier than I expected, with some nice modern touches that don’t take away from the experience of living in the old west for a night. Kathleen was a dream, allowing us a late check in and communicating with us throughout, answering any and all questions that we had. If you have a interest in history or just a desire for unique experiences, stay here! My only regret is we couldn’t stay another night."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice property, in the process of renovation, is like a step back in history. We were fascinated by the history of the area and the ""hotel"" itself.

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our favorite stop on a multi day trip, the suite at the historic Cimarron Hotel was spacious and comfortable. Host was very welcoming and we loved the chance to stay in this piece of Western history. Thoughtful amenities too, including local baked goods."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kathleen is the perfect host, excellent communication, so accommodating and a kindred spirit. From offering to set up a tour or a spa day to tips on the best places to find antiques, definitely check out “Remember When” down the street, she was always willing to go above and beyond to make my stay heaven. Thank you!!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a nice stay at Kathleen’s in Cimarron, Kansas.
It's right off the main drag in downtown Cimarron and next door to the post office, but it’s very quiet. It’s an old inn built in the 1800s. You can pull right up front to park, which is nice.
You enter the inn through a traditional lobby and the suite is easily accessed on the ground floor. It was a warm day and cool night but the temperature in the room was very comfortable.
The apartment is very spacious and the sofa and bed were comfortable. The space is clean and there were plenty of towels in the bathroom.
We were traveling cross country with two small dogs. We found a great fenced dog park in Dodge City, where we stopped on the way to Cimarron. We brought salads with us from Trader Joe’s in Omaha so I can’t comment on local restaurants.
Great communication from Kathleen.
A nice, hassle-free stay. Thank you."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A lovely spot......sweet garden and trees, a green spot in the midst of the Kansas barren landscape with so many feed yards and silos and grain elevartors and not much else. The parlor suite (indeed the hotel) are old, but it is alrge and comfy, good bed, plenty of light to read, a lovely stop off all round. Kathleen is kind and engaging."

Kathleen was pleasant and friendly, and it's a quiet area for a nice walk before getting on the road again."
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kathleen's house was a nice relaxing rest spot on a road trip to Arizona. We stopped in at Dodge first. Would recommend dinner/lunch in Dodge (30 minutes away) as the options near her house are limited to burgers or items with ground beef. We had zero issues checking in, and had a wonderful simple breakfast. Great place to relax after several hours of driving !!!"
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I wouldn't normally start a property review by talking about customer service, but ... wow. Kathleen went above and beyond. In the midst of a hectic tornado of a trip, her timely communications allowed me to relax, knowing that our lodging was handled. She was warm and welcoming, and made us feel completely at home, down to providing personalized cupcakes and banners in honor of my husband's birthday. The space was also very warm, homey and inviting. To quote my husband, ""This is the most ""in my living room"" that I have felt while being away from home."" We enjoyed the feel and decor of the historic hotel and appreciated the readings and photos provided that helped us learn about the building's storied past. We highly recommend the Parlor Suite."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home greatly exceeded our expectations based on the Airbnb photos and modest description. It has been beautifully updated and decorated inside and out, and was impeccably clean. I have rented a fair number of vacation homes nationally and internationally and don't give this kind of review often. The home has 3 nicely sized bedrooms with very comfortable beds - two queens and one king - plus 2 full gorgeous bathrooms. With the first floor living and dining rooms and the finished basement area, there was plenty of space to spread out and enjoy, and was the perfect size for my husband and me plus my two sisters. We will definitely request to rent this home for our next visit to Garden City and would recommend it to anyone else looking for a comfortable, beautifully-appointed house close to the downtown area."

The host was very responsive with questions, no matter what time it was. If you're looking for the perfect place to stay in Garden City...this is it!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is beautiful and CLEAN. Luna, the outdoor cat, was an adorable surprise. It was the perfect accommodation for our family for the length of stay so we could cook meals and go about our business without the hassle of being in a hotel. D'Arcy is thoughtful and had the house stocked with dishes, cups and cookware to use. She even has a grill in the back! We walked to main street in minutes, felt safe and the backyard was much more than we expected. If we had to give a critique, it would be regarding the security cameras but at the same time we understood and could appreciate why they were there. Looking forward to our next stay when we come back to Garden."

We definitely felt at home and would love to stay here again during future trips to Garden City!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nothing short of a beautiful and welcoming home. The yard was nice to let my kids run around in and the house was so spacious. D’Arcy and the cleaning lady were both exceptionally friendly. My only complaint would be that it’s a little difficult to get heavy luggage into the home after it rains due to a lack of drain systems on the street where parking is available and check out seems a bit earlier than most hosts offer especially considering it’s in between two times zones. It won’t deter me from a 5 star rating though. It was peaceful and all the lighting on and in the house made me feel safe arriving late at night.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,D’Arcy was a great host and responded to me right away when I needed help with the door code. Her places are great and always have everything I need! Thanks😄

Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I can't say enough good about this stay. The beds were so comfortable!
We ran into a family emergency, and were late arrving. I contacted our hosts, and the house was lit, and the porch light was on. How welcoming!
It was a blistering, hot day, and when we got back to the house after a busy day, it was heaven- cool, comfortable, and just right! The perfect place to relax!
Everything was meticulous.
Our hosts were excellent.
I could stay for a year!
You can bet this is my first choice when I'm back in the area.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stop half-way on our way to Colorado. The A/C worked great, the bed was comfortable, and the stove worked well for breakfast.
The shower worked well too, had abundant hot water. The bedroom had dark curtains and the neighborhood was quiet and safe.
It's a nice one-night place to stay. Didn't really watch TV or stayed very long, since we were trying to get back on the road early the next day.
The only item I would upgrade would be the cooking utensils, pots and pans. Also make sure you leave enough time to do all the dishes before you leave."

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place made my trip so much better! Loved everything in this house! Stairs were wider than other place so it was way easy to go upstairs with luggage.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Quaint and homely
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family needed a place to spend the night on our drive through Kansas. We were given helpful instructions on how to find the place as the address in g-maps is insufficient. I was able to tag the spot on the map ahead of time and find it without any difficulty once we drove there.
I love the blackout curtains that allow for my kids to sleep but also move easily and allow you to see the beautiful sunrise over the fields. We also thought it was fun to park on the scale and see how much all our cargo weighed!
They provided a pack n play with a sheet when requested and we all slept like rocks in the beautiful silence. Beautiful and friendly dogs. My 3 year old is usually terrified of dogs but enjoyed petting their dogs.
Good spot to spend the night. Thanks!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful scenery! We did get there pretty late and it was dark. The country roads were hard to see and a little muddy at the time we went. However Ryan gave us great directions and the place was cozy! It was a bit of a drive into town but that’s what you get for country booking! Thanks again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ryan came through in the clutch when that big online navigation app said I had reached my destination but was still in the middle of a country road. I texted him and he replied within seconds and told me I was on the right track and stayed in contact until I arrived at the front door (greeted by his two fluffy, friendly dogs!)."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet place in the country!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What an absolute joy it was to be here on a working farm! Ryan and his family were wonderful. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and the scale house was perfect. I definitely plan on coming back. 10 stars!!!! Loved being here and meeting these wonderful people.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great, and quiet place to stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice comfortable rooms.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,It was great for our family of 5. It was not as the picture showed but we managed. I was looking forward to the rocker I saw in the pictures to rock the baby during the night. There was no rocker. Ryan was very responsive and easy to deal with. Thank you Ryan! The outside light was burned out which was a negative as we arrived late and could see nothing. It was quiet and private. Over all it’s worth the money if you don’t mind making do with whatever doesn’t work or is missing.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, quiet, beautiful sunrise views, excellent parking. I have stayed here twice, and I would enjoy staying here again in the future!! Thank You!!😊"

I had an excellent stay and would love to return!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My big-city girlfriend loved the authentic farm setting and after the first night understood why we didn't lock the door. Rustic setting with just enough genuine farmer engineering to bring back childhood memories. Proactive and helpful host who did us a couple of favors, too."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great people
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place we stayed was very comfy and our dog was able to enjoy the freedom of the field. We had a great time and would love to come back.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Given the stormy weather the night we arrived, Ryan was very helpful and friendly. The listing matches the photos, and is a step above the other airbnb options in western Kansas if you are traveling with a dog—the options on that side of the state were very limited when I was booking!! Especially at this price point—we just needed a place to sleep while passing through on a drive from NM to MI. Small place but met our basic needs."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It was perfect for our time in the area, highly suggest you book it!"
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Ryan was very helpful in his communication
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect rest stop on our cross country trip. Fun place!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Needed a halfway point to stop on our way to Wichita from Colorado. Great little guest house on a big farm! everything was clean and as described in the listing. Host even left the lights on for us so it was easy to find late at night when we arrived! We loved walking around and visiting with the baby pigs and the dogs! We will definitely come back and stay again next time we come through the area!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great relaxing place to stay! We enjoyed being out in the country. The host was friendly and did good job giving accurate directions to the house.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our Airbnb was amazing for me in a way that had nothing to do with the actual accommodations, but the landscape. Being from eastern Kansas I always get a little miffed/defensive when people dismissively talk about Kansas being flat. I’m so quick to assure them it’s not all flat, like that’s a bad thing. This place was FLAT and gorgeous! There had been a lot of rain and a storm the night we were there, so as we left it was a 360 degree green earth against a perfectly even blue sky. Of course puffy clouds everywhere. Over the rainbow country! Flat and fabulous!
Accommodations were nicely country! If you’re not into a country stay, don’t stay here. It will be wasted on you. There is a mile of dirt road so be aware of weather. There was a lot of rain around time we went so quite muddy. Don’t go for the wifi, it’s spotty. Take a break and disconnect. I’m sending my family who travel between Albuquerque and eastern Kansas to stay here."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay and super private. Like your own cabin/shop. Do be careful if it rains, the roads up to the house are all dirt so small cars may not make it thru (ours almost didn't)"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was a good place to stay on my way through southern Kansas. I recommend following GPS till you get to Sublette or Liberal, and then follow the hosts excellent directions from there. Otherwise you'll end up in the middle of a field."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little farm to relax on. The lodging was small but cozy. We enjoyed interacting with the friendly dogs. Drive carefully on the long dirt driveway if it’s muddy! The mattresses on the small beds were a bit hard but I’m sure young kids would never notice.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place worth the money
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Ryan's place was very nice. We did have problems with the TV and Internet. it was not a problem but if we were there longer it might have been a problem. We would stay there again.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Decent place and quiet. Fun to see the animals. Window coverings on all the windows.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A great place to pull off from a long day on the road and get some rest. Very quiet remote location. The bed was very comfy.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We slept soundly in the comfortable bed and absolute silence of Bird Farm, and woke to the redwing blackbirds singing outside. Perfect size for our family of five. We enjoyed meeting all the animals, and one of the friendly ""Borgie"" dogs adopted us and slept outside our door all evening."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay on a road trip when you need to break things up. Comfy beds and the kids loved being on a farm. There were some dirty dishes and trash under the beds and the sink didn’t have any hot water (never tried the shower) but those are the only complaints! Overall good, convenient stay"

Had coffee and everything we needed for a 3 night stay. We were visiting family in Sublette for Christmas. Would recommend 😀👍"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great quaint country house.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here for one night with out dog, toddlers, and baby, and loved it so much we wanted to stay a week. Cute little guesthouse has all the necessities and farmhouse-chic decor. The kids were thrilled to find coloring books and crayons in their room. The main bedroom's bed is huge and luxuriously soft - best sleep of the whole cross country road trip - and it was great that the kids could have separate beds in their room. In the morning we met chickens, ducks, horses (one very big, one very small), and one barn cat before heading out. As someone who grew up in the country but has lived in cities the last decade plus, the highlight was definitely that night sky! Absolutely breathtaking!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay and hope to book again when back in the area.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Ryan was very welcoming. The place was neat as a pin and very clean. Very great small space. Ryan had coffees and pantry staples. It was a neat and off the beaten path place.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and comfortable. A bathroom sink for shaving and brushing your teeth would be a nice addition. The dish washing soap was terrible. We did not think they cleaned the dishes properly the first time. If we come back next year to hunt, we will try to book this house again. Thanks"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Peaceful, spacious, quiet. Comfortable bed. 10/10"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was traveling from Chicago to NM and this was a perfect stopping point. Wide open space, magical sunset and everything you need. Played with the pups, cooked some dinner (plenty of utensils), and enjoyed watching a storm pass by. Very comfortable king size bed :) Very quiet secluded space for rest and retreat."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place for a family with kids. Animals on the farm to visit, and very comfortable accommodations. Very neat to see what farm life is like in rural Kansas! Also, the hosts are so friendly and accommodating."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed here as a stop on a cross country road trip. It was a nice and quiet place to sleep and Ryan was a good communicator. It was hard to find in the dark even with maps but he gave directions that helped. My only complaint is the shower. It was a clawfoot tub on a platform so I could see it being challenging for some to step in. The temperature was also impossible to control. It was nice waking up and saying hello to all the animals. The dogs weren't super friendly to my dog but they were very people friendly. Overall, it was a great place to stay and I would recommend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really cool place.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful place to stay. The hosts really value your privacy, the dogs are super sweet, and the animals are really fun to see. I would live here if I could rent it out."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really quaint, clean, and simple place to stay. Exactly as advertised. I loved it. Also loved the sunset and clouds at night. I'd recommend staying here, and if I have to drive across the country again I may be back."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really unique place to stay - a scale house! Really comfy king sized bed. This place is nice and clean. Enjoyed our stay there...even being greeted by their friendly dogs.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice, cozy place to stay if you enjoy spending time in the country or would like to experience a farm setting.

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute little place in the country! Make sure to see the animals. Hosts were friendly and got back quickly when messaged. The shower was a little tricky, with the water getting very hot at times, then really cold. The king bed was super comfy."

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This farm stay was just what we needed to have a good weekend visit with our daughter.
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Expect a working farm, 3 welcoming cute dogs, a modestly but adequately furnished little house. Nothing fancy but “fancy” is not the value here."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is true Kansas. Loved it. You can see so many stars at night. The space was comfortable, clean and accurately described. I can’t wait to come back."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ryan’s place was great. As the previous reviews said, the bed was so comfortable! After a wedding weekend, it was a great place to come back to and rest! If ever in the area or passing through we would stop and stay again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ryan was very communicative and responsive as a host. The place itself was clean and comfortable.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute location in Kansas the my sister and I stayed at during our road trip. We had some difficulty finding the location because we arrived later in the night but the host was kind enough to rescue us when we were aimlessly driving around 😂 There were the most adorable dogs on the premises we had the pleasure of giving many belly rubs to and the Airbnb space was adorable, comfy, and well equipped! We were in and out pretty quick due to our travel itinerary but I’m confident that this is a lovely, relaxing place to stay for a small vacation. I would also like to mention that the host was very kind and one of the most responsive Airbnb hosts I’ve had."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,quaint farm house. lovely hosts. perfect for a stop over en route road trip.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"For those really looking for a remote place to stay, this is it. Located in beautiful farm country, just outside of town in a cozy place. Make sure you clarify directions because GPS might not work. The only downside was a large barking white poodle that I wasn't sure was friendly or not. They called her in when I requested and that was appreciated. A nice place to stay and get away, especially for road trips!"

It’s very simple and basic but the king size bed was super comfy. I felt very safe and comfortable while staying here!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a great place, and our family had a great time. The inside was clean and stocked with everything we needed.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ryan’swas a perfect landing pad while on long road trip & in between our destinations. We had fun, loved the farm atmosphere & were very comfortable.

2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"A relaxing, quiet, and comfortable stay! The listing description perfectly lays out what to expect and it is important to follow the host’s directions in because Waze and Google maps will take you along dirt roads for a whole lot longer than you’ll want. Master bed was oh so comfortable. I slept so peacefully! Pet friendly with approval and an additional fee. My kids enjoyed watching the chickens and ducks, petting the friendly resident turkey, and playing fetch with farm dogs. We were in town to visit family, but were able to make our stay into a relaxing mini-vacation. House is clean and cozy with plenty of linens and appointments to keep my family of 5 comfortable for three nights. Ryan is very prompt with communications and extremely helpful as any issues arise. If we are ever back in the area, this is where we will be staying."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stop at if you’re traveling through Kansas. I was on my way to New Mexico and needed a pit stop. One of the best sunsets I’ve ever seen!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place to stay! Loved it!
2021-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This little farm house is adorable, is fairly spacious considering it’s size and has all the amenities that you could need. Everything was great except there was absolutely no hot water and there were bugs everywhere. While it’s expected to have to deal with a few bugs while at a farm, it was much worse than expected. The bathroom floor/shower mat was covered in small bugs that crawl all over your feet and there were a few pretty big wolf spiders that were definitely not afraid of humans."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ryan was great with communication and very accommodating. The place was cute, clean and cozy. Had everything you need and the perfect halfway point from MN to AZ."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This location was amazing! It’s very quiet and peaceful! They have friendly animals! Anytime I needed help, the host was able to assist me. The host has great recommendations for food. The guesthouse was very clean. 10/10 I would definitely come back up here just for beauty of it!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Ryan is certainly a wonderful host! location was further than expected and the red dirt road gets really bad when it rains so if you have a car you may get stuck. Other than that it was the best time! I would go here again!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Pleasant farm stay—quiet and peaceful—good value!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was so perfect for a relaxing night on the farm! The whole family was very kind, but also respected our space. The guest house is clean and very comfortable!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, quiet, and the personal touches are amazing."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a clean, quiet, and comfortable place to stay. I would recommend checking this place out if you're in the area!"
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This quaint farm guest house has comfortable beds, a good kitchen and is super quiet so you can get some rest. The host is very nice and accommodating. We were happy with it. We didn’t have time to enjoy the farm."
2021-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Not as good as previous reviews in my opinion.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our 2nd stay at Ryan's guesthouse. Check-in was smooth and Ryan continued to communicate well with us as our booking date approached. We really appreciated having a comfortable place to crash after a long drive. There aren't many lodging options in this part of Kansas so having a reliable option at a good value is appreciated!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a warm and friendly farm heaven retreat. We unfortunately had a funeral close by - but, this place was perfect for our family.
The dog kisses, beautiful horses, turkey, duck and chicken greetings made our stay so memorable.
Not to mention- we don't get to see stars that clear living in the city in Texas.
We appreciated the comfort and tranquility of this little farm getaway very much!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, quiet, pet friendly, and as described. Worked good for our overnight stop in Kansas"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great place for a quick trip through!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay in the country if you want something homey, private, and country chic! Beds were very comfortable. :)"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay for our night driving through Kansas! It was a chilly morning otherwise we would've explored the farm.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"They are very accomodating, the beds are very comfortable, appliances are great, and they had free eggs for cooking!"
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very peaceful and quiet on a beautiful farm in Kansas. It was a good price and comfortable for what we needed passing through Kansas.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was excellent value - it comfortably slept our family of four without feeling like we were on top of each other, and the separate rooms were a welcome change from the four of us all in a shared space for the preceding 6 nights we'd spent on our road trip / vacation. The king-sized bed was exceptionally comfortable and I my only regret was that I had to get out of it in the morning. The kids enjoyed the bunk beds, too. We didn't prepare any extravagant meals while there, but it appeared to have everything one would need for making breakfast, lunch & dinner. The linens provided for bed & bath were also more than adequate for us, and it was nice not having to unpack that which we'd brought with us just for a night.
Overall, definitely recommend a stay here if you happen to be in the area. We were on a trip back home from a couple states west of KS but wanted a change of pace from the same trip out we'd made along I-70. It's 15 minutes (or less) from US-56, 83 & 160, so close enough to any highways you might be traveling, but far enough out that you don't have nosy neighbors. Just a word of warning if you book this place - heed the owner's advice about directions when he sends them to you, since Google seems to have made a mess of how the streets in the area are labeled."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A quirky little farm stay on our way back home cross country. Not much in the area to do but a nice place to stay if passing through. It was very clean and Ryan communicated directions perfectly as the GPS will take you to the wrong place. The place is pet friendly which is great, but just a heads up they will charge a $20 pet fee."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pleasant but short stay. Clean, quick response, quiet. Overall would recommend."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An awesome spot to stop for the night on our way through Kansas, easy to find with Ryan's directions and not too far off our route. The space had everything we needed to refresh from the road and was plenty cozy despite the howling wind!"
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This cozy little Kansas farm building was exactly as advertised, an easy no frills stop for the night.
The host was clear and gave excellent directions, I never met them but everything was ready and as promised.
I would stay here again."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ryan’s place is an authentic short term stay or a place to pass through on a long drive or perhaps for hunting. The location is typical of Great Plains lands, with fresh air and sweeping ground level views. The animals are a nice touch. The “amenities” are the authenticity. Animals, farmland, a good and safe place to stay. Rustic and small but country living is real. We were a family of four, with school age kids and a dog. Comfortable, plenty of food in Sublette (15-20 minutes). What a beautiful piece of the earth."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay on a long cross country road trip!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Convenient place for us to stay for a stop on our road trip.
Well equipment with basics for our one night stay. The bed was really comfortable. Ryan was very friendly. Thank you!"
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Easy to find with host’s directions and the set up was cute. I only stayed one night as I was traveling through, but the full kitchen would be great for multiple nights."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Would highly recommend.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. The location was easy to find and a nice quiet setting. We didn't get to enjoy the outdoor space due the February temperatures but next time we plan to check out the animals and grounds more.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"if you're looking for a two Kansas experience, definitely book here! It's small and quaint but the farmland is beautiful and my son really enjoyed visiting the animals. The beds were extremely comfy and our only calm was that the hot water was not working during our stay. However, not something he could control. If we ever go through Kansas again and need a pit stop we will definitely be staying here!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for a quick stop on our road trip. Cozy & comfortable. Ryan is also quick to respond if you have questions!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were looking for a place to stay overnight on a quick weekend getaway. We have an older, well behaved, dog and that makes it harder to find a more traditional hotel room. The renovated scale house was well equipped and comfortable for our one night stay, and would have been perfect for a longer stay. It was perfect place to relax after a long drive, and we slept soundly in the country setting. Highly recommend."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ryan's place was great! 10/10 would recommend!
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed on our drive from Arizona to Minnesota. Ryan was generous to give good directions and advise us on the best route. It is a clean, fully functional unit in which we were able to make a quick dinner and sleep for the night. There are some idiosyncrasies like the absence of a sink in the bathroom, thin walls, and a funny kitchen layout that were fine for one night but may be irritating in a longer stay. That said, it’s a good price and safe, clean accommodations."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice space, very clean, & great communication! Great place to stay even for a short night & it was a plus that it was dog friendly!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. Perfect for a quick stop.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space just as advertised. Just what I was looking for quiet and comfortable.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Not much to say, great clean place. Owner is great with communication and making sure you have everything you need."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ryan's guest house. Ryan was quick with communication, and the detailed directions were appreciated as we arrived in the dark. The space is clean and cozy. Check in was simple and we felt we got a great value, especially considering the lack of lodging options in the area. You'll be greeted by their two dogs upon arrival as well! Highly recommended."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is a must stay if you are in the area. We stayed here during our hunting trip and was extremely comfortable. This gem of a place will be our new spot to stay every season.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice Place! No hassle entry and dogs to say hi when you arrive. Cooked up a quick meal and slept very well on comfy bed.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place off the beaten path. Ryan gave us great directions so we had no problem finding the place even though we arrived late in the evening. Very cute and friendly dog will greet you. Very cozy for our quick overnight stay.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and a very responsive and kind host!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such an amazing time at Ryan’s place! It was everything one could want at a little ranch house and we loved being able to meet his sweet animals and have a good time! Ryan was the best host one could ask for, from making sure the house was super clean and neat to helping us get un-stuck from a ditch! Genuinely could not have asked for a better host or a better stay!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ryan and his family are wonderful hosts! Very kind, generous and down-to-earth people. Our son particularly loved being able to see all of the animals on the farm.
We enjoyed our time at the scale house, had everything we needed and would highly recommend staying if you are in the area."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ryan’s place is a great place to stop while on a long car trip. There is enough space to spread out without forgetting where you put stuff. And it is well equipped for all your travel needs!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous sunsets, great price, beautiful location. Very peaceful. Everything we needed for a getaway."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"a FARM STYLE style of stay,,,, very private setting,, & very cordial personality of the host."
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place is both charming and welcoming, especially the friendly, well-behaved farm dogs. No doubt, we will be back. Our family loved it."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very unique space as it is a converted weigh house. We were traveling with a trailer full of bird dogs and it was away from town so their barking did not get us in trouble. Plenty of space to park and feed our dogs. The place was very clean.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thanks Ryan!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute, private space with a surprisingly comfy bed. Super friendly pooch running around the farm to welcome you. Quality kitchenette and little dining area. Had the opportunity to check out the stars at night without the city light pollution."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We took an off the beaten path route from midwest to southwest, and this was a very comfortable, enjoyable spot to rest on our journey! Sweet canine friend greeted us when we arrived, which we all enjoyed! We checked out the hens & ducks before heading out. Everything you need in a private house."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nestled in the corn fields and greeted with a happy farm dog was perfect for a family trying to escape the city. A perfect place to unplug & get away from everything, so dont forget to hit the local market (15 mins from location)."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely darling little farmhouse space. We had 5 people in our party, and it met all of our needs. The host is friendly and accommodating, and I would definitely use them again when in the area."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had an awesome time here! The scales house was very roomy and clean. And I loved meeting all of the animals!
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Had a little trouble finding the place at first but Ryan was very helpful and got me where I needed to be. It was a quick stop on my trip cross country, and a neat experience being out on a farm in the middle of corn fields."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderfully unique little ""scale house""! I didn't even know there was such a thing. And even cooler, it's still in use during the season. This family is just the cutest, sweetest, most genuine and lovely bunch you'll ever meet. I felt privileged to have this little retreat and experience a real Kansas farm. The decor is also really perfect. Even though it's a small space, it has everything you need and a lot of style too!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice relaxing stay while passing through the are. Comfortable and well appointed. Happy to recommend to other travelers.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Recommend getting directions from Ryan - Google Maps took me to a different spot (not his fault).
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,exceeded expectations! we loved staying here and will make sure to stop by next time we drive across the country!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ryan was a great host --quick to respond and willing to book us at the last minute! He was also very accommodating to us on our changing schedule! We really enjoyed driving out into the rural Kansas farmland and arriving at his beautiful farm! We were greeted by his sweet friendly dogs and easily found access to the lovely apartment that is separate from the main house. The place was charming and full of lots of nice country style touches -- including farm fresh eggs in the frig! The kitchen was all set up to cook with dishes utensils and cookware -- we enjoyed making our home cooked meal upon arrival! It was a very quiet cozy and restful stay -- We would definitely like to return sometime!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ryan was very kind to host us at the last minute -- even including the change in our night's stay. He was very accommodating! The space was clean and full of amenities --full kitchen and even farm fresh eggs in the frig! Check in and check out was quite easy.

2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was a nice space for my quick stop for the night. There was a smell in one of the bedrooms (it's on a farm, so that's not unexpected), but other than that, it was a good space with everything I needed. You have to drive up a dirt road, so if it's rained recently, be prepared for your car to get muddy!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was just what we needed, and fairly priced. No complaints."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This renovated scale house was great! It's a smaller space, but was organized so efficiently, we didn't even notice. Ryan's friendly dog was an added bonus!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay on a farm. Very nice host. Enjoyed the place and all the animals. Will come back if we are driving through Kansas again.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect price and amenities for my last minute reservation on my way back home to Omaha, from New Mexico. I was able to bring my pup as well! She loved meeting all of the farm animals she had never seen before. The bed in the guest house was very comfortable and I slept great. I loved that it was cold as well- after 9 hours of driving in the heat and sun it was very satisfying. Ryan was also very quick to respond when I got lost right before dark during a brief rain storm."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ryan gave us great directions getting there and accommodated ya to check-in early! Such a cute spot to stay with a country vibe! Thanks!!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed at D'Arcy's houses in garden city before and is always a great experience.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This AriBNB was wonderful! Made you feel right at home. We were in town for a truck show and we wish we would have been able to spend more time in the Airbnb because it was so beautiful! D’Arcy was always very nice! She gave us recommendations on what was going on it town while we were there and checked to make sure everything was going well. 10/10 would recommend!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stacy had to move us to her property on Walnut due to AC issues . The place was absolutely amazing. Looked like a model house. Thank you Stacie
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable place. Walked to the sports bar on the corner for a drink and a sandwich.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is lovingly decorated; it certainly felt like a home. The kitchen was well stocked with pantry items and cooking utensils and the appliances are top notch. D'Arcy has done a great job at anticipating what her guests might be needing. I think this is the best condition of any AirBnB we've been in.
The arrangement of the rooms worked well for us with a shower on every floor making it easy for us all to be getting ready at the same time. The best surprise was the soft water; Garden City's is not the best. When I'm back in this area again overnight this is where I want to be staying."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,thank you again everything was perfect
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very nice place close to everything in the city. great recommendations for Mexican food it was fantastic thank you
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We came for a wrestling tournament. It was a quick 3 minute drive to the high school. I've stayed in many Airbnbs and this is one of cleanest I've ever been in!! D'Arcy had excellent communication with easy instructions and was very responsive and friendly. Can't recommend Red Door enough!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Very warm and welcoming!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I grew up in Garden City and I can say that this is a great and safe location. D'Arcy went above and beyond in responding and answering any questions we had. The townhome was sparkling clean and decorated in such a way that it made one feel special and yet also at home. I did some cooking while I was there and every utensil and kitchen item I needed was there. I am so happy we have options like this in Garden City now for short and longer term stays. Thank you D'Arcy!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay once again, very clean and cozy!"

It wasn’t just clean, the property is beautiful, the patio is relaxing, the kitchen is top notch, and my room with all of its space and natural sunlight was very peaceful. It’s tucked away in a quiet neighborhood away from the busy areas of Garden City but still just minutes from everything you need.

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place for our 3 night stay was exactly as described in the listing. What stood out was the friendliness, responsiveness, and helpfulness of the hosts. Not a full kitchen, but the food preparation area was clean, well-suited for coffee preparation and heating food in the microwave. A big plus was plentiful small snacks like candy and protein bars, even a couple of drinks in the mini-fridge. The dog is very friendly, brought over one of his numerous balls to play with. As older people, we found getting seated on the raised toilet challenging, but we managed. The shared living room is a very comfortable place to sit to read or watch TV. The hosts stay on the first floor other than doing laundry. The only time I ran into the hosts was meeting Mike who was working in the backyard when we arrived. Shanna texted me the morning after our first night and I got her ok to rearrange the bedroom some to make ourselves more comfortable. I would not hesitate staying again."

,,,"It appears to be a former weight scale room for a farm. Front door is a glass door like you would find at a business with a curtain hanging there trying to keep people from seeing in. Windows were boarded up. Bathroom had gas odor and rickety wall divider covering up some sort of appliance. Bathroom very small. Economical price, decent bedrooms."
