2024-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"It was an okay stay but I probably wouldn't do it again. The good - super fair pricing, clean and Andrew is super responsive. The negative - it had a weird smell that required me to buy candles and spray + the strange neighbors outside across the street made me uncomfortable (catcalling.) The wifi /tv didn't work half of the time so I had to leave and find somewhere else to work on my laptop, which was part of the reason I booked."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hideaway is a great place to stay. It was clean, cozy, and comfortable. Andrew provided clear and timely instructions for checking in and out. I would highly recommend this place if you are in the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrew was very accommodating and the space was cozy and relaxing!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Roomy booking with so many thoughtful touches-bottled water in the frig, choice of several snacks, books, you wanted to read, & cards & some games! The bed was very comfortable. We didn’t use the kitchen to cook but easily could have since it looks like Andrew has most everything one would need. The frig was great since we brought a cooler with our own snacks& drinks. Everything was clean as a pin! Andrew was so patient & helpful when we booked for the wrong night by mistake. It’s easy to see why The Hideaway had great reviews, it deserves them!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location was fine, clean, some snacks and water provided which was nice. TV mount was too high for me, for comfortable viewing. I would stay again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed for a night since we only took a break from traveling home. Even so Andrew’s place is close to downtown, it was pretty quiet. The bed was very comfortable.
The shower and bathtub is great for very tall guests, but it worked well for us, too.
We would definitely stay at Andrew’s Airbnb, again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Hideaway was perfect and Andrew was a very responsive host. We stayed on night on the way to Texas from Georgia and it was exactly what and where we needed it! The place was so cute and the snacks, bottle water, games and other accoutrements were a lovely touch! Made our stay extra special."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,The place was clean and was just what I needed.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at Andrew’s place. One of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in. The place had a lot of thoughtful touches we appreciated. Thanks for giving us such a comfortable place to rest before continuing on our journey.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is a cute place! Loved the hardwoods, glass doorknobs, tall ceilings, comfy bed, lights outside... the area seemed a little sketchy, but didn't feel unsafe. Great private entrance and parking was very close to the door!
The only negative was the towels and blanket at end of the bed had a slight dog smell. We connected Andrew and he apologized and offered to bring us a new blanket. Overall it was a great stop from Atlanta to Fort Worth, good deal too!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cuter than the pics show! Everything you need, bed and water pressure are top notch."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This little hideaway had all the “c”s going for it. Cute, cozy, clean, and conveniently located. Hosts were quick to respond and the history of the building was so interesting! There was a lovely path along the river just a block away so nice to walk and the host’s welcome book recommended the many fine eateries nearby."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely great stay at Andrew's place! Exactly as describe and we wouldn't hesitate to stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband needed a place to stay for the night and we aren’t familiar with the area so I checked out airbnb instead of a hotel. This was our first experience ever using it. Now, I will always use it but Andrew has set the bar so I have high standards for them. My husband went to eat at a local restaurant called The Cotton Restaurant and he said the food and atmosphere was a delight. I highly recommend The Hideaway. Thank you Andrew."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was my husband and I's second stay here, with our dogs, and as usual Andrew's place was great! Clean and comfortable, easy to get to (important after 8-10 hrs driving...), and all in all we would definitely recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"SUPER UNDER RATED!! I’d give this place 10 stars if I could! The photos and descriptions don’t do it enough justice! My husband and I stayed here with our 7 week old baby and loved every second of it! The host was very responsive and friendly, the place was spotless and smelled amazing. I felt like I walked into a place you would read about in a book. 10/10 would stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is perfect for a weekend getaway in Monroe! The space was great and had everything you needed. Very close to everything. We loved it!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Better than expected. The Hideaway is truly that; a hideaway. The entry is tucked around the side of the building in a somewhat obscure side door of a multi tenant building. Although there were other people in the building, there was no noise whatsoever; very quiet. The Hideaway itself has everything you need for a short stay and is well appointed with amenities like a coffeemaker, cook surface, full size refrigerator, very nice washer and dryer and a small grassy side yard for our pet to use. The bathroom and shower is conveniently located adjacent to the bedroom and is well appointed. The shower is spacious and functions very well. The only caveat is that the surrounding neighborhood isn't 5 star, but the Hideaway is tucked in so well that this wasn't a concern. Off-street parking helped tremendously and overall we felt very safe and secure. I definitely would stay in this location again and I can recommend it to you without reservation."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very peaceful and much needed during a stressful move.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,I stayed twice. great place

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. And I must highlight the binder Andrew left with not only thorough instructions for everything in the apartment but also helpful information about the town.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I go back and forth from Texas to Georgia to visit family. I have stayed at Andrew’s twice now. It’s cute, clean, allows my pup, Cooper, and has everything needed for a comfortable stay. My sister and her husband are going to stay there, too, in a couple of months.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean. Easy. Well worth it. Nice centrally located place.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Once again, this was the perfect place! It has everything I need (more than, really), and it feels like I'm staying in a Victorian home. Beautiful, beautiful wood. Charming with obvious history. Love the old neighborhood, which is so easy to get to off of I-20. I would recommend this jewel to anyone, whether passing through or staying for a bit. Thank you, Andrew! Will be back."

2023-10-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Nice, cozy home! Good location. I was initially confused about which door to enter, but figured it out. The furniture, appliances and amenities were fantastic! I had a hard time trying to lock the door after I left. Clear living and check out instructions. The Wi-Fi was slow, but there may be a new one through Xfinity, which I didn’t know how to access. Nice washer and dryer washing machine refrigerator stove Bathroom, kitchen bedroom, towels, bed covers, etc. Everything you need!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this place!!! It is conveniently located--about a 10 minute drive of anywhere we wanted to go. And it was great to step out the front door and stroll through a beautiful historic neighborhood. It has the charm of an older home while being totally up to date and stylish. It looked just like the photos. We appreciated special touches like water, snacks and coffee. Also, the bed was very comfortable. We would recommend this house and expect to come back."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Will stay again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Andrew's place was just what we needed while moving a cat. I do recommend bringing something to set any angular things like a pet crate on, like we did, as the floors are wood. They're one of several features of the place with historic charm, although that's contrasted with office-style fluorescent lights in the living/kitchen space. The host left a guide binder, snacks, and water for us, and communicated well.
The location is close enough to a nearby bar that we could hear their live music when we parked, but we didn't hear it once we were inside, so I don't think it will disturb anyone's sleep.
The neighborhood features a lot of one-way streets, so be extra attentive to signage.
We would stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a lovely little gem, not too far from the Interstate. The neighborhood has history, and the little apartment has some serious character. Love all the beautiful wood. It had everything I needed, including a comfy bed and a perfect little strip of grass for walking my puppy girl. Thank you so much, Andrew, for a wonderfully welcoming hideaway!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great stop for me on my way to Alabama. Perfect size for me and my Aussie to stop. The house was exactly as described. Very compact but well organized and extremely functional!
Highly recommend this for the one or two person traveler. Local venues are easily accessible if you want and local eats are close.
Great job Andrew!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Andrew’s place is comfortable, conveniently located and well equipped. The neighborhood is great for walking, especially if you’ve been driving like we had been and needed to stretch the legs. A variety of restaurants are in easy walking distance, too.

Our master bathroom was very spacious and shared by both bedrooms upstairs. The whirlpool jets were not operational during our stay.

2022-12-01,4,Group trip,We loved our stay here! We got both of the bnbs that are side by side and it was perfect for our family to spread out. The host was responsive and the home was beautiful. Our only issues were finding some dirty dishes in the cabinets and some people in our group not favoring the comfort of their beds. (My bed was comfortable to me!) location is quiet and safe. There were 2 dogs that roam the area and they came to see us several times while we hung out on the beautiful patio. They were friendly and sweet dogs so no worries if they come to see you during your stay! Overall; it was just what we needed.

2022-10-01,5,Group trip,We loved our stay. So many extras in the kitchen. Big bedrooms upstairs and very comfortable beds. Quiet neighborhood with nice patio area to hang outside.

2022-08-01,3,Stayed with kids,"it was a fine enough place but i would not recommend this place for families glass EVERYWHERE, it looks nice but is a stroke trying to keep the little ones out of it, and secondly the outside area aswell as the parking were shared with another airbnb, very uncomfortable we ended up taking 2 of the chairs and putting it up agaist our outside wall, so really not that secluded, honestly i wouldnt stay there again but it might work for someone else"

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Six of us spent 8 nights here and had a wonderful time. The place is large enough that none of us ever felt like we were in each others way. The bedrooms upstairs are huge and can easily accomodate an air mattress or two if needed. Super large bathroom upstairs as well. Nicely decorated and well stocked with all the supplies that you will ever need. Lovely safe neighborhood as well. We spent many nights enjoying the covered outside area that has a fan and some lights. I would highly recommend this airbnb to anyone looking to stay in Monroe.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Upon entering we realized it was the whole home, two levels. There are 2 large king size bedrooms are upstairs with a shared bathroom between. There is one small full-sized bedroom off a small sitting area. There are tons of kitchen supplies and the front living room is very comfortable. Three bathrooms with a laundry room. Beautifully furnished and was so nice to share this spacious place with our daughter's family while visiting Monroe. Would definitely stay here again!"

2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"My son, his team and I stayed here for the Louisiana High School Bass Fishing State Championship on Ouachita. This place was very convenient to the Forsythe Ramp and all the other necessities in Monroe such and gas & food. The concrete parking pad provided more than adequate room for all three boats. The outdoor sitting space & BBQ pit was a welcome area to sit and chill. All around great fishing stop to lay our heads."
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Audrey’s responsiveness to any question at any time was the best we have ever experienced. The beds were soooo comfortable that everyone kept talking about it the next day! The location is beautifully quiet in a cute neighborhood. We loved the outdoor patio area. We’ll definitely be back next time we come for a family event.

2022-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Albeit the “little hitler suite” on the door- this is a perfect place for a family! The furniture and decor really gives it a home away from home feeling! There is another property here and in my situation was contacted bc they other home has quite a few cars! Slight inconvenience, as I am a rule follower! Checkin and out was easy, the beds were comfortable and plenty of TVs"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay here at the Bungaloo. It was a very nice house with nice big rooms and we loved the closet vanity area and all the big mirrors. The only downside was the AC system which didn’t let you adjust the temperature easily. But overall I would stay here again!
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"My group rented out both, the Cottage and the Bungalow, and let me tell you…the pictures do not do these homes justice! Absolutely beautiful and super clean with all the amenities you can think of. My large family flew in from Michigan and were blown away by all the space and open areas to spend time together. The rooms were huge, the beds were very comfortable, the host always texted back immediately, and the location was close to everything! Don’t hesitate to book this incredible BnB, it’s definitely the best with the best, most communicative hosts I’ve ever had."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,really enjoyed staying. nice neighborhood. clean rooms!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our hosts were very sweet and their home was beautiful!

There’s a nice outdoor seating area to enjoy the outside. Whole house is nicely decorated
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had to travel from Las Vegas to Louisiana for a funeral and needed a place at last minute to accommodate a nice size group. We decided to get an Airbnb. We came across Audrey’s place and from start to finish the process was very simple. Audrey’s place was wonderful. It was very roomy and spacious and located in the perfect quiet neighborhood. It was extremely clean and equipped with lots of extras. We would most definitely be using Audrey’s place again and I recommend any and everyone that passes through Monroe and needs a nice clean spacious place To look up Aubrey.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was as beautiful as the pictures showed. The host was quick to respond to every question. I highly recommend the place and the host.

The apartment was very well presented with nice furnishings and great facilities….a very cool spot for anyone looking for a great place to stay in the area.
I would have no reservation about recommending this accommodation. All credit to Jason and the team for a great service all round."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed our stay. It was the perfect place to spend graduation weekend. The apartment was very clean, cozy, and we felt very safe. If you’re on the fence about booking this place, book it! You won’t be disappointed!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is very nice, modern, with everything you’d need. Comfy bed. Great location."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have had to go to downtown Monroe for business fairly regularly for 13 years, sometimes for a day, sometimes for 1-2 weeks. Before discovering this AirBnB, my preference has been to try to get a room at one of the Pecanland Mall/Airport chain hotels. I found this AirBnB far more to my liking & a much better option (and add that hotel rooms in Monroe can sometimes be surprisingly hard to book). I found the unit to be exactly as depicted (which was great), a wonderful space with everything you would want. It is true that the hard wood floors do creek a little but that’s not a problem for me. Great combo of amenities and charm. Will certainly stay again (already booked for future business trip in a few months). Also, finding & getting settled in was incredibly easy. I did not arrive until 11:30 pm after 3 hour drive & it was great to be able to get in quick & easy & immediately wind down. Dedicated parking for Castle Hall also fantastic & convenient."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and close walking distance to a really good restaurant in the area called Restaurant Cotton.
2024-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time and loved the place!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend this gorgeous condo! It was exactly as listed, lux and easy to find. We have a student at ULM and this location is convenient to the local restaurants as well as campus just minutes away. We walked 3 minutes to Planters Gastro Pub for a gorgeous river view and 90s music. We felt perfectly safe parking and walking in the area. It was perfect for me, my husband and adult son."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sadly, there isn't a sixth star or I would have given it, so 5 stars will have to do. Unbelievable place, from the paintings in the hallway to the actual condo itself, there was a huge attention to detail. Very clean, very modern (in a good way), style was awesome, beds comfortable. Could not highly recommend this place enough. If you are traveling thru and need a place to stop for the night, this is the place. Plus great restaurants within walking distance in a safe downtown area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jason is the BEST super host EVER!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful condo in a great location! We enjoyed the beautiful town as well as all the wonderful restaurants and shopping the town had to offer. Majority within walking distance. We also felt very safe. Our condo was extremely clean and well decorated. It matched the pictures perfectly. Our only minor complaint was the low water pressure but being in an old building we totally understood.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved our stay at CHC! Beautiful renovated building downtown with eclectic decor. Walkable to great Restaurants nearby. Will be back!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"my family rented a total of 4 rooms for my daughter's wedding. Everyone raved about the rooms and stated the beds were comfortable. Furnishings are very nice and modern. Jason is very easy to communicate with, responds very quickly to questions and was very accommodating. Highly recommend."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I recently had the pleasure of staying one of this AirBnB and I must say, it was a truly wonderful experience! The owner of the property was incredibly nice, responsive, and professional. From the moment I reached out to inquire about the listing, they were prompt in their replies and provided all the information I needed.
The owner had gone above and beyond to ensure that everything was clean, comfortable, and well-equipped. The attention to detail was impressive, from the fresh linens to the thoughtful amenities provided.
Throughout my stay, the owner was always available to answer any questions or address any concerns. Their professionalism and responsiveness made me feel well taken care of and at ease. It truly enhanced my overall experience.
I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a memorable and enjoyable stay. The owner's kindness, attentiveness, and professionalism truly set them apart. Thank you for making my stay so special!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love it, will stay again"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was unique, but unfortunately, the squeaky floors and lack of soundproofing kept me awake when the upstairs neighbors arrived at 1:30 a.m. It may have been fine if I had not needed to sleep to give several presentations the following days."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in a very non modern city!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect. Thanks.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed our stay, this was a convenient location for us and much better than a hotel. The floors were very loud/creaky, most of the time it was fine but upstairs had an early check out one night and it was extremely loud on the second floor. I would prepare with earplugs, sound machine or something like that when staying in the future. Overall enjoyed our stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jason is a great host. I will always choose this place first when staying in Monroe. Castle hall is clean and safe. Jason always responds promptly and kindly and is always willing to accommodate if possible.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay! Will definitely recommend this place for future family and friends visiting in town. The condo was the perfect place to stay for a wedding located across the street.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exceptional accommodation!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great downtown location, walking distance to lots of attractions. Would highly recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We selected Jason's listing because our conference was being held in Downtown Monroe, and the location was unbeatable. The photos made a great impression, but the accommodations exceeded the images and description - great natural light, cozy furnishings, great working space, ample kitchen, and great laundry appliances. Will definitely look for a reason to get back to Monroe and stay at Jason's place again!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was just like the description! I was blown away by the living room, that was hands down my favorite part. Absolutely gorgeous.
The floors are so very creaky, but that’s alluded to in the description, and the guy above us didn’t do anything obnoxious.
The rooms are so dark at night that you’ll have no idea what time it is haha. The surrounding area is quiet, save for the clock tower, but I thought that was cool, and couldn’t hear it from my room.
I felt safe being here, and there was an additional alarm to set if I didn’t.
I would definitely recommend staying here"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love staying here!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jason was so easy to work with - always responded quickly to any questions. Took care of an issue very quickly even though it ended up being our fault.
Will (and have already) definitely recommend this place. Already starting ti plan our next trip."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worth every penny. We loved this place! What an interesting building and it was very nicely furnished.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in downtown Monroe. So close to a handful of great restaurants. Beautiful space and very comfortable. Truly is a home away from home. Can’t wait to go back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great condo.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jason’s place was as described. The condo was conveniently located, beautifully furnished and felt welcoming. My family and I felt safe during our stay. Parking was adequate and close to the entryway. Jason was extremely responsive to any question or concerns I had. He graciously accommodated a last minute change with the utmost kindness. I will definitely consider Jason’s place for future travel to Monroe. Thanks again, Jason."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would gladly stay again. Between the building and the furnishings, it is a perfect blend of modern and nostalgic."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Castle Hall was just as described, fit all of our needs and Jason was wonderful at responding to my questions. If ever in the area again, it will be my first go to for accommodations!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and peaceful place to stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jason was amazing from the very beginning!
He was super flexible with check in and provided all of the info I needed.
The space was amazing! The exposed brick, high ceilings, and large windows made it feel very historic.
But most importantly, Jason was available when I had loud music issues from a large crowd also in the same building, which Jason did not know about. He addressed it immediately and it was never an issue again. It was a very peaceful weekend with my wife and kids thanks to him."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jason’s rentals at Castle Hall are always beautiful and comfortable - extraordinary. Each time I visit I feel like I am on a mini vacay! Thank you Jason for your attention to detail and hospitality.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The walls are very thin. I could hear the noise outside and next door. They do provide earplugs.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jason's place is breathtakingly beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. I traveled to Monroe for the very first time for a family reunion, and we loved the small town feel. The location was perfect. Jason was very responsive to my inquiries. My elderly Mother was equally impressed with the decor and cleanliness's of the Loft! 5 stars without a doubt!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Will be back for our next stay :)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"6-18-2023
Awesome time in Monroe!
It has been fun going back down memory lane.
The condo was perfect and we would high recommend it to anyone looking for a very beautiful home away from home!
We were in town to attend the Miss Louisiana Competition.
We definitely will stay here again!
Two standout highlights of our trip was the condo and seeing our friend being named 1st Runner-Up!
A memorable weekend!
Thank you Jason!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely gorgeous downtown condo. Well-appointed with everything we needed. Beautiful restored hardwood floors and exposed brick. Lots within walking distance. Will totally stay here again!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jason is a great host. Our stay was great. I’ve already booked again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jason was such a good host, and quick to respond. His place was exactly like described and so beautiful! We booked it again this year while we were in town volunteering for the Red, White & Blue Airshow. We loved staying here a second time and enjoyed that we could just walk across the parking lot and go to Mass at St. Matthews. We just cannot say enough good things about Jason & his place!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is AWESOME! Unique loft style apartment with soaring ceilings HUGE windows with a view of the vibrant neighborhood. We walked to nearby Cotton Restaurant which was fabulous. Spoke with Jason on checkout and he was super responsive and accommodating. Location is right in the middle of downtown Monroe. We'll definitely be back!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay. One thing to know is it's an old building with lots of 'character'. The floors have a tendency to creak in spots. We were only there two nights and I learned where to walk to avoid making too much noise. Don't think it bothered anyone too much.
Would definitely stay there again if we have the need.
Convenient to ULM for those going to activities there"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rented all of the nine condos at Castle Hall for our daughter's wedding weekend and family members occupied all the rooms. I was able to see each unit and as I walked from room to room, I thought, "" I like it better than the last one"" and I continued to say that for all 9 of the condos! They are all wonderful and like a home away from home. So much character in the entire building. Easy parking and walkable to coffee shop and downtown restaurants. The condos had all amenities you could ask for and really nice televisions with wifi that we used for music while our daughter's bridesmaids got ready in our unit. Jason was so very responsive and helpful. He was flexible with us and allowed us to arrive before our check-in time when we had family members who arrived early from the airport. Staying here was the best decision we made for the wedding weekend! We look forward to coming back to use it when we need to stay in Monroe overnight. This place was AWESOME!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very neat place and comfortable.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Condo was absolutely beautiful. However, the kitchen lacked some things that would be extremely helpful. We are cooks and really needed some type of baking sheet, more than 1 mixing / serving bowl, and measuring spoons / cups. The master bed also had a bird's nest effect, it definitely rolls you into the center, not uncomfortable, just demands closeness 😉. Other than that, it was outstanding. Beautiful, tastefully decorated, spacious, clean and cozy."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The historic building is a thing of beauty. We loved all the exposed brick and the industrial feel of the place. There were a couple restaurants and a coffee shop within walking distance, which was great. The host was proactive and had all information sent over to us before we arrived. Check out was a breeze. I highly recommend this place if you need somewhere in Monroe."

Jason communicated well and his place is set up so nice with lots of storage. We loved the collapsible carts downstairs that we could use on the elevator to help get things up to our condo, and then back down at check out. We also enjoyed the location and it was nice to walk to Mass at St. Matthews on Sunday. We will definitely book again on our next stay in Monroe!"

2020-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This space is beautiful and well decorated and in a great location to walk to several nice restaurants downtown. Check in was easy and host was easy to work with. The only drawback is that the walls in the building are very thin, so you can hear everyone around you. The experience of your stay might depend on how quiet the other guests around you are. For the most part, it was pleasant, but one of the nights we stayed, one of the neighbors had a screaming match above is, making it difficult to sleep. If you stay in the building, I would recommend staying in one of their bookings on the 3rd floor."

2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Talk about a spacious and interesting place. This is by far one of the prettiest AirBnB’s I’ve been in. Once you see the building you know you are in for a treat. The huge windows and creaky floors were my favorite part. Talk about a dream house!!!. The furnishings and decor were very well thought of. I would stay again in a heartbeat.

2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The condo/building was fantastic. Great blend of old brick walls and original hardwood floors updated with modern finish out.

2020-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed at the condos before just not this specific one and it looks exactly like the photos.
It’s beautiful and spacious!
We’ve never had any issues until this time around.
Unfortunately, the floors were soooo dirty.. like, I was walking barefoot all night and when I went to go shower at the end of the night my fiancé and i noticed my feet were totally black.
The toilet in the master room had been used prior to our arrival like someone had forgotten to flush because there was toilet paper and pee inside.
I know everyone uses the restroom but I don’t like opening a toilet only to find out someone didn’t have a courtesy to flush...
:(
We used a pot and pan and had to hand wash it prior to using because it had a grease film on it..
I usually never have any problems with these condos and Jason is super responsive however after spending $250 for the night I was kinda disappointed on the overall cleanliness of the place.
Don’t get me wrong, it’s totally beautiful place, very romantic and brings backs lots of memories because it’s where my (now) fiancé and I met for the first time but there was just those little details that kinda ruined the night for us :/
Overall it’s a nice and safe place to stay but we weren’t too happy this time around.
Hopefully our next stay is better because we do love these condos!"

2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This building was super cool , the unit was beautifully decorated, comfortable and well supplied. We enjoyed being close to restaurants, churches and bars. The host responded quickly and were very helpful, but we self checked in so we did not meet them. The building felt very safe and neighbors were quiet. If we ever make it back to Monroe we will stay again. Thank, Kathy and Davis"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jason and a Shelley have been awesome and extremely accommodating! We stay at Castle Hill Condos every time we come into town, and couldn’t imagine staying anywhere else! I highly recommend!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very charming, beautiful, clean condo in a historic building. Great size for our family of four stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Charming home in a great location! Very clean and comfortable…communication with Chandler was great!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Charming house that needs some updating. Musty smell on entering.Pilled sheets in one bedroom which made for uncomfortable sleeping. No window treatments in one bedroom except cheap shades and only one bedside table in each bedroom with one lamp.
Dated knotty pine kitchen cabinets. Very cheap coffee maker. Could use some nicer seating on the front porch.
I’d say the house has plenty of room for two people and the architectural charm of an 1930’s home that has been nicely painted but needs some TLC in the bedrooms and kitchen to make them more inviting."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was so comfortable and cute.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,we loved the place it was Adorable. The host answered any questions we had right away and messed to check if we needed anything. we would definitely stay here again.
2024-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,For the most part the place looked exactly like the photos. It wasn’t a great experience like past Airbnb in regard to the host responding. I wouldn’t recommend if you have any pet allergies as myself as it was lots of dog hair on the beds. Host did reach out to assist but response times were slow I wasn’t able to stay the first night but did stay second. Area seems pretty safe though
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay for a quick business trip! It was a quick 2 min drive to Starbucks and other great restaurants.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice house in a great location. Host was very helpful as we communicated throughout our stay.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Rarely do I stay at an Airbnb without having to be in constant communication with the host for one issue or another...that was not the case here!! Everything was exactly as described & was super accessible. If I had needed her, I'm sure she would have been just as responsive as she was during the booking phase, but again, everything was perfect, so I didn't have to bother her!
The house is an adorable older home in a great, very safe & convenient area. I HAD to book a pet friendly place & this one was everything I look for...big open yard that is fully enclosed, roomy interior for kennels, etc!(I will say, for the dog owners looking for a place, there are 2 pretty reactive dogs on the left side, but the neighbor was super nice and we worked together to manage when our puppies went out so they wouldn't fight through the fence!
Chandler even had a cute little Christmas tree set up, so I ended up doing a cute little Christmas photo shoot for me and my doggos! We will definitely be back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darling, comfortable house in a great location."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As a person who travels to Monroe often, I cannot even tell you how excited I am to have found Chandler’s place!
Perfectly homey with every amenity that you could want or need! We travel with my Frenchie, Julep, and she had a large and secured backyard to play in - which was a huge bonus!
The beds were extremely comfortable, and being able to drink coffee on the front porch was so relaxing!
The house was decorated so cute - with even a Christmas tree so we still felt “in the spirit” being away from home!
Chandler is a one-of-a-kind host! We had a slight hiccup with booking (due to rescheduling) and she was able to accommodate us seamlessly. She also checked in on us after our arrival just to see if we needed anything, which was very thoughtful!
If you’re going to be in Monroe - this is the place to stay! The neighborhood is quiet, but you are only blocks away from restaurants, shopping, etc.
Truly a GEM in the 318!"

I spent the week in Monroe for work, and the house was in a perfect location. The neighborhood was so charming and quiet. I spent the mornings drinking coffee on the front porch before starting the day.
Definitely will be staying here again next time I’m in town."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was the greatest experience… our stay was perfect! Chandler has little details all throughout the cottage that make you feel right at home. She was quick to respond to questions. The location is perfect! We fell in love with Monroe. We were in town for the World Series and so many of our friends had problems with their stay.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a precious little gem in the heart of the cutest city! Definitely a “home away from home.” Extraordinarily clean, beautiful natural light throughout, fantastic, new appliances, beautiful floors & the sweetest Host! Remarkable attention to detail in the best way from the front door to the back door & from floors to ceilings! Curl up anywhere in this abode with a good book of your own (or there are great books here to choose from!), or gaze out the windows watching the beautiful birds fly around & trees swaying in the breeze! Take an afternoon stroll on the sweet, quiet streets of the neighborhood while smelling the fragrances of the roses and other various fragrant flowers or sit on the porch and speak to the friendly neighbors! It’s all here!!! I wish I could give this host and home more than 5 stars! Excellent, Chandler!!! I’ll be back!!! :)"

Amanda was also gracious enough to allow us to park our car and trailer on a car pad beside the house, so if you’re a bigger vehicle or hauli- you’re in luck’
The space itself is bigger and nicer than I actually read from the photos! The bathroom is a bit outdated but it’s perfectly useable and we had no problem doing what we needed to do. The main bedroom king bed was spacious and it was a very comfortable mattress. The living space was really nice and the kitchen had everything we needed.
We were just doing a stop over on a road trip, but our stay was very comfortable and our dog enjoyed the yard to run and play in. We would stay again!"

This is an older home that has been beautifully renovated and decorated. The location is a quiet residential neighborhood. The bedding and towels were high quality. The kitchen had everything I needed. The two beds (one quite firm and the other softer) were very comfortable. There was a small, private patio area in the back where it was nice to sit while drinking my morning coffee or having a glass of wine in the evening. The large dining table in the kitchen also served as a good workspace for my computer and the wifi worked very well. There were no issues with the neighbors in the adjoining duplex. Would definitely stay here again!"

Everything was ready - including toiletries!
If we’re ever in Monroe again, we will definitely be back at this property!
My only hang up, the bedrooms did not have TVs. This is most definitely not a deal breaker for my family, it would’ve just been nice to have more than one TV. Maybe something for owners to consider?
Again, not a deal breaker, though!
Highly recommended for other guests!"

2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Overall the stay was great but it had a few flaws I didn’t like the rooms because they didn’t have televisions in them and the little patio space outside you didn’t have privacy had to share it with other people.

Check-in was a breeze thanks to Matt's clear instructions, and I was delighted to find the place impeccably clean and in excellent condition upon arrival. The attention to detail in the cleanliness and upkeep of the space truly exceeded my expectations.
Moreover, the location was ideal, providing easy access to all the attractions and amenities I needed during my stay. Whether it was recommendations for local restaurants or tips for navigating the area, Matt was a wealth of knowledge and made me feel right at home.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I (and basset hound Daisy Mae) were traveling from St. Paul, MN to Lafayette, LA and made Monroe our final stop. This was a perfect little home for us - very clean and in a nice, quiet and safe neighborhood close to the downtown areas. Everything was exactly as shown in the pictures. The backyard was fenced in so we could let Daisy Mae sniff around without worry of traffic (but it's a pretty quiet neighborhood anyway). Monroe was a great town as well. Had coffee and lunch at Standard Coffee and it was an amazing find if you're particular about coffee, and their lunches were above and beyond the expected coffee-house fare. We'd definitely stay at this place again on our next trip, though it may be more of a destination next time."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Another great stay at Amanda’s home! Knowing what we were arriving to after a long day’s drive made the stay so much less stressful. Amanda sets you up with water and snacks right off the bat, and her home was spotless. Our dogs enjoyed the fenced yard while we unloaded the car and settled in. Thanks to her list of restaurants we even ordered in some local fish and chips.
Amanda is incredibly responsive via text and even sent a note where we could find extra blankets if needed that night. We consider this place a top stay for a road trip and hopefully we’ll be back again next year!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We’ve stayed in well over a dozen Airbnbs (5 in the past week) during a North to East and now Coast to Coast roadtrip. Amanda’s place was my best night sleep, hands down.
The place had a nostalgic feel with a mix of vintage pieces, modern furnishing, with beautiful accents, some old, some new. Thoughtfully and tastefully decorated to give you a sense of warmth and comfort.
Rated cutest kitchen ever!
Rated squeaky clean!
Rated most well-lit fenced in back yard for the pups!
If we ever pass this way again. Amanda’s place will be our pick for a place to rest our travel- weary heads.
And Amanda was a prompt and helpful communicator who also left us a nice snack basket.
We highly recommend this sweet spot!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect home to rest and relax for a night! We were driving cross country and Monroe was a good stopping point to break up the drive. Amanda’s place was exactly as described and we appreciated the local food recs (even ordered a pizza for the list which was delish!). We had our two boxers with us and appreciated the fenced yard which allowed us to unload our car with ease and peace of mind for our fur kids.
Amanda was very quick to respond when I had a check out question, and even let us check out a few minutes late to accommodate my husband taking a work meeting! Internet was top notch (my husband is a software engineer so internet matters a LOT to us) and the bed was super comfy.
We will be back when we pass through next month!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"With pet fees so expensive at mediocre highway hotels, it was nice to relax for a night at this cozy cottage and let our doggie take his time in the fenced in yard. The cottage is darling and very comfortable. The kitchen was very will equipped, even though we didn't need to use it."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This house is exactly as described- a cozy charming cottage. To my surprise, a Christmas tree was perfectly decorated in the living room and few Christmas decorations were located in the kitchen making this feel more like a home away from home. The house was clean and the beds were comfy. We enjoyed the fact that it was perfectly located for our travel needs. I loved that Amanda is so thoughtful that a list of recommended local restaurants were left on the refrigerator. The fenced in backyard was great since we were traveling with pets. I highly recommend staying here."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely little house. Perfect for myself, my husband, and our dogs. Amanda has done a great job decorating and choosing nice furnishings. The backyard was fully fenced and large. Perfect for our dogs. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a charming, cozy cottage! We love this perfect, little home that is convenient to ULM, wonderful restaurants and our favorite desserts at Eskimo’s. We felt safe and the neighborhood is quiet. The home is absolutely precious and we loved having two bedrooms, a walk-in shower, full kitchen, washer and drier, covered parking and a nice backyard. Amanda was so kind and surprised us with a complimentary snack basket with waters. She knew we would have a late afternoon arrival and left the front porch and interior lamps on for us for when we arrived. We will definitely be booking her home on all our future visits to Monroe. Thanks, Amanda, for sharing your home with us!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Honestly, this is an awesome place to stay. We all slept great, felt comfortable, and enjoyed all of the amenities! There’s everything you could need. The yard was so awesome for our kid and dogs. It was an amazing stay to unwind and kick back. Johnnys pizza is delicious we tried it thanks to Amanda’s recommendations on the fridge! Definitely come stay here if you come to Monroe!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Amanda’s place on our way to Houston. I appreciated how Amanda reached out to let me know she would be dropping laundry detergent by before we had even gotten there. Once we arrived, the place smelled clean, was well kept, and was a nice respite from the road. We ordered Indian food through Doordash, took showers, watched some TV, and slept before we got back on the road early the next day. The beds & couch were so comfy. While our visit was short, we will keep her place in mind if we are ever back in Monroe. It’s a quiet, peaceful neighborhood but close to many restaurants and stores if needed. Check-out instructions were simple and clear."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Big thanks to Amanda for hosting my family of three humans and two pups at her lovely little property in Monroe! The property was well kept on the outside with a spacious backyard for our dogs. The location is very central to all of Monroe, so whatever the reason you’re visiting, the location is great! The neighborhood is safe & quiet. The inside was spotless and comfortable! This was, hands down, the cleanest pet-friendly listing I’ve stayed at and there was no animal odor. The kitchen is fully stocked for cooking should you be staying long enough to utilize the refrigerator space, range & oven. The water pressure in the bathroom was good & the bedding was comfortable. I highly recommend this property for your stay in Monroe and won’t hesitate to book Amanda’s listing again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a cute little place!! Perfect for our family of four while traveling through the area. Home is newly renovated yet not overly modernized.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home is so nice we have stayed twice. It’s very clean, cool, and comfortable. The location is easy to get to. Check in couldn't be easier. And the back yard is a huge plus if you have a pet."
2023-08-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Please beware that there are several unmarked tripping hazard ""steps"" inside the house such as the bathroom threshold, laundry room threshold, and a line between the kitchen and living room. The one at the bathroom is especially difficult to see as it blends into the floor. I hurt my knee on this step the first night and spent the entire next day in bed.
The walkway leading up to the house is wood and quite uneven which could also be a tripping hazard.
The fence was down upon arrival (after verifying with the host that the yard was fully fenced for our dogs). It was down due to repair and was fixed the next morning but a heads up would have been appreciated before arrival.
The doors stick and can be very difficult to open at times.
The property was clean, the bed, and couch were comfortable."

Amanda and Robert were totally awesome hosts even opening their personal home to me on Fourth of July. Amanda went above and beyond the call of a host numerous times and responded to my questions and needs ASAP. This awesome little house made my World Horseshoe Tournament 3 weeks, way better. I personally know 4 situations will my friends that was just horrible with their ABnB whilst there and they were jealous of mine. If you're looking for a Holiday Inn, go there. If you're looking for an awesome house at a totally reasonable price that you can feel home in. Contact Amanda. I personally expressed my feelings to Amanda and would recommend this house in a heartbeat. Thank you again Amanda and Robert. God bless, Gerald"

She responded to all my messages very quickly and she was a great host!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was in a great location in the city. The neighborhood was tranquil and the fenced in backyard yard was a great place to sit and have coffee in the morning. It provided a huge space for my fur baby to explore safely. It was better than we expected. We were very happy with the accommodations. Check in and check out protocols were simple which was another plus for me.

It's an easy drive to one of the best Cajun-Creole restaurants I've ever been: Warehouse 1. What a treat! If not from the distance to home in Acworth, Georgia, my wife & I could eat there very often.

The cottage is cute, but it was enough to accomodate 4 adults + a toddler, and it was very cozy! The snack basket she had ready on the kitchen counter was also a nice treat. And she’s quick to respond if you have any questions about your stay. I would totally recommend this AirBNB to anyone."

The Christmas tree and other decorations were so cute. It was such a nice touch to have tasty snacks and water provided when we first walked in. My small dog loved the fenced in back yard.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location. Everything just as advertised. Very cordial hosts. Responded very quickly when we had a small issue .
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amanda’s property was a quaint home. It reminded me of visiting country relative where it’s charming and comfortable. The neighbor and his excited pooch alarmed us when we pulled up (we’re not pet people) but he quickly put us at ease.
The house sits on a corner so expect to hear passing traffic at night…thankfully not much at all. That’s just a tip for light sleepers. You might want to sleep in the room to the right. The beds were comfy. Linens were fresh. This house is fully stocked…snacks included. Squeaky floors and squeaky clean dishes (can you tell that I can be a bit persnickety?? 😆) My main negative (though not enough to alter my rating) would be the shower. Warm water with great pressure but I’m not sure if the stains were rust or mold. Bring flip flops if you’re weird about things like that.
If I return to Monroe, I would look for something more modern but that’s ONLY because it’s my preference. That in NO way reflects on this home. Having said that I WOULD recommend it."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Judi was an exceptional host! The property itself is beautifully renovated. You feel like you are in a 1930 farm house, but completely modernized and with all the amenities. We watched the sunrise and sunset on the bayou, daily, but we also walked ULM’s campus every day. The kitchen is so well appointed we never left once we arrived with our groceries. We played corn hole with the kids in the backyard and games at the dining table. The two tables seating 10 each gave us more than enough room for all! It slept all 10 people in our party very comfortably and would sleep many more. I highly recommend Judi and this property to anyone visiting the Monroe area. We will be back!

2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"My family of 6 had a great stay at Gabrielle’s place. There were a few minor items that need a little attention/repair, but nothing substantial. The kitchen is fairly well stocked with utensils, pans. The house is adorable and very comfortable. We had some issues with a dog barking at the neighbor’s house, which we did message about. Not much can be done by Gabrielle about this, but it made it difficult to be out back and was disruptive late at night - it eventually quieted down and we slept fine though. All in all it was a great stay, and we will likely stay again when we visit family again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely updated home! So comfortable! We didn’t need for a thing & I don’t think I have ever stayed in a cleaner airbnb. Lots of hot water. We had a quick question for Gabrielle & she responded immediately. :)
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place... very peaceful and I was able to catch a high school football championship game
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place to stay! Convenient and near downtown. Definitely will stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying here, and we have felt very safe and at home each time! Gabrielle is very accommodating, and we enjoyed ourselves!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely beautiful home that Gabrielle hosts. This is such a perfect location and space if you’re visiting Monroe. It’s very clean, nicely designed and has plenty of high end touches. Would absolutely recommend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved this place!
The decor felt just like home with cozy antiques and homey furnishings.
Host was more than accommodating and gracious.
We will definitely stay here again if we are in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location and beautiful home. Gabrielle was very communicative and responsive. I’d definitely stay here again
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay. Very spacious. Was just like the photos. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was perfect for what we needed: Nicely decorated, up to date, spacious, and easy to get find. Only issues we had were with the front door lock not cooperating with us, and would've liked to turn on the front Tiger sign for photos but everything else was perfect. 5/5."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great weekend here during Neville’s Homecoming. Everything was fantastic, the beds were comfy, and the space was large! Loved the grill and backyard area. Looking forward to staying many more times! If you’re not from the area this house is perfect! Quiet and close to everything you won’t regret it"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gabrielle, we had and amazing time! The house is precious, well maintained and in a great location. Would definitely stay again!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was in the perfect location for our weekend softball tournament. The house was clean and decorated so cute!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was an answer to prayer! We got to Monroe and the original Airbnb we booked was a disaster and we could not stay there. I looked up another options and within 3 minutes we had this one booked and Gabrielle was letting us get in early! Everyone was wonderful and we felt right at home!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute house. Lovely neighborhood. Comfy beds and lots of pillows!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"This place was nice, clean, and roomy. The appliance was up-to-date and working, but some of the bedroom furniture was very dated. Overall the home was inviting. The bedrooms were suitable for our needs. The best home amenity was having enough cooking ware and eating utensils for our group of 6. The only small issue is not having a front porch light, but the area was peaceful even with the school being across the street. We wanted to take pictures by the Tiger sign but half of the sign was inoperable, so we took most of our pictures out on the deck which was picturesque. Would recommend and use again when coming to town for a vacation, if available. Also, the hostess was sweet and gave quick responses."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Loved staying here. Felt at home for the weekend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first stay in an Airbnb, and we loved every minute of our stay. The living quarters were very roomy and comfortable as well as the bedrooms. The family also toured Landry’s Vinyard and tasted some excellent homemade wines."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,First of all Gabrielle was amazing. She was very responsive and she accommodated our needs beyond our expectations. The home was very clean and exactly like the pictures. Our stay was wonderful here. It couldn’t have been any better. Definitely would stay again!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,If you are looking for a quiet house with great modern charm THIS IS IT! We felt right at home. The cleaning crew missed a few things but Gabrielle was very responsive and offered options to fix the problem. We will be back soon! Great place.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you sleep in the master bedroom and someone else is up watching TV in the living room you will be able to hear it. The TV and the head board of the bed share the same wall.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gabrielle place was very clean and she was very helpful and responsive! Will definitely be staying next time we come into to town!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay in the Tiger House. It was very comfortable and was just large enough for us to host a few family members over who live in the area. The grill and backyard were great for both my parents, siblings and small children who visited us and live in the area. My husband and I were both pleased with the kitchen, bathrooms and living spaces. The mattress was a little firm for our taste, but that is a preference thing. Additionally, there were some birds nesting in the fireplace in the primary bedroom that needed to be cleaned out. Occasionally, they’d make chirping sounds (as birds do). It was kind of nice and kinda annoying at the same time. I’ve given that feedback to Gabrielle, so it’s likely been resolved. We will certainly be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Thank you so much for a home away from home for our friends to meet up and prepare for a week full of exams. The three rooms and large living space made the crew feel right at home and the kitchen was perfect for prepping and enjoying meals all together. Could not recommend this home enough!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Beautifully decorated and very comfortable! It had everything we needed for our stay. Highly recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay for a quick weekend! The host was very helpful with getting a steamer sent to the house when we asked if there was one already there. Overall, it was really nice!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great place! Gabrielle was super, responsive and friendly! The place was in a great location, very nice accommodations. The Fresh Flowers that were throughout the house were such a nice touch."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely quiet space, conveniently located, in a beautiful safe neighborhood. Although I didn’t use them, it offers an inside basketball court and swimming pool. It has a spa like atmosphere. And the air conditioner works great too. Great host and hostess. Easy self checkin and checkout. I highly recommend staying there. The price is great too. It definitely felt like home away from home."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Like to play so much going back there again in December
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Joshua and Melissa’s place is wonderful! I stayed there for three months while doing a clinical rotation at a nearby hospital. I felt extremely safe in the neighborhood. It was an incredibly quiet and private space. Additionally it was so incredibly clean when I moved in. I would definitely recommend staying here!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it was a great stay for my usage. I will be traveling here 2 times per month and this will be my spot unless I bring the familyand would need a kitchen and more seating. for me the perfect price and location

Location was convenient to the events I attended.
Television was easy to use.
I"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely loved it! The space was cozy and beautiful. The host was incredibly welcoming.
Also the calmness of the outside porch with a pool view was an added delight."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have one complaint about Joshua and Melissa's space. It's that we couldn't stay longer! The location was very easy to find, close to I-20 and eating places. We were pleasantly met at the door by Melissa and ushered into a very unique space with the basketball court, bedroom, bath, and kitchen area. I have to admit that we had been in four previous b&bs on our trip, so I had forgotten the details on this spot and didn't realize there was also the shared space including the shared pool, living space, and BBQ area. We were only there one evening, so we didn't see that part and can't leave a review for it. The bedroom was cozy and the bed comfortable. The bathroom is very spacious and well stocked. Joshua and Melissa were very responsive to our questions. We will definitely try to stay here again and use all of the space and amenities! I think you'll enjoy your stay here!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Joshua’s place! The communication was super easy and quick, and the place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. Although it was too cold to utilize the pool, we took full advantage of the basketball court and loved every minute of it. I would definitely recommend Joshua’s place!"

If we ever return🤞, we will stay here again 💛"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,WONDERFUL! We really enjoyed our stay. It’s very unique with the indoor basketball court. When you first enter the apartment you walk into the basketball court area. But we loved it. We are both active and we really enjoyed just shooting around in the evenings. I could not even find anything else like this at this price point. Bedroom is cute and bathroom is huge. And The area to chill and entertain is by the pool. But having the pool area right there was nice and I’m sure we would’ve enjoyed it more if it were a bit less humid . This place was a great find and real gem. The host was very responsive when we had a question or need. Would definitely stay again
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I was driving through and stopped for the night. The basketball court was amazing for the kiddos to get some energy out after sitting in the car all day. The home was so clean and at a great price. I would recommend this place and will absolutely stay in the future. Beautiful neighborhood too.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Unique, not run of the mill lodging. Climate control was good and it was just what I needed. Would stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our 2 night stay here! It was me and 3 kids ages 4, 8, and 12. I also had my 1 year old grand daughter for a day. She crawled around all over the place, including the basketball court. The place was so clean that her knees and hands weren't dirty at all afterward! If you have kids, you know how impressive that is for a nightly rental. The kids enjoyed playing basketball. We all enjoyed the pool. The host was very responsive to any questions I had and helped me when I needed to edit my reservation at the last minute. They also set up an extra floor mattress for us, which I really appreciated. There were a few snacks and some drinks in the little refrigerator that we also appreciated. The beds were comfortable. The towels were soft and fluffy. The neighborhood was nice, and I felt safe going to my car at night. Everything was just like it is in the pictures. This is one of the best stays I've had away from home in a while! Thanks so much for having us!"

I hope your grandkids appreciate the place as much as we did! ❤️
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joshua's place really ticked all the boxes. we needed a place to stay that felt more homey. It really was good to arrive , even though it was dark. the description and the check in photos really helped.
We were looking for a different lock box/key pad which was clearly in plain sight. I think we were tired from our drive..... We really had a great night sleep, quiet and safe neighborhood."
