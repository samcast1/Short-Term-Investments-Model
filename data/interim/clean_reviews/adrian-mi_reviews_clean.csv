2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Songbird Cottage was a balm to my soul! It was so peaceful listening to the rustling cornstalks, the rolling thunder, and the giggling children raking and throwing leaves on each other. And the cottage inside truly earned a 5-star rating‚Äîa comfortable, beautiful gift. But the best part was how welcoming Joanna was, from homemade granola to stopping by to lend me a cutting board so I could make my daughter and her friends supper. Visiting my daughter at college made some beautiful memories, and I will definitely return!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are needing a break from busy life, this is the spot! Very peaceful and the perfect spot to recharge. Snack basket and water were a nice touch. Love the soft throw and chairs on the porch."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, quaint place. It was perfect for my wife and me.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cottage was so nice! It felt like a home away from home, even for just spending one night. Only 15 minutes away from the City of Adrian, where there was conveniently a Marshall‚Äôs, Meijer‚Äôs, Walmart, Starbucks etc. The cottage itself, is peacefully located in the country surrounded by farmland.
I definitely recommend booking this cottage if you‚Äôre looking for a tranquil spot to vacation or just needing a quiet & cozy place to rest before heading farther North in Michigan :)
Additionally, the host offered early check-in for my daughter and I, if we happened to be in the area earlier than the 3:00pm check-in time, which I thought was super hospitable and kind. The check out time was 12:00pm, which was awesome, considering a lot of airbnbs have earlier check-outs; so instead of rushing around trying to pack & leave, we got to relax a bit in the morning :)
My daughter also loved the chocolate bar & Cheetos snacks in the basket graciously provided by the Host!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay in this very peaceful, immaculate, cozy cottage. We were in Michigan to bike the Kiwanis Trail so this was a perfect location and memorable stay. The hosts were great to work with and the fresh eggs were delightful!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time at this beautiful studio apt in downtown Tecumseh. We loved that we could bring our dogs and were able to walk them right outside the apartment. We also loved how walkable the apartment was to all of the shops and restaurants in downtown Tecumseh. The only time we used our car was to go for a hike and it was only 15 minutes away. I also requested a special gift basket as a surprise for my husband since the weekend getaway was to celebrate his birthday and they put together an amazing cheese and wine basket for us that we enjoyed all weekend. The wifi could be a little unreliable at times but there are plenty of places around town with free public WiFi where we could go to work for a bit. Hope to be able to come back again soon.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time in Tecumseh. Apartment was clean and in walking distance to many restaurants and shops. It was a little out of the way for why I was there (UM football game) but that was on me and had nothing to do with the place. Highly recommend!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, cute, centrally located, great value. Stairs, as described in the listing, are steep and pretty challenging if you have much luggage or a physical problem. Would definitely stay there again and pack lighter for the stairs."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was a nice spot for a quick overnight. Cute area. As Erica says, the building is old. If you have allergies, I would not recommend staying here. It smells a little musty. The stairs are very steep."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed a lovely, albeit quick stay. The bed is softer than my husband and I usually like, but we were both very comfortable.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We decided to take a last minute trip and Erika's place was open! It was located in the center of downtown and I loved that many things were walkable. Parking was close and Erika was always responsive when I messaged her. The steps up to the floor are steep but it goes with the age of the building and we didn't mind. Place was clean and seemed to have anything we would've needed dif we had stayed longer. Highly recommend and would go back again when we visit the area again.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a cute town - wish we had more time to explore. The building had great charm. All was clean and we had everything we needed. Would definitely stay there again. The stairs where steep, as mentioned in other reviews, but they weren't an issue for us."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very quaint and clean place. The bed and pillows are very comfortable too. Highly recommend it.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very cozy place right in the heart of downtown Tecumseh. There was some outside noise at night since it was the weekend but other than that it‚Äôs quiet and no neighbor noise. Lots of local and chain restaurants and stores within a couple minutes walking distance. The host was very gracious and left me a bottle of wine even though I was only staying one night. 5/5 would stay again.

2023-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Clean place, comfortable bed. Host was easy to communicate with and left a complimentary bottle of wine for us. If you‚Äôre sensitive to noise , bring a sound machine. Lots of noise (cars and people talking loudly) from the street overnight."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Erika‚Äôs place was perfect for what I needed (a stop on a cross-country drive). The stairs are indeed as steep as described so be extra mindful of that if you have difficulty. Erika was super kind when I reached out to confirm the place was pet friendly :) They also reached out day of to let me know when I was able to check in, how to reach out to them, and that a complimentary bottle of wine was left! Inside the studio as well was a little reminder of how to contact them as well as an adorable hostess stand in the hallway with little goodies/necessities as well. Really get communication and cute little studio in a sweet town. Definitely would stay here again if I were ever in the area :)"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed my stay very much. The space was cute and cozy and comfortable. At first I was confused about where to park. Maybe Erika could include a sentence about parking?
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location! Great host! Great stay!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for offering this simple, cute Efficiency Apartment to travelers like us. We were visiting friends in a nearby town and loved that your place was uncomplicated cozy and right downtown within walking distance to the many unique shops and Restaurants. Got los of amazing Bread at the Bread and Pasty shop, delicious unique cheese at your store right below the apartment and we loved our lunch experience at the British Tea Garden."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay at Erika‚Äôs French Studio and, just like the first visit, it was just what we needed. Clean, comfortable and ideally located in downtown Tecumseh, this our go-to when visiting our Michigan family. Although the steep staircase might eliminate some guests, if stairs are not an issue, any one of Erika‚Äôs studios would be a great choice for lodging in Tecumseh."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Erika was an amazing host! I recommend her 100% for a nice and peaceful stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We love staying here. Erika deserves the title ""Super Host"". She is always accessible and quick to respond. she left us a nice bottle of wine as a gift. I was able to go downstairs to Boulevard Market and purchase some cheese and crackers prior to checking in. We had a nice dinner and went out on the town all within a few blocks of our room. Great experience!"
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Great location - walkable to Tecumseh's abundant downtown shops and restaurants. For a shorter stay this would be great (which we have done previously). We prefer a firmer bed and better stocked kitchen for a longer stay. Erika was super responsive when a small issue arose and it was resolved quickly. Appreciated the bottle of wine she left us :)
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay here and another great visit. A couple of new shops within walking distance have opened since I was here earlier in the year. Pita Delite across the street has delicious food. On the next block, The Vault is a great spot for ice cream. I was here on a Saturday, so was able to visit the Tecumseh Historical Museum. Once the volunteers there found out where I was staying, they brought out some old photos to show me other businesses that once occupied the space. Very cool. I was in town for the Holiday Open House and the streetscape lighting ceremony. Hundreds of people gathered on the street to watch the holiday lights get turned on. A true small-town hometown feel. I'll be back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, clean, great location."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Apartment was very comfortable, clean & had everything we needed"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved staying in the French studio! I felt safe staying alone and it was such a comfortable place to just rest and recoup. I will one hundred percent come back!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful little apartment perfect for us and our two fur babies. We were all relaxed and warm after a cold camping week. Shopped the store below and made ourselves a yummy charcuterie board to match with the commplimentary merlot. Perfect spot to walk down and shop at other local places as well.

Hardwood floors, spacious bathroom, and I like that the bed is in a little alcove. The bed is very comfy. I love everything about this old building and check in and check out are super easy. I always enjoy hitting the shops in the area. I thought it was very quiet. Not a lot of road noise, even for the holiday. I look forward to visiting again."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"‚ÄúLittle Europe‚Äù in Tecumseh
As a British Citizen but Resident Alien living in Manchester Michigan for the past 32 years we have been remodeling our turn-of-the-century farmhouse and every room is under some construction, needs fixes, and is a serious trip hazard. Plus, August at our house is bat month when these flying rodents somehow escape the attic and explore the house! After two months of this combination of challenges, I needed a break. So, I thought that getting a nearby Airbnb for a night would be the tonic for a hazard-free, stress-free, bat-free, break. Airbnbs are all around and what sounded enticing was the French Studio in nearby Tecumseh, half a block along Chicago Street from Tecumseh Brewing, which I already frequent. Perfect. Erika, a super-host, with her husband John let these ‚ÄúEuropean studios‚Äù (I believe there are six or so) are each styled after a particular European country. The French Studio for France, Italian for Italy etc. Climbing up a long steep flight of stairs nestled about halfway down the corridor was the French Studio. Entering you really do feel like you are in France, Paris actually. The first thing of note is just like Paris hotels and studios, they are small but cozy, sparse but adequate. Europeans may not get the American-style shower, and certainly not the portable air conditioner (Only 1% of British homes have A/C, which in England means to open a window!). Erika‚Äôs studio has this but does not have a dishwasher, just like European Studios. Drawing a richer French picture was the decor, which had touches of French art and symbols such as you would find in Lyon or Nice. As a host, Erika is super responsive to questions and suggestions. But there is more. Beneath the studios is a European cheese and wine shop, with an abundance of imported delicious European cheeses and wine pairings. I am in there like I was on vacation in France spending way too much and s guy walks in placing two just-made Mozzarella balls in a refrigerator. This was John Erika‚Äôs husband who along with her owns and runs the store. Walk a couple of doors down and you come to a British Tea Garden, with a gazillion teas, British fav foods, specialty British food, including cottage pie, beef pasty, and even a Ploughman‚Äôs lunch which can be enjoyed in the cozy British Pantry Tea Garden or rooftop garden caf√©. So, Erika‚Äôs European Studios are at the heart of Tecumseh‚Äôs Little Europe and, like being in Paris or Rome are part of the richer European experience right outside your door. I was transported from my stress into this mini-vacation just 9 miles from the remodeling hell and I recovered ready for a fresh start. Thank you, Erika, for being so friendly and open to suggestions and enhancements."

The host offered a complimentary bottle of wine and additional supplies in the hall including snacks, water, tp, and ear plugs. I have no idea why people are driving around 24 hours a day up there, but they are! The traffic didn‚Äôt bother me a bit as I live in a larger city, the periods of silence were more notable. I had a great dinner at the restaurant behind (the station) and started my day at musgrove coffee shop across the street. Highly recommend both. Great value for a lovely stay in a small town."

We will definitely be back!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"ok so we stayed in the French themed apt. it was awesome. I felt like I was actually staying in a euro-flat in a small quint little town.
Pros: kitchen, bathroom, overlooks little town, safe, lots of shops to walk to, and wine and cheese shoppe directly underneath the apts. french apt is pet-friendly and our doggy was so peaceful there. Bed was perfect. it is so soft and warm and the linens are great quality. We travel all over the world, so I always appreciate a great bed.
Cons: ZERO
Honestly, I I loved this place. However, it's on the second floor, so do not choose it if you are afraid of stairs or simply cannot go up them. I really enjoyed the stairs. They give the building an extra bit of cool touch to the ambiance.
I will definitely stay here next month when we return."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved this little studio for my stay in Tecumseh. I loved the historic nature of the building; it‚Äôs a great location in Tecumseh!

Great outdoor space.
Overall it served its purpose. Thank you for being a great host."
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,Nice cozy home. Perfect for college graduations. Well stocked and spacious rooms. My only cons were that some of the beds were uncomfy and the downstairs bathroom didn‚Äôt drain properly. neighborhood is nice and quiet.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Some of the nicest people I have met
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, clean Airbnb. We were in town for a dance competition. We had five people in our group. More than enough room. Tastefully decorated. Beds comfy. Had everything we needed and more‚Ä¶milk, eggs, bagels! Owners lived right next door and were super friendly. Huge backyard, although we didn‚Äôt get time to have a fire or anything. The only downside was we don‚Äôt get our daughter‚Äôs dance schedule until a week before and we didn‚Äôt need Friday. We tried to contact Evolve to get some of our money back for Friday but they didn‚Äôt respond for a few days. Then they did respond to say they had a two day minimum and wouldn‚Äôt be able to refund any money. We should have read the details before booking but just be aware of the 2 day minimum and the cancellation policy. Otherwise, we really enjoyed our stay and would return."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for four guys on a work retreat. Calm and peaceful neighborhood and easy access to everything the home offered. Very clean and very nice owners.

It‚Äôs definitely an historic home and obviously that brings character, but it‚Äôs been nicely updated in the bathrooms and common spaces. By far the most well-stocked kitchen that we have ever experienced in an AirBnB! They even had eggs, milk, bagels, and more in the fridge and advised we were welcome to it.
Would absolutely recommend this place!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location. Nice neighborhood
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house had a home feel immediately because of the intentional decorations and personalized touches. The lack of a large dinning table was made up for in all of the personal touches. We would absolutely book this home again. Any Adrian College parents or alumni should absolutely stay here.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was exactly as described in the listing. The hosts were extremely generous in their accommodations, leaving lots of snacks, drinks and a stocked fridge for us to enjoy. Would definitely stay again, and recommend to others."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Your home was wonderful and very welcoming. We enjoyed the view and everything about your home. It was very well stocked and in order. We didn‚Äôt have to reach out to her about anything when it came to her home. Besides putting the lock box back up. And she told me that they had that under control. She worked with us with our check in time also. And the checkout time was really reasonable also. We loved your home and will considered it in the future when we do come back to visit. Y‚Äôall please book

Clean, comfortable and peaceful - we felt like we were coming home after a day of being out & about. Everything was at the cottage for you to have a stress-free stay. We plan to rent the cottage again when we are in Michigan."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oh my gosh, do yourself a favor and just stay here for the peace and quiet!

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Best place ever to stay. Very clean. Great country setting. You will not be disappointed if you stay here. Many hours just sitting on the porch watching the pond life and chatting. By far the best place we have rented in the Michigan area.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,We heartily recommend Deanna's & Denise's cottage to those who value beautiful surroundings and solitude while only minutes from town.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I stayed at the Farm Cottage in July (2022) with my wife and 2 children. I could not ask for anything more from an AirBnB. 10/10 for cleanliness, amenities, location, communication, etc. We really enjoyed being out in the country and found it very peaceful. There was plenty of nature to observe and my 12 year old daughter loved getting to feed the sheep some animal crackers! We will definitely stay here again if we come back to the Tecumseh/Adrian area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friends and I met at the Cottage for a weekend get-away. It was just the right size for us and the area was so beautiful. The cottage was very clean and had everything we needed. Mornings were special sitting in the rocking chairs on the front porch and listening to the birds sing. We loved listening to the silly sheep and feeding them their animal crackers. Baaaaaa!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wow what a nice cottage! Everything was so clean and comfortable and well stocked and we had a great time. Great setup for kids - we had a 4 year old and an infant and they provided everything we needed and more! Perfect front porch for relaxing with a coffee & watching the gorgeous sunrise. Tons of wildlife and my little ones loved visiting with the sheep! Very kind and generous hosts. Would definitely stay again if another family trip brings us back to the area!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing view with privacy!! This is one of the nicest properties I have rented. Hosts were very accommodating and quick to respond. Definitely recommend if quiet country and nature views are on your bucket list!
We found kayaking, strawberry picking and Footloose the musical all nearby.
Kitchen is well stocked and accommodating for cooking and eating in. Lots of little touches and warm and welcoming. Most guests speak of the porch and it does not disappoint. Make sure to take some time to just relax and enjoy the property; it is beautiful."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home on a country road, not far off the main road. Just be aware of the wildlife crossing the road. It was a very peaceful place to relax in between events, during our very busy weekend. Enjoy!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at the farmhouse while in the area for a family event. The place was cozy and comfortable. There's a Busch's grocery store about 10/15min away. The area was quiet with a nice view of a pond from the porch.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We traveled with our two sons - 9 and 16. We all loved the porch and view of the pond and watching the blue herron, chipmunks, goldfinches, rabbits and beaver. Very clean, well appointed home with plenty of room downstairs for the kids to hang out in. Not far from grocery store as well."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful home with an even better view! We enjoyed our stay so much. We were only am hour away from the Toledo Zoo as well.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you! We had a wonderful stay. My only concern was the water smelled a bit like sulfur but otherwise everything was perfect and we very much enjoyed ourselves.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This rental is fabulous and perfect! I've stayed here several times this past school year (visiting my son in college) and I look forward to future visits over the upcoming years. This is my ""home away from home"" and it saddens me whenever I have to leave and head back to reality. Mahalo Nui Loa ..."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"You won't have any regrets staying here, especially if you're from a city. Hosts are awesome and the rental is literally a ""home away from home"", it's so peaceful ... no neighbors!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is in a great location if you are looking for peace and quiet. It is not far away from town, but far enough to enjoy the country. The host is awesome, responds very quickly, and willing to answer any questions. The place was a perfect size for my Family, 3 bedrooms, 1 upstairs (main level), and 2 downstairs. A bathroom on each floor. Kitchen has about everything you need, we only had to pick-up a few special utensils. I hope you get a chance to stay here, I think you'll agree, it's an awesome place."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This Airbnb is excellent in all aspects! Information provided is ""spot on"" and even better when you actually get there.
Rental is peaceful and beautiful and being from Hawaii, I got to experience my ""Winter Wonderland"" on a few occasions which was memorable and fun.
In the future, this is my ""home away from home"" as long as the dates are available.
Deanna, ""Mahalo Nui Loa"" and see you in 2022 ... Mele Kalikimaka and Hauoli Makahiki Hou!!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spotlessly clean, and everything looked brand new -- I was surprised to see from the guest book that there had been many other visitors. It is not luxurious, but has everything you might need. Host is very polite and communicative. It is a good place to stay for a visit to Tecumseh, and I will use again."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is heaven. I never wanted to leave! Peaceful, serene and just a gem! Absolutely the best and I hope to stay there again. Just a couple minutes from town but it feels like your own private paradise. An absolute must stay if you are in the area!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are a very busy family that needed some time to unplug and unwind. This was our first time renting a vacation property outside of a hotel or resort. We didn't know what to expect, but we were blown away from the moment we pulled into the driveway. The pond (small lake) was gorgeous. The house was spotless and well appointed. We brought everything we thought we'd need, everything we didn't think of was provided and then some. The fishing was great, not sport fishing by any means but never more than a short wait for a bite. Our children loved feeding the sheep. The fire pit by the pond was great for some evening smores. The place was so peaceful and tranquil. We live in a city environment, so for us being so close to nature was an amazing change of pace. O wpuld give this place 10 stars is it was an option. We will most assuredly rent this cottage again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the best rental I've stayed at by far! There is no comparison-the layout amenities location etc. This place is definitely five stars! Wow!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was beautiful both inside and out. Inside was nicely decorated and anything that you could need for your stay was provided. Outside was a tranquil country setting. Hosts provided all you need to have a camp fire along the pond in the evening. It was just a perfect weekend getaway
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house with clear interior space division. Gorgeous front view and a nice comfortable porch. The goats next door are also adorable.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Simply put, it doesn't get better than this Airbnb! From check-in to check-out it was fabulous. THE most peaceful, clean and well equipped property we've stayed at to date. You WON'T be disappointed!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All I can say is it exceeded our expectations just a beautiful place to get . If any issues came up they were right there!

This is a great place to stay!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice place to spend a few days. Clean, modern, and well appointed. It's a bit remote, but that was a plus for us.

2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage was a true hidden gem. We had a little bit of a hard time finding the place due to our GPS but luckily once we realized where the little path off the road was located we had no issue. It was just my husband and I but this would have been a great get away for several couples or a family. The place was super clean, very cozy and well decorated. It was so quiet outside and the deck was great for sitting and watching the neighboring sheep graze. There was also a gas grill and fire pit in the front which would have been nice to use if the weather was slightly warmer.
We truly enjoyed our stay and would 10/10 recommend this for a country get away!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at the cottage! A little off the beaten path with gorgeous views. We were able to take time during our days to venture to nearby cities and caught a football game in Ann Arbor(GO BLUE!) and were incredibly grateful to come ‚Äúhome‚Äù to this warm and cozy cottage. Plenty of space for everyone to spread out. We enjoyed hopping around nearby towns to check out local stores and coffee shops. Beautiful views and a wonderful stay. 5 stars all around!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was sparkling clean, close to so many different things and perfect for a much needed getaway! We would stay here again in a heart beat! Loved the actual property and house itself. Updated, had everything you need and perfect for a couple or family!"

Deanna was in regular contact whenever needed and willing to help in every way."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay, and we enjoyed it even more than the first. Cleanliness was appreciated! Everything worked great.

Quiet and private. We'll be back!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"What a delightful place to spend the summer! Everything we needed was at this cute cottage. It was the perfect place to enjoy Michigan for June, July and August. We loved the serene and natural setting yet it was close enough to town to meet all of our needs. There's plenty of wildlife and even sheep close by to watch and enjoy. The cottage is very comfortable for long-term or short-term stays with three nice bedrooms and two baths. The downstairs has an additional living area with lots of seating and a TV. Overall, a great comfortable and sparkling clean place!"

2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,In town for my daughters college graduation and perfect place to have family be together. Great setting and relaxing to be on the water with farm life around. Denise was very responsive and helpful. Beds were really comfortable!! Will definitely recommend for other folks traveling in the area.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A home tucked away in the country was a gem for us. Peaceful and quiet and lots of sheep. The house was sparkling clean, equipped with everything one would need. The utensils and knives were cleverly placed in a hidden compartment, away from little hands. It is a cosy home with all the entertainment we need on rainy days. Deanna and Denise are very thoughtful hosts. We are already looking forward to be back. Thank you very much."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I come to Tecumseh typically once a year to visit our family. Having this home away from home at the Cottage made our vacation so special. From the linens to the coffee mugs, there wasn't a detail that Denise didn't have covered. We were able to grill out over the lake, and even visit with the new spring lambs! We will now never consider staying anywhere else in the area and look forward to the private peaceful slice of heaven that the Cottage provides."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely cherished our 4-day stay at Denise's cottage! The cottage was beautifully renovated and included any amenity you could possibly need! Denise even included a thoughtful toiletry kit in the bathroom in case you forgot something at home. The cottage itself was extremely clean and we felt right at home immediately. My fiance and I will cherish feeding the friendly sheep on Christmas morning and the adorable Christmas tree that welcomed us when we arrived. We will definitely rebook next time we are in the area! Thanks again Denise and fam for your warm hospitality!
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dennis and Denise are excellent hosts. They went above our expectations for a comfortable, private, and very clean and cozy cottage."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Denise's place was an amazing getaway in a beautiful area. The property was very nice and the local wildlife makes for great viewing.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is updated and very clean. We were so much happier staying at this cottage than at a local hotel. There is also a pond by the cottage, very scenic."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved Denise and Dennis's cottage. At 3 bedrooms and 2 baths, it has terrific space and charming decor. But what really sets it apart is the overwhelming sense of peace and happiness that you get from sitting on the porch and enjoying the views and nature.
The cottage was well stocked and even had supplies for the fire pit down by the pond. We roasted marshmallows and caught fish with my 3 year old. He thoroughly loved the feeding the sheep and the fresh eggs Denise brought by as well.
Denise and Dennis were wonderful, thoughtful hosts; you meet them once and feel like you've known them for a long time!
The area around Tecumseh is also very interesting and you're not too far away to visit larger towns like Ann Arbor, Dexter, Chelsea or Toledo.
We highly recommend this place for your next stay. You won't find a better place!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great. We loved our stay. It was even better than we expected! Beautiful touches in the cottage, great views and a peaceful setting. Very comfortable! Denise and Dennis were great hosts!"

2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was by far one of my favorite weekend getaways of all time! We had so much fun roasting marshmallows, kayaking on the lake, and feeding the sheep! Definitely hope to be back some time in the future!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was hands down one of the best Airbnbs stays I have ever had. Denise is an attentive host and everything was perfect. The cottage is spacious and lovely -- my friend and I both commented that it felt like something out of a magazine. The beds were comfortable. My friend and I loved being able to stay on different levels and each have our own bathroom. We had a pretty busy itinerary for our visit to the area so we didn't get a chance to use the kayaks but really would have liked to. I took some time on our second morning to meet the sheep which I just loved. The property is sprawling and gorgeous. It is so nice to be right on the pond. Even though the weather was rainy, we took some time each morning to be out on the front porch and just take it in. If my travels ever bring me back to the area, I will definitely stay here again."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Far exceeded expectations. Anyone coming to the area should make this their first choice for accommodations.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome! You can tell they put some hard work into this cottage and it paid off extremely. Close to MIS, not far from a cool little downtown with some great food spots. 100% will recommend and will stay here time and time again!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place exceeded all my expectations. The host has great hospitality, friendly and kind. The Cottage is beautiful, quiet and very clean. Everything we needed was provided to us. It was like being at home! It rained a lot during our stay, but the sound of the rain on the pond and the frogs at night was calming and peaceful. We sat outside on the deck while drinking our morning coffee and watching the sheep play. My daughter loved feeding the sheep and the beautiful stairs that are landscaped around the cottage. She pretended to be a princess in a castle! I would highly recommend this cottage to anyone! I hope to go back very soon!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! Denise was an A+ host with an unbelievably beautiful home. Upon pulling up to the home, you‚Äôre greeted by a beautiful pond, lambs in the pasture and a cute little cottage. The cottage itself was so clean and spacious. It had everything we needed - including farm fresh eggs from Denise and coffee. She understands her guests so well :)
We only used the master bedroom, but there were additional rooms in the basement along with an extra bathroom and living space. I could easily see a family or group of friends here. We would highly recommend this cottage!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Many thanks to Denise for letting us enjoy her lovely cottage!

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"My family stayed at Lisa's place just one night but it worked out perfectly for us. it was very clean, had everything we needed and was comfortable. I highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay. Close to everything. Amazingly quiet for being in a neighborhood close to the main road.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing place to stay, very homey, cute and clean. We loved our time there. It had everything we needed and very close to Adrian Campus. Highly recommend to others looking for a place in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I used to live in Adrian and wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd find a place to stay that could match the feeling of how I used to be when I got home, but Lisa‚Äôs place did not disappoint. Easy walking distance to Adrian College and a grocery store, driving distance to shops and restaurants downtown, and a wonderful home to stay in. Was clean and comfortable, making me feel right at home the moment I walked through the door, and Lisa was extremely responsive to any questions or concerns I had. Definitely worth the price to stay here!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,House was perfect for me & my 3 kids. We had a short stay for a day-camp at AC for one of my kids. House was within walking distance to everything on campus and a short drive to grocery & downtown restaurants. House is just like pictures and listing describes.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at Lisa‚Äôs place. Two families with toddlers shared the space for a wedding week. It had enough bedrooms and was convenient for our needs. The laundry was very helpful! Would happily stay here again :)
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's place was the cleanest rental we have ever experienced! We loved everything about it: the location, the amenities, the complimentary water, coffee and snacks, and the private deck in the back. The beds were comfortable and the bed linens were fresh and new. It is located in a quiet neighborhood near Adrian college, which was great for taking walks. We will surely be back if we are in the area again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to bring the family in for graduation. Yes, you might have to take a number for the bathroom, but the number of rooms made this an easy choice. And I loved all the little things. Surge protectors with usb ports in every room. K-cups for us avid coffee drinkers and the snacks and treats. Wow. Very thoughtful"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was nice and the location was wonderful for walking around the neighborhood. Communication with the host was very timely. Appreciate all the snacks and drinks that were left out for us. Had a great stay while visiting family.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super cute, extremely clean, and comfortable for our family of 5. Very conveniently located for our purposes. Great communication from host. I highly recommend staying here!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Needed a place to stay for the weekend because my youngest daughter was graduating from Adrian College. Lisa‚Äôs AirBnb was a perfect fit for us. We enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"This place was lovely, clean and very comfortable. I think maybe it needs to be made clear that this might not be suitable for older adults as the only bathroom is up some pretty steep stairs. And the tub is not older adult friendly. Other then that it was beautiful and everyone loved it. We could walk to Adrian College and the neighborhood is also so lovely!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lisa and Jon went above and beyond any of our expectations! Several friends and I were in town for a wedding and unfortunately the town got a pretty crazy ice storm that caused lots of power outages. Lisa kept me in the loop with any issues occurring because of the ice storm. The house was super cute and cozy, it felt like home. And had every amenity we could possibly think of, plus some additional sweet treats and snacks. It‚Äôs located near lots of stores and restaurants, everything we needed seemed to be within approximately 10 minutes. If we ever make it back to Adrian, we would 100% book with Lisa and Jon again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place. It is so cute and cozy. The location is super close to Adrian College. We will definitely stay again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great home. Nice location, home was well kept. Snacks were surly appreciated. Only thing worth mentioning for some travelers with complications with stairs would be that there is no 1st fl restroom. This was not an issue for us but could be for some travelers. Also worth mentioning that all the mattresses were extremely firm. If you don‚Äôt like a firm mattress this is not the pace for you. Nice deck on the back of the house nice home that is much larger in the inside than it appears on the outside."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was very clean and well kept. the kitchen was very nice and the house itself was super cute!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful house! Our kids greatly appreciated the snacks left in the kitchen. The communication from Lisa was top notch! Would highly recommend, and will definitely stay again!"

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay. My wife fell in love with the home as she repeatedly told me ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs soooo cozy in here. I love it!‚Äù Lisa was so helpful. We appreciate the extras such as snacks, a variety of drinks. We would love to stay here again anytime in Adrian."

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Lisa was very nice responded quickly and prompt.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, relaxing, and pretty quiet. The back yard and porch were great for a little night cap!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"This cottage in Adrian was just as described in the AirBNB listing. In fact, the beds and rooms were more than expected...pretty, comfortable, plenty spacious. We loved sitting on the back deck, having coffee in the morning and the toddler with us found it a great exploration spot. If there was a way to give more than 5 stars for communication, I would do that. We had a few questions along the way and Lisa was super quick to respond and very helpful. If you need a cute, comfortable place to hang your hat while in the Adrian area, this cottage is perfect."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I met here for a nearby wedding and our stay couldn't have been better. I had plenty of questions for Lisa before the trip (and even during our stay) and she was extremely responsive, accommodating, and helpful. The house itself was great - safe location, very clean, comfortable, and plenty big. We traveled pretty light, but everything we needed was stocked/provided (dishes, toiletries, coffee, snacks, linen, and more). Very happy with the way everything worked out and should we ever find our way back to this part of the world, we would absolutely stay again. Thanks, Lisa!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and place!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was great! Bed was comfortable and the kids had a blast and LOVED the candy jar lol
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved your home! Ultra clean, lots of special touches (Keurig coffee stocked with pods), great location!"
2022-07-01,4,Group trip,"This place was perfect for our short stay. Had a bit of trouble getting in with the lock, but Lisa and Jon were quick to respond and let us in. The water, coffee, and candy for us to enjoy was a nice bonus. The fireplace was a nice touch. We used it. The outdoor patio looked great, unfortunately with the rain, we could not use it."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very friendly, clean, perfect for a large family!! Thank you for your hospitality!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House is beautiful, exceedingly well stocked, and on a quiet street. The back patio was semi-private despite backing up to several houses (be sure to be quiet later into the evening, lots of families nearby). Everything we needed was within a 10 minute drive. 10/10 would stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing home !!! Everything was perfect
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"One word for this stay-Amazing! I have never been so happy with an Airbnb or any rental for that matter. The house was clean and the host took the time to stock extras so our stay would be easier and more enjoyable. From coffee to chocolate and so much more this host has went the extra mile to ensure guests have a wonderful stay. I can‚Äôt even express how much this took the stress off our trip, just to be able to relax and rest up in such an environment was just what we needed. If I am ever in the area again we will definitely be booking this home again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful home and in a very peaceful neighborhood. Pristine and just how the picture showed. Highly recommend for those in town with large families. Large lot, plenty of parking space and easy communication with the hosts. Kitchen stocked, bathroom had full amenities. Perfect for long stay guests. Will go back again!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Our stay in Adrian was very pleasant and we had a great time. The house was as pictured, very spacious and clean. The pool however was very cold. So cold that the adults could not enjoy it, but the kids did. I would recommend a heater for the pool. The house was also recently updated. There were TVs in most rooms but only a couple were set up to watch. There was a very noticeable temperature difference between the three levels as well. Overall, the house was as expected, but not quite worth the money spent given the location and the fact the pool was not enjoyable to the adults, but the kids want to go back next year."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing house the host was very easy to communicate with and easy to reach . Will be back soon thank you.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Noah eas a great communicator and always extremelyhelpful. Beautiful house nice quiet neighborhood.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great family vacation here. We had 12 people - ages ranged from 11-76 - and everyone was able to move about easily and we weren‚Äôt tripping over each other. The home is gorgeous and the furniture and beds were comfy. It was a perfect place to hang out, recharge, and make memories!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! The Victorian home was beautiful and there was plenty of space for our large group.
It was fun to walk around the neighborhood and the historic downtown area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This easily fit 6 adults, 5 kids and an infant. The bathrooms are so spacious! plenty of dishes & silverware for all of us. Some toys were tucked into a room which helped a lot with the younger kids and the older kids found board games as well. Huge yard also helped with kids. The beds, linens and towels were all very comfortable. Nightlights were included in both bunk bed rooms. The history of the home was fascinating and the neighborhood had so many similarly charming homes. Megan was an excellent host, I communicated we were traveling for the eclipse and she even offered us eclipse glasses! She was communicative without being overbearing, just the right balance. We felt welcome in the home, if we ever travel to Adrian again I would book this place again in a heartbeat."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect house to meet up with family. The house is BEAUTIFUL, and had plenty of communal space to play board games, cook, eat dinner together, etc. We were all very happy with this location."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We love this house!! if you are a historical home enthusiast or love Victorian homes you must stay in this house. We were visiting our children and had more than enough space for everyone. It was really a lovely family time. Ôøº love the area and looking at all the historical homes. It was a blessing to be able to hang out with our kids and our dogs.ü•∞
ÔøºMegan was a gracious host and always responsive. I would definitely recommend this host and Airbnb, really exceeded our expectations!"

I went for a photoshoot, but I stayed for the weekend and enjoyed everything the house and surrounding area had to offer.
Megan is a phenomenal host who was incredibly helpful and responsive throughout my stay.
I adored this location and would absolutely stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was unique and very comfortable. It had everything we needed. We enjoyed reading the history of the house and the information about the builder. The gas grill was adequate size for our families and grandkids. The alley parking was plentiful and easy to access also had plenty of lighting at night for carrying our things into the house.

It was exactly like the picture and bigger than we expected. we have 12 in our family, and all had our own beds and plenty of space and never felt like we were tripping over each other, ever. We could cook when we had time. Everything was clean, and Megan was a great host! She gave us clear instructions with everything we needed.

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Excellent stay in this exquisite historic home - spacious and perfect for our family of 8 as our rally point to attend a local wedding. Great kitchen and the woodwork throughout the home is magnificent- quiet street with other beautiful homes and very convenient - highly recommend!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"This place is phenomenal! I cannot begin to explain the charm of this gorgeous home and it's vicinity to the whole of downtown Adrian. The backyard is huge and ripe for yard games. The interior is near untouched from it's original construction and clearly has been well maintained through the years. This house fires on all cylinders so to speak and has definitely seen a lot of love over the years. The host Megan was nothing but perfect. She helped us with a couple of issues that popped up and was never more than a few minutes from answering our questions or offering suggestions of what Adrian has to offer. Both the check-in and check-out process was beyond easy. Given what our group has had to do to check-out of previous rentals, Megan asks practically nothing in the way of checking out. Just a few simple and minor tasks. I would rent this house again without a moments hesitation."

The neighborhood is very conveniently located and is a perfect escape from the city. Would absolutely recommend to stay there!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow, what can I say, this is a fantastic home in Adrian! The historic nature of the home is outstanding. The woodwork and the floors are unreal. We had to visit our hometown of Adrian to attend a funeral service. This home easily accommodated, 3 couples. We were able to visit with each other and family friends who came over to visit. The large wrap around porch gave us some wonder additional seating as well. It is well situated in the Historic District of Adrian and an easy walking distance to downtown Adrian, ie (5 min).
Megan as a Hostess was fantastic with her communications and the home was in extremely good shape and very clean!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful stay. Very clean, cozy beds, and great patio. We left a book and they were very responsive and met with us to get it back. I highly recommend this Airbnb and we will definitely be back."

I slept 10hours, it was amazing. It‚Äôs a great quiet place to get away from the kids hahah. It‚Äôs quieter than a hotel, I can make my own snacks, watch TV on a couch, I love it.
The area is just wonderful. Cutest downtown area. We love having dinner and walking the town in the morning. Great coffee place across the street, several options for breakfast. Great shops!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family very much enjoyed our stay. We came from out of town for a wedding and this was a great location, with so much to do outside our doors, and yet still quiet at night. Cozy place to stay with comfortable beds, conveniences like coffee were much appreciated."

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We rented this place for the night before my wedding. The biggest reason we chose this spot was because we knew that we had wanted to get pictures of getting ready with all of my bridesmaids. The pictures did not do as much justice as seeing this place in person! Such a gorgeous place to stay and was so comfortable for our stay. They had lost power the morning of our stay, but we were hopeful that the power would come on before the end of the night. The owners were flexible with the situation and communicated immediately and thankfully the power was restored before we got there! I also found out about the amazing bake shop next door which was a plus for me. I love that this Airbnb also had offered toys and books for kids as my daughters had been with me. Absolutely amazing weekend and we will be back!"

We would stay here again in a heart beat!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a treasure and made our 1st visit to Tecumseh more memorable. Right in the middle of all the cute shops downtown, we didn‚Äôt need to drive anywhere.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying with Jason & Martha and it was just as nice a second time around. Close enough to Ann Arbor to celebrate our graduate but far enough to not be a hassle with traffic. They‚Äôre place is beautifully decorated and always spotless. The little booklet of nearby recommendations is always appreciated. Thanks again, guys!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay and really enjoyed the shops we went into!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friend and I drove up from Ohio for a peaceful and fun time out.
We had such a lovely time. The place was Amazing and Very Clean. We loved all the little shops around us! Oh and the huge windows were perfect to see the shops and the beautiful street.
If you stay, you should definitely try the Mexican restaurant, I apologize I forgot the name but they have everything there including a Vegetarian menu!
We loved the place and everything about where it is located.
We will definitely be back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We actually live two miles from this property but needed a place to stay while some remodeling to our bathroom was being performed. The location, feel and layout of the loft allowed us to feel like we were taking a vacation in our own town. The location is perfect and despite being right over the main street downtown still feels private and is well isolated from road noise.
The Loft is a special place and we will definitely be coming back as further renovations to our own house are being made."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely, clean, quaint loft right in the heart of town! Jason was responsive and helpful when I had questions. He made sure the steps were shoveled in the morning, which was greatly appreciated! We wish we had more time to explore the adorable town, but a snow storm and quick trip didn‚Äôt allow! We hope to come back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really a beautiful and spacious place. Loved the two ovens. Kitchen was awesome. Loved the coffee pot. Bathrooms were spacious and clean.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I needed to visit Tecumseh because our daughter, who lives there, had emergency surgery. When I contacted Jason and Martha, one of the nights we needed didn't appear available on Air BNB. Martha instantly responded to me. She opened the night on the app so I could complete my reservation. Upon arrival there were cookies waiting from the local bakery. The apartment was immaculately clean and nicely decorated. It is very well equipted with everything you could need. I used the kitchen to meal prep for my daughter. The double ovens were amazing. Downtown Tecumseh is a small but adorable place. It has so many cute stores to visit. There is a large parking lot right behind the space so no parking issues. Restaurants were in walking distance and grocery store was within a mile. We will definately stay here again. Jason and Martha made our very stressful time so much easier. Communication was great!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was just what we needed, very spacious, clean and equipped for our stay. Our family had a wonderful time relaxing and the town is so quaint with great little shops to explore. The host is very responsive and even had complementary cookies and coffee waiting for us when we arrived."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"It‚Äôs a great alternative to a big hotel and the area is my absolute favorite. Tecumseh is a cute little town where everyone is friendly, the shops are local and fantastic, the food is great too.
The stay was delightful as always. Nice place, clean, comfortable, and has little extras. For example they left us a dessert from the local bakery with a hand written note. I like to spend my money at small business and Tecumseh never disappoints. My husband also had a local florist deliver flowers and have them waiting, I made the reservations, so he don‚Äôt know what to do. Well everyone knows everyone and the florist took care of it, made it that much easier for him. They were a wonderful replica of my wedding bouquet, just wonderful . We will be back and we always recommend."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was exceptional. The bowl of candy was a nice touch. They even had someone shovel our walkway and stairs after a snowfall. Will definitely stay again when visiting Tecumseh. Would recommend to everyone.

I just cannot say enough good things."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I highly recommend staying at the August and Company Suite. The beautiful decor and spaciousness make this a home away from home.
A friend and I stayed for a ""Momcation"" (as we like to call it), and everything was perfect!
We started our day with a massage at one of our local spa's, enjoyed lunch and shopping in downtown Tecumseh, then went back to the suite where we enjoyed everything it had to offer.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am reluctant to review the August & Company loft because I feel like I am sharing a hidden gem with the world and might not be able to get it back once others know it exists! lol. Seriously, this is a TRULY beautiful place to stay in Tecumseh, right in the heart of the charming downtown, surrounded by lovely shops and nice restaurants. The loft is just gorgeous and very spacious, with a kitchen that's so pretty I wish it was mine! The furniture was very nice, the place was clean, and the beds were comfy. Jason and Martha went the extra mile with having a Christmas tree and a plate of cookies waiting, which was great as we were celebrating Christmas with our sons. There is a really nice deck out back that we didn't get to use but would be fantastic when the weather is warmer. I would recommend staying here to anyone going to this area, as we had everything we could need from our wonderful hosts. If I could have moved in for good, I would! You will not be disappointed, so don't hesitate. Thanks for the great time!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jason and Martha have a gem on their hands! The location has easy parking, right in downtown Tecumseh. It‚Äôs much larger than we expected, and was incredibly clean.

We found the apartment homey, comfortable, and nicely furnished and equipped, compared to a generic hotel room. It is in a lovely town worthy of wandering around in to shop. A great getaway for us and strategic jumping off point for traveling to other sites we had on our agenda. We definitely will have this apartment on our list to use again when we return to Michigan."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Only thing I wish is that we had more time to soak up this beautiful city. Inside the place is beautiful and so is the outside. You have your own fenced private deck and that was another cherry on top. It was perfectly spacious for the 4 of us. There is bar food and Mexican so close it‚Äôs barely a walk. Iced and hot coffee drinks are less than 2 minutes. My best friend drove halfway and so did I and this was our halfway point besides Ann Arbor which were 400/night! It was just an awesome place in an awesome area and one of the best priced options I could find. The hosts were very thoughtful and accommodating as well. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place to stay!

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"This is the 2nd year in a row we‚Äôve stayed at this location, and as soon as I walked in, it fell like home! There‚Äôs everything there you could need to have an amazing weekend and everything is so close incase you forgot something or want to run out for food. Would recommend."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Bobby was great to work with and quick to respond. The few things we encountered when we arrived was the oven was dirty and the post on the porch wasn't safe to grab to help get up on the porch. The neighborhood was nice and close to a lot of different places to eat and was easy to get to Ann Arbor from there.
The house itself was fairly clean, but on the older side with very narrow stairs going to the upstairs bedroom. We didn't feel safe using the dishwasher because it wasn't anchored into the counter top.
Also we were woken up early every morning by the neighbors dogs barking nonstop. That isn't on Bobby.
Our stay was pleasant and the price was great compared to a hotel. Thank you Bobby."
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We were happy to have a kitchen, the price was about the same as a hotel. But very sparse amenities."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great house and great location. My family was very happy with this house.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Bobby‚Äôs place is a great place to stay. It was nice having someone nearby for help.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice stay and the host was responsive.
The washer leaked when used and the dryer didn‚Äôt work at all.
The host is aware and indicated he was going to replace the dryer and washer.
Overall, the property met our needs."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Bobby was responsive and place was as advertised. No issues at all.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,It is an older home pretty bare bones but it felt like home. The couch was a bit low for my Mom in her 70s. I would feel comfortable using this place again. It is close to down town. The neighbors dogs barked but not for long. They were pretty good about keeping them inside. The stairs going up were steep. If you are familiar with older homes this is pretty common. There is a handrail.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Bobby was very responsive! House was as advertised. Smooth checkin and checkout.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Thank you! Loved the place and you were very helpful
2023-10-01,3,Stayed one night,"This was a convenient place to stay. Some of the outlets in the kitchen didn‚Äôt work.
The main thing was it was advertised as a 3 bedroom with 3 beds. The one ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù was at the top of the stairs, no door. It had a tiny futon instead of a bed v"

2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very nice house; both close to town and Siena Heights University. Accurate description of listing and the host, Bobby was fast to reply to my questions and really nice.
The only thing I will make mention of was the actual stairs to the upper level of the home are very steep. Upstairs is where the loft with the futon is as well as the second bedroom.
Really nice size bedrooms and brand new carpet throughout.
Thank you Bobby!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. Would recommend to others.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Worked well for our last minute trip to Adrian. Seemed a bit spendy for the night but might have been related to the added on 75 cleaning fee. Thank you for being so accommodating .

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The location was perfect for our needs. Bobby responded quickly to my messages. I recommend Chomp Burger as a place to eat.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and great host!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Treana‚Äôs place was very welcoming. We felt right at home and comfortable. It‚Äôs definitely a great place to rent when staying on Adrian.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here while we were in state for a death in our family. The house is beautiful and cozy and was a great price compared to others in the area. Treana was a great host and very responsive. Will definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,This airbnb was a good place to stay in Adrian with a small group. We had 5 guests and were able to comfortably find places to relax within the house. The details for check-in and entry were clearly communicated and very helpful! The small details of activity ideas and restaurant suggestions by the host were a nice touch as well. Within convenient walking distance of downtown Adrian.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was perfect for our family. Our son goes to Siena Heights and it was very close to him. It was also so close to everything else; restaurants and things to do, we went bowling. The house was very clean and we did feel at home. Treana was very easy to get ahold of and helped with anything we needed. We loved our stay!"
2023-09-01,4,Group trip,Treana was great at communicating instructions and made our stay easy! The house was a bit older but clean and had everything we needed.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful visit with family!
Treana‚Äôs place was perfect for us and our 4 children. Very comfortable and worth the price ! If there was a washer and dryer , I would rate it 10 stars !!!
Was a very pleasant experience for our first Air b&b !"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Residence is clean and well stocked with the basic household needs along with some extras if something is forgotten. There was a little glitch with the tv‚Äôs during our stay which were beyond the hosts control. She was very quick to respond to my message to try to help and was extremely apologetic.
2023-06-01,3,Stayed with a pet,Treana was an extremely accommodating host. She was very nice and responded quickly when she could but I got the wrong door code when first entering. I eventually took it upon myself to try something else and it worked (it was supposed to be the last 4 of my phone number but the code given was the numbers mixed up). Upon entering you could smell a faint smell of pee and the half bath was smaller than expected. Upstairs bedroom was fairly warm but not horribly uncomfortable. Overall it was a good stay just needed some work
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From check-in to check-out, Treana provided details so I knew exactly what to expect! The home was clean and accurately reflected in the listing. I loved the idea of homemade ice cream, but didn't get around to it unfortunately! The d√©cor was cute, the bed was comfy (I only used the downstairs) and there was great water pressure in the shower! I would stay again without a doubt!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It‚Äôs a nice place
Quiet
Restaurant
Store near
üëçüèΩ"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great first air bnb experience.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Will rent again.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Treana was very responsive and helpful. We hit a few snags at the beginning of the trip but she was able to resolve them quickly and continued to check in and ensure we had what we needed. As she states it‚Äôs a simple stay, nothing glamorous but meets the need!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute & cozy! Perfect for our weekend getaway!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,House was very clean. Thoughtful accommodations. Great value for the price. Slept 6 comfortably.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a wonderful place in the midst of Adrian. Not far from where my parents live. The driveway did concern my daughter when we check in. However it was all good a great place to unwind and relax.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,I found the house to be an adorable little thing. We did have issues with the Smart lock system. My husband was the only one that could get it to unlock but even he had issues. The kitchen has poor lighting by the stove that discouraged cooking. The living room has sheer curtains which made us feel exposed at night if a light was left on in the house. The biggest red flag for my family was actually the neighbors yard. The neighbor has a rather large dog that is not chained and the fence line has about an 8-10 foot breach. The only barrier between the yards is a metal trash can. This is not of any fault to the owner but it is something to keep in mind. Aside from that the house was clean an cozy. I would personally book again.
2022-11-01,3,Stayed with a pet,Trenna was wonderful to work with always attentive and ready to help when I wasn‚Äôt happy with the condition of the house . Great Airbnb for college kids not so much for mature families. Neighbors dog barked outside the bedroom window on and off through the day and night.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was great for our Family Hockey weekend and a birthday!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place, we‚Äôll be back if in the area again"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We experienced a minor setback (no one at fault at all!) and Treana was immediately in contact and helped us problem-solve. She‚Äôs a great host!
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,The host has this house stocked with anything you might need.
2022-09-01,4,Group trip,"An older house with everything you need. The property was as described.
Sleeps six comfortably with
two couples sharing the two larger beds.
A good value.
One problem was that the host accused us of smoking in the property which we did not do. They are asking for us to pay a $250 fee for cleaning. It has caused me to spend a couple hours defending ourselves to AirB&B and the inconvenience that goes along with it. I would ask AirB&B to remove this paragraph after a positive resolution is reached."
2022-09-01,4,Group trip,"The Property was as expected. The place had everything we needed.
Communication was good except we were accused of smoking in the house which we did not do. The host never made any attempt to contact me but went straight for a $250 cleaning fee through Airbnb.
Beware!
Here is what I wrote to AirB&B as a response to her accusation:
No one in our party smoked anything in the home. No one in our party even smokes at all.
In fact, my sister has a sensitivity to odors, including cigarette smoke that can trigger migraines. Evidence of this is that we unplugged about 4-5 electric air fresheners that probably would have triggered a migraine for my sister. Also, there were non-electric (Glade?) air fresheners that we closed to prevent odors from them triggering a migraine for my sister. We didn't plug the air fresheners back in or open the Glade fresheners back up when we left. They were not in use during our entire stay.
I was the last one to leave the home at about 8:30 am on the day of checkout and there was no smoke odor in the home. I double checked that the door was locked upon departure.
I have used AirB&B all over the world and have never had any complaint from any host for not following the rules. In fact, if you check my reviews, you will see that I have only positive reviews.
I‚Äôm perplexed why the host is even making this accusation. What evidence does the host have? We did not smoke in the house or outside the house. Upon our arrival I noticed an ash tray on the outside porch railing, which we left untouched throughout our stay.
I made sure the house was left in a condition that meets my usual high standards and the standards set forth in the host‚Äôs guide. Dishes were cleaned, sheets were stripped from the beds, counters were cleaned, trash removed, and floors were swept. We followed all rules set forth by the host, including no smoking in the house.
It is my understanding that this host is new to AirB&B. My only suggestion is that she take a critical look at who she has hired to clean her property and ask herself if they are being honest with her.
The host has presented no evidence to back up her accusation that any of my group smoked in the house. That evidence does not exist because no one in my group smokes."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,awesome place!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It was nice and simple !

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here to visit my sister in town. I was walking distance not only to her place but local shops which was a plus. The unit was quite clean when we checked in. Downsides were communication and the toilet paper being single ply. If I had to do it over again I would stay here and just bring my own toilet paper. Thanks for the stay ‚ú®

Details? Granite countertops, long windows with beautiful wood casings, wooden blinds that overlook downtown, spacious bathroom with modernized shower, the high ceilings, the light fixtures, and two Vizio TVs. The location, too, was perfect - easy walking to restaurants, bars and more. Thank you for the fine experience!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great place for me coming in for Faster Horses Festival - just far enough away and very peaceful with walking distance great restaurants. Nice place, location and host that went out of his way to help me when I had a need. I would definitely stay again."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tyler's place was perfect for a short weekend trip to Michigan to visit family. It was very convenient for us because my family lives a 1/2 mile from the location. The kitchen had everything we needed, the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This house was absolutely gorgeous! It almost made us not want to leave the place. So much room, character and the details are so intricate, absolutely loved our stay. Would make a great honeymoon getaway or a special family get together weekend"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really fun, classic home. Loved spending time with the family out on the big deck. We booked both units in the house and worked great for our bigger group. Tyler was very responsive and flexible."
2022-06-01,4,Group trip,"The place is very interesting, with many beautiful antiques. Anyone interested in history would enjoy the house.
The host is available at a moments notice.
The location isn‚Äôt the best as it is in kind of a rundown area of town."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful large house, tastefully furnished with nice antiques and some modern pieces. If you have kids or are a clumsy person I would beware because I was afraid of breaking something super pricey!
Luckily that didn‚Äôt happen.
great kitchen with everything you would need. We did order a carry out from a place in town called Sauce, super yummy Italian food.
Nice deck in the back to enjoy your morning coffee. Enjoyed the air hockey table too!
The house is shared with another rental unit but you are probably not going to see each other because it is technically separate."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House is beautiful and really well decorated and the kitchen is perfectly stocked. Everything is very comfortable and well thought out for any possible needs
located in a quiet area not far from town."
2022-04-01,2,Stayed a few nights,Didn‚Äôt enjoy my stay
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fascinating and fun air bnb property! I‚Äôd definitely stay here again.
I wanted a spot in Toledo area for a girlfriend and I to spend a couple nights away in December. This property was available on short notice and looked super interesting!
It‚Äôs not really kid friendly at all.
Old house, fine furniture etc.. but that worked just fine for us.
The space is huge and fun to wander and explore. I‚Äôd love to see more history from the period in the house if not story on the house itself perhaps.
It seems the property was perhaps in disrepair and has had a lot of work done to it. The rooms are well furnished and comfortable, but the house has old house quirks for sure.
The house had what it said it did and was all fine.
Bring your slippers ‚Ä¶ and know that the heating system heats upstairs better than downstairs - downstairs the fireplace is a lovely spot to sit with coffee in the morning and wine in the evening.
I bet as this property gets more experience it will only improve and I‚Äôd definitely stay here again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Place was absolutely amazing, minutes from a great little area in Adrian. A little under a hour drive to Ann Arbor. The place itself it fantastic and very vintage with a touch of modern here and there. The fire place was a great spot to sit and talk with my wife and the bath tub is perfect for two."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"peaceful stay for our group, friendly and responsive hosts"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was so welcoming from the moment we stepped in. It is obvious that we the owners pride themselves in welcoming all ages. They went above and beyond to hit all of the amenities and special touches that make this a true home away from home!
Thanks so much!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"No disappointments !!!! Our stay was amazing. comfortable beds, lots of space. The best place I've stayed with my grand kids.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lots of space for our two families, we had fun with all the games and play structures outside. Comfortable beds. It was nice to have many extras/basic foods and spices in the cupboards/soap and shampoo, etc. A great place for families!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice we really enjoyed it
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I enjoyed the stay so very much! It was so beautiful and we felt right at home! I highly recommend the stay ! We will definitely stay here and if we are back up that way! Thank you again for such amazing hospitality! God bless you !
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Very friendly hosts, LOTS to do outside! LOVED that there is only one TV in the house! Can‚Äôt wait to go back again with warmer weather!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,my friends and I rented this place and absolutely loved it. We didn't have to go out and spend our money on activities because there was so much to do at the air bnb itself! It is a guaranteed blast until the very second you have to leave. It's the perfect place for both families and friends!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for a wedding in Ann Arbor. Excellent hosts that were so flexible. Great place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The host was absolutely so sweet and the place was beautiful! We hope to return for all our future Michigan family vacations!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It was all great. A perfect host, all questions were answered immediately. The house is beautiful, spacious, with great games room, extra TV room and a unique garden. The garden is really incredibly large, with great games, climbing frames, swings, volleyball court, etc., etc.
Adrian and thus shopping and restaurants can be reached in just a few minutes by car. There is everything you need.
It's quiet and you sleep very well.
We would love to come back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,great home.. definitely would stay there again. fun for the whole family..great host
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful place to stay. The house is clean, large, and full of fun. There‚Äôs a game room which the children loved, and an upstairs loft. It was a children‚Äôs heaven. But that‚Äôs not all. It was also in an adult heaven. The rooms are spacious and very nice. Living room and kitchen provided ample gathering space. There‚Äôs a large dining room table, big enough for everyone to gather. And then there‚Äôs the outside space which provides all sorts of fun, with an obstacle course for adults and one for kids . There are hiking trails right there. The patio looks out on this Vista. I simply cannot say enough positive things about this place. If you have a chance stay here. Oh yes, and the host was wonderful. Helpful, accommodating, warm, and friendly. It would be hard to find a better Airbnb."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"We loved staying at Evolve's place! The property is beautiful & well taken care of. At first, we were bummed that the only TV was located in the movie room upstairs, but with all the items in the game room & outside activities (although we were in colder weather) you didn't need a TV!
We would totally stay here again!"
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nice place, but for the size I think they could have had another TV downstairs - perhaps in the game room. Very cold when checking in and it took a while to warm up.
Loved the wood stove and the kids loved the gameroom."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Great place for our family Thanksgiving gathering. Selena was responsive and communicated very well before and during our stay. The bedrooms are thoughtfully themed and there was plenty of pots, pans and serving items for us to cook as well as plenty of spices, condiments, and things to prepare food. We didn't have any kids with us but there is so much for them to do there...even if the weather doesn't allow for outside play. The game room is a big and little kids happy space. We enjoyed walking on the property and it was fun to try to find the hidden treasures on the Sasquatch trail."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,This house was very cozy and serene. It was perfect for our friends 40th! Thank you for you‚Äôre hospitality!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Do not miss the opportunity to stay here. It‚Äôs quiet and cozy and still close enough to town. We spent a lot of time unplugged and just enjoying all of the activities. The drinking water is also the best I‚Äôve ever had. This place is a perfect place to stay and just hang out and relax. We also enjoyed a late night walk in the trails looking for Sasquatch.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great. We loved the game room and all the little touches. Did get a little stuffy inside at times, but the fans did help."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Selena was an AMAZING host! We loved the location, the setting, and the thoughtfulness she puts into the experience. I'm sad we were only there for a couple days as there is SO much to see and do. This place is great for families with children of all ages, or, like us, a group of adults wanting some downtime. Thank you so much!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"An awesome place for family to connect and enjoy each other. From the board games to the outside awaited adventures, this is truly a great place to just enjoy being a family.
Seeing natures wildlife up close and personal was an experience my kids will forever remember, from the deers to the rabbits and even more so the fire flies, this place is a gem. Looking forward to booking again in the future."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, alot of fun things for the kids. The home is beautiful, met all of our needs. Owners are friendly, and are on sight and are always available if you needed anything."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I cant say enough about my stay at SJL in Adrian. The hosts were amazing with both communication and the property itself. The trip was for myself, as well as my kids and a few of their friends. This property was spot on perfect in a million ways. I would definitely go back, zero hesitation. I absolutely loved it! Beautiful and well maintained. Stocked with several amenities, including firewood."
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Dont need to worry about anything :)
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent place to stay, great hospitality and superb place to enjoy family and the outdoors. Lots of extras to entertain kids"
2022-03-01,3,Group trip,"Quite, Tranquil , and beautiful area. clean"
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"The house was great and the owners had thought through about all the small needs and requirements which was really nice. The only issue we had was there was no dishwasher in the house and we had not got enough disposable items so we ended spending some time washing the dishes.
The location is really good and we would definitely love to go back in summer."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location. Peaceful. Clean. Lots to keep busy on the property and in the house. The hospitality was great‚Äîjust what we needed for the week. We hope to come back when it‚Äôs not so muddy so we can enjoy the trails, obstacle course, play set, etc. Loved the cozy wood burning stove!!! Gives the place a unique touch."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fabulous weekend at this home. The hosts went above and beyond to make us feel at home and make sure we had everything we needed. They were wonderful at communicating and a pleasure to work with. The house itself is very cozy and homey, yet quite spacious. The game room and theater room were perfect for our children‚Äî they had plenty to do to occupy them all weekend long! The outside patio area was really neat out back. The view is pretty spectacular too with hills and woods! The house was very clean, comfortable, and welcoming. We would definitely stay here again!!"
2021-12-01,3,Group trip,"The property was lovely, and the owners who live upstairs, were very kind. I rated lower for two things:
-There was consistent loud renovations happening upstairs while we were there. We ended up leaving a day because it was so loud. The owners apologized and said it couldn't be helped due to scheduling,but they should have told us ahead of time.
-Although the listing said there is no wifi, there is very limited cell service, which is not listed. We have hot spots, so not having wifi would not have been an issue if we had better cell service.
Aside from the renovations, we did enjoy the space. thank you to our hosts."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was A-MA-ZING. So cute and in an awesome location for some R&R. The HUGE backyard space had many fun things to do like hiking through the woods, volleyball, and a super cute campfire circle. We'll have to come back again in the summer to enjoy it all. The hosts were also responsive to any questions and very friendly. A+ experience."
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place to stay! Owners are very welcoming. We plan to come back!
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,üòÅ

2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"We had a big group and were comfortable, the outdoor patio was great and we had fun with all the games indoor and out. would certainly stay again"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"This place is AMAZING!! The hosts are so thoughtful, between the cute little snack baskets in each room and bathroom... all the way to the obstacle course and fire pit outside! Super clean and a great get away. The check-in and check-out was super easy as well. My friends and I will definitely be coming back:)"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a perfect family retreat! The house is ideally set up for kids and adults alike, and the grounds are beautiful, peaceful, and fun for kids. Steve and Selina are exceptionally friendly and attentive hosts. Exceptionally clean and you'll find everything you need in the kitchen and bathrooms."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful location for disconnecting for a weekend complete with a firepit, outside activities, and a game room. Will definitely return again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a clean and homey feeling place. Lots of space inside and felt excluded from neighbors!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice place.
Small house converted to a purpose-built AirB&B. Had pretty much all the amenities you'd want.
We got into town, rode the three minutes to downtown Adrian for dinner, stopped at the astonishingly well-stocked packy for an after-dinner drink, sat on the porch and watched the sun set. Great ending to a long day on the road.
When the weather is warm, make sure to find the controls for the two air conditioners in the leftmost kitchen counter drawer. They had the place at a comfortable temperature in a couple of minutes.
Adrian's a small town, so no major nightlife, but it's a useful stopping point for cross-country trekking.
I also liked that they haven't followed the trend for getting rule-heavy at the same time they're doinking people with major added expenses. So a very good value."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,nice little house.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect for the night!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very nice place everything we expected

2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was exactly what I wanted. My husband and I wanted a quiet weekend and that just what we got! We sat on the couch, watched tv, and did a puzzle. I absolutely loved the bed, my husband, not so much üòÇ"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very very nice!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice location with many restaurants and shopping options close by. Great place to stay for the weekend. Easy check in with parking right by the back door. House has many updates on the inside.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Best mattress I‚Äôve ever slept on in my life! I wanna go back just for that lol. Beautiful house, perfect for what we needed, loved the front porch!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a good stay. The house was as described. Quiet and out of the way yet close to everything. The bed was a little soft for my liking but I‚Äôd definitely stay there again.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was a good place to stay for visiting friends in Adrian or visiting the college. The only things that were a little disappointing was the mattress was too soft for our comfort and the sofa sleeper In living room had food particles under the cushions which was the fault of the cleaning crew. Other than that, the house was very clean, and looked like had been recently painted. Lots of snacks and coffee were included. Neighborhood was quite and very close to downtown!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This Air B&B fit the purpose of my trip for being near my daughter at Adrian College. Everything was a very short drive away. Very modern in design. Comfy living room to relax at the end of the day.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a return visit to the cottage. It's a clean, quiet, and a relaxing environment."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice place, but lacking decent cooking supplies for those staying longer who don‚Äôt want to dine out all the time."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my very first Airbnb stay, and it was amazing. The cutest little house. Close to everything."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice little place to stay. There were only 2 of us. I‚Äôm not sure how many more people would comfortably fit into the space. It had great amenities, smart TV, washer dryer, coffee. The space did have a faint cigarette odor and it wasn‚Äôt the cleanest like it would be staying at a hotel, but it‚Äôs nice to have the space of a house."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was everything I needed. Big enough for a four person birthday party for my great granddaughter. I've never enjoyed myself more. No worries. Clean. Cute. Very functional kitchen. Big TV all set up ready for your favorite movie or show. Thank you so much Gideon for offering your home to me. Claudia
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was very clean and felt right at home. Was close to college and other things to do! I recommend this place for anyone to stay!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was wonderful! A full house with 3 different sleeping areas, kitchen, very nice bathroom, and even washer/dryer. We had a bit of a problem with the lock as I think the battery died but I messaged Gideon and he was there within minutes to help us out. The inside is updated and very cute, we felt safe staying here and very comfortable. They even have some snacks waiting for you! Would definitely stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved this place. Everything was perfect and we will definitely be back! 10/10.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,The inside was nice and clean. Just be careful driving to the back of the house to park. Scraped the front of my car driving up to the back. Overall good experience!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Location was great for our stay. When it says cozy - they mean cozy. Since we primarily slept there it was fine for us. The bedroom was a bit small and the bed is a full size mattress. Easy check-in and check-out. TV was easy to view. Make sure you bring your own toiletries.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Updated, simple, and tidy clean place. Can be oudoors, also"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy & clean & perfect, exactly as described. Great place to stay for a quick visit to Siena Heights University"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,wonderful
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Check in was very easy, the location was great, and the space was just the perfect size. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Conveniently located near several places for eating, etc., this was a perfect place for a night's stay on our trip. It's been remodeled and is great for a gaggle of people. Hosts were excellent with communication. Check in was easy."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay close to college. Nice quiet spot. Amenities provided were much appreciated! May be back for a visit if the college is our kids pick! Owners are very quick to reply!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice little home. Updated appliances and cupboards. Would stay there again!
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect house for me and my best friend who were in town for a wedding. It was well decorated and clean! We had an issue with the water temp and the host came right out to fix it for us! Definitely would stay here again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,absolutely love this place by far my favorite
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay. Matched the photos.

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great place! If you have time, take a walk and check out some of the old architecture."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,cute little place.. way better than trying to stay at any of the run down hotels in the area.. I'd stay here again if I'm in the area
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay, especially for the price! The house was so nice, clean, and was in a quiet area close to pretty much everything in town. We had a great time! Host was very accommodating and even brought us laundry detergent when she saw that there wasn‚Äôt any in the house."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,My husband and I had a lovely time. The place was cute and clean. We loved the coffee and the bed was comfy. :) Entrance code was easy and smooth!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We booked this passing through the area. It was perfect little stop. Easy walk to many restruants and businesses and in a cute neighborhood.
2022-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"A sweet and nice house that is spotless and well-furnished, with excellent communication from the host, and a great value all around. The unit has a washer and dryer, so you can arrive early and run a few loads of wash on the bedding and towels before you use them. We found this necessary to reduce the smell of stale cigarette smoke. Otherwise, everthing was absolutely perfect."
2022-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute little house for a quick, weekend stay. The home is very updated and modern and had such a cute little front porch sitting area. The bathroom, kitchen space, and the bedroom bedding was clean. But, like other reviews, I agree that the cleanliness could definitely improve. I wore socks inside and they were very dirty on the bottoms. The refrigerator had the previous guests milk, water, and sandwich left in it. One of us was going to use the pull out couch but when removing the couch cushions, there were lots of crumbs and popcorn kernels under them, so we decided against it. Lastly, the trash can where you enter was full, which is not a big deal but smelled terrible and had bugs flying around it, so you had to rush inside so bugs didn‚Äôt fly inside. Overall, it provided what we needed for the weekend, just wish it was cleaner."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Was very nice and clean. Was for our visit with our daughter and family. Would rent again..
2022-05-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The home was cozy and just the right size for my two children, myself, and my fianc√©. The floor was dirty, so I swept, but my socks were still brown after walking in the house. There were also no blankets for the pull out couch, but when I messaged the owner about it he was very quick to reply and very kind and accommodating. The overall experience was okay. The bed is comfy, on both the pull out couch and the bedroom, and it was updated and included necessities. It could use a good cleaning though as there were clearly places missed (bathroom vanity and the floors)"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,clean and cozy 2 bedroom home in a quiet neighborhood. Was pleasantly surprised by the updates inside. We loved our stay!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little one-bedroom house. Just what we needed.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent, comfortable, home."
2022-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute house in a good location. Furniture is comfortable. House is on a busier street, so you do hear traffic passing by. Cleanliness needs to be improved."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We came to Adrian for a tournament for our son. It was a short stay, but everything was great. Very clean and well maintained. Thanks."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,just as advertised. 10/10
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this little house. The inside has been redone in a really classy way (think high end Lowe's). It had everything we needed - a big fridge, dishes, oil and spices in the cupboard, washer and dryer, lots of towels, two comfy couches for the kids to sleep on. Everything was clean, smelled nice, and felt like it had been set up with care. The bedroom was small but quiet and comfy and we got three great nights of sleep. The inside is great, so don't be dismayed by the outside, which is cute but dumpy, with an unfinished backyard that backs into an unmaintained yard. It's a small town, so everything is convenient, but this edge-of-town location was perfectly fine - among small houses that were only a block from much bigger, older houses of an established residential block."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay. Clean, private, and well cared for."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice area. Close to Main Street with all your needs and fun. The home was clean and well stocked with all essentials.

2020-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Overall a great little place to stay light and airy. No Tv both couches pull out one less than other but that gives you more time to talk or play games. Nice touches with the closet door also the kitchen and bathroom mirror..i would stay again but they sell a wireless teapot I would recommend it is 19.99 glass and lights up. But anyways it is a good find close to many things and. A cute downtown are
