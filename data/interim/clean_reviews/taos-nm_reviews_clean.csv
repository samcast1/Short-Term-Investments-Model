2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A beautiful home with vast views of big sky and high dessert. Very private. We loved watching the sunrise in the hot tub
and sunset with a glass of wine. Our dog loved chasing the ball down the driveway in the afternoon. Not too far from Taos, but you feel like you are in the middle of nowhere. I will definitely book again, but longer next time"

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house is special! The house is so cool and chic, but also really comfy and functional. It has everything you could possibly need! And the view…WOW…you look out over miles of magical land and mountains. Sitting out having our morning coffee with hummingbird’s flying around us and hot air balloons overhead was literally perfection! It’s also less than 15 min to Taos which has great restaurants and stores to check out. Would 100 percent recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely unique home. Was a nice get away to such a peaceful place. All the amities you could ask for. Melissa was a wonderful host and had clear instructions along with a great list of suggestions that helped make our stay even nicer.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Peaceful vacation weekend in a lovely house. Immensely enjoyed the outdoor space and indoor amenities. Kitchen is excellent. Close to neat hikes (Mamby hot springs) and Taos Mesa brewery. Enjoyable to stay at home as well. 10/10 would come back.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were so lucky this place was even available for our needed days. Book it ! We wish we could had stayed longer. This place is the perfect mountain retreat.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views, could use curtains in the front window at night"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,What an incredible stay. We loved everything from the location to the amenities. We were without absolutely nothing. We will definitely be back and recommend Melissa’s beautiful home to all of our friends and family. It was an amazing place to unwind and reconnect with our kids from our fast pace city life.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I can’t even begin to describe how magical this home is!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"By far the best place we’ve stayed in New Mexico. Stylish, modern, bright and comfortable house with forever views in all directions. Close to great restaurants, hikes, skiing and shopping. Not usually a hot tub fan, but this one was irresistible. Excellent host. Can’t wait to come back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location! Felt so private and peaceful even though the house is only 10 mins from town. Very little road noise; it was super peaceful to sit outside and enjoy the surrounding nature. Lovely hot tub! Would definitely stay here again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a unique property! Mountains surround the entire house - incredible views, remote but close to town, comfortable beds, amazing kitchen space. Spent a lot of our time relaxing outside and taking in the views. Melissa lefts tons of great recommendations and was quick to respond to all our questions. Would absolutely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"To say this place exceeded every expectation is an understatement. The house was located amid a beauiful mesa with clear views of mountains from every window.
The interior of the house was spacious, updated, spotless, and so tastefully decorated.
We enjoyed every perk and amenity the hosts offered and everything was in brand-new shape. The beds and linens were some of the most comfortable I've ever stayed in.
I stay in a lot of rentals, and this one by far is the only one that felt difficult to leave. It's worth every cent and then some."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a unique home in a beautiful and unique location. The amenities are great (especially the hot tub with Mountain views). Hosts are super responsive and thoughtful. Overall, an excellent stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa’s Huckleberry Home was an absolute dream, I couldn’t have been happier with the house, the location or my incredible host. This was my first time in Taos, and not only did Melissa provide some incredible recommendations (Orlando’s was delish), but she also provided everything I needed and more to feel right at home. To say I was sad to leave is an understatement, this is by far the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in. We had the best time cooking in the beautiful kitchen and stargazing from the hot tub! Can’t wait to visit again someday!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful and relaxing space. Our group had an amazing time cooking in the well equipped kitchen, stargazing from the hot tub, and taking in the surrounding mountain views. Beds were really comfortable which is such a bonus."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We cannot say enough amazing things about this place! It was magical and transformative! The views from the hot tub at sunrise, are beyond gorgeous and remind you of the beauty of the world around us! Star gazing at night from the patio, makes you feel like you’re in a snow globe…in your own private oasis of wonderment. We loved how accessible Taos Ski Valley was for snowboarding…we made a day trip to Santa Fe which was fun!…and we enjoyed all of the restaurant recommendations provided! Melissa and Vanessa were prompt and responsive, especially when snowboarding plans changed during to extreme weather conditions on our first day in town. We highly recommend this amazing home if you are searching for a place to reconnect and recenter ❤️"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed at a lot of BNB’s but this was hands down the best place my wife and I have ever stayed. Clean, comfortable and pure relaxation. We enjoyed the great views of the mountains in the jacuzzi and while having a bonfire. Everything we needed for cooking breakfast and dinner was supplied in the BNB. Vacation made easy by Melissa :)"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay. 10/10 would recommend.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Can’t say enough about our stay!! We had the most relaxing weekend. We felt comfortable and cozy at the house & couldn’t get over the views (especially from the hot tub). Melissa communicated with us all weekend which was super helpful.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We visit to get away. Because it's quiet. For us, the location is the draw. It just so happens that the house and the owner are also incredible."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was IDEAL. My husband and I can't say enough good things about it. The use of space is great, the views are unbelievable, the furniture is both elegant and not stuffy, just...it was perfect. The location is wonderful, within easy driving distance of good restaurants, downtown Taos, and the ski village. Melissa left us a list of awesome recommendations for restaurants in the area and they did not disappoint! We want to come back soon and stay longer!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location, thoughtfully decorated, extremely peaceful. Melissa maintained proactive coms throughout. special place."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing three-night stay at the Huckleberry House, while visiting Taos!
Was greeted with an epic sunset upon arriving as well as a handwritten greeting inside… set the tone for a great stay.
Enjoyed all the amenities the Huckleberry had to offer between trips up the valley to enjoy the slopes. Definitely will look to book again in the future... Can't say enough about the home or the location... If you stay at the Huckleberry House - I would encourage you to catch every sunrise & sunset!!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at this house! Not only was it clean and comfortable, but the house and views were beautiful as well. The kitchen was well stocked, and there are many tasty restaurants within a short driving distance. We'd be happy to return in the future."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had SUCH an amazing weekend in El Prado/ Taos. Melissa's house was incredible - as was the view from the hot tub! We went skiing at Taos and afterwards we were so excited to return to the airbnb to relax. Melissa also had great recommendations for local eats and drinks. Town was a little quiet this time of year, so we cooked a few meals in and the kitchen was great for that. The airbnb is very close to town, the ski mountain and other fun things in the area. Totally recommend doing a tour of Taos Pueblo. Can't wait to come back!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great remote getaway for peace and quiet with 360 degree panoramic views. Every room in the house has a spectacular scenic view. Clean comfortable furniture, bedding and utensils. Easy access to the enchanted circle. Melissa is a friendly host that cares about your experience and very responsive!
We'll be back!
Jack"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible. A little slice of heaven that feels like you’re all by yourself though very close to anything you need. Delightful space. Perfect for a disconnected getaway.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t have asked for more. Absolutely loved the decor, gorgeous views, hot tub, well stocked kitchen, wide assortment of teas, and beautiful heated floors. I injured my knee on the second day of skiing and coming home to such a cozy and accommodating set up was truly a relief. I would absolutely recommend Melissa and her thoughtfully curated space to anyone looking to spend time in Taos and the surround area."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely place with beautiful views from the house and hot tub. House matched the pictures perfectly and was very well appointed. Just wish we could have stayed longer.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place! Beautiful views and lots of things to do and see In the area :)
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This stay is an absolute gem in the Taos Valley area. The views are stunning and the house is so cozy and comfortable. Melissa was extremely communicative and friendly. I would highly highly recommend!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Huckleberry House was a great place for a peaceful vacation! The hosts were really good about communication and checking in, and welcomed us to enjoy all the house had to offer. The view is unbelievable. Soaking in the hot tub surrounded by desert white sage while watching the moon rise over the snow-capped Rocky Mountains illuminated by alpenglow was nothing short of magical. The kitchen is well-equipped, with a really powerful gas stove and lots of counter space. Having a full bathroom for each bedroom is convenient. The wi-fi is fast and reliable. The property is not quite as isolated as it looks in the pictures, but the neighbors on both sides were quiet. The location is great. It was an easy drive from Albuquerque, and Taos is nearby, with great culture and lots to see and do. I hope to come back for another stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was wonderful at El Prada. The place was beautiful and well decorated. We loved the hot tub and many of the adventures we had. We appreciated the attention to detail and will recommend to friends.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great space!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Huckleberry house was outstanding! Beautiful location and home. Close to downtown Taos, ski resorts, Ojo Caliente Mineral springs, Enchanted circle scenic byway and so much more.
It snowed while we were there so after a day of shopping we made Some soup and enjoyed the hot tub before Settling in for a movie.
5 stars!!! Can’t wait to book again in the spring!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was amazing - hands down our favorite Airbnb we've ever stayed at. Truly incredible views from every single angle. We lucked out and got to witness snowfall and a full moon over the mountains.
The place itself was exactly as described and pictured: clean, warm (stayed in late Nov), well decorated, and had an awesome, well-stocked kitchen. We cannot wait to come back... it was so hard to leave this place!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay! The location was in great proximity to everything we wanted to do in Taos, Taos Ski Valley, and the surrounding area. The property itself was well appointed with comfortable beds, good quality linens, and had tons of amenities - even a few we didn't expect like Turkish towels (which we love) and fun toys our kiddos enjoyed. It's also difficult to describe how amazing the hot tub is under the open sky before the sun rises (props to Melissa for that strong rec). What a restful, dreamy experience we would highly recommend! Melissa was an amazing host as well and provided everything we needed for a great stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home strikes a perfect balance between seclusion and convenience. Its unique location offers 360-degree views of the natural surroundings, making it an ideal spot for high-desert view lovers. At night, the experience is elevated by a hot tub session under the stars. The house itself is well furnished, featuring a stunning kitchen and a cozy living space, all maintained with the highest standards of cleanliness. Additionally, its proximity to some of Taos's best restaurants, just a mere 10-minute drive to the downtown area, offers easy access to the local culinary scene. This house is a gem, and we're already looking forward to our next stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the perfect place if you’re looking to relax in the desert. Taos is interesting and authentic. The people are friendly. The house is well appointed and very comfortable with a crazy cute loft for kids or a third bed to sleep. We spent every night watching the moon rise over the mountains and returned feeling refreshed. We liked it so much that we already rebooked.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Never have I had such a relaxing stay with stunning views. Everything was perfect and well worth the trip.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa was a thoughtful, communicative and helpful host. We had plenty to do and her home was a peaceful way to begin and end our day. Stars were clear, sunsets and sunrises magical."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely fabulous--definitely a gem. Beautiful stargazing with the milky way overhead, a hottub, and a firepit. Gorgeous vistas. Far enough away from town that you feel truely away from it all, but the main strip of Taos is a 10-15 minute drive with everything you need and tons of cute shops. The place itself is stellar--super clean, updated, and decorated with some really cool pieces. Total zen. This is really what airbnb is supposed to be."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had the best time on our trip. The house was beautiful and had everything we needed. The views were breathtaking! This was a dream trip. Thank you Melissa for being an outstanding host.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in homes throughout the Taos area yearly for the last decade, from earthships far out on the mesa to condos and casitas squeezed in town close to the plaza. Our stay in Melissas home far surpassed all other visits!!
The design of the home is impressive, the views amazing, experiencing the Taos mesa stars at night from the hot tub and the incredible sunrise over the mountains each morning was awe inspiring. I have really enjoyed many of the places we have stayed, but Melissas home is the first place that made me say,,,I Only want to stay here in the future!!!
Melissa was attentive, easy to contact and flexible, I enjoyed interacting with her. The attention to detail in the home, the design aesthetic, the high end appliances and marvelous bedding made our stay carefree. Melissas home is truly the Only Place I want to stay on future trips to Taos!! Five Stars !!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such an awesome gem! Far enough out of town to see the entire night sky, but close enough to easily meet up with friends. The house has great amenities, a fun hot tub, and is a super cozy place to stay. We hope it’s available the next time we’re in Taos!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Melissa's place. We travel as a couple and like places that provide quiet, privacy and beauty; Melissa's placed lived up to our expectations. The TV in the living room was also better to watch than I expected because it's on the smaller side these days. But checking out some college football was great. The kitchen has gas burners (nice), and the hood is nice. The place was very clean. We highly recommend the place for couples. Thanks Melissa!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the Huckleberry House, surrounded by sage brush, so much! The passive solar was terrific. The 360 view was spectacular. And, the outdoor space was excellent. If I ever come back to Taos I’d rent this house in a heartbeat"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Better than the photos. Perfect Air BnB to soak in the beauty of beauty of New Mexico while being close enough to downtown Taos to easily fill up on NM cuisine.
We loved our girls retreat here. You will, too."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Close enough for the convenience of town but far enough away for privacy, peacefulness and quiet. Loved the expansive skies, especially for watching the spectacular storms. The layout of the house is perfect, very open and bright. We had everything we needed and really enjoyed coming back at the end of the day."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice to stay with lots scenic views.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property, honestly even better than the photos."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay very much! The cabin was private with beautiful scenery. We appreciated the recommendations on places to check out and the proactive communication.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic home. Love this area. Super short drive to everything the area has to offer. Host and all the team were great! Great communication. Very clean with special touches and attention to detail throughout. Wonderful 360 degree views! Wouldn’t change a thing.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Melissa was an excellent host and the Huckleberry house is amazing. Perfect location to be near our friends wedding at Luna Mystica. Gorgeous views and and atmosphere just outside of Taos. We definitely look forward to coming back out in the winter.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Huckleberry House was amazing. So relaxing and the views were incredible. The sunrise and sunsets were gorgeous and different every night. It was the perfect location to do day trips all around the Taos area and then retreat to the house and relax on the porch to take in the views or chill in the hot tub. Would totally recommend to anyone.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I think someone already said it, but...the views, the views, the views! Gorgeous & peaceful scenery, fantastic star-gazing (in or out of the hot tub!) and all the amenities you could need.
Great internet for remote working and a cool library to peruse. Only a short drive from town, and very much worth it for the extra serenity, highly recommended!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I may leave out a thing or two after a long night of travel, but we have nothing but good things to say about this house and location. This was our second summer in Taos in a year; last year we stayed near the plaza. This year we enjoyed being a little removed from the downtown scene.
The views from the house are incredible, there's easy access to town and all of the exploring we had planned, and we enjoyed watching small planes land and take off in the distance (far enough away that you can't hear them). I wouldn't change anything about the house. It was very comfortable even without air conditioning, it had everything we needed, it was very clean, very comfortable beds, and we enjoyed hours of sitting on the patio staring into the distance with coffee or cocktails. We took advantage of the hot-tub one evening and there was a gentle cool rain coming down; it was perfect. We were visited by the jack rabbit and many birds and we spotted a coyote crossing the road. Highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our experience at Melissa's home was outstanding. The location was private and beautiful and the house itself was even nicer than the pictures posted online. There are amazing views from every window, and the interior is tastefully decorated; you can tell that it was designed with intention and care.
The house is far enough away from town to feel isolated and peaceful while still being convenient to shopping/restaurants/etc - I don't think that it took more than 10 to 15 minutes to get to the Taos Plaza. The location also made it easy to make side treks to the Gorge (less than 5 minutes away) and the nearby ski villages.
Melissa communicated proactively throughout and provided numerous helpful suggestions for dining and activities. We would be thrilled to stay in her home again the next time we pass through the Taos area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a magical place that I hope to return to often. The home is stunning, the views left us breathless, the hot tub and star gazing combination was an unexpected treat as were the daily jackrabbit visitors and the hot air balloons off in the distance at dawn. We had fun exploring the town, eating at great restaurants, and catching an unexpected concert at the brew pub just down the street. Truely a destination home to visit that we couldn't recommend highly enough!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, beautiful location. The home was modern and well-appointed. The views were amazing from every window in the place! A great spot, just a few minutes from local attractions and shopping/restaurants. A great escape :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was perfect.. house was fantastic. Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a magical spot--360 degree views! The house is meticulously clean with so many thoughtful places to sit and view the landscape, both in and outside of the house. We enjoyed cooking meals in the well stocked kitchen and eating at the outside picnic table under the stars. Also loved hanging out in the hammock and hot tub. The house is a quick drive into Taos but also you feel like you are out in the peaceful wilderness when you are home. Easy access to great hikes, bike rides, and runs. Hope to return one day!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The ""huckleberry house"" ❤️is a wonderful place to stay with beautiful views and peaceful surroundings. I loved the eclectic book selection as well as all the other amenities and immaculate home! I used my time there to 'reset' and I hope to visit the ""huckleberry house"" again soon as I love Taos!💕❤️
Melissa and her team do an excellent job hosting & maintaining a wonderful destination. Exactly the place you want to stay!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an awesome stay and I will be missing those views! Such a great space and Taos is amazing. 10/10
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our family of 4 and our dog, Buddy loved our stay! From waking up in the morning to a beautiful sunrise to unwinding in the evenings in the hot tub, our stay was relaxing and peaceful with everything we needed. We loved the location, close to Taos, yet away from the
hecticness of town. The kitchen was well stocked with anything you might need to prepare a meal and the beds were very comfortable. I appreciated Melissa's guide as well as a nice selection of books.
Our family would definitely love to come stay again and would highly recommend it to others!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was the perfect, peaceful retreat we imagined. It truly felt magical.
Melissa was so helpful and responsive on all the things! The home was not o to beautiful and marched the description, but was an designers dream. So luxurious, carefully curated, and with so many thoughtful meaningful details. It didn’t feel like your average Airbnb or hotel stay. We loved it and can’t wait to come back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"To sum up Huckleberry House in one word, I would use Spectacular! The property is amazing and it was everything that Melissa said it was. The views are amazing and the house is incredible!! We absolutely loved the house and plan to stay there again next time we are in Taos. Hopefully it will be available. :) The home is so thoughtfully laid out and Melissa provided great instructions on everything about the house. The cell service is non-existent but there is good wifi at the house so you can still make calls. We saw hot air balloons over the Rio Grande Gorge and so enjoyed sitting on the patio with our morning coffee. If you are looking for a place to get away and decompress, this property is the place to go!! Thank you Melissa for everything!!
CKP"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time at the Huckleberry home. Very peaceful and you can see lots of stars at night! Would definitely come stay again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The views, the views, the views! The views are even better than described in the listing. Every accommodation you could need with a fully stocked kitchen and all bath amenities. Time slowed down for us while we were here in the best way possible. The hot tub was perfect at the end of a day of exploring Taos and the surrounding area. Patio was ideal for morning coffee. Watching the clouds and weather roll in around the mountains was the best show each day! Easy access into town and also to the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge and surrounding hiking, etc. While we were there, most of Taos experienced a major internet outage but we never lost service here!
Suggestions for what to do in and around Taos were also helpful, especially the restaurant recommendations. Melissa was a super host, very clear communication both before, during, and after our stay.
We had a fantastic time! If you are going to Taos - this is the place to stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was perfectly appointed and Melissa was exceptionally communicative!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I have never stayed at an air bnb twice besides at Melissa’s place. And we hope to keep coming back every year!! The views are amazing, the location is perfect for hiking or going into town, the house is clean including the hot tub and it is wonderfully decorated. I can’t say enough good things about this house. You really need to see it for yourself because it’s even more amazing than the pics!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa's home in Taos, NM was an excellent place to stay. The house design is interesting and beautiful with so many unique details. The bed's were extremely comfortable and the bedding was wonderful and high-end. Everything was so clean and organized and the kitchen had everything you could need. The floor to ceiling windows allowed beautiful views and elevated our stay. Her jacuzzi was perfect with just the right amount of privacy for comfort. Melissa and team have created a super comfortable setting for the perfect getaway. We enjoyed stargazing and just relaxing whenever we were at the house. We would love to visit again and bring family. I would definitely recommend this home and hope to come back. Thank you Melissa for all of your attention to detail and quick responses to any of my questions."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I can’t wait to come back. What a fantastic location and place to stay. Views for miles! Excellence in every corner of the house.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay and plan on returning.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a great place! Everything was just as described. The area was private and everything was clean and super nice. We loved the place and the kids loved playing in the sand! Great views no matter the weather and close to lots of attractions.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a magical stay at the Huckleberry House—expansive views in every direction. The house was clean and cozy, with many thoughtful touches. Definitely a place to get creative, unwind, or launch into a nearby adventure."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house with more character than the typical cookie cutter Airbnb. Only ten minutes to town but feels like the worlds away when you’re at the house. Host communication was tremendously helpful and proactive. Excellent stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I spent 4 days and 3 nights in this amazing house with its 360 panoramic views... and I never got in my car the entire time I was there. Grant it, I was taking a break from the road to work for a bit. It was pretty much perfect in every way."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The perfect stay just outside of Taos. We found this to be exactly what we were looking for— tranquil, private, and just far enough from town (10 minutes) to still be able to enjoy the Taos restaurant scene. Melissa’s home was pristine and well designed, with a curated space that made it feel truly special. The views from the house for sunrise and sunset are unparalleled. 10/10 stay— thanks Melissa! We’ll be coming back to the Huckleberry House soon."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an exceptionally nice place to live in. There was plenty of living area that offered gorgeous views of the landscape, picturesque sunsets and sunrises through the many windows. The blanket of sagebrush softened the expected outside noise and produce a sound of silence for solitude. We drank water straight from the tap that is as good as any you can buy. It is located just far enough out of town to give that country feel but still close enough to enjoy the many amenities the city had to offer. We highly recommend the Huckleberry House and hope to be back again. BH"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Melissa's for a few nights with our two kids. The house is immaculate and is just a really special place. Filled with sunshine, amazing views, and everything you could possibly need. The hot tub is perfection, and the whole house is really well appointed and comfortable. I spent a lot of time just gazing out at the mountains, as the views are truly spectacular. Melissa was in touch throughout making sure everything was OK. Definitely one of our best airbnb stays ever."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is as ideal as it gets when it comes to a peaceful, beautiful, and rejuvenating stay! Every morning the sun rises behind the mountain and easily enjoyed from the hot tub. Small dining table outside to enjoy breakfast. Hardly ever saw anyone around. Felt very private and quiet. All you could hear is the wind.
Melissa is extremely communicative throughout the stay. Any questions were answered very quickly. The kitchen is amazing. Plenty of space to prep and everything in great working condition. Anything you need is available. Overall the entire property is very clean. Would definitely return to this amazing property!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed the accommodations, seclusion and privacy, and proximity to both Taos and other fun activities. The home was welcoming with exquisite views and unique amenities. We would love to stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy, clean, comfortable. A relaxing, quiet home with all the modern conveniences. Easy to town and ski valley as well as all the natural beauty northern New Mexico has to offer. Host was super responsive and thoughtful. Stay here!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique and beautiful place! We loved cooking in the spacious kitchen and the views of the surrounding area were gorgeous, the hot tub was the icing on the cake!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful experience and one of the best hosts I have ever had!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great spot in Taos! Beautiful home and setting everything was as mentioned in the listing. Melissa is very responsive.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wow! Stunning vistas from a beautiful, exquisitely designed and appointed home. Peaceful, inspirational, comfortable, modern yet welcoming, remote yet accessible. Melissa is a fabulous host, very proactive and responsive, with great recommendations. We will be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were wowed by the design and layout of this beautiful home! So many comfortable furnishings welcomed us (beds, linens, reclining couch). There are tons of artistic touches (the space is full of creativity) and beautiful picture windows to soak in all of the desert and mountain surroundings both day and night.
The kitchen was the highlight for my chef husband (very well equipped), the dog loved the surroundings outside, and the baby had heated floors and a great crawlspace to play in. I loved the desk and library. Thank you for sharing!
Check in was easy. There are houses either side but you hardly notice them while enjoying the house. All very private.
We loved sharing meals at the family table, star gazing in the hot tub (super clean), having the mesa surround us on the doorstep and yet only being a short drive to town, the gorge, the mountains.
We really appreciated all the help and communication with Melissa and Vanessa who could not have made our stay more enjoyable!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely fabulous
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at this phenomenal house. The house itself is clean, bright, spacious, and well-furnished, but it's the spectacular views from every window that truly set it apart - waking up to a dramatic sunrise over the mountains in the morning, and then enjoying a drink during the beautiful NM sunset in the evening. We especially loved the hot tub with mountain views, the floors with radiant heating, and watching a hot air balloon that seems to have its launch and landing area in a nearby field. Town is a short drive away, and we took advantage of the easy trip to Taos Ski Valley to do some skiing and snowboarding. We did not want to leave, and hope to visit again some day."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great long weekend at Melissa's place. It was clean. well-stocked, comfortable, and the design really takes advantage of the mountain views from the mesa. It's in an enclave of similar homes that are somewhat close to each other considering the expanse of the land, but they have done a good job orientating the homes to maximize the privacy. Melissa was very helpful and I would stay here again. Thanks!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I will definitely be back!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I flew into Santa Fe and stayed here for our yearly snowboarding trip. We went to Taos and had a great time. It was a short drive, as were McDonald’s and some nice Mexican spots. The house is VERY peaceful and modern and we really enjoyed the sketching area. Highly recommended!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful vacation home with a hot tub to relax in at the end of the day!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay and unwind.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay. Melissa was very responsive and the home was exactly as expected. I would definitely stay again should I return to the area. Thanks for a great retreat.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing spot with beautiful views! Great WiFi for working remotely and very peaceful for getting away from work. A great kitchen for cooking and a short drive to the Rio Grande, skiing and Arroyo Seco shops/restaurants."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a lovely time here. Check-in was easy. Finding the right drive way was tricky driving in at night, but we made it lol. Maybe add GPS coordinates to your welcome message? Our favorite part was the panoramic views of the mountains and of course the heated floors throughout. amazing! Thanks for sharing your home with us!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A truly amazing home in a perfect location. We had so much fun exploring Taos and meeting everyone in the community.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved the house— it was a perfect place to stay while visiting Taos. The beds were comfy, kitchen clean and spacious, and the 360 view unparalleled. And did we mention the hot tub!? We’re coming back in the spring and will stay here again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a treat to stay here, we’ll be back again for sure!
The privacy, views, hot tub and floods of natural light were our favorite parts. Feels remote but less than 15 minutes from downtown Taos and all it has to offer."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This ""Butterfly House"" was a fantastic place to stay. Big views of the mountains and a short walk away fromt the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument. Melissa was a wonderful host and provided lots of help with the entry to the house. And...there was coffee in the kitchen (important for us) and it was stocked with lots of yummy munchies. Can't ask for more.
This is a partly solar powered (no solar at night obviously!) house, and is a modern design with almost 360 degree views of the mountains and a view of the Rio Grande Gorge. Love this place."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here. Hot tub was amazing and the views were awesome. We will definitely be back. It was peaceful. Was a lil away from town to make it feel out of town but also close enough to get food to cook or eat at a restaurant. We were glad we could bring our dog. Wish the telescope wkuld have worked as we had a nice clear night with a full moon. Things were stocked and house was clean. Kitchen had everything needed to fix a nice meal. Was relaxing and peaceful. Can’t wait to return soon. Will definitely be our go to place to stay when visiting Red River.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa’s home was beautiful and comfortable, and very clean. We really appreciated the chance to bring our pets as well!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What can I say that everyone else hasn’t already said? Literally the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Incredible views, comfortable beds, massive and well-equipped kitchen, and so many special places for the family to spread out and explore or relax. The house is so thoughtfully designed and the natural light and views in every direction make for such a peaceful experience. I just can’t say enough great things about this home. Thank you so much Melissa. We would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was amazing we hiked in the “backyard”
The vibe and feel was amazing grounded in the sand while playing fetch with our dog who was retrieving her ball from a patch of snow the hot tub was awesome, kitchen had everything we needed.
6 minutes from the Gorge bridge which was amazing would love to come again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"AMAZING!! This is a magnificent home that manages to strike the balance between being both modern and warm at the same time. The pictures don't come close to showing all of the nice touches the owners have included for you. The beds are super comfy, the heated cement floors are SO cool, the kitchen is awesome and has everything you'll need and the view of the stars from the hot tub each night will take your breath away. You can see the milky way and we lost count of all the shooting stars and satellites we saw. Honestly, the views from almost every room will make you stop and stare, it was hard to concentrate on cooking with the floor to ceiling southern facing windows. We were lucky enough to have some snow during our stay and it really put the cherry on top. Make sure you drive the 5 minutes to the gorge bridge and watch out for big horn sheep while you're there! We even had a few hot air balloons floating around during our last day. We will definitely be back!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you’re looking for a relaxing, spacious home base to explore the Taos valley, look no further. Our group of 4 plus two dogs had a wonderful time at the property. A great balance of tranquility and access to local activities"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing views and very quiet highly recommended
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Oh wow. Beautiful high desert, wonderful hosts, tasteful touches. Fantastic. Go. If not, I’ll be there."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All the reviews are spot on. This is a great property and the host is more than accommodating. Our favorite part is the wonderful vista views and sunsets. The purple hue over the mountains will make you smile. Thanks so much for sharing your home.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful vistas in a fun town, we enjoyed our stay."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Melissa's house was great - she was very accommodating and generous with what she offers when you stay and has lots of little touches to make you feel at home. The location was great - views of the wide open plains one direction and beautiful view of the mountains the other direction. The listing was very accurate and would highly recommend staying here when visiting Taos and the surrounding areas. Thank you!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was probably the best Air BnB experience we've ever had. Everything was absolutely perfect. Stunning views, amazing hot tub, great location, so many little touches that just made this a perfect getaway for my wife & I. We already can't wait to go back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"OMG this is a diamond stay!! I don't know where to start because all the other reviews are 100% spot on and can't say enough about how much we enjoyed this home for our girls trip. The property makes you feel secluded in a good way, with only a couple-minute drive to the main road to get anywhere. Melissa was A+ on communication prior to and during the stay which was very appreciated. Stargazing (and being able to see the Milky Way band!) was soooo zen at night. Comfortable beds, perfect hot tub temp, basic meal prep items in the kitchen saved us from purchasing the same for just a short trip. Little personal touches were left around the house for us as well.
If you're still pondering on whether to reserve or not by this point... don't. BOOK NOW you will not be disappointed. I will be back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic home, location, and hosts. We enjoyed the architecture and thoughtful design of the home and the warmth of the furnishings. Well stocked for meal preparation. Great place to relax and watch the ever changing big sky views. Highly recommended!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay if you're looking to unplug from it all or be somewhat close to the action. We had restful nights and relaxing mornings before heading out for hiking or wine tastings. We had a great stay here and hope you do too!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, pristine home with terrific views. You can’t beat relaxing in the hot tub and looking out at the mountains. Perfect location to easily get to both the ski valley and Taos. Bright, cheerful and well appointed, we had everything we needed. Melissa was attentive and thoughtful. Thanks for a sharing your home."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a Taos gem with incredible views, top of the line amenities/appliances, and beautiful craftsmanship. Check-in/out was easy, parking is spacious, and it's close to so much cool stuff! I hope I can stay here again and some point in the future!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Better than anticipated and we'll worth the effort to drive from Houston to take in this amazing gem near Taos! Host, home, and hospitality are top knotch! The views, wildlife, and landscape are stunning. You will definitely leave refreshed and renewed. Tell your friends and family. We will be back again real soon for another stay Melissa."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is an absolute gem. If you’re looking for a private stay that is still accessible to all the Taos amenities, this is the place. 360-degree views. Stocked kitchen. Lovely hot tub. Stable, fast Wi-Fi. A short drive to town and the Gorge. We were sad to leave and can’t wait to return again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really beautiful place in a lovely setting! Melissa responds quickly and was a really great host -- lots of little touches as well, handwritten notes. :) Really perfect -- and make sure to go outside at night: the stars are amazing!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at this beautiful house, Melissa was a fantastic host and provided everything you might need during your stay in Taos. Fully stocked kitchen, clean, comfy, beautiful setting, close to town but still feels private and remote. The views are stunning, the hot tub is divine. The temperature inside was perfect even on warm days. We can’t wait to come back and visit this special space again. Overall a fantastic Airbnb experience in every way!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of the absolute best AirBnb homes we have stayed in. The home is bright, airy, and beautifully decorated. The mountain views are gorgeous and the perfect backdrop while soaking in the hot tub. We were ready to move in!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The desert oasis that is the huckleberry house was the perfect spot to enjoy time away with a few friends and our pups. My husband enjoyed raking what he called the zen garden each morning and the kitchen had everything we needed to prepare simple meals. We were worried about the heat without AC, but the airflow in the house with the fans was quite pleasant and we were very comfortable overall."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place and location
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"BEAUTIFUL property, amazing views, FANTASTIC HOSTS, everything you need...and more...perfect stay! Definitely recommend!!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful house, with a wonderful location. Quiet and private, yet close to Taos for everything you need."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! Melissa has everything just right. Our family was comfortable in the two bedrooms and the views are stunning! The kitchen has everything you need and the decor is fabulous. We are so glad we stayed here. The house is close to everything, too."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best and most rejuvenating places I’ve ever stayed. The house had perfect accommodations (starry nights, hot tub, fire pit, chef’s kitchen, dead silence) and was close to great restaurants, the Rio Grande and Earthships. A must-stay paradise."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Huckleberry house is amazing! Great views of the mountains right out the back patio with a hot tub, beautiful space, and only 10min drive to town. Very good communication from the host, and many small touches to help you have a great time in Taos. The place stayed cool in July due to its passive heat/cool design. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property was BETTER in-person than the listing. Melissa has crafted a space to soak up the beautiful mountain view. We watched the sunrise over the mountains every morning from the private and unobstructed eastern view. From the living room, we gazed at the southern view. Though there are other homes in the greater area, this property feels secluded and private because of the deliberate positioning. We ate breakfast and dinner at the property each day, and Melissa had everything we needed. We explored the trails of Taos Ski Valley, visited a few landmarks Melissa suggested, then drove over to hike and explore the Bandelier Monument in Los Alamos. This property was a perfect central location! But it was also a beautiful space to spend time together as a family. Thanks SO MUCH for sharing your home with us!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was the best air bnb we have ever stayed in. The view is unbeatable. There is nothing like sitting in a hot tub and watching the sunset after a long day of hiking. Besides the view the house itself was awesome too so modern and incredibly clean. Good location just right outside the hustle and bustle of Taos. Easy to get to mountains and downtown shops. Also dog friendly which is a huge plus. We will def book here again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Designers paradise! The Huck House is perfectly put together inside and out with the most epic views. The hot tub was incredible! Walking up to the sunrise everyday was simply stunning. We were so happy with our stay and grateful for the experience. Very clean. Thank you so much for hosting us.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is such a peaceful and lovely spot. Close to town yet also so quiet and peaceful. We loved the simple modern aesthetic and all the lovely touches. The kitchen was well-equipped, hot tub was amazing, and we loved relaxing on the outdoor patios. Cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay here. We come to Taos 3-4 times a year and this is definitely our new favorite spot to stay. Many thanks to Melissa and Jared for their hospitality and wonderful communication and opening up their lovely home for us to stay there!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10/10 would recommend! Beautiful and comfortable home with gorgeous views. Short drive to Taos shopping and restaurants. We especially enjoyed the wide selection of books in the house! Great for sitting on the patio to read and take in the mountain air. We will definitely be back!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I absolutely loved my stay at the Huckleberry house.
The home is very clean, beds are comfy and we loved the views!
Melissa was great to work with and communication.
The sunrise and sunset are fantastic,
The floors are great too and hot tub was really nice help a 'lot to relive stress really calm and the hammock was great really nice to lay in the morning!! And one last thing I really like is that Dogs are welcomed.
We truly enjoyed our stay and would recommend to anyone considering to stay here.
Thank you!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved my stay at the Huckleberry house. The pictures don't even do it justice, it's open and gorgeous. Everything you need is there, I cooked almost every meal in the great kitchen and found all the equipment I needed. The bedrooms are quiet and comfy...the bed was great! The hot tub is actually in a nice private area...I loved that I could sit out in it and not see other houses (and vice versa). I never realized that most people have their hot tubs too hot - the temperature on this one was perfect!
I didn't want to work on my laptop much, but I had to a little, so I was really happy to have a dedicated desk area.
Here's something many hosts miss - mirrors and good lighting! This is the first place I've had that did that perfectly, the lights in the bathroom are fantastic, and there are two full length mirrors so you can actually check out what you look like before you head out!
I loved the chiropractic bench in the dining room, it really worked out some kinks I had going on, and the couch...well, let's just say I took quite a few naps on it, most comfortable couch ever.
The views and location are spectacular...I will definitely be booking this property again! Thank you hosts!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The home is very clean, beds are comfy and we loved the views! The serenity and the quiet was exactly what we needed! We stay in airbnbs quite often, but this is the first time we've stayed in someone's actual home. After we got past the initial feeling of intruding on someone elses territory, we felt very comfortable. And it's not as if there's personal stuff everywhere; it's very subtle.
Communication with Melissa was effortless, and we appreciated her recommendations for restaurants, The Rio Grande Gorge and the Earthship. Everything she recommended was wonderful!
The only thing I would suggest is supplying beach towels for the hot tub. We didn't bring ours, since they're usually provided, and the bath towels were a bit small for that.
I would definitely recommend this place to others. Thanks Melissa!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful time! Will def go back as this was my first time in NM. Melissa was great to work with and communication was top notch. She checked in with me and also sent a good list of suggestions of what to do. A really cool house with a jacuzzi, hiking and stars to check out. 5/5 would be out again. Would love to be out there during ski season. Main Street was cool with a mini market and shops to check out."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We found the house architecture and style to be a perfect match for our tastes. The sunrise and sunset are fantastic, and on clear nights you are far enough out that you can do star gazing or astrophotography with minimal light pollution. Within 20+ minute drive you can be at an altitude of 7000+ feet hiking in the mountains surrounding Taos. The host has a 110v external plug for EVs, and there is a level 2 charger by the city park if you need it. The host was always available for questions, and extremely helpful. Overall, it was a perfect getaway if you like nature and want to relax."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Melissa’s place was beautiful and a great experience. The place was clean, comfortable and exactly as advertised. The views are wonderful, and the large windows don’t disappoint! The location provides a perfect starting point for any Taos adventure. Melissa was also very accommodating and available throughout our trip. We truly enjoyed our stay and would recommend to anyone considering to stay here. Thank you!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very easy to reserve with great communication. Very comfortable with essentials provided. Enjoyable hot tub with beautiful views to help with relaxing. Had a wonderful time and would go back again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Highly recommend Melissa’s place! The house was awesome! Can’t beat sitting in the hot tub looking out over the mountains or staring up at a sky full of stars. The house was clean and well stocked with everything we needed. Melissa was great with communication and checked in on us throughout our stay. We will definitely be back!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa’s place was super homey and stunning! The pictures don’t do it justice. A great tranquil place in the middle of the desert. Be mindful of smoke, fires, and wind. This Airbnb does not have A/C, so the windows need to be opened for the home to be cooled. If you have allergies like myself, prepare in advance if there is smoke. These are common weather patterns in the area. Be respectful of the land and community and you will absolutely have an amazing time! Cheers!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can't say enough about how we enjoyed our stay. This was a beautiful, soulful functioning home. The spirit of our artist-hosts prevailed during the stay. Comfortable, beautifully built, well appointed. Every convenience provided. This is a happy place. It feels remote and private yet so close to Taos and all the wonders this region has to offer. We will be back someday."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is very cool and cozy- a perfect landing pad. We loved the solitude outside in the evenings. During the day there’s some construction activity on both sides of the house, but it wasn’t too obtrusive."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location of this house was amazing. Beautiful views of snow covered mountains, sunsets and sun rises. The house was cozy and stylish."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Charming, unique house, amazing night skies, awesome views and hot tub after skiing or exploring . What more could you ask for?"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a wonderful place!! The home is elegant in it's simplicity and thoughtful layout and design. Melissa left very clear instructions and was available quickly for my few questions. The views are astounding, both from inside the house and the hottub! The road was great for long sunset run, walk, and bikes. Highly recommend Ojo Caliente, Hanuman Temple, and St Francisco de Asis historical Cathedral. Great location too: Taos Ski Valley is about 40 minutes, and Ojo Caliente about 40 minutes. Loved the Slide Trail too."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay, great house, great views, and great host. Very friendly and communicative. Definitely recommend relaxing in the hot tub at sun set and enjoy the view."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great place! We really enjoyed the quiet and even saw a couple hot air balloons."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay! We will be back!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing space! Great location! Beautiful landscape. The hot tub was a favorite as was the kitchen. Super peaceful space. Easy to get to the Rio Grande, Taos Ski Valley and Taos. Highly recommend. Will definitely visit again!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Love the place. Very private with amazing furnishings. The hosts were extremely communicative and great to work with. Already planning our next stay here!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible visit to the El Prado house. The communication throughout the process and our stay was excellent, and the house and location exceeded our expectations. It’s super comfortable, well-equipped, well-designed and the setting is amazing. We explored the area, Taos and the ski valley and had a blast."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location and home. Very much enjoyed it. Thank you
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous views and the hot tub was amazing, super convenient location for skiing!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! Melissa was super communicative and helpful. The place was beautiful, funky, and had great views of the stars.
The beds were comfy, TVs had Netflix and Hulu access, and hot tub was lovely! The place was bright and sunny and an easy 30 minutes to Taos ski valley and 15 minutes to a grocery store and downtown Taos. Would recommend going in the opposite direction to the gorge bridge!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a fantastic time! What a relaxing location and view, perfect to get away."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Google maps will steer you wrong so follow Melissa's directions for arrival. Amazing space!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Melissa and her home are simply fabulous! Nothing more you could want than what she has provided. A true oasis! We hope to visit again!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax.
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, just outside of Taos"
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house is a gem! The location and views made for a really lovely stay. The house is modern with new appliances, a fully stocked kitchen, comfy beds, and a hot tub under the stars."
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's a cute and interesting house, the family who lives here seems really lovely, and the Taos plateau is magical. We were looking for a nice, quiet place to bring our friends, who came from out-of state, and we were excited to be able to stay outside of town. We didn't mind the rate, which averaged out to over $530/night, because we wanted something a little special, but were a bit surprised by some of the aspects of the stay. Since the photos on the listing were taken, houses have been erected on either side of the Airbnb property, and one of them was actively being worked on by some friendly contractors while we were there. Some of the amenities also seemed pretty basic for what we were paying (e.g. I would have expected shampoo, soap and conditioner instead of ""3-in-1,"" but again that's just because the rate was so high). The mattress in our bedroom was also extremely flimsy and sagged, and we didn't sleep well (I'm guessing the Tempurpedic mattress mentioned in the listing was in the other room). Check-out time was at 10am, as opposed to the standard 11, and we were asked to do dishes, start the laundry and carry the trash down the long driveway and across the street before we left — even though we paid a $200 cleaning fee. It's all little stuff, but it made our stay, and particularly our last day, feel less like a vacation."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place definitely brings you closer to the nature. Beautiful home surrounded by breathtaking scenery. Loved our stay there. Would love to go here again.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is so amazing it’s tempting to not just stay and hang out the entire trip!! The backdrop is sooo gorgeous and even cooler that you have an amazing view of the mountains while you sit in the hot tub, it was snowy while we were visiting and super cozy. The kitchen is so nice to cook in and the house was so cool. Melissa and her husband were so helpful with great recommendations and tips to getting around in Taos during the snow. We would love to come back and stay for another visit !"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Huckleberry was perfect in every way. All the details were perfect; comfortable beds with nice sheets, great kitchen perfect for cooking and an exceptionally great salt water hot tub. The location was amazing as well - it felt like you were in the middle of nowhere with the amazing views but town is just a few minutes away. The hosts were very responsive to questions and just lovely to work with. We really enjoyed our time and can’t wait to come back."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home + epic location and Melissa is a great host! Highly recommended for an off the beaten path Taos stay!!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Can’t say enough great things about this place. We came with my 2 kids and it was the perfect setup. We loved cooking in the fully equipped kitchen, soaking in the hot tub after some long days of skiing, and the toys they left for our kiddos to stay entertained with. The surroundings are picturesque. Highly recommend."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay. It was cozy and quiet. It was a great open space for our toddler. The tipi and sandpit were a big hit. The location provides great views of the high desert, mountains, hot air balloons landing and stars. Easy to access Taos and Arroyo Seco."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a special spot, we would be lucky to return! Made some magical memories here. We were looking for a peaceful getaway to reset our souls and this is a wonderful place to do just that. FYI there is construction of new builds on either side of the property, very close. The structures are up so it was super minimal noise! We were so comfortable here and could tell the home is lived in and loved. Super to the Rio Gorge Bridge and other cool hiking."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Neat space space in an excellent location. Only 10-12 minutes to Taos and just a few more minutes to 99 other cool spots around the area! You’ll be very comfort table here!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"So comfortable, well located, clean as a hotel but with all the comforts of a home. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets. Perfect place to stay when visiting the area."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a place with endless views that change by the hour, look no further. From sunrise to sunset you can unwind and disconnect from the busy hustle of the world. Mornings were spent soaking up the sun while watching our boys explore the sage and play while evenings were filled with a fire and great views. Furniture and beds were extremely cozy and comfy and the kitchen was usable to cook meals in..again all while catching amazing Mountain View’s! Most importantly communication with Melissa was quick and helpful when needed; not too little not too much..just right. It was a great place and would highly recommend."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a great place to unwind and re-group! Wonderfully furnished with comfortable beds and the radiant heat floors are super cozy.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best air bnbs I have ever stayed in. Great kitchen if you like to cook (I do), beautiful views, best saltwater hot tub ever. Excellent communication and lots of little touches to make your stay more comfortable !"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay is incredibly unique and special. The photos just do not do the home or the surrounding scenery justice. From the 360 degree views of the mountains to stargazing from the saltwater hot tub, the property has so many amenities to make your trip memorable. Melissa is a fantastic host. Responsive to any need we had during our stay, as well as offering tips and things to do in the wonderful city of Taos. Do not hesitate to book this home; you will not regret it!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is a great place to recharge and watch the sunrise and sunset. Melissa is great a communication and making sure you’re taking care of. I’d come back again and I’d recommend it to all my friends. You won’t be disappointed.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely incredible experience. House was clean, communication was clear and stargazing from the hot tub was surreal."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a magical home and location! We loved our stay. Every morning we would watch the sunrise over the mountains above Taos through the huge windows. Every evening we would watch the light change through the same windows. Melissa’s amazing home was quiet and so comfortable. We will be back!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place has every possible thing you could need. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.
Views views views"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best airbnb stay we have ever had. Every detail was covered, the place was beautiful and the landscape outstanding. We appreciated the way everything was laid out when we arrived, and the thoughtful communication with the host. If you have the opportunity, books this stay."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cool place. Melissa was great to work with along the way.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing. Everything you want from cleanliness to a very responsive and polite host. Add on the stunning home and views we couldn’t ask for a better experience. We plan on sharing this place with all of our friends and hope to come back some day.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing house and great location. Isolated enough for peace and quiet, yet close enough to all the Taos has to offer. I would highly recommend staying here."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved Melissa‘s place! It is incredibly kid friendly, has phenomenal views, and we sincerely felt like home and did not want to leave. Cannot speak highly enough of Melissa‘s home! If it’s available, book it!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa’s house is amazing. Every detail was meticulously planned. We loved the desert location. It was quiet and peaceful, yet close to all the activities we enjoyed.
We had all the comforts imaginable. A truly memorable spot. If you’re traveling in the Taos area, you will find nothing more perfect than Melissa’s home."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! We had everything we needed for our weekend in Taos. Easy drive to town, the ski valley, and other outdoor adventures.
We were able to relax and enjoy the stars. Definitely would book again!"

Would definitely come here again and refer to family and friends. Thanks for all your tips, very helpful!!!
Peggy & Tom- Ovilla, Tx"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great city escape, and a literal breath of fresh mountain air. Melissa’s communication was excellent, with very detailed information about different amenities in the house, area recommendations, etc. Star watching from the hot tub at night was as relaxing as it gets. The home is about 10-15 minutes from most activities in Taos, and about a 40 minute drive to Red River which is an amazing spot up in the mountains. You can hear coyotes at night, which I appreciated, and if you don’t appreciate them they have ear plugs for guest use. The only potential drawback is if you’re visiting on a very hot day the home doesn’t have AC, I missed this on the listing. It’s very well insulated, and it totally cools down at night as soon as the sun goes down. However, I don’t sleep well in a new place with windows open and no security system. It does have heated floors and I’m sure it’s nice & toasty in winter. Otherwise, it’s definitely a hike away from home and a great place to decompress and relax. Also, pet friendly which is an absolute must when I travel. ;)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed the experience of staying in an Earthship.
Pretty funky."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,loved the earthship beautiful location!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was stunning. The views are incredible, especially at night. The only thing I’d be mindful of is that it’s pet-friendly. Some of the throw blankets irritated me a bit (I’m allergic to cats) sometimes dander is hard to avoid. But would go back again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a very enjoyable and interesting stay over 4 days. The main bed is very comfortable and the kitchen well equipped. I was impressed by how warm the space stayed during the night. The views towards the mountains are impressive and be sure to walk around and see the other earthships nearby, a “ castle” and the Taos Pyramid!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"if you want the Taos Earthship experience but you still want to have a toilet, Wi-Fi, and electricity, this place is exactly what you want. It was cozy, well equipped, and clean. clean. The outdoor deck area is perfect for stargazing (weather permitting, unfortunately!!), and the town and all the restaurants are literally 15 minutes away. You can't beat that. Our host, Rex, was very communicative and that made us feel comfortable. Just a fantastic experience."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot speak highly enough of this airbnb. I stayed a few years back when I was roadtripping, and another vacation brought me back to Taos. Rex’s Earthship is beautiful, quiet, home-y and exactly as described. There were a few additions from my last trip, and looking forward to the next one. The only confusing thing is getting there, but as stated, if you follow instructions you can find the right Earthship easily. Rex also is super responsive and reachable. I can’t wait for my next trip already and will be back for a 3rd visit!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Incredible find! We loved the chance to stay in an earth home. It was a quick drive to town, but peaceful and quiet on nights we chose to stay at the home. The telescope was a thoughtful touch.
We were prepared for low shower pressure since this was an eco-friendly stay—not the case! The shower had two shower heads, both with great pressure, and a window to let in natural light for ambiance."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Earth Ship was perfect for our group on our ski trip to Taos. Quiet and clean and a great value. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a clean, comfortable place to enjoy northern New Mexico!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a rather special house. It has a very welcoming feel. Very comfortable. I was there in February and was concerned it might be cold. It was not. Because of the unique design of the house it was almost too warm.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"peace. quiet. stars. serene. all found in this amazing energy Earthship. stand on the deck at night, take a deep breath and look up...all stars...wow. and the sunrise is breath taking. surrounded 360° by mountains. you should stay here."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay at the Earthship was everything we could have hoped for. We have been researching Earthships for a few years and knew we wanted a true Earthship experience before deciding to build one of our own. The property is incredible. Mountain views all around and it is incredibly quiet. This location and Earthship is truly an experience like no other. Rex went an extra step to provide space heaters to help with any temperature issues due to us visiting in the winter. Once the sun rose in the morning we didn't need them the following evening at all. We look forward to our next stay at this Earthship!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for a great stay! Everything was perfect! We look forward to staying with you again!
Jason and Julie"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Earthship was an extremely comfortable and very quiet place of refuge on a chaotic road trip. Slept like a dream! It was nice and cozy and warm, there were many space heaters provided if needed, but we didn't even need them due to the sun coming in through the windows and gently heating up the home. It was really nice. We absolutely loved Taos, very walkable, tons of art. Great restaurants. Thank you for an amazing stay!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot to experience Taos and the earthship lifestyle!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at this earthship. Convenient location for visiting Taos and Ojo Caliente. Plenty of heating, great views, dog friendly."
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed the quiet that the earthen walls provide. Disappointed you can't really see out any of the windows because they are covered with shade tarps and sheets. Also disappointed the main kiva fireplace in the living room cannot be used.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A really neat place ! About a 30 minute ride to Ski Valley. I definitely would stay again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super cozy space among lots of Earthship history. Had a blast skiing Taos and going to Ojo Caliente hot springs near by. Rex was very responsive and accommodating!

2023-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"Earthship was exactly as we expected. We had difficulty locating the access road in the dark but G Maps was accurate and rerouted appropriately. I advise you follow the directions provided by Rex and look to check in before dusk.
Very comfortable and cozy home.

Nearby there is Pizanos a small pizza pub. The good was delicious and staff friendly."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great get away in a cozy quirky wonderful earth ship house.

The earth ship had everything we needed. We hope to retreat there again in the future!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful time at the Earthship! The home was warm and cozy and very peaceful. I so appreciate being able to take my dogs and they truly enjoyed themselves.

We went for a nature and quiet getaway. It was just that. The high desert, blue sky and rarified air fit the bill. For entertainment, Taos is only a few minutes away.
Enjoyable stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rex was pa great communicator and gave us detailed I strictions and a warm welcome. The place was comfortable and private. The deck out front was amazing for enjoying the sunset and the night sky was unbelievable.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Staying in an earthship was a very unique experience. This earthship appears to be an older construction. It was different from the earthship construction and features described at the Earthship Biostructure Visitor Center. Rex is a very attentive and friendly host. Having read all the previous reviews my expectations were higher than my experience.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had the best time staying at this earthship. The home is very cozy and has all the supplies one might need. Will definitely visit again. The bathroom is like a spa

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"staying at Rex's place made the multiple hour drive absolutely worth it. breathtaking as soon as you pull into the driveway, lovely landscaping, and the architecture unmatched. I recommend this bnb with all my heart !!!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our party included 3 adults. We stayed 4 nights. It was a great location for visiting Taos, Santa Fe, Ghost Ranch and Albuquerque. The beds were very comfortable and it is a very quiet location. We had everything we needed including a well equipped kitchen, washer-dryer, outdoor living space, and peaceful, private surroundings. Everything was in good working order and we were very happy with our stay. We do plan to return and recommend this unique place to our friends. Rex was very nice and he greeted us when we arrived. I highly recommend the earth ship!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was a unique place to stay. Rex was very friendly and explained what the earth ship was about. Nice to stay in an environmentally friendly structure. Place was large and had everything you needed. Rex was a great host and quick to respond to texts.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Two friends and I, all in our 80's, drove a long distance to experience an earthship. It was well worth the 12 hour drive! Rex was helpful and the property is unique, peaceful and beautiful. Views are fantastic. We were comfortable and felt completely safe in the area. We enjoyed the house so much. I will recommend it to my friends who are interested in an earthship vacation. Thank you, Rex!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about this Earthship. We didn’t know what to expect, it was are first time to the area. By the time we left we didn’t really want to leave.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I wanted to stay in an earthship and by golly I did! Very interesting. Rex was very responsive.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Rex’s Earthship sparked the creative inspiration that my partner and I were looking to explore so we could learn about sustainable living.
Rex curated an environment that allowed us to decompress and sink into the earth. We enjoyed speaking with him about astrology and music and really appreciated him sharing his home with us.
The Earthship is one of the original models, so it was beautiful to see how well it stands the test of time and how self-reliant the home itself is. The surrounding land is beautiful and overall this was an experience we’ve never had (and highly recommend)!
We’re grateful to Rex for the experience, and grateful to see how magnificent an Earthship really is in person."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an awesome place to stay. Rex was a fabulous host and his Earthship was gorgeous, comfortable, quiet and peaceful. The views in every direction were breathtaking. There was no problem hooking up to the internet and although I didn't watch TV, it was working fine. Bed was comfortable and the entire house was inviting with enjoyable local artwork and decor. Rex was very knowledgeable and informative about the construction of the Earthship, but only if you're interested and message him. If you do have any questions he answers right away. The house was very clean and neat. The kitchen has everything if planning to cook, including a gas stove. Great coffee and other supplies like salt, pepper and olive oil if needed. Speaking of which there is a gorgeous olive tree right out the door. Can't say enough good things about the place and the host."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Could only stay one night but well worth it. Minutes outside town centre, have to drive, but at night the stars were so clear.
A great experience staying in an earthship, loved every minute of it. The new deck outside was great for hanging out at night and enjoying the wildlife.
Would stay again. Cheers"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great week in this Earthship nest while hiking in the ski valley, Angel Fire, and Arroyo Seco. This was a great jumping off place for hikes as well as being convenient to Taos for groceries, shopping and dining. The home is also relatively close to the gorge bridge &Earthship visitor center. We had everything we needed in the unit. The location was perfect for a walk down the road. I saw several people walking with their dogs. Lots of rabbit activity and loved seeing & hearing Says Phoebes who are living in the Russian Olive while sitting on the deck out front. The home is pet friendly and I wish we had brought ours along. Another fun tidbit was watching the dog across the way keeping watch from on top of the Earthship nextdoor."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was easy to get to and was well stocked for basic necessities. I especially appreciated the washing machine and coffeemaker. Easy in and easy out! Would definitely stay again.

I just wish I had had more time. Thank you Rex for a remarkable place."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a special place! Breathtaking views and the night sky is unlike anything you've seen before, I was lucky enough to catch a lightening storm coming in over the mountains while I was staying and it was incredible. The earthship is gorgeous and I miss my sun filled mornings in the kitchen, drinking my coffee and looking out over the panoramic view. The beds were so comfortable and even going in the middle of July it stays cool and you can play with the windows to get the exact airflow you like. Its a short drive into Taos but you would never know! Its so quiet and secluded. Rex is an amazing host and is so kind and helpful. If you're looking for a one of a kind experience to restore your soul, this is the place!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Rex's place! I would like to go back in a different season, just to see what it's like. (Pretty with snow) We were there in the first week of July, and it was the perfect temp inside. Cool enough to sleep. Such a cool place. the plants on the inside had crickets which had a relaxing sound, but only during dusk (they didn't go all night.) Just like all the other reviews say, it was a really cool place. G00gle maps took us right to his doorstep. A plus! what a great experience. Thank you Rex!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a wonderful place to stay!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cool place to stay with incredible views of wheeler peak. Very peaceful. Would stay there again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very fun place to stay in Taos! Quiet and roomier than you'd think.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rex was a phenomenal host- if you feel the call to stay at the earthship, follow it!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Earthship was charming with jaw-dropping views. The location felt really private and part of the gorgeous surroundings, however, it’s actually super close to Taos. The best of both worlds!
Only stayed one night, since we were passing through on a roadtrip, but would 10/10 stay there if we visit Taos for a longer stay."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home was perfect for our needs. There are enough fans to be comfortable and we loved the warmth of the exposed mud walls. Directions could be better as the home is rather remote. Being remote, there is a lot of dirt around and lots of critters. This was not an issue for us and to be expected based on location. We enjoyed our stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful earthship. Loved watching the stars from bed. Cozy, had everything we needed and slept great! The jade garden is truly impressive"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful earthship, quiet & away from the small town. The earthship has great views of the starry night sky that you can fall asleep to. It's unfortunate that it's not priced ideally so that more people could experience it, however it was worth it for us."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quirky stay in Taos! A classic earth ship with the fundamentals that make it unique and interesting. Beautiful plants and mud walls! The place is a bit hard to find but Rex was helpful in finding our way.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect weekend getaway! The pictures don’t do it justice. It’s a great proximity to Taos downtown, yet the house itself felt very private and peaceful. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Do you want to stay in a modern earthship that's completely self-sustaining? This one is not so. It's one of the early model earthships, and a very nice place to stay. However, you do not get the full earthship experience here. It does not have water collection, storage and reuse. It does not have an indoor food forest. It does not have solar energy power. It does not have colored bottles embedded in the walls for beauty. I wish the description would have been clear about this...I would have chosen a different modern earthship and not felt so disappointed. However, it does have 2 lovely bedrooms, full kitchen, living room, dining area, bathroom, some indoor plants, and is built in to the earth, with wonderful interior rounded walls and beautiful big windows. It's close to Taos town, which we enjoyed. Very private and responsive host. But, you had to go to the Earthship Biotecture Visitors Center to really find out and experience what a modern self-sustaining earthship is like."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really loved my stay at Rex's Earthship. I loved the views and the space itself felt really good. It was nice to hear just birds and bugs at night. The furniture was comfortable and all the appliances worked well. I especially loved the way a cool breeze moved through the whole structure. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location! Loved the house and the Vibe! I’m
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Friendly host and beautiful home! Highly recommended for relaxation.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Unique property with beautiful sunrise/sunset/nighttime views. Great natural ambient temperature inside, my husky dog felt comfortable at all times. The owner, Rex, was very helpful and friendly. The only thing missing was some extra kitchen amenities (pots, pans, utensils)."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tranquility at the ready... amazing Earthship Experience!
Nestled within a one-acre lot and surrounded by sagebrush and chamisa, the place exudes serene beauty and romance, a mere 15 minutes from town. Inside, the adobe interiors in dark and gold straw, rustic Sycamore Oak beams, flagstone floors present an enchanting spectacle. The sustainable design not only showcases the principles of green living but also provides great comfort. With an impressive pyramid nearby, the Earthship offers an immersive, inspiring stay, the likes of which are seldom encountered.
A peaceful retreat at this haven was truly unforgettable. We used the time for some high level planning and reflection We'll be back! A great example of sustainable living, this Earthship experience is badass and we hope to someday find (or build) an earthship to live in!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful earthship. It was very comfortable and relaxing. Rex made everything easy.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed the Earthship! If you’ve never had an earthship experience, it is worth it.
Once you make it up the bumpy gravel road for the last mile (not a big deal), it is so peaceful and quiet. It’s a sweet little cozy environment and plenty of room for just 2 of us and our dog. We enjoyed our morning walks on the gravel roads admiring the mountain back drop and enjoying the interesting architecture all around. Although it is off the main roads and there is plenty of area to roam, if you have a big and fast dog like we do, I wouldn’t venture to let Fido off-leash if you don’t have voice control over your pet, even though you could let them off leash. There are rabbits and other little creatures, and other neighbor dogs that could be out and about and our dog would have ran up to or after other animals cuz he likes to play. So our advice is to do off-leash at your own risk. Otherwise, Rex was great and responsive as we had an issue arise that he was able to address same day!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The earthship is unique space in a equally unique place; there is a pyramid nearby. Lots of interesting furnishings. Amazing place to skywatch. Highly recommend for the adventurer.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rex’s earthship was lovely! The area is in a beautiful location and the stay was such a unique experience. The place was very cozy and it was such a nice and relaxing time. Rex was very friendly, responsive and accommodating. Would love to go back!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"A very peaceful & spiritual place. Waking up to snow at the end of April was unexpected, but it was gone by noon. Being dog friendly was a plus, my dog loved staying there( good smells outside)I certainly would stay at the earth ship when in Taos again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,so fun& lovely stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our experience at an Earthship. The evening was chilly but we were able to do some star gazing which was lovely. The beds were very comfy!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved the sycamore oak beams!
Unique experience. Do it."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I wish we had more time to enjoy the space. It was quiet and cozy for sleeping, with an amazing view of the stars."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This earth ship is amazing and one of a kind. This is airy, open layout, full of natural light. Early morning outside temp was 23F, however inside was still around 65F without any hear. This is amazing and warm place to stay at."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The earthship is amazing. Such a great place to stay. Very homely, comfy beds, wonderful stars. Such a treat staying in an earthship and experiencing living in the eco house which is a big deal around Taos. Highly recommend it."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Earthship is an amazing place! It is so warm and welcoming, and the place feels like a living museum. Made me want to live in a house like this!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a peaceful stay and little getaway
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rex’s beautiful earthship was a peaceful refuge, surrounded by dramatic, breathtaking scenery. The home itself is cozy, charming, and inspiring (because earthships are the best). The huge paneled windows, natural light, thriving succulents and other plants make it feel as though you’re always outside. Our favorite part was the bathroom, with two shower heads, and beautiful tile around the shower/bath and sink. We brought our dog who had a blast roaming around outside. A treat to stay here, and we will recommend this spot to friends!"
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Lots of room and so quiet. We were there on a cold day and it was wonderful to have space heaters and heating pads.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic experience and my first in an earthship! Convenient location an easy drive back to town. The place was as described and very niche but more importantly peaceful and Rex is a very cool gentleman who is a wonderful resource for the area and good for just thoughtful discussion. I will come back.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The earth ship was really beautiful. The location has an amazing view of the surrounding mountains.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is located a bit remotely from town but is secluded and scenery is beautiful. The home has good insulation and we were fine with heaters off for a day. We would definitely come back!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little place not far from Taos. It was lovely getting to stay in an earthship! We appreciated how hospitable it was for our pup - including dog bowls.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay and so did the dogs!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The earthship was fantastic. When we stayed the temperatures were between the teens and 30s the whole time, but inside it was always comfortable, even with just a small electric heater running. The location is extremely quiet a couple of miles down a dirt road and maybe 15 minutes drive from the center of Taos.
Getting the water a comfortable temperature for a shower is fiddly, but easy enough if you follow the instructions in the house. The kitchen is well appointed and everything works great."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rex was great and responsive as a host. The earthship was a wonderful and unique place to stay, truly felt out of this world. Rex was also helpful in assisting my friend when she forgot the key and locked herself out, and when she left her own home key behind and needed it sent. Appreciate all the help!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great experience in an earthship! Wonderful host.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautifully constructed home, had all the amenities, great scenery, would recommend."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very warm and cozy environment.
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely but chilly visit. I would note guests do not have access to the fireplaces. Also the wifi is limited to only parts of the house. Overall a great opportunity to stay in an earthship. Thank you to Rex for being a great host with quick responses.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My partner and I loved our stay at this earth ship. It was very peaceful and secluded. Also, it wasn’t very far from the town of Taos, which was a plus! We will definitely be back!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I’ve always wanted to stay in an Earthship, and Rex’s place did not disappoint! Beautiful views, plenty of space, and everything you need. Only 35-40 minutes from Taos Ski Valley."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rex’s earthship was a truly unique place to spend a few days. Very warm, comfortable and private. 15 minutes to restaurants, but definitely felt secluded and private. Great star gazing! Rex was very accommodating and made us feel welcome."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Earthship was very cozy, comfortable and very rustic. We enjoyed learning about sustainability in home design, as well as the homy vibe. The house was well provisioned with clean linens, blankets, towels, etc and very good internet/ wifi. Rex our host was super responsive and check-in & check-out couldn’t be easier."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Only thing we regretted was not staying an extra night. Place was magical and very private. Definitely would recommend if staying in Taos, you won’t regret it."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rex was such a lovely host. He met us as we checked in, charmed us with his knowledge of the stars and of earthships, and made us feel right at home. Sadly, we only got to stay a brief night, but we definitely felt the Earthship power! Very cool."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rex’s Earthship in Taos was a magical escape. When we arrived, Rex greeted us with enthusiasm then he gave us a tour and some fun facts about the space. The evenings were cozy within the Earthship, we had mostly homemade meals and enjoyed watching snowflakes land on the big picture-frame windows looking out toward the mountains and a wide-open sky. We spent time every day and night outside to look at the expansive mountain landscape around us, taking the telescope outside to the platform that Rex built and got to look up at the moon and even see Jupiter and its moons. The Earthship was a perfect warm and cozy home to curl up and read a book, work on art, and play cards. We hiked at the Rio Grande Gorge, an easy 20-minute drive west, and left our dogs in the Earthship to soak up the sunbeams warming the house. We were not ready to leave.
Thank you, Rex! The Earthship was a beautiful cabin escape in the desert!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a unique experience it was to stay in this beautiful earthship! We can’t wait to be back. Rex is a great host and the place is carefully filled with everything we’d need.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really unique spot in with beautiful stars and 360 degree views right outside the house. Loved the stay and the host was great. Will be back.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Got to live the dream of staying in an earthship... Rex was a geat host and was readily available to our needs. TV wasn't working and he purchased a new one the next day ...!!! If you want to stay in an earthship this is a great one !!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rex's earthship dwelling was really interesting and cool! We rested well in the comfy beds and enjoyed looking at other earthship houses in the area. My son & daughter in law loved the deep tile tub.
Rex was super responsive & an excellent host. Everything was clean & we enjoyed the unique experience."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at the earthship. It was easy to find and Rex was super friendly and responsive to any questions. Words can't describe the beauty of the property and surroundings. We really enjoyed our walks and stargazing at night was quite a spectacular experience. We are so happy to have stayed there and highly recommend it!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rex was a great host. There were many special touches at this fabulous spot. Highly recommended
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a special place to stay. Rex was so kind upon check-in and gave us the privacy desired during our stay. This place is magical and we can’t wait to come back.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful way to experience an Earthship while visiting Taos. Very cozy.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very fun and interesting get away! As a native New Mexican, I always wanted to spend the night in an earth ship. It was a unique experience."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A neat unique spot and Rex was really easy to coordinate with. The place had all I needed and quality items in the kitchen, bath and bedroom. Some favorite aspects: the double headed shower, the comfortable mattress and bedding, the kitchen table during the day, with the light coming in through the windows. It was kind of amazing that it snowed outside and the temperature stayed even and cozy inside, without the need to turn on a heater. Very cool design, these earthships. This was my first experience with one. The only drawbacks that seem to be due to the nature of earthships in general: I am a wee skittish of bugs, so I escorted some out, and would have liked a bit more curtain to pull over the large windows at night, but otherwise was delighted with the stay."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,So fun to stay in the earth ship. Beautiful home outside of Taos.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This earthship is amazing. It’s beautiful, cozy, sustainable, and just plain cool! It’s secluded on a dirt road. The sunset and stars are unbelievable. The design details in the house make you want to never leave.
Wifi is strong in the living room but spotty in the back bedroom.
Place stayed warm from the sun even though it was cold at night.
No complaints. 100% recommend"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rex was a magnificent host and we would definitely recommend the earthship. It’s cozy and charming and well-decorated. Rex was very easy to get a hold of, helpful and accommodating. Beds are comfy and the bathtub is spectacular. The best part of the stay, however, is the sunsets! Gorgeous view. Hope to be back soon."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Highly recommended to anyone looking for a really cool experience. Awesome home in a very secluded and quiet location. Got up early each morning to watch the sunrise and take photos of the starry skies.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rex was an excellent host, the place was exactly as described and was such a unique experience."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our time at Rex's home. We did need to review Rex's directions because GPS gets close but it was not accurate. We loved looking at the sky at night from our beds. The home is convenient to town and was comfortable.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Rex’s earthship is a really beautiful and unique place to stay. The views are incredible. This was my second time there and both experiences were wonderful.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our one night stay in the earthship. Beautiful views in every direction, a comfortable stay, a different kind of experience that is a highlight of our trip to New Mexico"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"such a beautiful space, Rex was a great host. would like to return!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, truly unique stay -- we loved our time in this earthship!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful natural setting with a starry night sky and very comfortable beds.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"A very unique and fabulous stay, with easy access to Taos. Rex was a great host and made check in a breeze. 360 degree views and we could see the Milky Way in the sky each night! Lots of local wildlife, too.
Even with below 40 degree temps at night, the Earthship stayed HOT. By the second night we figured out to keep all the windows open and fans on, even though outdoors was quite chilly. All part of the fascinating technology that is an Earthship, but if you think you may want to close some windows at night -- don't. Think of it as being more connected to nature, just keep the screens closed or you'll be inviting nature in :)"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location with views of the mountains just outside. Earthen brown adobe walls and Saltillo floors make it charming.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Rex was a fine host, great communication and hands off in a good way. The house got a little warm in the afternoons, but cooled down in the evening. Fun place and a fun stay."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay at the earthship may do again when we’re back in Taos.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful beautiful place to stay with great host Stars were beautiful and it was really nice to see how the Earthships feel. Good location for exploring area. Very comfortable for a group of 4.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot! Super cute.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a special place - never been anywhere quite like it and probably never will again! A great base to explore Taos - or just read books in one of the property's many cosy chairs.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, cute, earthen home styled after the famous ""Earthship"" as designed by Michael Reynolds. A wonderful get away- great for a couple, or a family!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy, beautiful and one of a kind! Rex provided all the amenities needed and was helpful and communicative.
Breathtaking views of the stars and night sky from every room!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rex's place was great and his instructions were super helpful in finding it! I will note this is an older-style earthship without the cooling tubes, so ventilating the place required us to open up all the windows and the front door. Additionally, the place is due for a deep clean just being in a dusty desert environment. Loved the experience of staying in an earthship though and Rex was a super-responsive host!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A unique and inspirational property. Fascinating inside, and surrounded by lovely mountain views."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our one night stay in Rex’s earth ship was delightful. He was easy to communicate with, directions were easy to follow and the views are spectacular! Such a unique stay and would love to visit again soon."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Rex is a great host and will bend over backwards to make you feel at home.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing time staying in Rex’s Earthship! The house exceeded expectations, with its two bedrooms, excellent furnishings, and a fully stocked kitchen. I initially had concerns about finding the place, but Rex’s instructions made it exceedingly simple. We’d stay again in a heartbeat!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a magical place to stay. There are certain quirks about being in an earthship (weird water pipe noises, full moon through the skylights in your face while sleeping) but if you are prepared for them, there is scarcely a more relaxing place to be."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our visit to the Earthship, which was very sunny, quiet, and comfortable. The restaurants mentioned in another review, Medley and Farmhouse Cafe, were both wonderful! As you approach the Earthship on Sugar Lane, look for a small street sign labeled Pyramid Way--that's the final bit of road to travel to your destination. We took a walk around the neighborhood, and found a number of other earthships, a pyramid (!!) and a castle. Quite a place!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Was a very unique, eccentric and beautiful place! Rex was friendly, cool and helpful. The huge windows, lush plants inside the Earthship, telescope, and vast views made it a memorable experience. My only concern was the dustiness and it was pretty warm in the middle of summer. Highly recommend if you want a hippie-esque, marvelous experience."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space and great stay!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"I enjoyed my stay at this private Earthship near Blueberry Hill (not to be confused with the Earthship Biotecture community beyond the Gorge bridge). It was very comfortable, other than a bit hot at night for sleeping despite the many fans. It had all of the amenities a kitchen could possibly have for cooking meals. Once you find the place it is an easy drive to town because Taos just really is not that big! But oh-so-beautiful!!!!"
2022-06-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,Unique stay
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My partner, my dog and I just stayed at Rex's place for the second time, and we absolutely plan to come back. It is the perfect weekend getaway from city life, a cozy and peaceful escape where you can enjoy the silence and serenity of the desert. Rex's house has the feel of being private and rural despite being in a neighborhood (the houses are spaced pretty far apart), and we loved sitting outside with our coffee in the morning and wine in the evening, enjoying the quiet, taking in the beautiful mountain views, and admiring at the stars at night (there is a telescope in the house!). Rex's place is stocked with all of the essentials, and you feel immediately at home. Our dog loved it here as well, but a quick note that there are some neighborhood dogs that paid us a visit and we weren't sure if they were friendly, so just be alert/aware if you bring your pup as well. If you are looking for an earthship experience, you won't be disappointed with this place. Local recommendations: try the Farmhouse Cafe for brunch and Medley for dinner (both in El Prado); we had some fantastic meals here! I also recommend taking a walk through the neighborhood around the house as there are some very cool structures."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A tad warm at night in June but it’s still incredibly comfy and cool.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful and quiet!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are on this area and can book the Earthship, you will not be disappointed."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very cool experience! Enjoy your time lounging in the desert and just enjoy the quiet, amazing star gazing, and a super rad home!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Unique and lovely place, spectacular sunset view and stars. Really enjoyed the experience."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rex's place is exactly as described! It has everything you need, in quiet location with amazing open views, while still being convenient to area attractions. i was impressed by the plants inside! I would definitely recommend!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The earthship was a great experience. Rex, our host, was always available. The place was very clean and had everything we needed. Outstanding views!!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved my stay at the earthship! Stayed for a short time during a New Mexico road trip. LOVED the location. Short drive to the main Taos plaza but remote enough that you could appreciate the desert splendor. Woke up early and could hear (and see) the wildlife. The washer/dryer was an especially welcome perk after our hikes. The place itself is well equipped and felt like I was being welcomed into someone’s home- cozy, comfortable, and inviting. Would definitely stay here again, for a longer time, to truly experience New Mexico life."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We only stayed a night, but it was a unique experience and gave the kids something I think they'll remember for years to come. Everyone should experience an Earthship at some point."
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"We only stayed for 1 night, but the house is pretty cool! I was kinda expecting to be able to see the stars from the inside, or lay under the large windows, but it isn't really set up like this. The stars are super visible to admire from the outside area, but the outside area wasn't quite as peaceful as I had expected. There are houses close by, including the owners (i assume) which is very close & it was a bit noisy (mainly neighbor dogs barking, couldn't hear them from the inside). Overall we had a great stay & Rex was responsive & it was great we were able to take our dogs with us for the stay. Maybe just a little on the expensive side for what the stay & area are."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great views & comfy interior.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed one night at Rex's earthen home. It is an older design Earthship, so does not have more fine-tuned temperature control. There are not cooling tubes, and the greenhouse is not separated by a second glass wall. That said, when I got there in the afternoon, it was warm, but not too bad. There are fans, but I didn't need them, because it cooled down well in the evening. Having the plants (huge succulents!!) in the house seemed to make a very pleasant atmosphere and aroma. I would gladly stay there again if the opportunity arose!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An incredible earthship experience for anyone. Even though I only stayed one night, definitely an adventure I will be telling friends and family for years to come."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay at Rex’s Earthship. Very comfortable and surprisingly stayed a comfortable temperature the entire time! Beautiful wood beams, and loved the whole vibe. Would definitely stay again. Thank you!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a lovely stay!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing Earthship, so peaceful and quiet and completely private! The views are amazing and the property itself is really well equipped but still retains that authentic Earthship experience. We loved our stay and would have loved to have stayed longer!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy, relaxing, and BEAUTIFUL. We had a lot on our schedule and I wish we would have had more time to sit and relax. But when we were there it was wonderful and easy. Thank you, Rex!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our time at Rex’s earthship was incredible. I felt like I was on another planet. Thankfully this other worldly place has great internet, is super comfortable and clean. Highly recommend making some mystical memories here."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great how and amazing place
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you are looking to the see the stars, be one with nature, chill out and align with the Taos vibe, this place is it! Rex is a fabulous host and you'll be so glad you booked a stay at his place!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super quiet, beautiful scenery. If you have not had the opportunity to stay in the Earthship community, this is perfect. The home was easy to find, Kirsten has excellent instructions and wonderful recommendations for things to do and places to eat. After a day of sight-seeing and hiking, I loved sitting outside and watching the sunset."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Kristen and Ron are great. Their home was super unique. The surrounding area is beautiful. It is easy to get to Taos and various hiking trails.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"magical place, we saw things we've never seen before and will be using bits and pieces of the house as a source of inspiration for our future home. we truly feel extremely privileged to have experienced Kirsten & husband's home and it's surroundings."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful! Great host and hope to get back ASAP!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cool place & area.
LOVED everything.
A special experience!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful opportunity to experience a self sustainable home!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Responsive host, super clean home, soft linens, great views."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay in the earthship! The light-filled home is a beautiful place to watch the weather on the mesa and learn a little about this cleverly designed off-grid housing model.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first time to stay in an earthship, and we were blown away! Such a wonderful experience. The house was clean and very comfortable. It felt very private, and the views of the sunrise and sunset each day were to die for. Kirsten was a fantastic host, and left easy to follow instructions for the off-grid systems. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a great weekend!! We ended up having to swap our dates because we got snowed in in Colorado but Kirsten was super communicative and understanding :) Definitely is a solid 20-25 minutes from downtown Taos, stars were beautiful and mountains were snowy. Bed was SO comfy. If you leave the sky light open in the bathroom it helps with the airflow :) the place had everything we needed! Keep in mind you can’t use blow dryers or curling irons if you’re planning to go to dinner or something. But the house felt very cozy and we even heard coyotes at night. The plants inside definitely bring in a few bugs but nothing too scary😂 very dog friendly, arrived to a full water bowl and some treats! Hard to navigate if we didn’t download the map on our iPhones before hand, no service without WiFi. But WiFi was great at the house! We both worked remotely for 2 days no issues :)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I saw the Earthship community this past summer and really wanted to stay in one. I'm so happy to have found Kirsten's. I was able to stay there with my dogs. Really incredible experience! I cannot get over how steady the climate inside stayed. The skies were cloudy and it snowed the two nights I was there. Temperatures at night were in the 20s and probably 40s during the day. The temperature inside was quite warmer than in my house. The Earthship felt so solid and cozy. The plumbing and electrical functioned like a normal house. Hopefully spring 2025 I will be building my own Earthship. Definitely recommend staying in one, and Kirsten was an outstanding host!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super lovely experience. Kirsten is a pro host for sure, and super responsive. Very cool and unique stay in the Earthship! So quiet and comfortable."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I dunno what to say--the pictures of this special home speak for themselves. STAY HERE if you have the opportunity to--it's a place you will never, ever forget. My partner and I went on a number of hikes in the area (30 minutes away or so) and loved the warm and down-to-earth folks of Taos. Wanted to move there."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Simply amazing. Perfect location for my ski trip and unlike any place I've ever stayed.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a magical two-day stay at the earthship, a one-of-a-kind experience. Walking in to see an indoor mini jungle was incredible, and we saw several coyote frens outside over the two days. It's dead silent in the area so sleep quality was great. Our host was very communicative and friendly, and instructions were super easy to follow. The earthship is only ~30 minutes from Taos which has easy groceries and restaurants, plus nearby attractions even if you aren't into hiking or skiing (such as seeing the Rio Grande bridge. The earthship is comfortable and cozy and even has bikes to ride, and a french press! Not unexpectedly, a passive home has certain operational requirements, for example it's not possible to use a hair dryer, and the stove was a bit difficult to use (even with instructions), so just go with the flow of being off the grid, as it's a wonderfully relaxing experience. Definitely recommend this spot."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, I really enjoyed the space. It wasn't actually in El Prado, so expect to drive a little bit further from the main road through Taos. I was a little bummed I couldn't use my hair dryer (it could really hurt the solar powered system), but that's on me. I ended up having to wash my hair at my father-in-law's house.
But Kirsten was wonderful. The surroundings are beautiful. It's quiet and you can see ALL the stars at night. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone interested in experiencing an earthship. Thank you Kirsten!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Kirsten was friendly and very helpful. It was super cool to observe firsthand how the plants and systems were cultivated from what otherwise would be wasted.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Loved staying in Kirsten’s Earthship. Cozy and convenient. Would definitely stay again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cool house and very great surrounding views. Highly recommend!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was such a dream come true to stay at Kirsten’s earthship. I loved the brilliant design of the structure and interior, the spaciousness, wonderful natural and interior light and spectacular scenery with the huge windows, superb kitchen, beautiful plants, “glass brick” wall design, cozy bed. I also loved learning about the earthships systems by getting to stay in one for a few days. Even in freezing temperatures, the place was warm thanks to its passive heating and cooling. There was even an option to compost too! I really appreciate the opportunity to experience the place that Kirsten designed and built. Thank Kirsten and Ron for hosting us!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our first time staying in an Earthship and it was a great stay. Communication and instructions were clear. They made it easy to understand the home and how to operate the various features of an Earthship. One thing to note is that there is no microwave or traditional coffee maker. Location is outside of town which adds to the experience. Kitchen had more than everything one needs to cook meals.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"House was super private and unique. Host was very responsive and friendly even treated us to an Apple movie for Christmas. And yes, we watched the Grinch for 3.99$. Great place to take your dogs and get away in the mountains. The ski resort is only 30 minutes away and Taos is a lovely town! 10/10 would stay again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing experience!! Absolutely loved the area and the house and land is beautiful. Perfect place to stay! Thank you so much:)
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,amazing!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying at the earthship. Super unique and comfortable. Great place to get away and have some peace and quiet. We loved that we could bring our pups
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time here. Staying in this earthship was a special and inspiring experience. The views from the place are incredible and the large windows allowed us to enjoy the scenery, sunrises, and stargazing while comfortable inside. The temperature inside was very comfortable, even when the overnight temps dropped down to the 20s or 30s outside. The location is convenient to Taos, very close to the gorge and lots of other fun places in the area. Highly recommended!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was a joy to stay at. Kristen was an excellent host. Instructions were clear and timely and the communication was prompt. The place was as described and as expected. This was a great AirBnB experience and I would definitely recommend to family and/or friends
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome experience! Definitely recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience in an Earthship. Well appointed, lovely extras such as creamers in refrigerator. Very helpful information about day to day living in an Earthship.
Be aware that GPS may be wonky as you get in the community."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kirsten’s Earthship is absolutely gorgeous and beautifully built and designed. The surroundings are breathtakingly beautiful and peaceful. I had a wonderful experience staying there and enjoyed every element of it. Kirsten is very friendly, responsive, proactive with useful information, and there even is a great binder with information and recommendations. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants to try something different in a very peaceful and beautiful setting."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really cool experience
Recommend to all
Check out visitors center"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is a beautiful place with amazing views. Both of us had to work during the week and had no issues with the Wi-Fi. The kitchen has all the cooking supplies needed. There are great views from every room and the place is so peaceful. One downside is that it is 25-30 minutes out of town which asked it hard to get to any of the shops before they all close. Overall it was a great stay and I’d stay again in a heart beat. Kirsten is an amazing host who goes out of her way to make your stay phenomenal.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is magical , the panoramic views, the silence , this house is beautiful and very special
It's very cute and clean
You feel embraced by the land
We loved it"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First stay in an Earthship and our expectations were beyond exceeded! Considerate touches throughout the home for convenience, incredible views both day and night... plus restful sleep in the tucked-away bedroom. Look forward to another visit down the road."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a very enjoyable stay in Kirsten's earthship. Very peaceful and quiet, just what I was looking for! I had both hot and cool, wet weather during my stay and it was fun being in the earthship for this. It can get a tad warm when the temp is 90+ but Kirsten has fans that can be utilized and I was never uncomfortable. Loved that it was dog friendly and my dog, Cosmo, thoroughly enjoyed napping on the cool concrete floors and sniffing all the plants."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You have to experience this beautiful space to believe it. The clean lines, combined with adobe aesthetics work in harmony and complement the desert surroundings. This cannot be overstated.
Our experience was contemplative, awe inspiring and thought provoking.
The ship itself with the 180 degree view of the high desert and mountain ranges is the stuff of landscape paintings. From the kitchen table we could watch jack rabbits, quails, coyotes, double-rainbows and the occasional sagebrush tumble weed roll by.
Even the thunder storms that rolled through seemed like something out of cinema.
The instructions on operating all necessary vents and units were clear and easy to follow. The kitchen with its modern style complemented the adobe aesthetic of the structure.
I can’t say enough about the coolness factor. There are banana trees growing inside the house!
On the practical side we were always comfortable and Taos was a very easy and short drive to galleries
and restaurants."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I had a great stay in Kristen’s earthship! I’d definitely stay there again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying in Kristen's Earthship was a dream! We had 3 inspired and productive working days in the space with incredible views, comfortable surroundings, and fast Wi-Fi! Staying in this fully self-reliant home showed us what was possible in terms of sustainable living, but it also felt really comfortable, easy, and modern. Kristen was super responsive and helpful, making sure we were comfortable throughout our stay. This was one of our favorite AirBNB experiences! We would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an inspiring space to work, a peaceful place to disconnect, or a home base to explore Taos."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time we stayed here and we love it. Even very unusually hot weather it was comfortable. The setting is so beautiful and peaceful.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice to be outside of town. Easy bike ride to gorge viewpoint and through Earthship neighborhood.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was amazing! We did not want to leave!
Even though it was only 15 minutes from town, it felt like we had left the planet and sailed away to another world far far away. Maybe that is why they are called Earthships?
We loved the storms that passed through, and cooking on while looking out over the mountains was so enjoyable.
Everything worked perfectly, the Apple TV, the Wi-Fi, the Bluetooth speaker, the stove. Everything was easy to use and in great condition.
The outside furniture was very clean and comfortable. We loved having dinners at sunset looking at the birds and the majestic view of the mountains.
We road our bikes through the community and made memories that we will never forget.
We were so lucky to get to stay in Kirsten’s home!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wow, that was the most memorable AirBnB experience of our lives! We feel so lucky to have been able to stay in such a unique house, and we're honestly thinking about building our own earthship because it had such an impact on us. Kirsten and her partner did an amazing job refurbishing this place and decorating it really tastefully. It's SOOOO quiet in the house and outside the house, it was so cool being able to see the stars and lightning from the skylight in the bedroom, and the feel of the house is just so cozy. Other than the lovely vibe of the house, it was clean, had everything we needed, and we couldn't have asked for a better stay. Kirsten was proactive with instructions about everything. The place is only about 15 minutes from Taos, so we were able to do all the town things and then escape to this little place when we were done. Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kristen’s place was amazing! We had such a great experience staying here. Everything was as described, and it is such a beautiful home. The views were absolutely breathtaking! It was such a great way to get away. We stayed during a heat warning in the area but had no issues with the inside staying cooler. Kristen was very responsive, helpful, and accommodating; a fantastic host! We can’t wait to come back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beyond relaxing with a gorgeous 360° views. We will recommend this place and surely come back.
Note to everyone: this is middle of nowhere, in a way. There are wild animals and critters. Enjoy every single creature or insect you see! House was safe and beautiful, though!! Great stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved it ! It did get a little warm and stuffy - but the temps outside were in the 90's. So, even without A/C, it was pretty comfortable.
The birds outside love to congregate on the metal table and chairs which make them too dirty to use. But, hey it's nature! We just moved the lightweight chairs to that area to sit. Just don't blame the host for the bird's mess!
And the bikes were a great touch, fun to pedal around the community.
Overall, it was a great experience. The scenery was so quiet, beautiful and peaceful. So relaxing after a hectic 2 day drive."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Even better than expected.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful area outside Taos, peaceful and you can see the sunset and stars at night. A perfect way to spend a low key vacation! We loved staying at the earthship, which was a new experience for us. Everything was as described and the view was breathtaking. The instructions on operating everything was clear. We’d definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay in Kirsten’s earth ship. It made our stay in Taos feel so magical and the home itself was beautiful and warm. Everything was easy to manage and it wasn’t too far from anything with the added bonus of passing over the Rio Grande every time we went into town!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was a pleasure to have a chance to stay in an earth home. We enjoyed the feeling and location of this abode. The night is fantastic!
We had a situation and it was handled immediately. Thank you so much for our visit."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely incredible. I stayed in Kirsten's Earthship with my dog Luna and it was exactly what we were looking for. Private, beautiful surroundings, only a 25 minute drive into town and only 30 minutes from Ojo Caliente. It was exceptionally clean and nicely decorated. Staying in an earthship itself was quite the experience and really makes me rethink how I live my life!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the Earthship, we want one of our own now! What a beautiful place to live! We felt very lucky to have gotten to spend our weekend in this beautiful home in a perfect location."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was amazing! The place is beautiful and such an amazing opportunity. Kirsten and her husband were very helpful and responsive when we had issues. The beauty was astounding and we felt so lucky to be able to stay right in the earthship community!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and location! Such a cool house and overall experience. Everything was clean and had everything we needed.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Kirsten’s earthship was one of the coolest places we have ever stayed at. We honestly didn’t want to leave to explore Taos just because we wanted to hang out at the house. The view over the mesa and of the mountains is absolutely unreal. It’s about 20 minutes from Taos Plaza and just 5 minutes from the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge. Kirsten was very communicative and provided some great snacks both for us and our pup! We absolutely loved our stay in this unique and sustainable home.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time taking myself on an artist’s retreats and this property was exactly what I needed. Peaceful and the surroundings were stunning. Easily one of the best airbnb experiences i’ve had.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was an interesting experience staying in an Earthship home!! What a lovely stay we had. The other homes in the area were beautiful and the location in Taos was breathtaking. We saw some hot air balloons, while enjoying a hot cup of chai. This place was cozy, and the instructions were very clear. We brought our dog, and he had a fun time too! I would say make sure you bring wipes for your dog, because it’s very dusty outside. I would stay here again! We really enjoyed ourselves :)"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kirsten’s Airbnb earth ship was a beautiful and wonderful experience to behold! There’s simply not much like it and would recommend visiting the Earthship visitor’s center nearby to learn and appreciate their beauty!
Kirsten’s instructions for everything between check in and check out were thorough, clear, and easy to follow and was much appreciated!
The place is very well kept and we had live nothing but praise! Thanks again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a fun and unique stay! Would definitely recommend!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying here was such a great experience - and a wonderful surprise for my husband who has been interested in earthships since the 70's. It's a beautiful place to clear the head - lots of space and light. A unique experience with everything one could possibly need. Loved it!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,what a great place!!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 2nd stay at one of Kirsten’s homes because it never disappoints. It’s the most beautiful, peaceful and amazing experience to stay in an EarthShip and Kirsten is a phenomenal host. Everything was immaculate with special personal touches and communication with Kirsten was always prompt and helpful. It was a another wonderful experience and we will be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying in Kirsten’s Earthship was the highlight of our trip! We were in Taos for our honeymoon and it was the perfect getaway after a very busy week. Waking up to the mountains and going to sleep with millions of stars was incredible. The space was spotless walking in and she even had little extra amenities like coffee and cream. Kirsten was extremely helpful when we messaged her. 10/10 recommend staying in this Earthship!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at Kirsten’s place. The home is gorgeous and unique. I enjoyed opening the blinds in the morning and drinking my coffee with a view! Never had to turn on the heater as the home does retain heat well. It’s in a great location to downtown taos and the ski valley. Would definitely recommend!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place. Perfect getaway.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I think this was maybe my favorite Airbnb that I’ve ever stayed in! The earthship is very well equipped and has everything you need. We were even able to work from there and take video calls. Would definitely come back!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I cannot say enough good things about this place and our time there!!! It looked exactly like the pictures- waking up with that view of the plants and the landscape outside was one of my favorite parts. We enjoyed the home and going into town/ Taos. Our time there was very relaxing and we had everything we needed. We reached out to the host who was very responsive and quick to help! We were so sad to have overcast evenings and no sight of stars- so we hope to return again to get the full experience! This place was one of our favorite airbnb stays of all time!!! I wouldn't hesitate to book it.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect peaceful getaway for my fiancé and I. Being a fully self sustaining home was amazing to experience. Our dog loved it as well. She had all the kitchen necessities and more. She responded to every question we had. Would 100% recommend this place to anyone.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space with beautiful views, rare opportunity to stay in an off-grid earth ship!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was both mine and my wife's first stay in an earth-ship home and was an incredible experience. The area was very peaceful and serene with friendly neighbors whom I rarely encountered. From the booking process to checkout everything went totally smooth. Will absolutely book with Kirsten again if I ever find myself in Taos again for the winter.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very unique stay in an earthship. It was very cold and cloudy wintery weather when we were there so we did have to turn on the propane heaters for a couple of hours, but otherwise the passive heating made it a cozy place to watch the snow over the mountains. Incredible views."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay. As some reviewers have mentioned there is no heat, but ample propane heaters provided for our February stay. This really is a wild place to stay, with coyotes, jack rabbits, and lots of small burrowing mammals. You may want ear plugs as the vent above the bed can be a little noisy if windy - but we only experienced this one night of our stay for an hour or two while a storm was blowing over. Easy drive to Ojo Caliente and everything in Taos."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a unique and fun place to stay! My husband and I skied and we enjoyed the retreat away from the rest of the world!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kirsten was a wonderful host! Very responsive, with a very thorough binder with all of the information needed for our stay. The home was a beautiful, relaxing, peaceful space. It was a unique experience that we would recommend to anyone!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kirsten is incredible. This Earthship was built by her in stages, over years, and she lived in it before deciding to share it with the world! The TLC is clear. I had toured an Earthship but never stayed in one, and the aura, the lighting, the *smell* from the plants, the room temperature even in winter, all surpassed expectations, even for this New Mexican! I went up for a birthday weekend, and Kirtsen was so generous as to leave little welcome gifts for me and my dog 💖💖. Not only that, but this is the PERFECT retreat after skiing (which we did) and a day at Ojo Caliente (which we did). Let Taos and the mesa seep into your soul ✌"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jaw dropping the entire time. From the amazing views to the innovative features of this home, our stay was 10/10. Couldn’t recommend more to someone looking to get away and experience this unique community"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kirsten's Earthship was a beautiful, unique place to stay. Definitely a place for solitude and relaxation but a close drive into town. The views were absolutely stunning."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"I recently stayed at Kirsten's earth ship and it was an incredible experience. The mornings were particularly warm and inviting due to the solar power that heats the space. The greywater recycling system was also a nice touch and added to the overall eco-friendly vibe of the property. The gas stove was a great way to cook meals and the space's overall design was modern, sleek, and comfortable. The location was also perfect, it was a quiet area but still close to Taos which was great for exploring. I highly recommend staying at Kirsten's earth ship, it's a unique and eco-friendly way to experience the Taos area."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kirsten’s Earthship is so very special. Don’t hesitate on booking this gem. We had an amazing stay at this home, it is such a magical place. Kirsten was a wonderful host, very attentive and responsive, you won’t want for anything staying here."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay at Kirsten's Earthship! Very unique stay in an absolutely beautiful, quiet, and private location. Instructions in the house manual are great and clearly explain how to operate everything. We stayed over the New Year's weekend and it was a lovely way to spend the holiday weekend. (The only thing to note if you're staying in winter is that it can get very cold in the desert. The heaters in the Earthship are propane heaters, which work great for short stints of warming the house, but they cannot be left on at night or for long periods. So pack warm clothes and pj's if you're visiting in winter.) Definitely recommend Kirsten's Earthship if you want a super unique stay with unbeatable views!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wow! What an incredible place in Taos! Kirsten was a great host, responsible, helpful, and provided us with wonderful recommendations well in advance of our stay. She also provided super clear travel instructions, which helped us as we were driving from out of state.
The earthship itself is out of this world, no pun intended! My husband and I have never stayed at a more unique, and magical place. The stars at night were incredible. The place was clean and had everything we needed. I was shocked at how warm the earthship would stay in the winter. Opening the blinds in the morning and in 30 minutes you’d want to take off your sweater! Crazy!
The earthship is also pretty centrally located so you can get into Taos, Arroyo Seco, the ski valley, and much more in about 20minutes. Worked great for our day to day plans.
Overall, if you’re looking for a peaceful, sustainable, and magical stay for your visit to Taos, I highly recommend booking with Kirsten. It will make your trip!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Surprisingly cozy for the temps outside, 9 degrees at night. As soon as you open the blinds in the am it heats up quick.
Kristen's added touch of coffee half and half and almond milk in the fridge made it extra special. Thank you! Great experience of Earthship living, just what I was looking for.
Kitchen is well equipped and fun to use. Really a very pleasant homely feel, highly recommend it.
Gabriele"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This modern earthship on the Taos Mesa is a delight. Get ready for quietude, beauty, and a true learning experience. Kirsten is an incredible hostess and Ron, her other half, is wonderful. Just go ahead and book you will not regret it."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,There are very few places as beautiful as Kirsten's Earthship. I will come back as often as I can !
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We've stayed in dozens of airbnbs, but this is the most amazing one we've ever been too. The views in and outside the apartment are beautiful, day and night. It's really weird experience because the windows are so tall you feel like you're indoors and outdoors. There is also lots of good hiking in short driving distance. We especially liked the trails around the vista Verda parking area, down in the Rio Grande Canyon. It got down into the low teens (Fahrenheit) several nights of our stay, but was still comfortable inside."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You should definitely visit this spot. hit a couple hikes and then come back to the cozy earth ship and cook a delicious dinner.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Earthship! It was quiet, peaceful, and well equipped. We especially appreciated the coffee provided by the host. We would absolutely stay again - the views simply cannot be beat!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed in a lot of Airbnb's at this point and this was hands down one of the best. The house itself was warm and inviting and had everything we needed. The instructions on usage were clear and we had no issues with the functionality or arrival. The landscape was stunning and overall it was an absolutely peaceful escape. Would highly recommend and hope to stay again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a unique experience while in the Taos area, this is it! My wife and I loved our stay here and there’s no shortage of views. Even though this property is off the grid it didn’t feel that way. All the comforts are still there. Highly recommend this place!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, unique house, great place to chill , take pictures , enjoy the sky."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve always wanted to stay in an earthship and this was a perfect place. Very impressed by how warm it remained indoors even when it was snowing outside. Love the large windows, we watched the stars from inside every night. Beautiful scenery."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Okay you MUST stay here, period. This home is amazing - sunlight through the front windows makes you feel like you are outside. Inside decor - I fell in love right away, so well decorated. The bed is SOOOO COMFORTABLE, I slept like a baby. The coffee that is provided is such a nice touch. I used the bike to ride around and take pictures of neighboring Earthships, so cool! I honestly loved everything about this house, I felt like the house was alive, never stayed in anything like this. Highly highly recommend this experience!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A fantastic stay and unique experience! Scenery and stars were amazing. Short 20 minute drive to Taos and even closer to Rio Grande Gorge.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kirsten's place is just as incredible as it looks! Surrounded by beautiful scenery and very comfortable, I highly recommend as a launching pad for exploring Taos and the surrounding area."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I strongly recommend arriving during daylight. We did get lost a little bit. the earthship was absolutely amazing. This vacation was exactly what we needed. We spent hours just staring at the scenery and the night sky. I was concerned with the fact there was no AC or heater. I get bad hot flashes at night and like to sleep in a cold room but once I started playing with the sky lights and vents I slept great! The weather was perfect. Scenery breathtaking. Has everything you need. I had to take a few minutes to say goodbye. We would definitely be coming back. Thank you so much!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kirsten’s place was all that we hoped it would be! In addition to being a clean, quiet, safe, place to stay, it provided a lesson in off the grid, sustainable living! We really enjoyed learning about Earthships and getting to stay in one ourselves.
Her place is a short drive from Taos and all that it has to offer, and it also has a full kitchen if you want to stay/cook in. Kristen provides thorough instructions and explanations for anything unique to the Earthship. And the views are spectacular! I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We’ve been to Taos many times but this was by far the most unique experience! Beautiful home, setting & good vibes. The perfect accommodations 🏔"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had the best time here! This is such a beautiful location and waking up to the sunrise through those windows is a treat! Kirsten is a phenomenal host - leaving us flowers and chocolates because this stay was part of our honeymoon roadtrip. Kirsten also left us fantastic recommendations for local food and hiking. We would absolutely stay here again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning. Clean, beautiful, unique and quiet. We had a wonderful stay and Kirsten is such a thoughtful host. We’ll definitely return!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW. A truly remarkable experience! All of the comforts of home, while still allowing the chance to experience life off the grid. It's easy to maintain the facilities, the bed was super comfortable, and we cooked for several meals with no issues. The views are gorgeous in all directions! We had a great time and I know we'll be talking about this trip to anyone who'll listen. Do not hesitate to book this home!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When in Rome... or, rather, Taos/El Prado. It's all about the Earthship. Kristen's Earthship is surrounded by all kinds of other Earthships, and it all makes for a unique aesthetic and feel to a stay in the Taos area. Also, the Earthship museum is a 15-minute bike ride (bikes provided by Susan) away from Susan's place -- worth going if you're interested in learning about what all goes into the makings of the place you're staying in. You're about 20 minutes from downtown Taos, but it is worth it if you're looking for quiet, privacy, and a one-of-a-kind stay in New Mexico. Being off-grid is just kind of cool, too, let's face it. Susan's Earthship, which we started referring to as the ""Mothership"" is plenty big, clean, and it's hard to beat waking up in the morning and looking out over big, tropical green foliage (that's inside), at the wall of windows that reveal the New Mexico landscape and mountains in the distance. It was fun coming home to the Mothership every night, and we'd do it again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was just the relaxing, comfortable get away that we needed. We stayed for a full week and it left me wanting an earth ship of my own. Kirsten was easy to get in contact with and provided lots of personal touches. Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the first time we’ve ever stayed in an earth ship and I have a feeling it won’t be the last! The structure was so cool. We loved riding the bikes PROVIDED to get a look at a lot of the other earth ships. It was a trip to see. Kirsten was a great host; very responsive and helpful! She even left a bowl of dog treats and a large bowl of water out for our dogs upon arrival. The space is extremely dog-friendly! Instructions were simple and clear. Even though there isn’t AC, the structure stayed comfortable, especially at night and early mornings. Will recommend this earth ship to all my friends! What a fabulous and unique place to stay."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW. Grab a camera before you book your stay here. The views at Sunrise are breathtaking. If you're worried about being here during the rainy season, don't fret too much--the panoramic scene with the rain coming in over the mountains will change your mind, plus this home has everything you'd need to stay comfy inside! You're about a 7minute drive to the Rio Grande Bridge(there are souvenir vendors in the parking lot), and about 20min to Taos. The brewery wasn't open from repairs yet, but if you're here in late September, you should be able to stop in for great drinks and scenescapes. You can see EVERY star at night, and you can hear the coyotes too! Great amenities, great location, great views. what else can you ask for?"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing visas, unique experience, inspiring place! Hope to return again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"one of the most unique homes I've ever stayed in! it's a great example of how sustainable living can be super comfortable. I barely noticed the fact that the house is off grid. I would recommend this place for a first time stay at an earthship, it was my first time and I loved it"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazing and special place to stay. We loved looking out on the gorgeous view and how quiet it was. The house is well stocked and the experience of staying in an Earthship was really interesting.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s in a gorgeous setting, and we enjoyed very much watching the sunrise, sunset and rain. Simple amenities but functional and comfortable. Will highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kristen is a phenomenal host. The instructions and communication leading up to our stay were detail oriented and helpful. She made it clear that she was available if we needed her however wasn’t overbearing in any way. There were so many great little touches around the Airbnb to make our stay more comfortable and she even left out some dog treats for Jelly, our dog.
The Airbnb is one of a kind. Do yourself a favor and book it for a unique but comfortable experience in an incredible location. The Taos Earthship was spotless and tidy when we arrived and navigating the off-grid system was a breeze. Also - there is so much great food and art in Taos as well as hiking around the area - and Kristen has a great little binder full of all of this information for you in the Airbnb.
I would recommend this place to anyone."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous location & abode! Highly recommend staying here— about 15-20 minutes to Taos, but entirely worth it to cross the Rio Grande Bridge everyday!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"There isn't a whole lot that I can say that hasn't been said in previous reviews. Staying at Kirsten's Earthship was a fantastic experience and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. It was serene, beautiful, and the perfect place for a getaway. I also learned a lot about sustainable architecture by watching some Youtube videos about the house as well as Earthships in general. I would recommend doing the same as you will be amazed at what Kirsten done and what a really amazing thing it is to be able to stay in this labor of love. Easily my wife and I's favorite Airbnb experience!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place which should be on your list if you have even a passing interest in earthships. House has everything you need so you won’t be roughing it despite the eco friendly ethos.
Short drive into Taos across the impressive Rio Grande Gorge Bridge!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had the best time here! The earthship is so cool and the community/neighborhood is very peaceful. Kristen's home is so close to the Royal Gorge Bridge which made it convenient to enjoy an early morning hike before it got too crowded or hot. The town of Taos was also close so we were able to spend time checking out the Plaza, enjoying dinner, etc.
Kristen was super communicative and helpful! We originally thought we weren't going to arrive until late at night so she left the outside light on for us so that we'd be able to see the house. I definitely recommend arriving when there is still light as it's hard to see the signs at night. Kristen's directions were *super* helpful so if you do come at night, make sure to read them.
We had a great time and hope to visit again soon!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing experience! I was so sad when we had to pack up and leave. Very clean and has everything you need. Beautiful views!!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a unique and wonderful stay! Highly recommend this place for anyone who is interested in what it’s like to live off the grid. The building is incredible and a bonus - we had front row seats to jackrabbits playing outside the house!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful desert getaway! So fun to stay in an earthship.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The earthship community is truly magical to drive into. We immediately felt the wonder and creativity coming from the people who design and build these homes. Check in was very easy, you can park near either door. From the driveway, we parked on the right facing the back of the earthship. The bedroom is over there (for ease of bringing your suitcase in), but the door you'll be able to get in to is the one on the left. Either way, there are stairs. The indoor garden is beautiful, tons of succulents and geranium. Our favorite place in the house was the kitchen. We cooked every meal (stayed 4 nights) and cooking felt like we were at home, very easy. It's stocked with everything you need. We bought groceries at Cid's Food Market, an organic market about 20 minutes away. I recommend the Taos Honey Company raw amber honey if you go there.
This might be a one-off issue, but I may have been allergic to something around us at the earthship. It could have been the dryness, the juniper or maybe the smoke from the devastating fires happening in NM right now. It was my first time in NM and I'm from Georgia (US). It wasn't until my partner and I left the earthship did my allergies ease up (we stayed another 5 days in NM in Ojo Caliente and Albuquerque). We bought some allergy medicine and eye drops at Cid's on our way out of Taos. And though I think they worked, it was expensive and you might want to bring your own if you any of this resonates with you!
If you like living sustainably and are an artist or creative, I recommend staying for a self-organized retreat. It's ultra quiet and there's plenty of space to work."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great host!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful remote getaway with all the necessities and comforts you might need. We had no issues finding the place by following Kirsten’s directions. I would definitely try to arrive in daylight though (which we did). The temperature was very comfortable the whole time and the view of the mountains was breathtaking. Would highly recommend staying at this Earthship!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a wonderful experience. We loved waking up with our dogs to beautiful sunrises. Town was fun but we preferred the refuge of the house. It was a great spot to recharge!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy place in wonderful setting - Earthship and all the dwellings around .
Yes that New Mexico light was present and the ever changing sky .
Enjoyed our stay !!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here. The design and aesthetics of the space are excellent. Everything worked very well. Extremely comfortable and off the grid !
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A fun and unique place to stay. We enjoyed our vacation in Taos very much!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and experience being off the grid. The windows allow for a beautiful sunrise.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second time staying in the earth ship community and it was more amazing than the first time. The place is so beautiful and comfortable. Incredible views and prime location. Thanks so much for having us!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was exactly as promised, nice, clean and comfortable. A great experience!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This stunning earthship is the most beautiful place I’ve stayed on earth! It was way more beautiful in person and the landscape is utterly magnificent. I can’t wait to return!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Earthship is a beautiful place to reconnect with the land, oneself, and others. Peaceful, serene, and just what we needed!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely, unique experience staying in Kirsten's earthship! My husband and I worked remotely during our stay and had zero issues with connectivity to WiFi. The views were stunning & the house had everything we could possibly need. Kirsten went above and beyond with small touches such as snacks and fresh flowers. Highly recommend!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It's an incredible out of the box experience, that will be unlike anyplace you've ever stayed before. The simple touches make this place all that more special. I had a wonderful time, and would highly recommend it!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was a very unique experience . More of an adventure! We loved the earth ship and the nearby town. The house is extremely bright and very quiet. The stars at night are amazing. The host is very friendly and helpful. The nearby town , Taos has cute stores and coffee shops. We had a couple of good dinners at Orlando’s and Antonio’s. I personally liked Antonio’s relaxed atmosphere with very good food. Take out pizza at Taos outback was also very good. There are many hiking trails and the nearby gorge is very beautiful. We went in early spring, the days were mostly warm and sunny. The nights cool. The lack of humidity made even the cool early morning feel warm compared to home. The experience is very unique and worthwhile."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best AirBnB I’ve ever stayed in! The location is incredible, so scenic, and just remote enough to feel removed but also close enough to town if needed. The house itself is very comfortable and has all the things you might need. The host is also very kind, responds quickly, and helpful. Great place overall!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kirsten’s Earthship was magical! We were comfortable and warm our entire stay. We had zero issues with working any of the Earthship’s features.
Definitely follow Kirsten’s recommendation and eat at Orlando’s Mexican restaurant (be prepared to wait)… it is well worth the wait.
We will definitely be back!!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a dream. This place was breathtaking at every moment, from seeing the mass of stars at night to the panoramic view of the sunrise, shining over the entire mesa.
The bed was so comfy, couch was large enough for an average sized guest to sleep on, the kitchen and bathroom had all the amenities, fridge was a decent size, water was hot for the first night. The second night the hot water did go out, which the owner informed me is common if its very windy. It’s a very easy fix and she even mentioned she would add this to the directions so you can relight the pilot. The house was warm just from the solar and geothermal even during my visit during the winter. I even had to crack open the skylight/vents at some points.
Kirsten was an incredible, communicative, and generous host.
I could have stayed here for much much longer!
Thank you!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!!!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautifully serene location! House was very clean and well-appointed.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay!!! The views were amazing, the bed was so comfortable, and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook all of our meals! We were so cozy here!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely magnificent! A magical off-grid cozy getaway. Really appreciated the little touches. I was so grateful to experience such a work of art and love and respect for the planet.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"100000% perfect. The view brings full wow factor, as well as the experience of staying in The Greater World Community as a whole. Expect that by the end of it you'll end up like my partner and I, plotting your own earthship reality in the nearest as possible future.
Such a sweet stay. Clean and all the amenities you need- we were even surprised with a cheesecake in the fridge for our anniversary 🥰
The only thing we felt was missing was a coat rack- for all our wet ski gear- but that was literally it.
We were cozy & warm on cold nights, even too warm at times during the day, as that structure traps in heat super efficiently.
thank you! would definitely recommend to all."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay! It was easier to understand how to live in an earthship and make it all work than I thought. It’s all very well set up, easy to use and a beautify place to stay. The internet worked great for getting some work done, as well. We’ll be back!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a very nice and relaxing time at Kristen’s earthship. She had everything I needed and the views were incredible!!!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,INCREDIBLE!!! One of the coolest places I’ve ever stayed. It’s a beautiful home with the most amazing views of the mountains!! It’s an easy drive into town to the shops and restaurants. We loved staying further out from town and enjoyed the drive everyday!! Kirsten is a fantastic host and even accommodated our early arrival. We had everything we needed in her beautiful earthship home. Can not wait to stay again!!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Incredible stay! It was our first time staying in an Earthship so we did not really know what to expect, but we didn’t want to leave when it was time to check out. The view is so breathtaking and the earthship is well-equipped with everything you could need.
We found ourselves wanting to stay in rather than going out. The skylight above the bed is a nice touch too.
Kirsten was a great host! Very communicative and helpful. We would love to stay at her earthship again. 🌎"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely as advertised - beautiful, unique and spotless! We loved every minute of it. The host Kirsten was extremely kind and very communicative every step of the way. She also added some really nice ""personal"" touches like a little New Year celebration kit for our stay - it's thoughtful acts like that that make AirBNB and these types of hosts so special! This is by far one of the best AirBNBs I have ever stayed at. Highly, highly recommend!!"
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Modern Mesa was a fun, unique, beautiful stay just 15 min outside downtown Taos and 35-40 min from Taos Ski Valley. The only reason we have to give 4 instead of 5 stars, is because we travelled during a high wind storm - which caused a loud rattling on the roof right above the sleeping area - that made it nearly impossible to sleep our first night.
The next night was the exact opposite - completely silent and peaceful. We loved the design, dog-friendly aspect, and the amenities. It stayed surprisingly warm and cozy in a winter snow/wind storm.
Kirsten was a wonderful host and communicated well."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kirsten's Earthship was such an amazing experience! We loved getting to explore the unique neighborhood; it's such an incredible community The house was clean, comfy, and peaceful. Waking up in the morning to the mountain view was surreal. Can't recommend enough!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely amazing… the pictures are 100% accurate. The indoor plants were beautiful, the views were breathtaking, and she (Kirsten) even had a small little cheesecake with a candle because I told her we were booking it for my gfs 30th birthday! The only thing to mention is that since it is an earth ship and off the grid, just make sure to be conscientious of water and power consumption… overall, an easy 5/5 stars from me, would definitely stay again. :)"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super unique stay! We loved the house and the views and everything!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay & accurate. Perfect place for a getaway or to stay while exploring the surrounding area
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying in this warm and cozy Earthship! It was easily accessible off the main road yet quite and secluded. Highly recommend.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t think twice, book this place and you will not regret it. The architecture, the quietness, and night sky was magnificent.
Kristen was extremely on top of everything and assisted me when I needed help immediately. Definitely plan to stay here again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We enjoyed our stay at this unique AirBnB. The location was perfectly situated; close to everything but far enough away to really get away from it all. We couldn’t get over the panoramic views this place offered. Kirsten provided all the comforts of home and left us clear instructions on the simple ways to run an earthship. We will consider staying here again or another one of Kirsten’s earthships!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and explore Taos, or even get some work done. Very clean and well maintained. Would recommend to friends!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this space so much I only left for groceries and even tried to extend my stay! It’s beautiful and so unique! As others said strong WiFi, informative instructions, sun filled and so unique! Beautiful, protected views, but silent inside. Super comfy bed, with the stars right above you! Everything you could need in the kitchen, 20 mins to Taos and a fun drive to Rio del Grande Monument."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Five out of five stars all around. The most amazing place that I’ve ever stayed. It was so beautiful and peaceful. It felt nice to get off the grid a bit and the locals were delighted that we were staying at an Earthship. Kirsten is a great host.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sunrises Sunsets Stars. Feeling incredible after our stay in Kirstens earthship. The experience of being in a energy independent home gives one the recharge a vacation should. Thoughtful and lovely. Quiet and efficient. Clean and very cool. Dog friendly a plus. Loved the bikes available for use. You will leave inspired to be a better earthling.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent and unique experience - beautifully maintained home with a great landscape to view sunsets..
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This earthship is very user friendly! We were impressed with how good the wifi connection was. One note, they don't have a microwave or blow dryer because both would mess up the earthship's electrical systems. It would have been good to know that in advance so I could have left my blow dryer at home!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All we can really say is bravo! This earthship was so comfortable and peaceful. We were so taken back by the views that we didn’t even turn the tv on once! Kirsten communicated everything very well and made it super easy for our first experience staying in an earthship. This place is a must and you will not regret it.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very unique experience- the interior is so well done and the views are unbeatable. Your closest neighbor is yards away and no city lights reveal the beauty of the stars.
The bed was very comfortable and we appreciated the personal touches and French press! We were very excited to explore what made this community special and it did not disappoint."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of my all time fav AirBnB experiences. Highly recommend
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hobbit meets New Age. As other reviewers have said, it was a unique and comfortable stay. The indoor garden was lovely. And the sunrises!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've always been curious about the earthships just outside of Taos, and getting to spend time in Kirsten's is like staying inside a work of art. It's spotless, completely private, perfectly appointed, beautifully situated (so much sky! unimaginably beautiful views!). It's the perfect place for a peaceful retreat, and I can't recommend it highly enough."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed this amazing location and home, which has been so carefully built and outfitted by the hosts. We arrived in an unusually early snow storm for Taos, and freaked a little about whether the home would be warm. Kristen immediately helped us know how to pull down the blinds, and to understand the theory behind heating and cooling the house. And, we were very warm and comfortable. The views are spectacular. Kristen left so many nice comforts of home too. All and all - we highly recommend staying here!."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Truly a unique stay the landscape is beautiful a great location to watch the sunrise and take in the stars at night.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing and totally unique spot! Earthships are incredible and this view could not be beat. Minor cons of this place: It is at least about 20 min from town. Skylight over bed makes it very bright in morning so not the place for sleeping in. No microwave/toaster and oven was hard to use. Apple TV spotty. Overall fantastic stay though, highly recommend!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kirsten’s Earth ship is a real standout - from the gentle curve of the windows to the gorgeous view to the amazing indoor garden. This is the one you want - and very accurate to the photos. Kirsten provided some snacks and everything we needed, as well as went above and beyond to answer questions and curiosities. If you’re considering this place, book it."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly a unique stay in a gorgeous setting! We enjoyed our stay very much, and Kirsten’s communication was awesome."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a unique space! We had a great time - just a 20 minute drive to Taos and so peaceful! Not knowing too much about Earthships, we were a little hesitant that house might require a 30 page instruction manual to operate - but there really wasn't anything complicated. It really was effortless! The instructions (which were few) were straightforward and easy to understand ! We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fun and different and an overall excellent experience. A great place for stargazing! If/when I ever stay there again I'll bring a telescope.
Pay attention to the suggestions in the house manual on how to best regulate the house temp.
Thanks Kirsten!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a fascinating place. It was very comfortable and well appointed. The sunset and full moon rising were magical. We learned a lot about environmentally sustainable building design from this experience. We would definitely return.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kirsten’s place is absolutely magical. We turned off (even though you don’t have to- there’s WiFi and television available) and enjoyed the solitude for a few days. The place is about twenty minutes outside of town, so it’s a perfect distance to visit Taos but still feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere. Her place was clean and easy to check in. We loved staying here!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the earthship. It was a unique experience. The landscape and outdoors was very spacious. Sitting outside for sunset was an enjoyable part of our day. The garden and plant life inside was magnificent. While we didn’t use them, there were two bikes there for exploring. Skylights we’re also very cool. Location was about 15 mins from el prado, but we didn’t mind the drive to restaurants and shops because it was worth it for the expansive views."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great stay! great host! thanks!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Two old somewhat hippies from Medina, Ohio. We have been in the Taos area numerous times and just love the town and the local culture. Wanted to be out on the high plateau and just experience the wind, mountains and sky! It did not disappoint. Almost full moon one night and a ring of rain storms the next. We loved it and highly recommend it!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spotless and really pretty inside. Comfy bed, good pillows, good water pressure. Overall, the communication was great, super easy to get in (just a lockbox code) and we really enjoyed our stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed my time at skybox. It’s a wonderful spot to connect intimately with nature. Super peaceful. As for the inside: the bed was comfy, the shower pressure was great."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is great! The place is every bit as stunning as the photos make you believe. What can’t be captured in photos is how quiet and peaceful it is. I would just stand hearing nothing but birds. No noise from the outside world. Just peace.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was able to some star photography and enjoy Taos at same time.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the skybox. A lot of amenities (dishwasher, washer, dryer) in addition to the views made this a grea stay."

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our stay! Great location with spectacular views. Communication was very helpful, clear and timely."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This space was wonderful! My favorite part was drinking coffee on the deck in the morning and just staring at the high desert.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Sean’s place. My husband said as we were leaving “I would stay here again”.
A little further from Taos Plaza than we had thought, but with GPS and Sean’s instructions we were able to find it without any problems."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous & peaceful spot. Enjoyed sitting out on the patio watching the mountains & stars. There is another skybox nearby so you'll see your neighbors but it doesn't detract from the serene environment.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Oh man, what a gorgeous place! If you`re looking for the most beautiful view with dark skies to see the stars, and have 100 mile visibility in all directions, this is your place. It was a 15 minute drive to town which we truly appreciated coming from a big city it was fabulously welcome to be there. The place is small but they`ve got cute design elements that made the house feel very comfortable. The bed was cumfy, the heating air-conditioning was easy to use and worked well. Would stay here if ever coming back to Taos. The nearby restaurants were awesome."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, and beautiful view highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,amazing view. quiet. near great restaurant “medley”
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is all about the views, which are stunning. Sunrise in the morning from bed or lounge, sunset at night from the corner of the deck or watching alpenglow creep down the mountains. It's about twenty minutes from Taos proper, and it's a beautiful drive out along the ridges and through the sagebrush. Starwatching is also excellent: there's little light pollution if you can catch it on a cloudless night. And the place is very comfortable: the bed is good (though the pillows a little hard), the furnishings comfortable (though the cowhide chair shedded all over us - ha!), the aesthetic contemporary in a SW way. Deck & deck chairs were awesome! Only downsides: the dishwasher was a little finicky, there were some oily pots and pans, and the surfaces weren't as clean as we'd like (we had nothing to sanitize surfaces with). The bedding and towels had a few stains but were clean. And the living room lighting was harsh--cold ""day"" light, so tough to wind down at night."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and great hosts!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sean’s place was the best of both worlds for chasing a winter storm at the ski valley. Easy access to town and a straightforward drive to the mountain, not to mention incredible views in the mornings and evenings. Washer / dryer and kitchen also make it a big step up from a typical hotel setting between ski days. Acoustic guitar on site was an added bonus!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stargazer is a quaint and cozy retreat where you feel away from it all but are in close proximity to shopping, provisions, restaurants and outdoor activities. The view alone is worth every penny."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Skybox was wonderful. We wanted to stay in a remote locale with the stars and sage brush as our landscape - as advertised!
The area does appear to be growing with more development.
The property is clean and well maintained.
Check in and check out were detailed with no fuss. We were very pleased with the Skybox in Taos."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Outdoor views were amazing and the location was not what I expected but very pleased.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sean's place was as magical and as nice as described. Perfectly rated property. Sean was very clear and helpful with instructions which created a fluid start to finish process. Everything was great, I would stay here in the future for longer if possible. Amazing view that is calming and a great place to unplug or stay plugged in with a view! Mini kitchen exceed expectations, water pressure strong and enough utensils and kitchenware for anything. Sean is a professional and this airbnb felt professional. I would recommend to anyone who who is thinking of staying just outside Taos with peace and quiet....and great views. Thanks Sean."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a lovely and relaxing time! The place, the surroundings, the weather, it was all too perfect! Comfy, cozy, classy, and efficient. Can’t wait to book again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sean’s place is amazing! The location is incredible, close to town, with 360 degree views! Even saw a hot air balloon come in for a landing! And the stars! Amazing! It was very nicely decorated and well appointed and comfortable for our two night stay. Would definitely recommend!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We celebrated our 4 year wedding anniversary here and had an amazing time! The space was beautiful and the views were absolutely stunning.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’ve been to Toas multiple times and I have to say this place is by far the best place we’ve stayed. Beautiful view it’s so private, perfect couples get away.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful space for a writing retreat and romantic getaway. The views of the sky are truly spectacular; we’ve already recommended Taos Skybox to friends!
Sean and Cambria are terrific and helpful hosts. They responded with quick and vital suggestions when we had car trouble and needed a mechanic.
Comfortable bedding / perfect water pressure and temp.
If you like quiet, privacy, the feeling of remoteness with Taos just 15 minutes away, and watching moody skies / miraculous mountains, you should consider this place."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Snow was falling when we arrived to a warm cozy place. The view was gorgeous and peaceful. Close to town and everything Taos had to offer!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place…modern, stylish, beautiful views, and great value…will be staying again soon!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stargazer merits all the superlatives...to summarize with just one word is WOW!! We knew when we booked it would be a uniquely memorable stay...the photos speak volumes as to the gorgeous vista location. Truly breathtaking...be sure to catch a sunrise! We felt so comfortable & cozy & appreciated the dual heating system plus terrific spacious shower with great water pressure. The large windows throughout let in the beautiful New Mexico sunlight & the interior artwork provides nice touches. Sean was prompt to reply always & gave awesome local recommendations. The drive to Taos is easy to navigate & there's civilization surrounding while maintaining a peaceful sense of privacy. MAGICAL in every way!! :-) Jules & Luis from Baltimore
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down one of the most gorgeous places I have ever had the fortune of staying! Out far enough away that sounds of bustle werent audible at all, but near enough to Taos to drive in for a trip to the grocery when needed. Sean's place was stocked with everything needed to make cooking an absolute breeze and we rarely found ourselves venturing too far for supplies. Absolutely stunning inside and out. My husband and I absolutely loved our time here and were so sad to leave. We can't wait to come back to see more sunsets on this gorgeous deck. Don't hesitate to book!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with amazing views of the mountains and stars (when it wasn't snowing!). This tiny house had everything we needed - the kitchen was well stocked and there was plenty of bedding. A really nice getaway.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice getaway at Stargazer. Sean was super responsive and very thorough with the check in information. It is a beautiful location! My only recommendation to people is to be prepared if you are coming in after dark. The roads are very dark, narrow, and winding."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sean was great and responsive. The instructions were easy and thorough to find this remarkable place. If you want some time away from it all this is the place to do it in Taos.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sean’s place is well-designed and seems roomy for the small size. The view is incredible and is close enough to town. It is so quiet and peaceful! We would love to come back and stay again!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we came out to new mexico from maryland for our baby moon, we wanted to get away, not knowing anything about the area.
I will say seans place is the gem of the Taos area, there isn’t much to do in the immediate town in november but to be able to get away, was priceless."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was incredible! Amazing views and you can't beat the night sky! Very private and beautiful space.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The unit was clean and decorated nicely and the location was quiet with a great view. Washer and dryer was nice to have but plan to bring your own laundry detergent.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was as dreamy as the pictures made it out to be. It had all the amenities we needed, it was cozy, and it had the most spectacular views! We stocked up to cook out there and get the most out of our time out there. You can step outside and walk around for a full 360 view of the area at sunset and sunrise, it was beautiful in every direction. Can’t recommend this place enough!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect long weekend thanks to stylish, comfortable digs and unmatched serenity. That view, morning and evening, was head-clearing and soul-filling."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stargazer skybox was wonderful! We spent two nights enjoying sunsets and then eating at a few of the local restaurants listed in the hosts guide. Skybox Taos will be the first listing I check for availability the next time I visit Taos! Thanks again, Sean!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The skybox was exactly as pictured! The views were outstanding and well worth weaving through dirt/gravel roads to get there. It was very peaceful and had everything we needed. Would recommend!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sean’s place is magnificent, a true place to find peace and quiet. The place was just like the pictures and I have never stayed in a cleaner Airbnb. The view of the stars and Milky Way will take your breath away. Location is great, about 15-17 min from the Gorge, restaurants and grocery. Seans instructions were very detailed and easy to follow. We had no issues during our stay. Apple Maps could not get us to the house but G Maps had no issues."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So perfect!! Really beautiful sunsets and great views. We loved our stay! Great distance from Taos and private.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I planned 3 nights at the Stargazer in early October, simply for the view. I didn’t know anything about Taos and the surrounding area and this was the perfect spot to stay. It was just far enough away from the town lights and the silence was beautiful for this city girl. Lots to do in Taos, food, shopping, hiking, Taos Pueblo, and so much art. I will definitely be recommending this spot to everyone I know. The furnishings were really well curated and Sean was great to communicate with."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as we had hoped. Hard to describe the view over the desert to the mountains. We're fortunate enough to experience a thunderstorm, amazing sunset and double rainbow all at the same time."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is wonderfully unique! We were in awe of both the sun rises and sun sets. Because the moon was full during our stay, we also observed the moon rising and setting! The mountains surround the setting of the Skybox as well as the color that evolves. We enjoyed learning the history of the area by going to museums and the Taos Pueblo. We visited art galleries, and went hiking. After a full day of activities, it was relaxing and peaceful to return to the Skybox. We appreciated the kitchen, and also found good places to eat in Taos. My husband and I highly recommend this area and place to stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our time in the Stargazer. Only regret was not timing our visit with new moon because of the amazing stargazing. Place was super clean and modern with a seriously comfortable bed. Awesome views all around. A total steal of a rate, too. Highly recommend, especially if you’re in Taos for hiking and other outdoor activities. We stay in lots of Airbnbs and VRBOs and this was truly great!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So beautiful. The road out to it is an easy dirt one. Also putting “Taos skybox” on gmaps and the instructions from the host made it easy to find. It was so quiet and peaceful.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing experience in a beautiful setting.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was such a wonderful place to stay! Beautiful views and central to all of what we explored during our trip! Amazing touches and clean and clutter free! Amazing stay! Highly highly recommend!!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! The airbnb is ~15 min drive from restaurants and shops in Taos. It's so beautiful and quiet, and we enjoyed incredible sunrises and sunsets. Sean was really helpful and answered a few questions about Taos/surrounding area ahead of trip."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a great place with an amazing view on the front porch! We loved staying here. An easy 15-20 minute drive into Taos/El Prado. Several good local spots for coffee and dinner. We took a day trip to Red River (about 60 minute drive), such a scenic, beautiful drive out there. Love this area and will be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! So peaceful! Place was clean.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location. Accommodations were new for us. It was a great experience! We would recommend and stay again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, modern, well-equipped, with a gorgeous view of the mountains and the vast night sky --- you will love the Stargazer Skybox! We found it on the ""trending"" tab of Airbnb, and booked a trip to Taos just to stay here.
I was a bit nervous at first because of there being 2 other skyboxes on the property, but they are situated in a way to maximize privacy and views and have separate driveways and such... so it felt very private. We hardly ever saw neighbors. It is so peaceful and quiet -- especially sitting on the front deck watching the stars (or doing astro photography like we did). We cooked some meals in, but also went into town a few times (only a 15-18 min drive) for restaurants and shopping. We highly recommend La Cueva and 5 Star Burgers!
The bed was super comfy, and the decoration and whole vibe of the skybox felt very upscale. If you're thinking about staying here, DO IT!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Skygazer was great -- your own private piece of the desert, looking toward town and the mountains in the distance. The views from the front proch are incredible, especially at sunset (and especially at sunset after a rainfall). The place is extremely clean and well-maintained. We cooked without issue a couple of different nights. And the guidebook Sean and Cambria provided was excellent -- thoughtful suggestions that led to some of our best experiences during our stay. Highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful escape
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stargazer is an amazing location for a family vacation. It lives up to its name as it is beautifully designed and allows to experience nature up close with an amazing view of the night sky. Highly recommended!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. Very neat!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful Taos trip, so happy to have stayed at Stargazer. Peaceful surroundings, beautiful scenery. Loved watching the full moon from bed and having coffee in the early morning sun from the deck. Inspiration for what I want in my own home."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular views of the mountains, sunsets and sunrises. Private, quiet and not far from anything. The space was lovely and clean. I'm so glad we chose to stay at the Taos Skybox ""Stargazer"" while we were visiting Taos for our wedding. It was a place of calm and respite during our busy wedding activities. Thank you Sean and Cambria. Best, Barb and Scott"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay if you are in the Taos area!!! Great space and lovely views.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a tranquil stay viewing the desert mountains, clouds and stars in The Land of Enchantment! This place is set up nicely to spend plenty of time outside enjoying the view.
Everything was clean and the hosts were super helpful. I even left something behind and they made sure to communicate and help me get it back.
I appreciated the AC in both rooms while visiting in summer, washer/dryer, and clean space!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The skybox was an amazing stay. The space is designed and decorated so it doesn’t feel small. Cozy and modern aesthetic. Lovely space, lovely deck to sit on and enjoy the evenings. Will definitely return."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was comfortable and positioned exquisitely to view the night sky. Fabulous! Everything was as described. Thanks, Sean for the easy communication and quick responses!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice little home with great view. The deck is a good place to watch the sunset. The AC worked great and the kitchen had just what we needed to cook simple meals. Very quiet, good place to relax and recharge. Perfect for 2 people. Really appreciated the laundry since we were coming out of a camping trip. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place with great views. We were looking to get away and Sean delivered! We appreciate everything!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Even before our arrival, Sean was a great host - super considerate that we had all sleeping spaces needed for our little ones, clear communication regarding check-in, easy to reach and always pleasant! The place was even better than we expected and extremely clean with everything you need provided. Easy drive into Taos. Insane views both day and night of the stars and surrounding desert. We’ll definitely be back. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very cute little place in Taos with insanely gorgeous views at night and daytime. The insides were decorated beautifully and made for a cozy stay. Absolutely would stay here again.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a peaceful place under the stars, this is it. Stunning views and lovely accommodations."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a awesome place! Unbelievable views, and you felt like you were all alone and very private! A cool place to get away and relax feeling like you were off the beaten track. The home had everything that you needed and was easy to access all of the local areas. Will definitely look to go back at some point!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful stay from beginning to end! Sean was great and provided a pack and play for our two year old. So helpful! The surroundings were gorgeous and peaceful. Has to be the best place to stay in the Taos area. Would book again in a heartbeat!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great spot for our honeymoon! We wanted to be close to Taos and related activities while having privacy and calm after the hustle & bustle of the wedding - this spot hit the mark. We were in the first skybox on the left (there are three on the plot of land, but they are strategically placed so you can't see into other windows and you have privacy). The views were incredible, especially during the morning coffees & evening wines. Inside was sparkling clean & a Southwest decor vibe. It was easy to get into Taos and around the area. I would definitely go back for a solo getaway or another couple's getaway!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Taos was great and we loved the secluded location. Everything met our expectations-clean, comfortable & the communication was one of the best in our Airbnb experience."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place - great porch!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful time at this very special place! Thank you so much! ☺️✨
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very unique spot! Fitting for two people. We stayed for one night and enjoyed the beautiful scenery and comfortable bed. Sean’s instructions were clear and thorough throughout our stay. Thank you.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very pleasant and comfortable home, and a unique one. Our hosts were very responsive to questions and to our specific needs."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location not far from Taos but just enough where you feel alone! The views and sunset were spectacular. We would definitely stay again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most beautiful airbnbs I’ve ever stayed.
It was just what my husband and I were looking for, complete serenity.
The house was super clean, beautifully decorated and it has all that was needed. We wished we would of stayed longer."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Skybox is a little gem!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a really cool place to stay off the beaten path, look no further. The accommodations were extremely clean, something we really appreciated. The location is easy to access and just remote enough, you can really get a feel for nature and watch the stars at night. The view is incredible, daytime and night time. Our hosts were so kind to stock the fridge with coffee and creamer, and some tea. The couch doubles as a bed, which was perfect for cozying up and watching TV. There’s access to wifi and Netflix. The bedding is so cozy. Slept so well. The washer and dryer were really practical. Lastly, there’s lots to do within 30 mins of the location. We loved it. Would recommend to family and friends!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The skybox was beautiful! Loved the tasteful decorations that went perfectly with the surroundings. Our place was spotless and had a great bed, great shower, even washed our clothes from hiking and cooked a few meals there. The deck is perfect for coffee, and the sunset was amazing (walk to the end of the road for the best view!). There are 2 other skyboxes on the property but it is such a vast space that you really don’t feel that you have neighbors! You can see downtown Taos in the distance all lit up at night. Great location for easy access to town or ski valley. Loved the little town of Arroyo Seco!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was just like in the photos..picturesque and serene. We woke up early to catch the sunrise. It’s beautiful. Thank you!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely place and location- we got a surprise snowfall on our last night!
We liked being able to go for evening walks right down the quiet road, and enjoyed the Taos vicinity during the days.
As a family of four, we thought our two smaller kids would be able to sleep on the pullout sofa, but it’s really more a single-person (even small people!) size so the place feels better suited for 2-3 people.
Host was responsive, and everything clean and as pictured."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a stunning location and a beautifully decorated home, about 15 mine drive from downtown. It was really cool to experience this alternate style of housing. We found it to be surprisingly spacious and comfortable. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. The kitchen was adequately equipped and we cooked a breakfast and dinner there. Due to clouds, we missed out on the starry sky, but there is a fantastic view of the high desert and mountains beyond, and at night the lights of Taos twinkle just along the horizon. So pretty!!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great stay! The Host was extremely detailed and had great communication skills before the trip and after the trip!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place with stunning views! Would highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sean's place, Taos Skybox was precisely as described and what I hoped it to be. It was comfortable for a 3-day stay for the three of us. The kitchen was well equipped and the rooms well appointed. The bedroom was cozy and the bed was very comfortable. It was quite cold outside when we arrived, but the cabin warmed up quickly keeping us comfortable for the rest of the stay. I will definitely come back here to stay when I am visiting Taos again in the future."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,What a view! Enjoyed morning sunrises and the stars at night. Great to enjoy a cup of coffee on the deck and look out on the mesa and the mountains in the distance. A lot of privacy. Modern amenities. Great for solo traveler or a couple. Noted a couple small concerns with Sean and noted he would follow up. Thanks Sean!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely fantastic place. Views for days. Felt like we were out in the country but were 15 minutes from Taos plaza. We loved our stay here and can’t wait to return.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the most magical and beautiful stays you can find in New Mexico!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! The host and the place were amazing. Highly recommend a stay at this place.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was such an amazing place to stay. We came to Taos mostly to ski but the skybox enriched our experience completely. We loved the views and the coziness of the skybox.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, every detail was thoughtful and made the place charming. We were comfortable after two days of skiing. We had everything we needed."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My son and I do a yearly road trip over spring break. I always try to find cool places in cool locations. The Skybox checked all the boxes. When we pulled up (looking at the back) my son said ""why are we staying in a crate?"", but when we walked around front he said ""oh wow, what an amazing view"". There was a really nice futon for him to sleep on and bundle up, and I was able to close a door so my nighttime sound didn't bother him. In the morning I was able to open the curtains and see the sun and views from my bed. I spent quite a long time enjoying that. It is obvious he spent a lot of time and consideration about the placement of the Skyboxes. Thought was given to every aspect of the place, and while it felt very well equipped and cozy it didn't feel cramped for a smaller space. My main regret is I forgot a guitar pick. I goofed and thought checkout was at 11 but Sean was forgiving of my stupidity. Hope to come back soon."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful place to stay in Taos! Gorgeous views of the mountains and the place was exactly as described
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,First time stay. My daughter selected and we love the Sky Box. Very private location. Sean was responsive and friendly host. We will return if no earlier than next Spring Break.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful place! Perfect for a couple looking for a peaceful getaway. Sean was proactive and clear with all instructions leading up to our arrival & then when time for check out.
The only thing I would suggest would be to have a regular coffee pot & a microwave. Also, my husband loves to recline in the evenings, but the couches were not as comfy as he’d liked. Despite those few things, we had a lovely stay & would 100% recommend to a friend and visit this place again! Thank you, Sean! We had a wonderful vacation with an amazing place to stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great weekend getaway! Would definitely stay again next time we’re in Taos.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at skybox…we arrived to a beautiful quiet desert home and woke up to an amazing winter wonderland with a coating of snow! A must stay and so close to Taos. Everything was clean and as pictured. Beautifully decorated. Very responsive. It was lovely!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The skybox is so unique and beautiful! The views are unbeatable especially the sunsets and sunrises. We cant wait to return!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great view, very clean, wonderful atmosphere!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was lovely here! Would definitely stay again, only 30 minutes from the Ski Valley, as well."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Magical!
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,It was okay.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The view from the front of the house is absolutely breathtaking. Get up early and watch the sunrise while you drink your coffee. You won’t regret it! The property was absolutely spotless and we felt right at home. We would definitely stay again!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What can we say?! The Taos Sky Box was the perfect retreat to get away from hectic city life and have an opportunity to unwind! The patio is great for sitting out and looking at the beautiful view. The space was cute, cozy and very functional. Sean was so friendly and willing to help. His wuick response to questions were very much appreciated! We look forward to returning soon! Highly recommend staying here!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying at The Skybox. The views were incredible both day and night. Close to town, The Rio Grande Gorge & Mountains.
Wish we could’ve stayed longer. Definitely will be coming back."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I absolutely LOVEDDDD the Taos skybox! Such an incredible value for the price- the home was cozy, clean, and had everything you could possibly need- kitchen equipment, toiletries, etc. The bed was extremely soft, the views of the mountains were amazing from sun up to sunset. Sean gave clear directions on everything we needed to know. And best yet- NO excessive cleaning like other airbnbs tend to do. Would 10/10 stay again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sean's place was beautiful, clean and well-maintained. My wife and I enjoyed our stay. The view was amazing!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Breathtaking views, very comfortable furniture/bed and a very clean space. I was not disappointed. The stargazer skybox was the perfect isolated getaway."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and very friendly service! Would recommend to anyone looking!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful view and location. We were passing through for the night and definitely plan on visiting again, and for a few more days!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a quaint unique place in the middle of the high desert. The stars and sunrise are phenomenal. It’s a sweet getaway for the remarkable experience of being in a self sustaining shipping container-like home. It is very nicely decorated, has all the amenities needed. Directions to the skybox, to get in, etc. were pretty clear.
Be sure to bring food with you. There is a grocery store nearby (per the rental details- we didn’t go) but food delivery services (we tried—- I.e., Uber eats, Grubhub) won’t come out there- out of range. The town of Taos is about 20 mins away. It’s a scenic drive to the town.
Overall a nice place…enjoy!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot! Great hosts!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at The Stargazer for our wedding anniversary and it was the perfect retreat. Incredibly quiet, well-appointed, fast Wi-Fi, and the view of the stars was unmatched. Would highly recommend to others and hope to stay again soon."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was beyond. First off, the pictures don’t due the view justice. The space is small, but has everything you could need and is perfectly decorated. Sean was the consummate host and was quick to respond and very helpful. Although we loved the view of the snowy mountains, we can’t wait to stay here again in the summer. We will be back!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tiny yet all the space you could need. Stayed with my husband (who is a big guy) and our 11 yr old. Highly recommend 4x4 vehicle in the winter months. A little tricky to navigate to if you’re not used to the narrow, windy roads. Scenery is pretty breathtaking! Kitchen has pretty much all you need! Bathroom has a big beautiful shower and washer/dryer. Living room is cute, but not the ideal hangout lounge. Bed is super comfy!! Both windows have black out curtains. Super cool place to stay away from everything. Would love to go back!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved the space and felt right at home. it was cloudy when I came so I didn't get to enjoy the stars but that just gives me more of a reason to come back!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very peaceful place with fantastic views. The stargazer was tastefully decorated and fit our family of 3 nicely. We would certainly stay again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very unique stay. Great views, super comfy, and close to town."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This container house is in a private and quiet location with beautiful views. The inside is cozy and very well maintained. My family and I enjoyed our stay. We will definitely stay at this place again. I highly recommend this impressive place!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! We've used Taos as a great basecamp for summer and fall adventures, and this may be our new go-to! Sean has placed a modern oasis in the middle of the high desert of the Southwest! The home was perfect for the two of us, with comfort abounding (the bed was divine) and great water pressure and warmth! The construction on this home was immaculate and had full amenities, which for a modular home placed in the middle of the desert is quite a feat! You can tell Sean and his wife have thought through every iteration of what we as guests may need. The location is remote but still a quick twenty minute ride into home. Waking up in to the sun rising over the Sangre de Cristo's can't be beat, and falling asleep beneath a blanket of stars book ends the start and end of your day in peace."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of my favorite Airbnb I have ever stayed at! Close to town and a short drive to the ski resort. It was a perfect weekend getaway plus the views were amazing!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a beautiful and peaceful getaway spot! The hosts are extremely helpful and responsive. All of their attention to details in the home create an incredible atmosphere. I would 10/10 recommend this place to anyone, and definitely would love to come back myself!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful view of the mountains and a very comfortable stay. Sean was responsive and helpful.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved this location! I had a bit of a time finding it, but the host were very responsive and helped me through it. The inside is beautiful, clean, and well decorated. You can definitely see the stars exactly as advertised."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay if your looking for seclusion, value, and uniqueness. Very cozy interior with all the necessities to make yourself right at home. The best part is how quiet and peaceful the home is during the day and at night!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at Sean’s place was awesome. Communication was great, everything was very clean, and the location was 10/10. This air bnb deserves to be on the air bnb homepage. The views out of the rooms were spectacular. Waking up looking out on the sage plains with the mountains in the background and sitting on the couch with a glass of wine looking out was incredible. The deck is very spacious, but a summer only venture. This place is perfect for a romantic getaway for two. Would not want any more than that as it is a small air bnb without a lot of room for more people."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sean’s minimalist, modern, beautiful and eco friendly home was the perfect getaway destination.
360 immersive landscape by the day, and stargazer by the night, we enjoyed every moment of being there.
The spot is a 20 min drive to downtown Taos.
The water on their property is sourced from 500 feet below surface, and their home is built to minimise waste of all kinds, which we loved being a part of!
Sean was super prompt and helpful!
Highly recommend checking the spot out."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had the best stay, the property was as pictured, clean and easy check in. I can not wait to stay again!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, comfortable, good location and value. Lauren was a great, communicative host. Casa was just right for my husband’s quick visit to get some work done in the area."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed my stay at Lauren's Casita de Indigo, which was equipped with all manner of amenities & conveniences... the Casita is close to all the cultural & culinary treasures Taos offers... Lauren excels at responding quickly in all communications and is unobtrusive during the course of her guest's stay... I'll search out the Casita de Indigo on my next stay in Taos."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lauren’s Casita was cozy and clean. Lauren was responsive and accommodating. We will definitely stay here again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay for a trip to Taos. Only a couple minutes from town. Probably the most comfortable bed I’ve ever had in a rental, which was great especially after a long day of snowboarding. Lauren is very nice and also an amazing host. Great place to stay and I will certainly return next time I am coming back to Taos."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Casita de Indigo, such a cute place in a great location. Lauren was quick to respond and very kind. I had a great stay here."

Cozy stay and easy to get around. Would stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was adorable and an absolute steal at the price. Lauren was very responsive and a big help. The property is very peaceful and right on a creek. When we were in need of a slow cooker, Lauren offered her own personal one so we could meal prep.
The space itself is the perfect size for a weekend away. The king bed was very comfortable and the space is well planned. My wife and I will be trying to stay here anytime the ski slopes of NM call."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great accommodation with lots of character. Lauren was quick to respond, helpful, and kind. Would definitely stay again!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place! Not far off the road to get to places yet you’d never know it, being nestled quietly next to a main house. So quiet and comfortable.
Every space in the casita emanates the beautiful Taos charm. Such a comfortable bed. I will definitely stay here again and again.
Great responsive host! Thank you Lauren for a great experience, I look forward to staying at Casita de Indigo on my next visits to Taos."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were fortunate to be able to book Jeff’s place for our two-night stay in Taos. Staying in this tastefully remodeled historic space made our time in Taos feel authentic. We used the courtyard to sit out for coffee and tea in the morning and to relax in the afternoon. We would definitely stay here again without hesitation.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adorable history home. Close to the plaza and easy walking distance. Nice parking. Clean. The sheets felt amazing.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Much bigger and spacious than the photos showed. Superb place to stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Jeff's place. It was charming, well-kept and made quite private and quiet because of the courtyard in the front of the house. Everything very clean, neat and just as advertised. Great value for the money and a terrific, walkable location!
We will recommend to friends and definitely be back soon."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was great and so close to the Plaza. We walked to dinner and shopping. It was even nicer than the pictures showed. Everything was pretty, clean, and comfortable and we would definitely stay here again. The historic aspect of the house made it extra interesting. Loved our stay! Thanks!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Can’t say enough good things about my stay! It’s a quiet spot that’s still close to the plaza and all the spots I want to go to in Taos.

The apartment is spacious, rustic but sensitively renovated; it's modernized while preserving original architectural details. It was comfortable with good lighting and the kitchen was well equipped. It was also extremely clean and well cared for. So far, this is one of our favorite vacation rentals in Taos."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Historic Mill is located in the HEART of Taos….you can walk to just about anything you can think of.

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at this location. Only downside was the parking availability would fluctuate and we encountered a mouse on our last day at the unit. It’s a very old historical building so these things happen, but I encourage the owner to look into it."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a gem of a place right by the plaza. The pictures don’t do the actual house justice. Wonderful stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We can't thank Jeff enough for the great place. Super comfy place to stay with my son (24) on a fly fishing trip. Walk to get food and have a cocktail! Beds were super comfy and all very clean. We will be back for sure. Thanks again!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location. Very good outdoor space.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place, great open layout. All the amenities listed were true. I felt very safe and I loved the location as it was easy to walk to dinner and shops. However, the couch was very dirty. My husband didn’t mind it but I wouldn’t sit on it. Not a huge deal as my husband and I were always out all day. Wifi was spotty so one time the TV didn’t work or would stop to load every 5 minutes. Got it working two times other than that one time. The only other thing is the laundry room is connected to the master bedroom which can be accessed from outside. Had a women waking us up at 9am being super loud in the laundry room. It honestly sounded like they were walking around the airbnb. Scared me until I realized they were just in the laundry room. Also keep in mind the unit entrance is a walk around the building from either parking lot. Not bad though. Overall the cons are still worth it. Again, wonderful location and super attentive hosts! Would stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jeff's place is beautiful. The pictures do not do it justice. How lovely to stay in an old, historic adobe in the heart of Taos. The place was also comfortable and workable. We really enjoyed being here!"

I have one minor suggestion- maybe 2 rolls of stored toilet paper. Or boxes of tissues. The roll hanging was less than 1/2 full and with 4 women we cut it really close with just 1 other roll
Thanks for sharing your place"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were first-time visitors to Taos, and this place was perfect. It is centrally located, with most attractions walkable. It is a historic building, with the look, feel, and charm of the area. The check-in / out procedures are automatic and smooth. We never needed to contact the host - which is the best compliment one can give. A wonderful special residence in a great location. I was very pleased with this choice for our stay."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is one of the most comfortable airbnb's we've ever stayed in. The space is perfect for sitting together with family and chatting or watching a movie. It's very open but can be private at the same time. The bedrooms were lovely and the minute we walked in we knew we would love it. It's also extremely quiet despite being near to a busy street. Highly recommended.

I will surely book if ever in Taos again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice rental, just a few minutes walk to all of the shops in Central Taos. The building is at least 100 years old and the interior features were excellent. Just seemed a little pricey for the features and the rental but I guess that’s Taos."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Jeff has restored the house beautifully and it felt a privilege to be able to stay in such a historic building. The furniture captures the spirit of Taos and the place was immediately clean. It’s in a great location, only a few steps from the Plaza but still very quiet. We had two great weeks and are hoping to come back some time in the future."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Historic Mill House #2! It provided lots of comfortable and relaxing space for us and our two young adult children, and the interior touches were well done. The unit had so much personality! I loved the ""truth window"" in the bathroom too. The keypad entry took a little bit of a learning curve to master, but we finally got it! The location is perfect - close enough to the old town center, but on a quiet street. We also loved dining at La Terrazza de Taos - don't miss that! It was some of the best food we had on our trip. Communication was great with owners/managers. We will be back!"

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and worked perfect for a ski trip to Taos. 30 Min drive to the ski mountain.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with plenty of parking. Spacious apartment. One very firm bed and one softer bed. Plenty of seating in living room and full dining set. The fireplace is a beautiful touch. There was snow when we visited, but the front courtyard would be nice in warmer seasons."

Would absolutely recommend!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It's a lovely place in a great location. Very charming. The gas fireplace wasn't working, but the host did message us in advance about that, which I appreciate.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Jeff for making such a beautiful, comfortable space! We totally loved it! We spent a bit more time ""at home"" during our stay because the weather turned cold and rainy, but that was not a problem since we had such a nice space to hang out in! And the location is of course wonderful. All the amenities, plus comfort, plus the place is beautifully decorated. We would definitely stay again.
We really appreciated being able to use such a well-equipped kitchen (loved the blender for smoothies). Anything we could think of was there for our use, and the kitchen was nicely arranged. The beds were comfortable and both bedrooms were beautifully decorated. Despite being located very near the Taos Plaza, the area was not noisy at night. It was fun to stay in a building with such and interesting history!"

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are many positives about this property: prime location, very comfy beds, robes, and plenty of hot water for showers. However, we also encountered some negatives: we killed numerous spiders and insects; the place was dusty, the outside light was very dim, and the living room couch was uncomfortable w/soiled pillows. There was a snafu with the lockbox when we arrived. However, the owner called someone to help immediately, and the issue was resolved in 10 minutes. Would definitely recommend this property if some of these issues were resolved."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible house and location; can’t wait to return. Advice for larger parties- if you do plan on having a dinner or cooking a lot bring spices and such, while the place is spacious and well done things like sugar etc should be brought with. Ideal location to rent out adjoining units for a full family experience too!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is my second time to stay here. Location is great. 2 minute walk to Taos Plaza. We enjoyed the comfortable beds and the hot showers after a day of rafting the Rio Grandè with New Wave Rafting. Highly recommend!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with access to restaurants, galleries, and museums. The place is larger than we expected with the bedrooms being separated by an open living space. Loved the nice touch of the robes and the access to laundry. Kitchen is well stocked to cook but restaurants are close and good. We made reservations at the Love Apple and loved it. Had lunches at Manzita Market--soooo good and a Chocolate shop is just around the corner from it.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Historic Mill House Unit 2 is a lovely place to stay when visiting Taos. You are in the heart of Taos, walking distance to the Plaza, restaurants and galleries. The house is just lovely, very upscale but in a low key way. We really loved the adobe fireplace, the comfortable beds, and the quality robes and linens. Very cozy and comfortable. I would recommend this charming home to anyone considering a visit to Taos."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We visit Taos often and this was our favorite Airbnb yet.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My sister and I stayed here for two nights. It was SO close to everything In Taos that we wanted to see. It’s a real pleasure to stay in one of the beautiful old adobe buildings. The fireplace made it very cozy and the beds were quite comfortable. It has everything we needed.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Historic Mill House Unit 2 is a lovely place! Spacious bedrooms with comfortable beds, great fireplace for cool evenings, very quiet, very safe.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place. Really enjoyed going back. The only tough thing is having to be out of there by 10. You really have to be ready the night before on these 10:00 am check outs.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely spot right off the plaza, great value!"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a spectacular place. One of the classiest Airbnbs I have ever stayed in or seen. Every detail in this place just screams top notch quality. This building is a traditional northern New Mexico architectural gem. The antiquated preservation and restoration paired with the updated 21st century technology and modern conveniences, culminate together in this ""old millhouse"" worth staying at as long as is possible. Tucked away, yet amazingly close to the Town of Taos's corazon, the Plaza, one will wonder where to explore today (without ever having to drive)? Also, one of the first Airbnbs I've stayed in where the description says ""sleeps 4"", that both rooms were partitioned for privacy, in a way that did not interfere with the fung shui."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best location, with easy access to the plaza and restaurants. Very large with all the comforts of home and then some."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff kindly let me book this property for my visiting relatives. The location was a familiar one, and I was concerned that the nearby road, Ranchitos, would be noisy. This was NOT the case!! The property was very quiet and the nights of sleep were uninterrupted.
Both bedrooms adjoin the communal area and have good doors for privacy. The higher ceiling gave a great sense of additional space. The fireplace was a delight!!
Information prior to the visit was comprehensive and clear. I would recommend parking off of Ranchitos as the Amistrad alley can be snow packed and narrow. There is plenty of parking!! Note that Amistrad on Google Maps is not correctly placed ... but it is not far off.
We left a charger and the host made it easy for us to retrieve. THANKS!!
Really great value for a group of 4, at a time when accommodation in Taos can be eye wateringly expensive!
THANKS JEFF and COMPANY!!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little pueblo was absolutely amazing and made for a great first experience in New Mexico. It was clean, equipped with anything you could need and very affordable. The check in and out was simple and easy and the owners were incredibly communicative prior to check in. This may have been one of my favorite AirBNB stays yet."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location 100 yards from the bars and restaurants. Good parking. Beautiful, clean, spacious and historic old house beautifully renovated. Two sets of washers and driers but watch out. If laundry room door slams you are locked out! Great value for money."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place in a historic building. The location was great - walking distance to the plaza and central part of Taos. Off street parking was very convenient.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, clean, centrally located place in the heart of Taos. Great New Mexican food within walking distance. Wonderful gas fireplace. Main bedroom, while great, is close to a semi-busy street, so expect a bit of noise from passing cars in daytime hours. Loading/unloading a bit of a challenge for this unit. Solid internet connection."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really beautiful place in an authentic adobe structure. Everything you need to enjoy the space is provided. Cozy fireplace is a bonus! Excellent location 1 block from the plaza, walking distance to restaurants, museums and entertainment."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Mercedes’s property is a gem of tranquility. I was able to work remotely with the support of excellent internet connection speeds. The views are spectacular and the artistry of the interior is something special with her wonderful ceramic work. An easy distance to town. Terrific kitchen. She responded rapidly to questions and was a great host.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mercedes place is located in a great location - right between the mountain and the town of Taos.
The area is super serene and beautiful (especially at night with the sky). Easy to get in and out of the area.
The house is very well appointed with a kitchen that has everything you typically need to cook, and beautiful hand made pottery for all the dinnerware. Comfortable beds, good AC/Heating, and clean and spacious bathroom.
Has a great living room with large smart TV and really fast (> 100 mbps) internet.
I would absolutely stay here again when coming back to Taos!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this airbnb! The views were gorgeous, the beds were super comfy, and all of the art/aesthetics of the home were great. Mercedes was a super responsive host when I had questions.
Location is also great if you're skiing at Taos since it's ~20 mins to the resort and ~10 mins to town. Would absolutely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautifully adorned place with easy access to downtown Taos. We loved our time in Taos and found this to be the perfect home away from home.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gracious, clean, easy, and out of our hair."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mercedes place is in a beautiful location with great access to Taos. The apartment has lovely art and amazing host-made ceramics. I loved the kitchen (REAL pots and pans!) with the large windows. Overall, it was clean and comfortable. That being said, a living room space that felt more usable would have been appreciated (oversized furniture was oddly arranged and taking up most floor space). For the sensitive traveler, it's worth noting that there's what appears to be a cell tower a hundred or so yards from the apartment, the heater is quite loud and that the mattresses are memory foam. There was also some trouble communicating...not sure if it was an issue with the airbnb text app but I did not get responses to my messages. If none of those things are a concern, you can absolutely count on a lovely visit in a lovely place!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely stay here again. It has a wonderfully equipped kitchen, comfortable beds and great views from all the rooms. Restaurants are a two minute drive away, and Taos and the ski basin within 10 to 15 minutes. Our host Mercedes was very responsive. All in all, a nice place to get away from it all."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed for a couple of weeks and could not have been happier. The hosts are friendly and very easy to communicate with. The location is ideal to access either the town of Taos or ski resort. The home is well appointed, quiet and clean. Love the hosts pottery throughout. Highly recommended."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable apartment with extensive views. We particularly enjoyed its relative isolation. You are about 20 minutes to Taos Ski Valley and 10 minutes from Taos Plaza. We were fortunate to have clear skies, allowing breathtaking sunrise views from the kitchen."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Barn house is such a cool place to stay! Appliances, space, amenities, the views, and the interior design of the house make it a very memorable stay. Additionally, Mercedes was a pleasure to work with and check-in /check-out were a breeze. This is my new go-to for weekend ski trips in Taos!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely wonderful apartment. Very comfortable and good style. I wish I could live here. Accommodates skiers and good space for relaxing. Great shower and washer/drier.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said. It was perfect! Right away when you walk in you feel at home. You can tell immediately that it has everything you will need for a great stay. The TV Room was great, the beds were comfortable, the views are exceptional, and the access is amazing! Even better, we were skiing at Toas Ski Valley and it's right along the route saving at least 10-15 minutes from staying more in Taos proper. Having all Mercedes' home made pottery was such a treat as it's beautiful as well as functional. And as a host you can't ask for much more. She was responsive and helpful with all of our requests. Really a top notch stay in a beautiful peaceful place for a family of 4. Thanks!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As most other guests have shared here, this place was even better than it looks in the photos!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mercedes’ barn is a lovely spot with amazing views. As advertised, it is very close to downtown Taos, but far enough out to feel like you are in the country.

The bed was very comfortable, and the art and pottery were lovely. I very much enjoyed my stay and will do it again."

I will definitely be visiting again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I loved my stay at El Nido. The place is in a great spot, super cut and cozy and I was blown away by the fact that all the dishware and tiles in the kitchen and shower were ALL handmade by Mercedes. Instructions were easy to find/follow and I had no issues.
Mercedes and Rick are both awesome hosts. They were very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again."

Highly recommend! We are definitely booking here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mercedes place was even more charming than in the pictures! Wonderful views, and charming touches throughout the house. It was stylishly and artistically appointed, and I loved all the amazing ceramics in the kitchen! Literally, it lacked nothing for our stay. Also- the most comfortable beds I've EVER SLEPT ON! The beds and bedding were like sleeping on a cloud! Mercedes and her husband are very sweet and accommodating as well, as we considered staying an extra night at the last minute, and they were swift to reply to our inquiry about that. Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"How can I describe the feeling of magic? Fine details, attention on simplicity combined with luxurious comfort, wrapped in artistic beauty of the local variety is truly amazing. The foresight of, ‘why didn’t I think of that’ when you see it, the small touches and grandness of it’s location with sweeping views charms the heart. If you want to feel at home again and be your true self, this landing pad is perfect."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A home away from home. On our first trip to Taos, NM area, we were fortunate to have stayed in El Nido, hosted by Mercedes. The lodging could not have felt more at home. The location of the lodging helped us to feel tranquil and took us away from big city living.
Thank you for hosting! You’ve helped our first trip here very welcoming and unforgettable."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’m big on aesthetic and pay extra to know I’m going to stay somewhere that aligns with my vibe. It was such a cute spot - only note is if you’re cooking steak open windows to not smoke up casita. Other than that loved how which he was to communicate and all the details.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Justin’s house. The surroundings are breathtaking and the house itself feels like a haven. It looks exactly like the pictures, and what the pictures don’t show is how secluded and private the space feels, while only being a few minutes from downtown Taos.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Justin was really helpful. We asked to check in early, and he accommodated us amazingly. Beautiful place. It was cool to have the piano and guitar. I was able to woo my lady with the guitar, and she serenaded me with her mad piano skills. We had a blast. It was a great spot. Beautiful scenery. The only thing we found difficult was the immediate turn into the property at night. It was just kinda tight. However, it wouldn’t hinder me from staying there many more times. Overall 5stars."

The decor and attention to detail of this space was incredible in addition to its incredible story of its past life as a dance studio. The porch was lovely as was the curtain-encircled, claw foot tub. The bed and pillows were so comfortable we are interested for our own home. Justin supplied tea and coffee with a conventional coffee maker as well as an electric kettle and french press.
We would to back in an absolute heartbeat. Thank you Justin for an incredible retreat!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was absolutely one of the best Airbnb's I've ever stayed in. Booked for my best friend's 40th birthday and it could not have gone smoother. Centrally located to the main part of town but still rural and secluded feeling. The landscape is gorgeous, the interior thoughtful, clean and quality. Nicer than some motels. The pillows were divine, the bath products, dish soap, all of it lovely. Coffee and good tea selection. Justin was helpful, unobtrusive, communicative and even brought extra blankets when requested at night. This is a wonderful spot and I will definitely be back."

I absolutely love Taos and wanted to find a place that was semi-secluded, yet still close enough to town. This place was it! The decor inside is so beautiful, and the atmosphere really makes the casita stand out from so many other places. We felt like we were right at home, but at the same time, it felt like we were on a retreat. There are so many thoughtful touches throughout the place, and we just absolutely loved it. The dining table was nicely decorated for us when we arrived, and we ended up having a peaceful candlelit dinner our first night. The bed was so comfy, the shower was perfect and we just loved being able to see the beautiful stars right in the front yard. We would love to stay here again the next time we're in Taos!"

Initially I was a little disappointed that it is quite far out of town but I sunk into the beauty/the serenity of the setting and the beautiful space. There’s a piano. There is a guitar.

I will be back. And may never leave next time.

So quiet and serene and lovely in every way. Can't say enough good things about this lovely accommodation. Really appreciated the quality and vibes of this location."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Casita Benitez was so so special to experience. The location was close enough to town to bike to (bikes provided by Justin) yet far enough to feel secluded. 10/10 would stay here again and again
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent two-night stay at the Casita. It was conveniently located close to town (we biked there with the bikes provided by Justin), and close to some great hiking trails. The Casita was tastefully decorated and extremely comfortable to relax in after a day of skiing, hiking, or walking around town. Justin is also a fantastic host, and provided numerous recommendations around town. I would highly recommend his Airbnb."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic experience, and Justin couldn’t have been a better host. Everything was seamless, and the place itself was comfortable and close to everything. Would absolutely stay on a return trip!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Taos after staying here. The location is ideal. It's far enough from the center of town to feel removed from the tourist bustle but still within easy reach everything. Nearby hiking options are abundant. The unit itself is impeccably and tastefully furnished, with a yard that invites you to lounge in the beauty that surrounds you. Easily one of the best places I've stayed."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a really magical place. I could have sat and looked out the front window watching the birds in the trees for hours. The bed was very comfortable and at night when the windows were closed up the place had a quite, calm cocoon feel to it. Even with the primary home and the B&B next-door it felt very private. This spot is only a 7 minute drive from town so you are very close to all the galleries, shops, restaurants and museums Taos has to offer. My only note to others would be that the claw foot tub in the bathroom is quite tall (above my knee at 5’6”). I absolutely loved it but if you had any mobility issues this would not be the bathroom for you. I would recommend Justin’s place to anybody looking for a place to stay that really feels like Taos."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved Justin's place! Secluded and quiet with tons of personality! We enjoyed watching the birds in the beautiful trees
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a charming Casita! Perfect for our family of three. Also a great location you to ski also enjoy the amenities of the town in the evening.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute!! Good price!!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Casita is a calm, peaceful place to stay. Very quiet and private. Absolutely would be our first choice in Taos if we visit again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Justin’s place was super convenient for going into town, snowboarding, and even fishing. Super adorable place. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such a wonderful stay! The space was beautiful and inviting. Justin had superb recommendations for us to maximize our stay.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an awesome Airbnb! Such a fun design, remarkably nice bedding, and close to all that we needed in Taos. I would recommend this place to anyone."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If this place is available grab it and don’t think twice!!! I could not have loved my week here more. I was here Dec 11-18, it was frosty cold- below freezing in the am and up to 40-50 in the afternoons, and we had a storm that left only a few inches of snow on the ground. Even with these few inches of snow the trails were awesome. Because of the altitude 40-50 in the sun feels super comfortable especially for hiking which I did every day. The casita is so close to magnificent trails. Close to town too, yet feels incredibly private and secluded. The pictures do capture the place and are a complete match for the warmth and light and cozy atmosphere. And the bed is no joke impossibly comfortable and feels like climbing into a cloud seriously a blissful respite of a place. I’m sure this place and space is wonderful in any season but winter was top notch. Also- so easy to arrive and depart all instructions very easy to follow. I arrived to a well lit and warm casita on a freezing day. Thank you!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A darling property in a beautiful town. Host Justin was on top of it; sharing recommendations for hiking and food spots as well as coming through with prompt communication. So appreciated this!!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous place to stay in Taos. Incredible energy in a peaceful abode.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly amazing. I echo all the other reviews and will add that I appreciated small details like the fact that the towels and bed linens had been laundered in a high end detergent with a wonderful smell, so my senses were delighted at the subtlest level. The portraits of the Native American chiefs and Georgia O’Keeffe really set the tone for mindfulness and thoughtful contemplation.
The ukulele and guitar on the wall invited my creativity as did the song charts I found in a dresser drawer. ❤️
I stayed at the Casita during the big lunar eclipse and was thrilled to watch the changing moon through the skylights.
Soaking in the wonderful tub with endless hot water also made me feel taken care of. I’d stay here again anytime, it’s a true oasis."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is lovely. Cute details, well designed. It is a bit out of town, which I enjoyed. Host provided lots of good recommendations in the area."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! The bed was super comfortable - almost too comfortable - we slept right through dinner the first night we arrived!. The place is a Close ride into town and everything we wanted to see in the area. The bikes were a nice touch to ride around as well. We’d stay again!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful oasis within an oasis. One of my favorite airbb stays- super comfortable, thoughtful, restful and peaceful stay and very hard to leave! I look forward to returning with more time. Thank you!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had the pleasure of staying at this lovely studio for a weeklong stay in Taos. It was equipped with everything you could possibly want or need for a short- or long-term stay, and stylishly decorated to boot. Justin was super easy to communicate with and all-around a thoughtful host. WiFi was fast enough for both of us to work from home and stream/be on video calls simultaneously. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a comfortable place to stay in this charming town."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I freaking loved my stay here. I could live in this cute place. I did 2 nights here and 3 farther out in Taos and it was the prefect mix. The decor was amazing, so clean, so unique. The lighting was so nice, everything had been so well tended to. The bed was so comfy, the windows let it such nice light, the skylights, mmmmmm. I even woke up one of the nights and saw the moon in the skylight. Loved the high-er brow coffee tools. The kitchen was more than big enough to cook anything. The tub was spotless, water hot!
Justin was super easy to communicate w. I felt special and cared for in this space. Also, great selection of books."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Justin’s Airbnb was phenomenal. The decor and aesthetic was thoughtful and intentional. It was the most comfortable place we stayed while in New Mexico (the sheets and mattress were amazing). Justin messaged me the day morning we were to check in to send me a list of all the recommendations I could ever need while in Taos. Check in/out was as easy as it gets and the house is very private. We are more than satisfied with our stay would recommend Justin’s place in a heartbeat!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay! It’s the perfect retreat just minutes from town. Justin was incredibly kind and gave us the most helpful list of places to eat, things to do and see, and was available whenever we had a quick question! Couldn’t recommend this stay enough☺️ We’ll be back again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Justin’s place is even better in person than it looks in the photos as it delights all of your senses. The textiles are soft and delicious, it’s spacious and light, the bed is super comfy and the kitchen is very well equipped. Justin’s exceptional attention to detail has given you everything you could ask for in a super styled, quiet, peaceful and gorgeous southwestern retreat. I can’t wait to come back!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot with amazing history. A great home base for a trip to Taos.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved this stay! I’m in Taos often and it’s a place I would definitely return to. Very stylish. Very cozy. Felt very peaceful and private. Justin was incredibly welcoming and we even had a blizzard one night and he checked in to make sure I had what I needed. The bed was SO comfy which is super important! Highly recommend.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the darling retreat! Close to town and wonderful outdoor activities! Justin was a fabulous host and took care of all the details! We would definitely recommend the lovely Air B & B
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My favorite Air B&B rental yet! This cozy casita was perfect for our getaway to Taos. Cozy and yet plenty of room and amenities. The host messaged with great recommendations for hikes, sites and restaurants in the area."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Casa Benitez. It is even nicer in person than in the photos and made for a perfect home base on my trip to Taos. Justin is a gracious host - he let me borrow a Macbook charger and kindly washed the bedding/towels with unscented detergent. One evening, I sat outside and was able to see the Milky Way. The kitchen is thoughtfully appointed and I had everything I needed for light cooking during my stay. One detail that I enjoyed was the binder that shared the history of the home. I also really appreciated Justin's dining recommendations - each is on point. I highly recommend staying here and would love to stay here again. Thank you!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely private casita that provided the rest and relaxation I needed. The setting is peaceful and I so enjoyed sitting on the porch enjoying the Taos fresh air and sunshine!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wonderful place to stay while enjoying Taos and the surrounding area. We loved spending our time there and would recommend it to others.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A special place. Instantly palpable energy when you enter and impeccably styled. Justin sent extensive info on check-in and recs for the area. Replied rapidly to questions. As others have noted, temperature is perhaps the one issue. Was pretty toasty on our early September days there. Not prohibitive at all, remedied easily with fans, just something to note and plan on for those who are sensitive to heat or cold. But our only real issue was having booked just two nights. Already looking forward to a longer stay next time."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish this Airbnb was my home. The styling is so perfect and thoughtful. The area is so quiet and serene, and a super quick drive to downtown Taos. We truly did not want to leave we could have stayed forever. Highly recommend this spot for your stay in Taos!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Casita is just as advertised.
It’s a quaint, well-decorated studio — just out of the way enough to be peaceful but easy to get into town and out for hiking. A terrific spot for a late-summer getaway.
Justin is a great host."

It’s always such a relaxing stay. Very quiet and comfortable. I enjoy listening to the birds sing outside. And I seriously love the bed and pillows more than my own.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Two of us really loved the vibe. Nice bluetooth speaker that made us want to dance as we imagined Maria Benitez creating movement in this adorable space. Although unseasonably hot for Taos during our stay, the adobe studio and swamp cooler worked well after a great day of hiking. The location was close to town yet quiet and peaceful. Especially loved sitting outdoors on the patio, watching the sky light up as the sun went down. Photos and description are accurate. We highly recommend staying here."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved your home and the decor was amazing! You are the perfect host and we hope to return soon.
2021-06-01,5.0,,"We had such a great time staying at Casita Benitez. Everything about the house was comfortable and unique. We really liked the seclusion, but also being so close to town. Great hikes are all around. It’s very clear the hosts care about this place and keep it a special place. We enjoyed sitting on the porch and taking in the surroundings. The history of the house was interesting to read about. And the books scattered around the house are top notch reads. We look forward to a change to visit again and give many thanks to Justin for allowing us to spend some time here."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about Justin's place was just perfect - the decorations, the outdoor patio, the location, etc. We truly enjoyed staying at the Casa Benitez and can't wait to come back!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I want to keep it a secret, but must give credit where it's due. This peaceful, enchanting, and inspiring space was even more than I hoped for. I left feeling rejuvenated and full of gratitude. The neighborhood is perfect for early morning walks, the big windows and large private yard immerse you in nature. Every special touch is warm and inviting. Justin was a top notch host. I spent a week here alone during my intensives week for grad school. I had to zoom all day and the internet did not disappoint. I couldn't imagine a better space to do it, and I'm so grateful I booked it."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Justin's place is very clean, quiet, and the perfect home base for a Taos trip.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Justin and Jade's spot is absolutely perfect. If you think it looks good in the photos, wait to be pleasantly surprised. It's spacious, tasteful, and has excellent energy throughout. My finacé and I both worked from the studio for a week and it never felt cramped or small, there are so many different ""spots"" to hang out in! We really felt at home here and enjoyed cooking/lounging in the casita every night. The list of recommended restaurants and spots in Taos was spot on and we were just a 4min drive from some incredible hiking.
Justin was so accommodating prior and during our stay, a really excellent host and he helped to make our time in Taos so wonderful. They were readily available with our questions and requests throughout our stay.
Lots of folks have said this is their favourite airbnb and I might have to join that tribe! Thank you Justin and Jade for being wonderful hosts!"
,,,"Outrageously overpriced, given the size and location of the facility and the quality of the furnishings."
