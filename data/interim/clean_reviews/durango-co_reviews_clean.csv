2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved our stay here! Kati was a wonderful host, very kind and responsive. Our trip had some last minute changes and she was flexible and understanding in our check in/out times - we appreciated it so much!
The airbnb itself was so sweet and cozy, us and our dog loved the peaceful, quiet property and watching the chickens and deer! Definitely coming back to this lovely spot next time I'm in town :)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kati was wonderful and it was the perfect stay for me and my fur baby on our way to Santa Fe.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Thoroughly enjoyed our first experience of glamping! The Flower Hut was charming and quirky and it was lovely to see three elk resting in the garden on our arrival and to be woken by the sound of the cock crowing.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kati is very sweet. The place was peaceful and quiet.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful location
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is so adorable. It was great. It was clean and just perfect for someone on a budget. This was our first Airbnb and Kati made it a great experience. We had trouble with hot water for the shower and she immediately came to help us out. The hut doesn’t have ac but it has plenty of windows for air circulation and she even gave us a fan to use. We also got to see two does which was nice. The wifi was great and the portable bathroom was clean as well. Only cons are the outside shower could use a bit more privacy since it felt like the neighbors could see you. Also the little wall way was bit narrow. Sink inside the hut only had cold water.The parking spot she originally wanted us to park was to narrow for rav4. Even with this conns they felt like you could work around it. Kati really did make our stay great and honestly would love to come back. Plus the bed was amazing to sleep in. Kati is also extremely responsive and did an amazing job accommodating us! Definitely recommend it.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and unique
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great airbnb! I had to go to Durango, Colorado for a 2 day work trip & this was the perfect place for me to stay. Kati is very kind, helpful, & responsive. The flower hut was very cute & perfect for a lonely traveler like myself. Would definitely stay here again if work brings me back to the area."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"If you want to be away from the hustle & bustle from busy, hectic life...then Kati's place is ideal. Living on a farm myself, I felt right at home with her friendly chickens, and beautiful calm quiet surroundings.
advice: when you pull up, your beautifully decorated, lovely art work filled private little hide-away is located FRONT OF the PROPERTY, to the LEFT. Not the building or house right up front or the home in the far back. Just stay L- not hard to find. Thanks Kati for the clean porta-potty!
note: folks, if your wanting hotel-style extras, close to shopping & restaurants, look elsewhere. But if you crave-peace, nature, back to basics...then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HIDDEN LIL GEM‼️"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy relaxing space to stay in. Great value for money.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place to stay. Very peaceful, relaxed and close to Durango. I will stay again next time I'm in the area. Love the outdoor shower."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Katie was quickly responsive and thoughtful. The room was just as described. Nice selection of coffee and teas.
The outside shower is fun and kind of edgy, early in the morning. The chickens are entertaining. The rooster is noisy like all roosters. That is his job. And I grew up on a farm, so it didn’t bother me!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Be prepared for the porta-loo, and know that the outdoor shower requires a little ingenuity, and is not for the highly modest. The room is charming and comfortable, and we enjoyed being wakened by the rooster. This truly is glamping, and so much more fun than a generic room somewhere."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Cute place and the chickens are lovely to wake up to!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,kati was a wonderful host. the chickens were a nice change from my city life and just awesome to hang out with. an amazing glamping experience for sure! the moon was full so it was hard to stargaze but it was truly beautiful being in the countryside like that! everything was a short drive away.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kati is a great host - once you book her place you will know why she’s a super star. I did not have the pleasure to meet her in person unfortunately, but I definitely enjoyed the stay and hope to stay again. The place is exactly as described. Funky and cozy. Comforter is so soft and she even left tea and goodies for the guests - so sweet! One thing I would like to note is that you do have to walk through a dirt path to the flower hub and the port-a potty is a bit of a walk too. Not a big deal unless it’s raining - just something to keep in mind."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a good location, country setting but close to town. Very quiet & peaceful, clean, it has what you need if you're not too picky as you do have to use a porta potty & shower outside but the path is lit to the porta potty & the shower is on back side of house & has curtains up for privacy it gets the job done for the price."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice quiet place to stay outside Durango with everything you need. Would stay again.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a cute place, very accurate pictures. The bathroom is about 50 yards or less from the bunch house but it’s well lit. The hospitality was superior."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We only stayed one night but very comfortable and beautiful place
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house was perfect for my family of four. There was plenty of space to spread out. The kitchen was fantastic and we enjoyed comfy living room at the end of the day to watch a movie on the smart tv. The location was the best part. Just steps from the Main Street of downtown but far enough to be quiet at night. We were there for a long weekend and always found free parking in the lot across the street. Would definitely stay here again the next time we’re in Durango!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay. The home was beautiful, beds were very comfortable and the location was phenomenal."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, Location , Location! It was so fun being close to downtown but still having the privacy and quiet of a side street neighborhood. Very comfortable common spaces, well equipped kitchen and comfy beds. The tight bathroom is somewhat of a drawback, especially for four or more people, but knowing ahead of time we knew what to expect. Really friendly host and very responsive to all requests."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Location was awesome, definitely within walking distance of a lot of restaurants and things to do. I left my wallet and the hosts were extremely helpful by letting me know it was left behind and allowing me to pick it up the next day. Had a great time and the house was super nice!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,2nd time to stay there. Very comfortable beds Only issue is only 1 bath and it is very small. Should upgrade. Otherwise really nice place and Trent is really easy to contact ( best we have experienced)

It’s quiet yet accessible, right around the corner from shops and restaurants. The house is comfortable with a large and well-ordered kitchen, and a dining room table large enough to host a gathering of house guests plus a few more!! We would definitely stay here again if our paths bring us back to Durango."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Trent and Lauren's place a few times before. Location perfect. Everywhere we wanted to be downtown Durango is walking distance.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Numerous restaurants within walking distance.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! We went on a couples trip for a birthday. The rooms are far apart enough to have some space. The kitchen was perfect size for cooking. And the best part was we were right in the heart of downtown. We walked everywhere we wanted to go and it was quick and easy! Not to mention the living room that outlooks to the snowy mountains beautiful!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s a special place and very convenient to downtown shops and restaurants. Easy walking distance. It’s a beautiful home. Lots of space and very tastefully decorated. We would definitely book again.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is perfect. You can park your car and not get back in it if you don’t want to.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect place to stay in Durango, and we would love to come again! It has 2 bedrooms with the living room able to be used as a third if needed. There was plenty of space for our pack n play for our 2 year old.
The kitchen was amazing and huge, and I really appreciated the gas stove! The place has plenty of space.
We loved how easy it was to walk everywhere in downtown. Parking was a little tricky but not bad. The covered parking a couple blocks away was great our last night when it snowed. Also, it was a very easy drive to Purgatory to ski.
Highly recommend!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Warm welcome. Easy instructions! Thank you
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was great for our trip to Durango during Thanksgiving! It was good for our younger family of four, very clean, and well stocked. The gas range was very nice, and I was able to bring several of our traditional dishes to my brother's house for Thanksgiving dinner. The location was fantastic, and we pretty much walked everywhere. The hosts were kind, responsive and accommodating. My brother just bought a house in Durango, and I can see us staying here again to visit."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good stay! Super close to the downtown strip with tons of food and shops. Hosts were extremely responsive. Beds were comfy. My van was too tall for the nearby parking garage, but there was free parking on the street about 2.5 blocks west."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friends and I enjoyed our stay. The location was perfect!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Trent and Lauren's rental! We loved how close it was to Main St and that we could walk everywhere we wanted to go including the Durango-Silverton train depot, out to dinner if we wanted, or for after dinner icecream. Lauren was extremely responsive and super helpful. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,House is in a great location. Parking is challenging but to be expected in an old downtown area (Trent gives clear options for where to park). Kitchen is well equipped and we enjoyed the complimentary coffee and tea.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, updated, and cozy space right in the heart of Durango. Great location and easy to walk to restaurants and shops on Main Street. We wanted to stay longer!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect location. Very clean and easy to get into. Thanks for letting us use your place!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Sweet place. Loved the location. Wish it had more mirrors to get ready in since there was only one bathroom and it was difficult to get ready. Also lighting was difficult because it was to dim. The parking was a hassle (like others stated) but we would stay again if it is just husband and I. Thank you hosts for sharing your sweet home with us.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place in an ideal location. Everything was very walkable from the location. Trent’s place was very clean and I can tell they thought through every detail. There is a unit above that is also rented out, but the white noise machines help block out the noise from footsteps above. I really appreciated the communication from the hosts! They were very kind and responsive to questions about the area and the space."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful home in a great location.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Updated historic home with lots of original charm... a few quirks, but to be expected. Great location! We were able to walk to restaurants, shopping and the train station. Great communication."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All of downtown Durango right outside of the door! Walk to countless coffee shops, restaurants, shopping and VIEWS. Throughly cleaned space, soft bedding, my favorite is the absolutely endearing kitchen. Friendly hosts, we would love to stay here again."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home in a Great location. The home was very spacious and very clean. It was in a great location, only one block from Main Ave. where there were many restaurants and shops. The only drawback about the home was the parking: there is no parking at the home. The hosts do provide paid parking but it is 3 blocks away. Even so, I would definitely stay here again. The hosts were very quick to respond with questions we had and were very pleasant. Great property, great location, great value."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location in town and a beautiful home with a good-sized space. Parking can be a touch difficult but Trent has gone out of his way to provide clear options and directions.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,If you want to stay close to Main Avenue this is the place. Left the car in it's free parking spot 1 block away during my stay. Very smart remodel whilst maintaining the original feel. The front room is very cozy for uninterrupted reading time. Loved it!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect location for our girls weekend. 1/2 block from Main Street where there is a wide variety of great restaurants and shopping. The house was also perfect for our group of 3. The beds (and sheets!) were very comfortable and every room had a sound machine! The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed and the living room (which turns into a 3rd bedroom) was very cozy. Trent was quick to respond to a few things that came up which was much appreciated. A great spot for sure!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was awesome! Right downtown and walking distance to the train and all the best restaurants!
The house is very well finished, spacious, free of clutter, super clean, and the list goes on!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was very clean, the kitchen was a dream with everything we needed including ice of all sizes!
The location couldn't be beat with a fun bar and live music just down the block. My kids loved having their own space."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was great. it was super clean and had a beautiful view of the mountains. The neighbor had dogs that startled us, and could easily jump the fence. The neighbor was not friendly at all either."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I felt like a local while staying at Trent's place! It was right in the thick of things in Dorango and was beautifully furnished and appointed. It was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay there again!

It was walkable to almost anywhere we wanted to go. Great selection of restaurants and coffee. The home was well furnished with a beautiful kitchen! Very clean and matched the description. Worked out perfect for our needs throughout this trip! Would recommend."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place my friends and I enjoyed ourselves
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is in an excellent location right around the corner from historic downtown. It is updated and very clean. The beds are comfy with great pillows and linens. However, don’t expect to get in one second early. The door lock is on a timer and will not open until the exact check-in time. (I suppose you don’t have to be flexible when you have a great place in a great location.)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great space to rent to be in downtown Durango. The unit was comfortable and well-equipped to host a family with young kids!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great spot, perfectly walkable. Clean and comfortable. The place in fact feels larger than the pictures convey"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"For Durango, this location is perfect. It’s situated literally steps from the main drag, with walkable access to all the shops and restaurants.
As for the space itself, it was very comfortable, clean, and cozy. All the amenities you’ll need are there, and everything was modern and updated. Trent was very responsive as well.
There are only two “cons” I would mention, (and they’re not deal breakers):
Parking is a little complicated (the reserved spaces are a block or two away), but that comes with the territory when the location is so convenient.
The front steps can be a little treacherous in icy weather, as the gutter empties directly onto them.
Either of these shouldn’t be a major issue unless a member of your party has difficulty walking.
Other than that, a very pleasant experience, and definitely a recommendation from me."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely home right around the corner from Main Street, putting you just far enough from the hustle and bustle that the home is very quiet and relaxing inside. But, you are steps away from restaurants, a winery, bars, and shops. The home was built in the late 1800s but it has been beautifully remodeled with an open kitchen and dining room space, and a very comfortable living room. The bookshelf has many great book titles that I wish I had had time to sit and read during my stay."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Trent's place ""Main Street Retreat"" was perfect for our ski trip to Durango/Purgatory. We stayed in the downstairs apartment and found the location to be very walkable to the main street of Durango. We were close to restaurants, breweries, and shopping. The hosts were able to provide us with some great recommendations. They were super responsive when we may, or may have not, tripped a breaker in the middle of a blizzard. They quickly came out in the poor weather to access and fix the issue that was present. They were responsive to us throughout the booking process and the stay. I cannot say enough good things about them. 10/10 would recommend."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little spot!
Cute. Quaint. With gorgeous mountain views. Close to everything in their little downtown area. Even the people in the town were helpful/resourceful and had a good vibe about them.
The home is inviting and has warmth. Was plenty of room for myself, my boyfriend, my teenage daughter and her boyfriend. We each had our own space. Loved how close it was to purgatory ski resort too.

My two teens walked over to the nearby ice-creamery a few times (which is a must try). Reserved parking is a few blocks away. Otherwise, there is metered parking directly in front of the home and free parking across the street at City Hall during designated times.
Contemporary renovations with a beautiful kitchen, plenty of hot water, a comfy separate lounging area to relax with family for games, movie night, or to read a book.
Books and a variety of board games are provided. Standard kitchen amenities, hair care products and dryer, and extra pillows and blankets are available. It is part of an upstairs/downstairs duplex, we were downstairs. The way it is designed you really do not encounter the upstairs tenants although you can lightly hear them walking around.
Trent is excellent at communicating and has a good response time too.
Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely stay again!"

Durango is BEAUTIFUL.
We booked this place after an unexpected event led us to leave Farmington, NM last minute.
One night was all it took to fall in love with the beautifully remodeled space.
Clean, modern, cozy.
We were so eager to check in that a small hiccup in the check in process almost crushed our dreams. However, the host was able to assist us and it was worth every penny!
Parking is a bit tricky but you don’t even mind since everything is walking distance. The host gives you detailed instructions on where you are able to park!
You can’t beat the views from all the around the home.
Beautiful kitchen, well- equipped, and just an overall cozy space.
I loved it so much, I am planning my next trip to Durango and I hope to be given the privilege of renting this space out again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place a short walk from downtown. the parking is slightly inconvenient, but in no way the hosts fault. The spots reserved are only a few minute walk away and wasy to find. Very comfortable and cute home."

The house is beautiful, well laid out, beautifully designed, clean, comfortable and everything you can imagine. But the location - wow.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is fantastic! I had been to Durango several times and loved this place the most. The location can't be beat. Easy walking down to Main Street and easy walking to explore the incredible architecture in the old Durango neighborhoods. We never even got in our car during our stay. The place is beautiful! We ate out every meal (great restaurants in Durango) but the kitchen was big and nice and would be perfect for cooking in. It has a large dining table and island. The 2 bedrooms had super comfortable beds and the bathroom was great too. The house also has an extra room that is used as a TV room with a couch. For sure could be used for sleeping. Very spacious home! Loved every single thing about it. Definitely one of the best AirBNB's I've stayed in! I'll be back 100%!

One little hiccup was resolved quickly by the hosts. Parking was a few blocks away but not a difficulty walk. Could easily load and unload in front of the home. Would stay again!

We also enjoyed the large kitchen and dining which we enjoyed cooking in. Family area has great large windows that let plenty of light in. Hosts are friendly and easy to work with. Option to include upstairs too, we didn't try this time, but maybe on our next trip to Durango with more friends."

You can only park in front of the building if you pay the meter like $1.00 an hour with a 3 hour maximum time, But you can also stay in that spot after 6:00 pm it’s free until next day by 7:00 am and pay the meter specially when you’re checking out, or you can park 2 blocks away for free"

The hosts provided accurate and timely communication about what to expect with arrival and departure. Their communication with me was very nice and timely. I would definitely stay at this location again!"
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely, well-decorated, spotlessly clean home that has been converted into 2 apartments (upstairs & downstairs - this is the downstairs unit - you may hear footsteps of upstairs tenant. Not too bothersome). Location is perfect - walking distance to everything.
Parking is a bit of a pain, but that is not the fault of the owners - Durango has parking meter enforcement that will catch you within 2 minutes of overstaying your meter. Just know that going in.
Beds are on the firm side. Shower is a rain shower head - lovely. Even though you’re right close to downtown, noise is not really a problem at all. Train sounds during the day, churchbells are charming, and good windows keep out most of the rest.
Listing says sleeps six. Six adults in this space would be quite cozy. Our group of four was just fine, however."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house has an excellent location. You can walk everywhere and we truly enjoyed that.

It is small, and a bit dark with only one window just above ground level, but that location in the back, away from the street, meant it was really quiet and private. Parking space is nearby and very welcome. I was in town to see relatives, but the condo would be great for someone who wants to make the best of what the town has to offer."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jarvis 106 is a real gem. It is on the historic register and extremely well maintained yet has all the modernization that everyone expects in lodging these days. Spotlessly clean, very comfortable bed, crisp linens,efficiently organized, very secure.
Due to my confusion as to our checkout date, we didn’t check out on time. The hosts reached out to us and we had to scramble our afternoon plans but we managed to clear out just as the cleaners were there for the next guest.
My point here is that the hosts were extremely patient, helpful and understanding once they discovered my error.
I heartedly recommend this Airbnb to any couple or single person who is looking for a place to stay in Durango."

The really only downside was no view outside the window and some of the kitchen items needed some extra cleaning before we used them. But overall the stay was great!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful first stay in Durango. The location of this small condo is right in town and is an easy walk to all the shops, restaurants, breweries and the Durango Silverton train. It was clean, well stocked, and I felt safe during my stay. I did not have a vehicle so having a grocery store just a block away was extra nice. I highly recommend R & K’s place for a couple or individual looking to spend some time in Durango!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I hidden gem in downtown Durango. Very well kept ,CLEAN, walking distance from everything. Private parking was a huge plus"

Reserved parking spot downtown is nice
Easy access to the unit; secure as well.
Clean everything and full of kitchen amenities.
It’s in a Historical building. Very nostalgic but updated in the unit."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here! Didn’t drive the whole weekend because it was literally walking distance for everything we were doing! We couldn’t figure out the parking spot because everything was covered in snow and was very fast at responding to help us! Great place! Would definitely love to stay again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and even better location. Will stay here again!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely enjoyed my stay at R&Ks place. It was cute studio with just about everything you need. It’s right by main st which is super convenient to walk the strip. City Market is within walking distance too and so much to do/look at. Next time I plan to come back I will be booking with them again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, walkable to groceries as well as the Main Street with shops and cafes, restaurants. Clean space, great amenities. Private parking is a big plus. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a fantastic location! Literally, in the heart of downtown, this unit was 50 feet from main street. Everything you need is within walking distance, including a supermarket. I will definitely stay here again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place was comfortable and incredibly well located right in downtown Durango. The hosts were very hospitable - even dropping off additional local coffee for me because they knew the apartment was running low. Great choice!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As advertised, right in downtown Durango. One small issue trying to get lockbox open, but the host answered the phone on first try and helped sort it all out quickly."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location down town. Absolutely killer rate and they we’re flexible with check in time. Could have had a-little more communication about the check in time. Private parking spot was great. But overall great experience.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was as described: close (meaning right downtown), quiet (well, the condo next door was having some remodeling done, but that was only periodic during daytime), and comfortable. Travelling alone, I don't need too many extras, but when I decided to cook dinner the final night, everything I need to prep the meal was there.
Their description indicates it's close to everything downtown. Very true, literally steps away from Main Street, which offers easy walking access to restaurants, shops, chocolate and, of course, the scenic railroad. Durango has lots of outdoor activities available (none of which I did because it was cold and I was lazy), so Robby and Kristen's place can be a good one for 1-2 travelers.
Thanks for letting me visit."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfy, clean space in a great location a block off the downtown strip. Parking space provided is in a small lot right across the street… bit tight for my 24ft long Sprinter van, but I made it work. Hosts are quick to respond. Bed and full kitchen were nice. Fairly simple check in process."

We will most definitely be back on our next trip to Durango."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great place! Easy check-in and good communication throughout. The place was tastefully decorated—a fun mix of old Durango with modern conveniences. It was also remarkably quiet given how close we were to everything. We’d definitely stay here again.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place! The condo was clean, inviting and cozy. The best part was the location, walking distance to downtown. We had the ability to walk around instead of drive around and that was a huge relief. The ice cream parlor and the Bookcase and the Barber were our favorite stops that we frequented multiple times. Make sure you check them out!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay while visiting Durango for a night or two. Just off Main St. in the historic district.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful studio located in the center of downtown. Had everything you might need . Laundry machines were right there in the building which was convenient as well. Not much natural light and the window faces a parking lot, but it did t bother as as we were out and about most of the day. We would be back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! A few steps to Main Street's restaurants and shops. One block over and down is the scenic Animas River Walk.

Nice studio with comfortable bed, well-furnished kitchen and bathroom. Liked having a ceiling fan over the bed. Exceeded expectations!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute all around! The space has been fully updated and modernized in a great way. The parking space is a plus as downtown parking can be hard to find during busy times. Loved being so close to all the shops and restaurants, too!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The condo was fantastic! Located in the heart of downtown Durango and within quick walking distance to restaurants and shops, as well as the farmers market on Saturday.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent space a block from the main level of downtown Durango. We loved being able to walk wherever we wanted to go. The space is very cute, comfortable and quiet. All of the utensils you would need to cook a meal were in the kitchen (although we did not). The bed was very comfortable, but like the previous reviews said, the frame will get ya (we just put towels on the posts). The instructions for access and parking were very well communicated. There is a coin laundry on premises, but they were not working well. Coffee was provided (a very nice touch). If you are planning on going all the time and just need a place to drop and go, I highly recommend this wonderful rental."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks for having us! Great location, convenient to have parking."

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space is just as advertised on app. A great value, clean and right in the mix of everything. I would say perfect for solo guest or couple; was a bit tight w our family of 3. Also just note that you can hear a lot from the unit above. Especially if you are light sleeper like me."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great and close to everything downtown!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This apartment is all about the location. Excellent location right off of Main Street. Great little spot to explore what Durango has to offer. The private parking spot was a huge plus too. Amenities in the apartment are good for a cozy studio. The shampoos & soaps were a nice touch in the spacious walk in shower. And the local coffee in the freezer was appreciated. This apartment was very clean, except for a weird smell coming from the garbage disposal (the last guests didn’t flip the switch so there were food bits stinking up the studio initially…the switch is behind the coffee machine for future guests). We definitely loved the location of this spot especially if you want to have a home base for all of the day trips you can do in and around Durango."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great studio apartment for two for our visit to Durango. Excellent location with everything you need/want both in the apartment or a close walk. Good value, very clean, and well appointed."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is definitely a studio space but was a nice place to get out of the rain and have a space to cook and sleep. Bed was comfortable but definitely ran into the legs of the bed several times. We accidentally turned on the dishwasher multiple times when leaning over the counter to cook- just be cautious of leaning over the counter directly in front of the dishwasher. Overall we enjoyed our time here!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ideal location in downtown Durango. Exactly as advertised. It’s not a bright space as it’s on ground floor with no view but it’s as advertised. Hosts are very helpful and responsive

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best location in Durango !!! Every store, restaurant, and attraction in town is less than a 10 minute walk. The building is historic, yet the room is updated with every amenity we could ask for. The reserved parking space was a big bonus and the security of the building made our trip so stress-free. We took a Historic Durango ""ghost"" tour and our building was actually one of the neat stops. Don't hesitate to book this one !"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,this place is located in a canyon and has beautiful mountain view. area was very quite an peaceful. we was a great experience and definitely stay there again. Also price is very reasonable.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When I arrived I immediately loved being here. I stay in a lot of Airbnbs and this place might be my favorite, which is an odd thing to say in the sense that it is so modest. Modest and majestic at the same time.
The space Eric has created is so comfortable, peaceful, spacious, open and private at the same time. He has put wonderful attention and discernment into the reclaimed and eclectic furnishings, as well as the art pieces.
Everything works well in the space, and Eric has been wonderfully responsive and supportive. Will definitely return!"

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"First of all, Eric is a really great guy. He bent over backwards to ensure we enjoyed our stay.
The view from Eric's place is lovely, the king-size bed extremely comfortable, the water nice and hot, and having the bedroom separate from the living/dining room was convenient. How Eric used vintage pieces for furnishings was innovative and fun. The layout is very practical and has a more rustic feel. We enjoyed our stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"A lovely place not far from the center of Durango, but on a quiet hill that makes you feel so peaceful. Kestrel the dog is friendly and will play catch for hours of that's your thing. The place itself is cozy and warm even as the temperature was dipping low at night. Would absolutely stay with Eric again."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Staying at Eric's Place, high above Durango, was like being in an Aerie away from the world. We loved it! The location was fabulous, and it was extremely quiet even with Eric's home being the floor above the Airbnb.
Eric was very friendly and helpful and willing to do anything we needed.
The bed was so comfortable as was the couch. It would have been nice to have more shelves in the bathroom and the kitchen, but otherwise, it was a delightful place!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Eric’s! Perfect getaway, nothing fancy, but absolutely everything we needed. After staying in hotels, this was so welcome to feel like we were coming home to a mini-mountain getaway w/ lots of beautiful views out the picture windows, and space to actually walk around and breathe. A fawn welcomed us upon our arrival.
Eric messaged us daily to see if we needed anything. Running low on coffee? That afternoon a fresh bag of organic coffee was waiting at our door.
We highly recommend Eric’s Inner Galaxy. I’d wondered about the name. It’s tied to the location, and the stars at night are amazing!"

The Inner Galaxy House will be my first choice of places to stay in my future visits to Durango."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful 4-day stay at the Inner Galaxy home. Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood, away from city lights making it an ultimate spot for stargazing. But also a convenient location not far from downtown. The French press was an added perk that we enjoyed for morning coffee. We would definitely stay here again on a future trip to Durango."

While the house is about a 5 minute drive to downtown Durango you are still in an area with restaurants, coffee shops and other stores. And the views were great. Eric was very quick to respond to communications and quickly address a problem that turned out not to be a problem. We hope to return.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic no frills place to hang you hat in Durango. Lovely views, comfy furniture/bed, good shower/sink, and great wifi for getting remote work done. It was mid-90s in Durango and the place stayed cool as not much direct sunlight hits the unit (lower unit to main house). There is an AC that I only had to fire up a couple times. Just a basic kitchenette (no stove/oven; only a small fridge). Great place, excellent value...would certainly stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great affordable place to stay! Would highly recommend. The space and Eric was very accommodating. Very clean and gives you more than you need.

The kitchen was very basic, and I don’t know that I would have been able to cook much, but we had no plans to cook because we love eating out in Durango.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Galaxy house is a perfect home base for exploring Durango and the surrounding area. We liked that it was a bit out of the heart of town, yet close enough to everything. Eric has done a great job making the space comfortable and useable. Even though there isn't a stove top, you are able to do just about anything in the kitchen. There is a microwave and table top plug in skillet.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eric's has a really choice spot in town.

2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eric’s place is very unique in a good way- more and more of his talent and enjoyment of art is discovered as your stay progresses.

We really enjoyed sipping wine and nibbling snacks at the outdoor bistro set.

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a clean and cozy space on the outskirts of Durango, look no further. Artfully furnished in an eclectic combination of old and new, Eric's place was perfect for our holiday ski trip. Close enough to walk to food and action, but tucked away enough to see deer in the yard. Loved making our own breakfast in the kitchen area that had everything we needed and eating at the table surrounded by windows w/lots of natural lighting and great views of nature. QUIET! The king-sized bed was uber-comfy and the bathroom was modern w/natural stone tile in tub/shower area. Only regret is not having enough time to hang out on the comfy couch and watch a movie or read a book. Just have to go back! Eric is a SUPER-HELPFUL host w/good taste in coffee...appreciated having enough for that first morning as we had forgotten to bring ours. It's the little things that count."

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eric’s place met our needs well. It’s in a convenient location close to downtown in a quiet neighborhood. The view from the living room and patio is amazing. One unusual aspect is that the bathroom off the bedroom has no door, just a three-quarter length curtain. For privacy in the bathroom, you have to close the bedroom door while the other guest stays in the living area."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eric's place was very clean and felt very private, even though it is still pretty close to town. Even though I had work to do while I was there, I really enjoyed doing it at the dining table with the view and the sun coming in.

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Galaxy house was PERFECT. Not only was Eric flexible with check in and check out for me due to some of my circumstances, he was always communicative and asked if things were going alright or if i needed anything extra. He really knows how to be a great host. The views were INCREDIBLE from every angle of the home, the natural light was amazing, the space is clean and quiet, location is minutes to town and many options within walking distance to eat. I brought bikes with me and I was able to keep them inside the house since it was really spacious. The bed is really comfortable and lots of storage space in the bedroom. AND I saw deer out near the windows early in the morning! I really enjoyed having my coffee and wine on the private patio overlooking a mountain ridge, surrounded by trees. Eric even left me some tea and coffee to try. I’ll DEFINITELY be back here when I visit Durango again. 10 out of 10 stars, I’m still blown away by this stay. Thank you!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eric was an exceptional host with timely responses to my every request.

2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Eric's home was a perfect spot for a weekend trip. It is very close to skiing (30 min) and downtown (6 min). We were there when there was a huge snow storm and the roads to his house were already plowed and made it very easy to get to. The big bonus was to see wildlife outside your window at all times of day and night! I would definitely recommend staying here during your time in Durango!
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eric was very responsive and helpful (even got our car unstuck!) and his place is in an awesome location. Views were beautiful, deer walked right up to our windows, the apartment was clean, quiet and super cute! Had a great stay"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is paradise. It is amazingly beautiful and peaceful. The hosts are amazing and very accommodating. I do not think a weekend is enough time to enjoy this beauty. Next time I am staying at least a week. Thank you John & Toshiko.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location! Comfortable cottage! Friendly hostess! We had a fantastic time!!!!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful and peaceful property. Lots of privacy and great views. Nice greenery and water. Toshiko was most gracious and although we were only there for one night, it certainly met our needs. The thermostat controlled heater was a nice bonus as the morning was still chilly, and the bed was very comfortable. Would highly recommend for an ""out of town"" stay."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed everything about this beautiful property and our charming studio! Sitting at the picture window looking out at the river and mountains will be remembered fondly. Hope to return someday.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such solace- such serenity-
Encased in John and Toshikos’ place-
From the nest in the tree-
To the ducks in the creek-
All cares from the world erased-
Magical- momentous-
The palette of colors on display-
Fresh daffodils so strikingly yellow-
While fresh greenery of springtime buds-
Give in to the breeze at bay-
The sound of the creek was enticing-
Leading to blissful sleep-
Refreshed, renewed and invigorated-
These memories we shall always -
Forever keep……
Thank you John and Toshiko for sharing the splendor of your place. It truly was a remarkable time!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Will be booking again soon! What wonderful hosts and humans.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"From Toshiko’s personal check in to viewing John’s world class art museum, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The suite was absolutely perfect with an electric fireplace to warm us as we watched the snow fall & the river flow in front of a large picture window. Toshiko had a vast array of teas and condiments for us to enjoy a warm drink upon arrival from the cold. We only passed through for one night, but will be back for a longer stay to enjoy this beautifully appointed hideaway. Thank you Toshiko & John for sharing your home with us!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Superbly peaceful location, and John & Toshiko are wonderful hosts. Definitely check out the gallery!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I booked our stay with John & Toshiko and we are glad that we did! The location was perfect, being sandwiched between downtown Durango and the local ski resort was ideal. The view from our stay was amazing and we enjoyed our morning coffee watching the sun come over the surrounding mountains. The check-in process was easy and our hosts were very friendly. Overall, we would recommend this stay."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,John and Toshiko were wonderful hosts! The property is picturesque in a tranquil setting. The home was extremely clean and had all necessary amenities. It was a very enjoyable stay and we hope to return.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a relaxing stay at this little slice of Colorado mountain paradise. Located creekside, at the end of a private road far from the highway, we could watch the creek rippling by and marvel at the snow covered cliff sides right out the big picture window from the warm comfort of the place. Our hosts were super nice and accommodating when we needed a slightly later arrival due to a late flight into Durango. There’s a friendly breakfast place not far away, and Durango is just a short 15 minute drive. So you get the best of isolated peace and quiet and access to all the recreational and dining opportunities in the area. On top of that, the kitchen is well appointed if you just want to relax and stay in. Definitely recommended!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Toshiko and John's place. Beautiful location, very responsive and flexible hosts. We will be coming back for sure!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Airbnb wants me to say a few words about my stay, but I have novels. This is probably the best stay I've ever had at an Airbnb and I've been a member for nine years. The hosts, comfort, beauty, peace, museum... so much. I stayed in the winter and am already planning a trip in the spring. Book your stay now."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable and beautiful! Looking forward to the next stay

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is stunning and beautiful. It was winter time, but still just as amazing as summer I’m sure. Can’t wait to come back when everything is green. Small cabin feeling! So cozy!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Clean room, friendly hosts. Really great view out of the window."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a retreat space, just outside of Durango, this is a beautiful space right on a creek. The view was absolutely amazing and we saw deer every day which we loved. It’s a small space, so not really suited for more than two people, but the place was beautiful and nicely finished. The only challenge we had is that it’s really a place to come for peace and quiet and I guess because of the weather, the owners were using their riding mower to suck up leaves every day we were there. That spoiled some of the peace and quiet for us, but they did stop on the third day when we finally ask them to. This place is probably best suited if you’re going to stay there quite a bit because otherwise it’s a 15 minute drive into Durango."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful location and a little piece of paradise.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This stay was our favorite so far. The nature and surroundings were just what we needed to unwind and relax. Pictures do not do it justice. The artwork in the home and museum were beautiful. They are talented and kind.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a very beautiful and peaceful property, nestled among trees, and adjacent to a babbling creek that sets the tone for a zen like experience.
While we've stayed at numerous properties across the country and especially in Durango, this absolutely is set apart.
We spent most of our days busy with various destinations and activities in the area. However, this is truly a place you could stay and relax and never leave for your entire visit. We enjoyed the views, listening to the creek and the elk bugling at night.
Another highlight was the gallery.
I highly recommend scheduling a time to view it. The owners are accomplished artist, and have studied, trained, and taught art across the entire world.
We actually saved our visit to the gallery for our last day and viewing the art was a perfect way complete our trip.
Thank you so much toJohn and Toshiko
for providing this amazing experience!"

John and Toshiko were both really kind and helpful with everything as well, and I really appreciated John's help with my van which was having some issues when I arrived. All in all one of the best airbnb experiences I have had-would definitely recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Incredible! Breathtakingly beautiful! Should be posted in House Beautiful magazine! Very secluded, even tho main owner’s house is on the property. In awe when walking by the river and the whole property. Very homey, comfy, cozy, and clean. Only high quality materials used when it was built. Owners extremely nice, but didn’t see them much. Highly recommend James Ranch, for lunch/dinner, and Hermosa Creek Grill, for breakfast. Will definitely stay again when in Durango. Thanks for an awesome stay!!"

The place was absolutely beautiful and perfect. I actually got a little misty eyed when we arrived and saw that beautiful flowing creek with the red rock mountains behind. Stunning! We slept to the sound of rushing water. We met John and enjoyed a wonderful tour of his museum. What an incredibly gifted artist with such an interesting story. He also gave us a tour of their garden with beautiful flowers.
I enjoyed writing and stretching creekside each morning and really could have stayed forever. Lovely people, lovely surroundings. It was a blessing for my husband and I to stay here."

It’s very peaceful, surrounded by flowers, right on the creek, and there are horses in the pasture. Falling asleep to the sound of the creek is majestic. John met us when we arrived and was very approachable and kind. He also allowed us to tour his art museum. I highly recommend this place to someone who isn’t looking to go out late on the town.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Every once in awhile you get astonished at something that happens in your life. One of those times was when when we had the privilege of renting the Modesitti's guest house on Animas Creek. Not only was the setting ideal, but the hosts were a JOY to get to know.
Our time on our 60th Anniversary became one of the highlights in our life together."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay and can recommend this place to anyone planning to visit Durango. The only caveat that I would highlight is their policy to close the gates at 10 pm. This could be an inconvenience for those wishing to stay out late. We only found this restrictive on one occasion when we stayed out past 10 pm to watch the 4th of July fireworks in Silverton. However, the host was accommodating with our request. I overlooked this minor detail during my booking, but upon revisiting the booking details, I found that this information had indeed been stated."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying here. We love how beautiful and peaceful this location is.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"John & Toshiko’s place is absolutely beautiful! It was just the peace and quiet and I needing. The view of the red rocks is gorgeous and the sound of the creek just lovely.

They are great hosts and I would highly recommend staying here!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular acreage property of great beauty along Hermosa Creek. Waterfront guest studio is private with serene views of close mountains and deck/porch offers sounds of the creek and refreshing breezes.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED staying at Toshiko and John's cozy and comfortable studio. Yes, Toshiko, the view sitting in the comfy chairs at the picture window is simply breathtaking. We loved sitting there watching and listening to the rushing creek. In fact, we made a point to get up early to drink our coffee at the window and to get home early enough to have a cocktail back in our favorite chairs!
The studio was clean and provided us with everything we needed. Toshiko assured us that we just needed to ask for anything we might need.
The location was perfect - we easily drove to Mesa Verde National Park for our first day - the drive there and back was breathtaking! The following day we spent in and around Durango. We got in a fabulous 2 hour horseback ride with Over the Hill Outfitters that started on the outskirts of Durango and quickly got us up in to the foothills. We successfully went cowboy boot shopping and birded a nearby reservoir, before getting back home to watch the sunset. Perfect!"

I wish I could give it more than 5 stars. Nothing is left out. They share their beautiful place and their beautiful souls. Their home, artistic ability, family and love for the beauty of nature makes this place a complete package. They are two of the best people we have ever had the pleasure of meeting. God laid the foundation and they perfected it."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was so peaceful sitting by Hermosa Creek watching the clouds come down on the mountains as a red-tailed hawk flew by. And the night sky! So brilliant!!
This lovely cabin is secluded, but only a short drive to town. The cabin was well stocked with all the comforts of home. John and Toshiko thought of every little thing a guest might need.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay here! John & Toshiko were very warm and welcoming and generous with their time. The studio is a beautiful gem right on the banks of the river with huge cottonwood trees, a hammock and places to sit by the river and soak it all up. The studio was beautiful and fully stocked with everything we needed and worked great for our family of 4. Note that there is just a hotplate for cooking however this worked just fine for us. We highly recommend taking a tour of their beautiful garden and John's incredible artwork in the museum next door. Probably our favorite Airbnb experience to date!"

Your studio and grounds are beautiful.
Very quiet & relaxing.
Close to Durango, the Million dollar highway & hiking.
Great hosts!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and Toshiko were warm, welcoming and responsive hosts. The studio is a beautiful, comfortable and modern residence with a well stocked kitchen. The expectations were communicated well and everything was easy to find. The landscape is relaxing with a beautiful mountain view. There are thoughtful details throughout and excellent suggestions for local activities and dining. We hope to return in the future."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"An idyllic, beautifully curated piece of paradise. John & Toshiko communicated all of the important information to us ahead of time and Toshiko greeted us at check in from the garden, which is clearly a labor of love. The value in this Airbnb comes from the riverside setting, which can be enjoyed from the thoughtful seating areas and multiple vantage points. The guest house has a lovely picture window, well-equipped kitchenette and a comfortable queen bed, but we wouldn’t recommend using the sofa bed as a second bed option. If you’re looking for a weekend getaway with easy access to the Durango Hot Springs and James Ranch Grill, this is a great option."

Check in/out was a breeze, and the cabin was very clean and cozy. We absolutely loved the location. Close enough to Durango/Mesa Verde day trips, but removed from the noise and traffic and set in a very tranquil location with a calm creek to relax by."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I have stayed here twice in two different seasons we love it so much (winter and summer). John and Toshiko are thoughtful hosts and the cabin is equipped with enough to cook small meals tiny home or glamping style. The woodwork and decor is lovely and cozy but what we adore most is the view. They have a little piece of paradise. Thank for sharing with us!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent stay. The property was absolutely beautiful, and everything was very comfortable, clean, and quiet. Toshiko and John were very welcoming and gracious hosts, and we had a wonderful time.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This guesthouse is absolutely a dream. We enjoyed our stay so much. The house is modern and beautifully decorated. Its so much more beautiful than the pictures show. The surrounding property is like being in heaven, we wished we could live there forever! The bed was comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked for what we needed. Plenty of towels and bedding. There is no a/c so it did get warm during the day even with the fan, (it was July) but we were out most of the day anyway. It was so quiet and comfortable, truly an ideal place to get away and relax. The location was perfect for visiting Durango and Silverton and driving the million dollar highway. Great restaurants and everything you need nearby."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay here. The Air BnB is situated by a lovely creek and mountain view and the hosts are very friendly and willing to show you around. The guest house was the perfect size for us to unwind on our trip. Highly recommend a stay and will be back if the opportunity arises!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"awesome view of stream and mountains from large window, or go out and sit in the chairs next to the stream. Short distance to Durango. One of the bests bnb's we've stayed at. nice and quite property for when your needing time to unwind."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There is truly no better place you can find to experience a magical place. The aesthetics of the views, sounds of the water and comfort of this home is exactly what fuels your soul. Could not give this place any higher rating or recommendations!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, private and peaceful. Everything you need is at your finger tips ."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,PERFECT in every way!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio on this property is absolutely beautiful. It had just what we needed to reset and relax…. a comfortably firm bed, hot shower, and stunning views. About 15 minutes north of Durango, we were close to everything we wanted to see and do. With such idyllic surroundings, we slept peacefully and had plenty of energy to hike and explore. The property itself felt like something out of a painting…. Soft grass, flowers in bloom, that stream running right outside of the studio…and had several comfortable places to just sit and enjoy nature all around you.
The only thing I should point out is the kitchen, while well equipped otherwise, has only a hot plate for cooking. It didn’t bother us, ( there’s a restaurant across the road and a small market 5 min away), but if you are planning on doing a lot of cooking on your trip, it’s something to consider.
I cannot recommend this place enough, and hope to return soon.
Thank you John and Toshiko for allowing us to enjoy a small slice of the paradise you have created!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful property with great views and a creek running through it. Quiet and peaceful. Loved listening to the sound of the stream during the night. The hosts were very helpful and easy to communicate with. Plan to return.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully stunning and magical from the moment onto the property until the departure. One of the best feelings of rest and calm wrapped in the warmth of serenity. A place to return to again and again. Thank you!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The studio suite on the property is beyond perfect. Leaving the windows open in the evening and listening to the sound of the lovely stream as you fall asleep is serene. The kitchen and amenities were really convenient as well in the studio. The property is gorgeous and sitting and drinking coffee along the stream is blissful. The hosts were wonderful and the property is quiet and peaceful with the sounds of rushing water. And leaving out the front door to see adorable horses on the property is always a welcomed site. Highly recommend staying here!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is unreal. Beautiful views and a clean, comfortable studio. They thought of all the little things. The kitchen and bathroom had everything you could need and more. We spent most of our time sitting by the river. It was just gorgeous! John showed us his gallery as well. His paintings are amazing. We will be back for sure."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of my all time favorite Airbnb experiences! The hosts were so kind and welcoming. The home was beautiful and clean. The views are the best part!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an incredible, energizing place with the river flowing by. Toshiko met me when I arrived late to make sure everything was in order. I hope to stay again."
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely location. However, it is NOT private. Apparently the grounds are open to various visitors who may come by to view the gallery. These visitors will be walking around the property, including around the outside of the Airbnb. To include the private deck/patio which faces the owners house, as well as the picture window of the Airbnb that faces the river. You see, the gallery is attached to the Airbnb so they have to go in front of the Airbnb. Additionally, there is no direct lighting in the entire Airbnb. If you like to look in a mirror to see your face or possibly put on make-up, forget about it."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a peaceful and unique stay. We absolutely loved the property. The creek is absolutely beautiful and made for the most tranquil stay. Highly recommend & hope to be back if ever in Durango again!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing experience. From beginning to end, the experience was spectacular! The place was very clean, private, and comfortable. It has a gorgeous view and an amazing designated sitting spot by the little river/stream to have coffee or tea by! Hosts were very friendly, an offered great suggestions of where to go/things to do in the town! Very easy check in and out. Toshiko gave us a welcoming tour of the house and demonstration of how to use all appliances. Communication was extremely easy, will definitely stay again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful, peaceful, relaxing place. A little slice of heaven on earth! My husband and I spent 3 nights here and we are looking forward to returning in the fall again. Toshiko and John are wonderful hosts."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As soon as we drove in, we could see that the place would exceed our expectations. It is private, at the end of the road with creek frontage. Toshiko greeted us and even though the owners are next door, the place afforded us great privacy. There is a mesmerizing view of water and trees from the window. Gurgling water sounds soothed us at night. The stars are amazing. Bring your binoculars, there is a lot to see from the two chairs along the river. There is also a picnic table, a hammock, a porch swing and chairs on a large covered porch. This deserves it's super host rating!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is absolutely amazing. Scenic beyond belief with a river right outside your window. John and Toshiko are extremely friendly and accommodating. Most comfortable bed I’ve slept in too 😁
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,John and Yoshiko were wonderful hosts and their little ranch was beautiful. We really appreciated the peacefull surroundings of the rushing creek and yard. It was fun to watch the horses and chickens too. We will definitely spend more time there next time.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The most beautiful, peaceful stay ever. Everything about this place is well done. Great attention paid to the little details that make for a memorable stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb experience I've had so far. The property is gorgeous, and the location was perfect for exploring nearby trails. John and Toshiko are great communicators and went above and beyond to make the studio a comfortable place to stay. I'll definitely be back!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Definitely would recommend to someone who wants a nice quiet stay and enjoy the beautiful outside.
As we pulled in, Toshiko greeted us with smiles and good vibes. She was as happy to see us, as we were to her. She gave us a tour and was willing to answer any questions we had for her. She was very welcoming and friendly to someone who is somewhat new to airbnb.
You have the entire tiny home to yourself. A ton of privacy and everything you need. A kitchen with a fridge and many items you can use to cook breakfast lunch and dinner. She provided an electric kettle and tea for you to use. I was even able to make my morning smoothie with the provided blender.
The bathroom was up to date and gorgeous. Towels and toiletries were provided which was great.
The living area and bed was very comfortable. The fireplace immediately warmed up the entire place.
Your vehicle will be locked inside a gated area which feels very safe. Especially if you have bikes on your vehicle.
Best of all was the window with a view of the mountains and stream. This alone will get me to stay again. View this from inside the home or along side the stream with provided chairs. They even have a hammock if you enjoy that too.
The provided pictures do not do any justice to this home. I saw the pics and then the home in person and was blown away by the choice I made.
I'm sorry but I cannot pick any downsides to this home. Everything was great and well worth it!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you, John and Toshiko! We had an incredible stay. Toshiko greeted us upon arrival and provided us with all of the information we needed about the property.

Very well equipped if you wanted to have dinner or breakfast at home (eg. oil, salt, oatmeal, some fruits, all the dishes and cutlery you’d expect). Tiny, but cosy and well organized, felt like at home. Bed was extremely comfortable and the sound of the stream that’s right behind the shack made it so relaxing to fall asleep. Got a chance also to pet the family dog who was curious to greet us (huge bonus!). All summed up, a great stay!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was a little hard for us to find in the dark but when we did we loved it!! So cute and cozy and had everything we needed to cook a little dinner.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect small space with everything you could need. Cozy and cute.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was perfect to us but..the shower & bed was absolutely perfection!!!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Would definitely recommend if you are traveling to Durango!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay, quiet, secluded location."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"MaeBunny’s Shack is a pleasant and comfy place to stay! I enjoyed it thoroughly! My only beef, and it’s a tiny beef, is that the shower is pretty small and requires creativity to reach some of your lower extremities if you’re an American-sized individual. Water pressure was great however! I will definitely stay here again the next time I come to Durango. Thanks for the hospitality!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! It was cozy and friendly. Recommend to anyone wanting some seclusion but still close to durango.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great quick little stay in Durango at Maebunny’s Shack! Loved it
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super Cozy, Clean and Comfortable. Well-stocked. Close to Town, Trails and Hot Springs."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,beautiful place in the mountains. felt like being in country but really close to town!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy space for a couple of nights in Durango, close to town. Had all we needed…thank you!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute and comfortable little cabin in the woods. We really enjoyed our stay! Everything was as described. Highly recommend for anybody looking to stay in the area!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for a great stay. We’ll be back :)
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Libby‘s place is small in size, but huge in amenities. The amount of space is great for a couple or an individual traveler. Just as the description the offerings are abundant. The bathroom is clean and Libby provided the basic toiletries and the kitchenette is well stocked with spices, utensils, coffee and tea.
The queen size bed was comfy with clean linen. There’s a small creek that runs behind the cabin even though it was dry during our stay. The surrounding area is very quiet since it’s a residential area even though neighbors are spread quite apart. About an eight minute drive to downtown Durango and with plenty of restaurants, cafes, and gift shops.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and can recommend to anyone without any reservation."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I am traveling from Missoula, Montana to San Miguel de Allende, Mexico and what nailed the reservation for me was having ""The Untethered Soul"" in her library. Anyone who has that book is a friend of mine. But it was much more!! She has everything a person needs and it's in a perfect space for one person and a small dog! I guess it would be good for a couple too, but I'm one person with a dog! It smells so good. No chemical Tide/Downy stink! All her spices are organic. Himalayan salt. Tea and Coffee. The refrigerator door had so many useful things when having take out or cooking for yourself. I enjoyed the peaceful early morning light and making coffee. The shower head is one of those amazing top end that feels like one is under a waterfall. I wouldn't expect that in a shack! I'd love to come back every year. Loved it! Terry"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here for a wedding and it was the PERFECT place for a weekend getaway! The space was more than accommodating for two people and it was in a beautiful location. Loved being able to open the windows and let the fresh air in. Absolutely plan on staying again when in Durango for a weekend☺️

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a gem of AirBnBs! Remote, rustic and quiet but close enough to town for essentials. The BEST shower head 🤗, spotless everywhere and thoughtfully stocked. 6 out of 5 stars! (And the pups are the sweetest!) Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the place, great for a quick 1 night stay !"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Libby's place was the perfect location for the event I was in town for. Cozy well maintained, and provided all the amenities I needed. I will definitely stay here again, the next time I'm out of a race."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an eclectic little shack that was exactly as I expected. A nice little place to stay and unwind for a few days. Loved the stream and the private outside area.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a joy to stay at this little piece of heaven. Best night sleep after sitting outside enjoying the sounds of nature.
Great communication, lovely place to enjoy and if I’m ever in the area again I will be reserving this peaceful shack again.
Thanks Libby for a great spot to lay my head for a restful night sleep after a day of motorcycle riding."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here! Although the space is a tiny house it doesn’t feel that small at all, with a thoughtfully laid out design and decoration. The host was proactive with informing us about the WiFi being down, but the service in the area is great so we didn’t mind at all! Thank you for a lovely stay!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This was a nice stay very close to town. The hosts had lots of thoughtful touches and amenities.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay and liked that the location was just out of town near a nice walkable park (Dalla Mountain Park). Location was nice, quiet and very clean! Would recommend to anyone staying in the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place in a good location. Has all the comforts of home, and is clean, quiet, and cozy."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodation is ideal: fully equipped kitchen, adorable decor, and refreshing exterior. All ideally located near Durango and all the wonders to visit around. A nice stay, thank you for creating this beautiful place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying here! The spot is a tiny cabin just a few minutes outside of town in a beautiful setting. There is a yard with a table and chairs, a rocking bench, all located next to a very relaxing creek. We arrived just after a few days of camping, so the size was perfect for us. The place was clean and cozy. I would stay here again, for sure."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely little shack in a great location. Very comfy bed and has everything you need. Nice creek to sit by and a private outdoor area to cook/eat. Really glad we chose this spot.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the second time I have stayed at MaeBunny shack. I absolutely love the location. It’s quiet and peaceful yet close to everything you need. I’ve always felt safe here as a solo female traveler. Me and my pup had a great time staying here.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at Libbys place! very clean, tons of kitchen amenities, and very comfortable bed.
Thanks for having us Libby! :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed maebunnys. It's only a few minutes from downtown Durango and from the Colorado trail. There's a kitchen so if you want to cook you can. The creek outside was peaceful. They left us coffee and snacks which was really nice.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place exceeded all expectations. Sitting right on a beautiful little creek with a large private side yard and funky covered space with a wooden porch swing, the outdoor space alone was awesome. (Sitting outside listening to the rain on that tin roof was divine!) The ""Bunny Shack"" itself is adorable, inside and out. It's positively dripping with character, and Libby's thoughtful decorating with an eye toward comfort and delight is off the charts. It's a tiny space, but thoughtful design and decoration actually make it feel quite large -- and definitely homey. Have you ever been to a rental that has deluxe (sharp!) knives in the kitchen?! From the collection of gourmet teas, coffees + snacks to the ultra comfy bed with rolling storage underneath to the thoughtful book selection and charming artwork, I was delighted to stay here and definitely will again. Thanks, Libby"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy all the way around and close to downtown, yet private and quiet."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Overall a cute stay! Definitely could use air conditioning - we had the windows open the entire stay but when it’s 90+ outside it never quite cooled off enough to be comfortable. Also the outdoor area/yard surrounding the cabin could use some sprucing and picking up. There’s old metal and wood being stored there as well as a run down workshop and if this was picked up and made to look more cozy, it would add to the experience more. Location to town was great and loved being on the creek."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Libby was very gracious and the land is lovely.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely perfect place for us! Exactly as delightful as described by the many other 5 star reviewers who've enjoyed Maebunny's.
Billie and Pippy, the small and the tall, are the friendliest dogs ever, but never pests. The shack had everything we needed and nothing we didn't, supremely clean, and the almost magical location: literally 5 minutes from downtown Durango, yet nestled within trees, birds, butterflies, with the sound of the water in the creek running behind the shack. Cars passing on the road mere whispers. The deep country experience just minutes from food, drink, rafting, etc.
Libby was low-key and friendly, responded to questions immediately, couldn't ask for a better host. We left a personal item behind and she was kind enough to mail it back to us.
I'd give 10 stars if I could. Would love to return!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Check in was very easy. Instructions to find were spot on. We were greeted by 2 very sweet dogs, added plus since we left ours at home. Slept to to sound of the little creek out back. It was peaceful. Had morning coffee on the bench by the creek. It felt like we were miles away from the city, but actually we were close. We needed to get away from things for a bit and this was the place to do it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was fantastic! The cabin was cozy and comfortable and had everything we needed. The river runs right behind the cabin and the cabin was nice and cool with just a window open. Next time we are in Durango we will definitely book this place!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the stay. Was clean and liked the location on the very edge of town. Felt like it was in the country. Private feel even tho it’s on their yard.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this place. It was close to town (Durango) but just far enough outside of town to feel like you were in the woods. The shack is right next to a creek that was so soothing.
Libby was so friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this place for people looking for that rustic out the of the way experience."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location. Beautiful property. The ""Shack"" was clean and no surprises. Nice quiet place to rest very close to town"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Loved the creek! Super cozy and cool at night. Would highly recommend if you are planning a trip to Durango. 5 min from everything!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give 1000 stars to Libby’s place, I would! A perfect, cozy, restful spot to stay while exploring all Durango has to offer. Libby has been so thoughtful in all the added touches in the cabin- you will want for nothing! The bed is incredibly comfortable, the cabin is spotlessly clean, and the setting is blissful. I want to spend an entire summer in this place. Highly, highly recommend and I’ll be back! Thank you, Libby!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was perfect for us. It was just as described and provided plenty room. The cabin was cozy and comfortable (great bedding) with all the little touches to make our stay nice. We enjoyed the outdoor area and spent the evening in the glider by the river. Libby was very responsive at time of booking and when we checked out. I wish all stays could be this nice and easy!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute and cozy spot with all the necessary amenities, we loved it!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay very much. It's a small space but has everything you need. We really enjoyed the stream and closeness to nature while also being very close to town. A real bargain for the money. Would highly recommend.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super host with a great location to downtown Durango… A wonderful place to decompress and enjoy the rushing sound of the creek at the back of the property… Ideal for one or two people…
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place in a beautiful setting with a little bench by the creek with great views! An excellent host!
A lot of little extras and a personal touch. I would definitely return and recommend it!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a gem! Cozy, simple , and all you need! Loved the creek on the property…just amazing to listen to as you fall asleep. Found my go-to spot when I’m traveling through Durango. Done deal!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our favorite Airbnb during our road trip! Although it was the tiniest place we stayed, it was the most accommodating and the best! The small size made it so cozy, and was very well put together! This one had everything we needed, from TV, music, a small stove and dishes, and lots of extra special touches that made our stay very comfortable. The sound of the stream was magnificent and the location was perfect and super close to downtown Durango! It was a perfect start for our road trip, and we would love to stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"if you're traveling solo or with a partner this is the place to stay while you're in Durango. it was perfect! the cabin is beautiful, the back yard is wonderful with a stream running through it and the canine greeters were super friendly."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute little cabin in a perfect location
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great, unique spot in Durango and easy drive to Mesa Verde. Would recommend if you're in the area!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place to take a break on a roadtrip. The river lulled me to sleep, great hiking trails just down the road and quick access to Durango. Would be a lovely base to explore more of the area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed the easy access location to trails (right across the road) and to town. The location is nice and quiet and has a beautiful creek flowing right by the cabin. While small, we had no trouble making meals in the cabin when we wished to. The bed was very comfortable. We so appreciate Airbnb's that allow dogs - thank you for that! It worked extremely well for me to take part in the bike races I was there for and my wife to hike with our dog, and access to town was very quick."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute little place! It was perfect for what I needed it for. I would come back and stay 😊 the little kitchen area was cute. I didn’t arrive until almost 1 am since I was driving from out of state and I was able to find the place in the dark since they were kind enough to leave the front porch light on. Thank you!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a great place to stay! Right in Durango but still felt private and in nature. So nice to sleep to the sound of rushing water! Great and cute place that has everything you need for an affordable price.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was such a great location! So close to sailing hawks and turtle lake for bouldering which is what we came for! The shack had everything we needed and Billie and pippy (the dogs) were so cute!!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the cutest place! I had the best time there; it’s so beautiful right by a stream and I wish I could have stayed longer! It’s perfect for one or two people traveling through Durango.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Enchanted spot
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful little oasis.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great little cabin by the stream. it's next to the owners house but still feels secluded and peaceful. just keep in mind that it is a small cabin.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The exterior looks very rustic in the photos but the interior is very clean and cozy. Somehow, in that small space is a full usable kitchen and bathroom and comfy large bed and a small table with two chairs. Loved the creek right behind the cabin. Perfect white noise for falling asleep."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,MaeBunnys shack was a great place to stay. I loved that it backed up to a beautiful serene creek. And the dogs on the property were so cute! Bring your own blackout curtains though because the traffic lights up the space like the 4th of July!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a quick weekend in Durango. The listing would appear that the shack is more secluded which is not the case. Building is about 30 ft from the main house and right next to the solar panels. Still a nice quaint stay.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Overall exactly what my partner and I needed for a night stay in Durango. There were helpful sticky notes around the space with helpful information that I appreciated being right there, as opposed to in the Airbnb app inside home instructions/rules. Bonus was the treehouse and being right next to the river. That being said, you can hear the river pretty well from inside as an fyi."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were blown away with how cute and well-thought out this little cabin is. In a great part of town. Really the prettiest place I've seen in ages. I would love to stay there long term! A steal for the price. Thank you!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place convenient to everything Durango has to offer. Will definitely be back and highly recommend.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was another great stay. It was quick, especially with the crazy winter weather coming in. The tiny home was more than cozy in the cold. Great updates, and so comfortable and quiet. Perfect for a quick stop through Durango, hopefully next time we can stay longer. The snow was deep, but we were able to get in and out with zero problems."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The shack was absolutely beautiful and very peaceful. It was very clean and comfortable!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was exactly as described. Cozy, but with all the essentials, and it was the perfect size for two people and a dog for a weekend trip! Finding the driveway can be a little tricky especially in the dark, but the instructions provided were very helpful. The place is only around 7 minutes from downtown Durango. Would happily stay here again next time we are in town!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"MaeBunny is a perfect Durango get away! It’s cozy, has all the amenities you need, and it’s close to some of the best hiking in the San Juan mountains. It’s also just a hop and a skip to downtown, but out of the hustle and bustle."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful experience! The cabin was literally a 5min drive from downtown Durango, but still felt nice and secluded. I stayed here in the middle of winter during multiple snow storms, and the cabin was nice and warm the whole time. My family staying in town were all jealous of how great and cozy my place was, compared to theirs! Definitely recommend staying here."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for hosting us!! The dogs absolutely loved playing in the snow and we very much appreciated the arrangements!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Libby’s place was great. Very clean, cute and with all the conveniences. The location was also perfect - close to downtown Durango but not in the bustle of things. We had a great stay."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This tiny home worked out well for our stay. The location was so convenient
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the perfect Durango stay. Feels like you’re out in the country but you’re just a hop, skip and jump from town. Extremely cozy and outfitted with everything you need for a comfortable stay. We loved that the cabin heats up very quickly when it’s cold. Very well appointed with so many extra touches provided, especially in the kitchen. We will definitely be back. 5 stars all the way."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved the MaeBunny Shack!! It was so cozy and very cutely decorated. They left plenty of detailed instructions and made check in and chexk out easy! I would easily stay here again and recommend to anyone staying in Durango!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place, close to town."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"2nd stay here and there will be a 3rd, 4th, etc. Such a lovely tiny space that makes amazing use of every nook & cranny but does not feel cramped. Clean, comfy and has EVERYTHING you need. Beautiful surroundings in an excellent location. Libby is just an amazing host!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I COMPLETELY LOVED Mae Bunny’s Shack!!!
For such a small space, every inch is well utilized. (Roller storage under bed, solid grab bars by toilet, spaces and hooks to store things…
They thought of everything you’d need!
Beautiful area- comfortable bed"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cute, clean, warm little cabin. It was the perfect respite for us after camping in the rain for a few days. The place was very clean, had all the essentials and nice touches of complementary items. I appreciated that the products were natural and/or organic. We did not get to use the outdoor space as it was raining on our one night, but the area by the creek looked cute. There is a fairly busy road right next to the property but the traffic noise was not bad inside the cabin. The location is great, little outside of the main part of town so quieter but a quick drive to everything Durango has to offer."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful, quiet, and cozy. More than we expected. We will be back again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was an adorable place and she responded immediately about our last minute stay request. Definitely recommend

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The MaeBunny shack was the coziest place I've ever stayed. It was well equipped with everything you might need for cooking, cleaning, and relaxing on a Durango vacation. The location is beautiful and private while remaining a quick drive from town. The MaeBunny shack truly gave us our own private slice of Durango. I am so excited to visit again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The accommodation was very clean and cosy. It is equipped with many features that we didn't use but others would certainly enjoy.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such an adorable little cabin! The bed was cozy, the kitchen was big enough to cook & the outdoor space was so peaceful. We loved how close it was to trails & to town! Thank you for everything."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved staying at Libby’s place. It was quiet and comfortable. The location was amazing, just a few minutes from downtown!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a great spot! I would absolutely stay here again next time I’m in Durango. Super clean and cozy, and conveniently located from town. The kitchen had the basics for cooking a simple meal and the tea and snacks were a nice touch.
Libby was helpful in making sure we could find it after dark, which ended up being easier than expected.
It is pretty close quarters, so it’s definitely best suited for folks that plan to be out and about during the day rather than those who want to spend a lot of time at the cabin, though there is some outdoor space as well."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Maebunny Shack was the cutest little thing and perfect for what we needed. Nice and clean with a ton of amenities. Libby was awesome and responsive. The location is great, everything is fairly close. The shack was overall a wonderful stay and would love to come back again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was really cozy and comfortable. We were so tired after a long day riding the Durango-Silverton train (which I highly recommend!!) We slept well and it was very near the downtown area. It was a great value and I would def stay there again if we are ever back in the area!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cutest little shack and such a convenient location. Loved it!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,was a great stay!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The creative layout made the small space very functional. The natural landscaping around the ""shack"" was lovely, and the creek in the back was a wonderful bonus. I wish I had been able to stay the full time I had booked, but Libby was very accommodating in changing my departure date. Thank you for a nice little place to stay in Durango!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little spot to rest and unwind. Location is close to town and seriously across the street from a network of hiking trails (love that!). The space had everything we needed for our 3 night stay.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sweet little cabin in a great location to town and trails. Clean and comfortable- an added bonus was the creek behind the cabin. Coffee/tea bar and snacks were provided and appreciated. We, and our pups enjoyed everything about our stay. Thanks Libby!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A really great stay!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Magical place! Immaculate - so much appreciated after a journey. Cheerful, comfy and so well stocked with a number of organic and useful items. Nestled in the trees with a backyard stream complete with meditation bench and yet so close to old town Durango - a perfect stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect getaway by a creek.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rustic, simple and comfy are the best words to describe MaeBunny's Shack. So close to town, yet it felt so far away - nicely tucked into the woods. One nice bonus was that the Colorado Trail trailhead was just a short drive up the road - a nice hike with a spectacular view!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Passing through and this worked for what we needed for the night.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I highly enjoyed my stay. The location is close to town and hiking trails. The home is comfortable and clean. Im glad i found this place. I was perfect for me and my fur baby.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"lovely place to stay as always!! second time back, we always have such a comfortable nice time staying in this cozy little airbnb, truly a cozy and comfortable place to stay!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Quick easy quirky responsive and hospitable. Lovely all around.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shack was a little creepy at night, but super cute inside and cleverly laid out (ei shower pod). I appreciated the ease of entry. You can tell a lot of care and thought was put into the amenities and information Libby provides. Stephanie was very responsive and flexible with our check out. Got some great and much needed rest during our short stay :)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, not too far from town. Shower is amazing. Bed slept great. We had the windows open at night with the fan going and it was a great temperature. No ac is needed! Kind of a fun funky little place to stay. We enjoyed it!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Libby’s place was great! It was a perfect place to settle in Durango.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot. Close to town. Clean and had all necessary amenities
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place! Perfect for single or a couple on travel. Close to trails, downtown and hot springs."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a cute little place. Perfect for my husband and I and our 2 dogs. Everything we needed for a 4 day getaway.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful location! My pup enjoyed running around in the creek and around the shack. Plenty of room for two travelers that just need a place to sleep. If we weren’t sleeping though, we were outside listening to the creek or sitting at the table/bench. Great space outside to relax. We even saw some deer down by the creek during our stay! We will definitely be back! Always a plus when we find a listing that is pet friendly. Thank you, Libby!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing spot for 2 and a dog. Bed is amazing!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was perfect for us! Will come back next time!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute little getaway outside of town that I'd recommend if you are looking for a place to crash. But it surprisingly has a large kitchen and other amenities. I wish we had time to explore the nearby hiking trails that I've heard rave reviews about.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Maebunny Shack is a total gem! Libby has put so much heart into the shack that you will not leave! The Maebunny is super clean, has a comfy bed, a small kitchen and bathroom. Don't be fooled by its small size! The Maebunny is a tiny home with everything you could possibly need! The location is 5 minutes from the Colorado Trail, grocery store and restaurants. Downtown Durango is about 10 minutes away."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such a beautiful place to stay. Junction Creek is a special spot in Durango, and the cabin on Libby's property is really a special spot, too! I highly recommend staying here whether you're from out of town, or you live nearby and you need a little getaway."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So quaint and adorable! Clean, thoughtful, and so well decorated and organized. Would highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely fabulous little place! Rustic on the outside and a resort room on the inside. Clean, comfy and stocked with EVERYTHING you could need. Can't wait to come back!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Just as advertised, great suite, close to Durango, and if you have a dog, even better. The house is small, but great for a couple, grill and kitchen super equipped. Super comfortable bed, sweet little slice of heaven! Great host!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,it's so unassuming from the outside but cozy and clean on the inside.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a cute little spot. Well appointed with most things you may have forgotten or may need to have a pleasant stay - tea, sunscreen, etc. down the road from open space and trailheads, adjacent to the creek."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Don’t hesitate just book! Libby’s place was the perfect location for everything we wanted to do in Durango! Close to the fitness center, hiking, restaurants, so much to explore not enough time. Thanks for letting us stay! Look forward to coming back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a slice of heaven. Tiny, cozy and clean, creek in back for dogs to play. Nothing fancy about this house but that is exactly what I loved about it, felt like a cabin! Bed is super comfortable, and everything you need to cook is in kitchen. Bonus is Libby the owner is super inviting and fun, fun to chat with over an evening beer, and her dogs are adorable. Can’t wait to stay here in future!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cozy and welcoming!! 10/10 would stay again!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved Maebunny’s!! Super close to town but still feels in the country. We enjoyed the bbq and dinner by the creek with some adorable K9 visitors!! We would definitely stay there again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place for a good price. about 2 miles from Central Durango, so you could potentially walk from this location if you want to (only about 0.2 miles have no sidewalk). The place has a great outdoor space with a bench and hammock near a stream. The shack makes good use of the small amount of space. There is no AC so it can get a bit warm, but opening the windows helped a lot with airflow."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay in a convenient location!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most comfortable stays at Airbnb that we have had! We loved how our host provided everything we needed during our stay, and also provided snacks. The location is super close to Durango, and worked great for our trip. Don’t be scared of the size, we found that the space have everything that we needed and we actually preferred to the size. We would definitely rebook."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The shack was our favorite option for Durango. The place is small but the land and river sounds make this a real relaxing experience!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cabin just outside of downtown. Everything you need, and nothing more!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved staying at Maebunny shack. I loved the location and the creek behind the property was very nice and calming. As a female solo traveler I felt very safe there. The shack was just enough room for me and my dog. I would definitely stay here again. I really enjoyed my time there.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"For those who are looking for a beautiful, peaceful, rustic setting (secluded, babbling brook behind the ""shack""), fun and quirky (not the typical ""cookie cutter"" sterile hotel room), comfortable with all the amenities we needed (coffee, snacks, plates, kitchen, a Weber BBQ outside, etc.), nicely decorated, WiFi, and plenty of power outlets throughout - this is it. It was just the right size for my wife and I and quite comfortable. I suspect that staying here will be one of the wonderful memories from our trip through Utah and Colorado."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great shack close to downtown
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Libby was a great host. I would highly recommend MaeBunny’s shack.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a fun place - nicest shack I've ever seen! Beautiful location near river - close to road but it did not seem to have a ton of traffic.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"MaeBunny was just as described and perfectly fit our needs for a two night stay while in Durango. The location was great; less than 10 min to main street and a skip away from the Colorado Trail, trailhead!
Communication was just right and check in was easy. The ""shack"" was clean and included several thoughtful amenities.
We greatly appreciated that pets are allowed too.
We will definitely book again if in the area. Five star, thank you!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"the tiny home was super clean, very comfortable and very well equipped. I woud stay there again for sure."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Adorable and quaint little place! It’s small but has everything you need and is located next to a peaceful creek. Bed was super comfortable and my pups loved the space to play outside with Libby’s dog! Close enough to town. Would recommend!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying here! It was perfect distance from town. Very restful and relaxing. During my stay, the creek behind the property was flowing and it made for a lovely environment. I would highly recommend staying here on your trip to the area!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying at Libby’s cabin and once again it was just what we were looking for during our short stay in Durango. Great location close to town but off the beaten path.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Libby's place exceeded our expectations! The sweet little space is used super efficiently, it honestly feels bigger inside. Super easy to find and get to, with a lovely creek on a beautiful piece of land. We only wish we could have stayed one more night. Super worth the price, and we will definitely book again next visit!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great experience! Great location! I loved hiking with my dog on the nearby trails.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you can catch a time when MaeBunny is available, you need to ""hop"" to it!! It's a nature lover's haven, and Libby takes care of the smallest details for your stay. Clean, comfy, cozy and you'll never forget your visit here!!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely space. Well appointed with everything you’ll need for a short or longer stay. The extra touches like coffee, 1/2 and 1/2, and an assortment of books was great. Comfy bed and pillows. Thanks for sharing your space!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved my stay at the shack. It's clean, cozy, the kitchen is well equipped, and the bed is very comfortable. I also loved the serenity of hearing the stream nearby. I would love to stay again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice idea to convert a ""shack"" into a small suite. Space enough for a few night stay and well equipped and new clean bathroom."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an adorable little tiny cottage for one (or for a VERY cozy couple, perhaps). Even though it's in the backyard of the home, it felt very private and the creek was lovely to have as ambient noise. Great location for Durango."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was wonderful! It was exactly what I needed. The location is perfect!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Small is better for some people but this is small.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome place to stay! The place is so cute and has many warm welcoming personal touches! It is small, but well designed and exceptionally clean. Everything we needed and more! The location is perfect if you plan to do anything in Durango. Would reccomend 100%!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We unfortunately had to cancel our trip very last minute due to some life circumstances. While we didn't get to see this awesome spot, Libby was kind and a fast communicator throughout the whole process."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy to find, great location, cute spot!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, cute place. Highly recommend"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute tiny spot that met all our needs for an overnight stay. Easy check in. Close to town. Even closer to hiking trails. Hosts provided coffee, tea and snacks which was thoughtful."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and value. Listening to the creek behind the shack is nice.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was just the best ever.
You’ll just have to try for Your self. Jacqueline is a wonderfull hostess"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was exactly what we expected. The bathroom has been updated to a porta-loo since the listing was created, which was a welcome improvement. If you stay here when it's cold at night just make sure you turn that space heater on asap! I unfortunately waited too long and was uncomfortable for longer than I needed to be. I arrived late at night and my son was already asleep so I didn't get to settle in before putting him in bed, and it was hard for me to find the heater under the circumstance. With that said, I do NOT recommend staying here if you might be arriving late at night. This is ideally a place you want to adapt to before night falls (like when you go camping!). All in all, I appreciated the accomodations and would certainly stay here again."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,In a beautiful location near horses and sweet animals. The yurt was the perfect home base for our inspiring and grounding weekend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We reserved what we wanted and we got everything we hoped for. It was comfortable and exactly what we expected.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here while in Durango. Wasn't expecting a snow storm but stayed nice and toasty inside the yurt. Simple and peaceful. Pretty views, friendly farm cat, would definitely stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jacqueline was so so helpful in everything we needed help with. There was a struggle with the heater at first, and she made it super easy for us to get help and get it working. I later than realized I had left a very important pair of earrings at the yurt. Jacqueline was extremely helpful and took time out of her own day to find the item and returned them to me. Overall a very relaxing and nice stay. 10/10!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at the Yurt after visiting the Hot Springs! It was a pretty easy drive out & we were able to snuggle under the covers to watch the stars before falling fast asleep! The next morning we saw the beautiful mountains out from the field & a group of geese flew overhead when we went out to the bathroom. Jacqueline was so accomodating when we had to change our plans & come in much later than planned! Thank you & if we are ever in the area again, we would love to stay with Jacqueline again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed looking at the stars through the moon roof while laying in bed.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Worth checking out!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The yurt was perfect for a weekend trip. It was warm with the fireplace. It was a good price for what was offered and a beautiful view of the sunset!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing stay. I didn’t mind the cold at all as I’m a hunter. Jacqueline was very upfront and helpful.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is what we expected. I’m glad for the outhouse instead of the compost toilet.
It snowed about 10” so the place was beautiful!
If you go winter dress warm and have 4 wheel drive🤗❄️☃️"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice stay and awesome host. Worked with us and made sure we had everything we needed. Was responsive on short notice. Not a complaint but the picture showed a weird toilet in the yurt so I was worried about that, but turns out they had a really clean outhouse so that was relieving! Great experience!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,good nights rest not far from the airport. plenty of blankets.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, comfortable, warm, homey, and a perfect location for exploring around Durango. Loved that it was pet friendly and especially loved the morning sunrise and evening stargazing views!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really liked the Yurt super cozy and felt like home. I got to stay up watch the stars while doing my bible study and play my guitar. The bathroom situation wasnt ideal for someone with a lot of maintenance like myself but I could do. I kind of felt like glam camping and that was great. Jacquelines' help was perfect no problems at all with her. Would not suggest for a long trip but for a couple days it was perfect!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place and very budget friendly compared with local hotels. My Kayak booking failed to go through, so I booked this one from Airbnb for half the price of that hotel. The place is comfortable and warm enough without heater turned on. The surroundings are beautiful. Jacqueline is very friendly and helpful, and allowed me to eat freely from her apple tree. Uber and DoorDash helped me go around and get food in. A great experience."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Same as photos, a clean place with plenty of parking space"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay the yurt is so unique and also accessible to town and activities.
The porta potty was clean. I just wish there were curtains but other than that I appreciate the great communication & lovely clean place!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,a slice of heaven
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place to stay! I loved the camping feel it had
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,love it here!! awesome yurt!!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"As a host myself and someones whos traveled alot, this is a one of a kind experience. Beautiful farm property with two great hosts. Open and spacious. It is very quiet here so peaceful. The bed is fantastic and the yurt is centrally located to Durango. I hope to stay here again next year!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If it's supposed to be cold, I probably wouldn't stay there, but it's great for warmer temperatures. Great if you have a dog."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This place is pretty well described. Very rustic, but the bed is super comfortable and the linens were definitely fresh & clean. My dog loved the open space. It’s a great place to hang your hat for a night!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Extremely cozy
We’d love to stay again
Thank you for being so welcoming of our dogs"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place for semi-roughing it.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super comfy.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have never stayed in a Yurt. My expectations were exceeded when I saw the location in person and the incredible views. It was an awesome experience. A must stay. I wish I had my son with me that weekend to “Yurt it up” with me. Btw the internet is flawless and the linens are comfy. Jacqueline my host allowed me to feel like the property was all mine. If I had a question she quickly responded but allowed me my privacy. I will book again and look forward to it.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay for anyone looking for a more rustic vacation experience. Listing is as described, so don't expect the most luxurious amenities, but for those that enjoy yurts and simpler living type stays, its a great find. Being only 15 minutes to everything in Durango is also a really nice advantage to have, so if you wanted to add some more social activities to your agenda, it makes a great launching point without being too far away. Would recommend an extra blanket for those visiting in the winter months, but beyond that it lives up to expectations and is a great experience."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I found this to be a good value for a private, quiet stay just minutes from Durango. Make sure to bring extra layers if you stay in the late fall/winter, as it does get chilly in the night."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying at the yurt!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for outdoor activity. PJ's was a wonderful grocery story down the street and close to Hermosa trail system. Miss Pac Man is very addictive btw.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Vita was a wonderful host, always responsive, and very helpful. The cabin is on a property with a few other homes but all are separated and secure. We stayed with our dogs and each home has a dog run, and you can walk them along the fence line by the adjacent property to watch the horses. the views were also beautiful and the proximity to Durango and Purgatory can't be beat."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our time here. Vita was very responsive and had great communication. The space was perfect for a ski trip and we enjoyed getting to bring our dogs with us!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This newly remodeled one-bedroom cabin was nicely decorated, clean, and comfortable. The rustic furniture matched the atmosphere of a mountainous Colorado terrain. The kitchen was very well equipped and easy to navigate. Each cabin on the property had its own dog run, which made it easy to bring a dog(s) as well as lent a very dog-friendly vibe. We came to snowboard and enjoy Purgatory Mountain, less than a half hour away from the cabin. Vita was a very communicative host and made sure the check-in and check-out went smoothly. I forgot something in the cabin when we left and Vita responded immediately to my inquiry. We would return to this cabin rental in the future because it has the perfect combination of ongoing upkeep as well as a responsive host. Shelley"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,nice clean place. great proximity to purgatory and durango.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little cabin. The location was great and the cabin was very clean. Will stay again for sure!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin is niche, cozy and surrounded by beautiful scenery. Vita is prompt, professional and friendly. I will definitely be booking here again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Clean and cozy
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location. Dog Friendly
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The ideal place to stay just outside of Durango. Everything is around 15 minutes away. Great area for our two dogs as well. Loved it👍
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a nice place for a stay. We enjoyed the place, and it worked very well for our dogs. The reason for our trip was a chance to see the Milky Way, which isn't visible anymore in Albuquerque. And boy, did we see a spectacular night sky. Also loved the neighbor Texas Longhorn. Will come again if we're coming to Durango."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My stay was quiet and peaceful. The bed was very comfortable and warm. The entire house was very cozy. I loved it!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Vita was a great host, very responsive and gave great local recommendations. She has a great location and her place was very cozy and clean. We enjoyed our stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was absolutely fantastic!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Vita's place was a great little getaway! Close to the hot springs and had everything we needed.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We came to Durango to see the fall leaves along the Million Dollar Highway. The location was great because it is situated right on the highway with easy access to head to Silverton and Ouray.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,we enjoyed our stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vita’s place is awesome. It’s exactly what is described. There are several other cabins on her property.
But, Lots of space between the cabins for privacy.
Each cabin also has a small fenced area for the fur babies.
Vita is slso super accommodating. I asked if there was a blender in the cabin, Vita responded with , she would put it on my wish list. The day before arrival she let me know she purchased a blender for our use.
We will Definitely be visiting Vita’s place again.
If in Durango check out her cabins."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vita was a great host. We booked the night before Vita let us know as soon as the unit was available. We were delighted with the location as well as the unit itself. It was so charming, cozy and CLEAN! If we head that way again we would definitely book this location."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic place to stay for a couple and one dog! We enjoyed the large patio and easy access to all the fun southwest colorado has to offer. Vita was incredibly responsive and had a great little home.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed this location, and our interactions with Vita, very much. She was absolutely amazing in accommodating us on short notice. We will definitely be back, and plan to bring friends and family, because there are several cabins on the property. We highly recommend Vita and any of her properties."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Vita did a great job communicating with me and was very responsive. The Pac Man game was so much fun. We had a mini tournament. The decor was very appropriate for the location. Deck was very nice.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I took my wife here for her birthday weekend getaway. She loved how peaceful it was. She especially loved the Pacman games!!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was fantastic!! Dog friendly, it had a little enclosed dog run/potty area on the side which was so convenient. Close to downtown Durango and a few local restaurants we visited. The place was clean and had everything we needed. Very responsive host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay in Durango. We loved how the cabin was out of the city area but close enough that you could easily drive to places. It was hot during our stay so the fans helped a lot. We would stay here again.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely amazing place in a very cool location! One of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept in at an Airbnb. Owners were actually there at another cabin while we were staying and gave great recommendations for local spots and hikes. Only thing I would warn is the cabin doesn’t have AC so if you are traveling in the summer it gets really really hot for the afternoon into the night.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Vita was a wonderful host! The cabin was clean, cozy, quiet, and close proximity to hiking, grocery stores, dining, fuel, etc. We (dogs included) really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Great property off the beaten path! Hosts are very friendly and the place was perfect.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is our second time at Vita's cabin. We were pleased with the quiet area it is in on July 4th (no fireworks)! Vita is a very responsive and helpful host. We arrived early and she let us check in before 4 and let us borrow a stock pot when needed. The updated and enlarged deck is very nice for spending the late afternoon and early evening. We recommend this enclave of pet-friendly cabins.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice cabin! A little warm even with all three fans running. During the day, Mid 80s in the house. But mostly not home during the day. Couldn't get the windows on the west side over the dining table open which may have helped with a better breeze. Evenings were cool and quiet. Other than that, all was comfortable and clean. The Internet was spotty but I think the evening before we left they (Spectrum) upgraded the system. But it wasn't that important to us. Even being off a main road, it was pretty quiet. Cute cabin. Perfect for two people and a dog."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A clean cabin in a beautiful area. Everything we needed was provided. We even had a place to park our ATV. The location is close to the train, hot springs, and Alpine Loop. We will definitely return!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great cabin. Vita was in contact with us even before we arrived, letting us know about a wifi outage, which was resolved by the time we got there. The instructions were a little lacking but we eventually figured out which house was ours and how to get in. It should be known that there is a whole network of cabins on this property and parking can be an issue depending on the other units. It’s just a gamble based on the other rentals. Otherwise, the place is fantastically located and the bed is huge and comfy!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cute little cabin and very clean! Vita is a great host - we rented this along with the larger property next door and she was responsive and helpful throughout the process. I even shared with her that we were getting ready for a wedding in the smaller cabin and she had beautiful, fresh-picked flowers from on the property dropped by. So kind and thoughtful."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed my stay. Close to Purgatory and Durango
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay at this place. Good location, close to town and other attractions such as skiing, hiking, etc."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a nice place! Vita was super helpful and wonderful during our stay :) I’d love to stay here again!!! Super nice!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Vita's place is a part of a small network of cabin rentals that is forest-facing and just off the main highway so it was super accessible even in the midst of beautiful spring snow showers. For a weekend getaway, it was exactly where we wanted to be- close to hot springs and Purgatory ski resort, Honeyville, and about a 15 minute drive from North City Market and friends in Durango. PJs Market in Hermosa is also a great place to pick up supplies (or in our case, our friend's birthday cake!). Cabin #3 was so cozy and pet friendly. It would be a family-friendly cabin as well. Great place to cook and sack out watch movies after a day of venturing in the local area. Loved the gas fireplace. It was an epic stay and we will certainly be back for more- her chateau would be great rain or shine!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Vita was incredibly good about communicating and helping us stay in spite of a blizzard. Highly recommend this location.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s a wonderful place to stay! Highly recommend for couples.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for us and our littles. Great location for traveling from Durango to Silverton. The cabin was very clean, the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in and the pillows were AMAZING. Great quality towels too.
It was also well stocked for cooking.
The view of the mountains were great to wake up to as well."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pretty view and quiet considering the Highway is so close. Nice place for a calming vacation. About 20 min drive to to Durango train station, quaint diner for breakfast & lunch is less than 10 min away."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute cabin with rustic charm, a super comfy king size bed, a Roku TV and high speed internet.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! Right next to James Ranch and a few other food restaurants for food. Awesome mountain biking close by and 10 mins from Purgatory Resort. Fast internet.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Vita's cabin was very comfortable and convenient for our weekend in Durango, we'd definitely stay there again!"
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great! NO AC, however. Would have been much better had it had air conditioning. Would not recommend for hot summer months."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay and loved the aesthetic of the little cabin. The kitchen and bathroom have both been remodeled recently and looked/functioned great!
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in this cabin was average. The location is good. Dog run is small but we appreciate them being pet-friendly. Communication with host was excellent. My friend forgot her wallet and they mailed it to us which is very kind. Kitchen was missing some essential items. Overall, we would come back if needed."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay for some quiet getaway appeal plus the convenience of being nearby Durango. Just the right size cabin for 2 people. Clean, cozy, and affordable. Will return again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Well stocked cabin right off of 550. Would stay here again.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,clean. nice cabin in great location

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, just a 12min drive into Durango and less than 20min to the top parking at Purgatory. The cabin had all the the necessities you could need. The turf dog run was fun for our pups! We enjoyed having a fireplace. Communication with Vita was quick and detailed. We plan to come back in the summer!
And it was awesome that someone came and snowplowed the driveway!"
2022-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin itself was really well equipped and clean. We enjoyed the fun arcade game, the smart TV and full kitchen. We did however have an incident with the neighbors on the property. The cabin sits on a lot with a few more airbnbs all managed by the same person. Because of this we ran into limited parking and unfortunately a loud party next door. Although it was not the owners fault I think it might have been nice to know the rest of the properties on site were airbnbs as well and all in close proximity to our Airbnb. If your looking for a more private cabin, I would probably look elsewhere.
The location was great, in Hermosa in between Durango and purgatory ski resort."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great location in between Downtown and Puragtory Ski Resort, and comfortable with our dogs. Wonderful views & an a cozy cabin. Couldn’t have asked for a better getaway place!"
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Only 15min from Purg. Vita was a great host! Easy communication & accommodating with last minute changes.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Vita is great. Excellent communication and accommodating. House was very clean and beautiful.
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute cabin in a great location
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location to visit the area. It was about 15 minutes into Durango. You could see the train to Silverton above the hill. The cabin had everything we needed including a very comfy king bed. Instructions and directions were timely and perfect. Nice place to stay!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"So cozy, we loved the fireplace! And very dog friendly!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cool cabin
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were there in September and the nights were cool and there were fans to use. The bed and pillows were comfortable to sleep on and the sofa was comfy for watching TV or reading. There is a front porch with nice chairs and side patio with a fenced dog run behind the unit. The kitchen has nice dishes and eating utensils. Yes, Route 550 is a little close but it is not too noisy. The other cabins are far enough away that you hardly notice any other guests. Pictures are accurate and communication was excellent. We would stay here again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place in a great location
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was great! So friendly and had everything we needed!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was perfect for our needs. It was clean, simple and well stocked with everything we needed. The dogs enjoyed it too!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was a great place to stay outside of Durango. Quick drive to restaurants and right on the way to complete the Million Dollar Highway drive. Vita was a great host and super communicative. It is also dog friendly!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cute and cozy little cabin that is conveniently located almost halfway between Purgatory Resort and Durango. Super comfy bed! Kitchen is a nice size and is well stocked. Best little added touch was the Pac-Man game in the bedroom. Our little family of three had a nice stay here.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little cabin. Worked well for my small family. Short drive into Durango or up to Purgatory.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This wss was a great place. Just wish the road wasn't so close
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very good basic place. It’s not luxurious, it’s as described. The bed was very comfy and the kitchen has everything you need to make good meals. I would recommend this place as a good bad of operations for the area."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cabin! I used this place as a base camp for the alpine loop, ouray and telluride Colorado. Definitely recommend this place and great access to anything within the San Juan."
2021-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adequate accommodations.. bed was very comfortable. Unfortunately, due to an unusual heat wave, place was very hot and the fans were not very helpful. Owners, however, were easy to reach and very available. Location was close to Durango."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved this great location between Durango and Purgatory. It felt like we were in the country and the cabin had lovely rustic wood furniture. A nice get-away!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place just outside of Durango. Dog/friendly with side yard. Very comfortable bed and nice front porch.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, contemporary cabin feel, friendly hosts!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! The cabin is accurate from the pictures and was very cozy and comforatble for my husband and I ....and our dog. It is close to the road but we really didn't notice any noise and the surroundings are so scenic. It was a perfect spot for exploring Durango and day trip to Silverton. We hope to come back. It was clean and well equiped. We couldn't get the gas fireplace going but there was some electic space radiator heater so it wasn't an issue at all. The check in and out process couldn't be easier. I have no hesitation in recommending. (I think better suited to a couple, might be a bit crowded for a family)."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing spot extremely close to Durango! Would stay here again!!
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"It is a modular house. Big enough for the three of us. Our dog was welcome - huge plus. Owner and agent were very fast to respond - great service. On a slightly negative side - location is ok, but not great. Next to 550 - hear cars passing by if windows are opened. Need to have a car even for a walk - no easy access to river and/or trails. We also thought that it was overpriced a bit. Otherwise it was a good spring break stay."
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay here! The location was perfect as it was pretty much right in between Purgatory Ski Resort and downtown Durango. The cabin was cozy and just the right size for our family of 4. The kids had never seen the old school table arcade before and they though that was “super cool”. Kitchen was pretty well stocked. We couldn’t figure out how to get the fireplace going but we didn’t need it because the space heaters warmed the space well enough. Overall great place and would stay again!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was really great for our family of 4 plus 1 doggo! I feel the need to tell every detail because we enjoyed it so much. First, the communication as outstanding. The day before we arrived, I asked if there was a grill. The property manager said he'd bring one over. There was a new grill waiting for us with grill utensils when we arrived. We were also sent exact coordinations to the house, but found it easily with the address. The house has a small fenced in back years that was perfect for our doggo. There is also what looks to be a garden in the summer that fascinated our 4 and 2 year olds. We'd love to come back when it's warmer and utilize fresh herbs or veggies! the bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. There was a small heater in the bedroom that warmed the space well, as it did get chilly at night! In the living room, there is a fireplace that I assume was gas. Very simple to turn on and off with a remote, and kept the whole cabin toasty. The kitchen was a small and efficient space, with a gas stove (which I love and prefer). We have young kids, so we really appreciated the sturdy and solid furniture, which was a beautiful wood. There were some really great touches in the cabin, including games, like Connect 4, several books, and, my husband's favorite, an arcade game with pac-man, Gallagher, dig out and others. There is also a washing machine that is a washer/dryer combo, which, to this point, I've only seen in Europe and South America. The space was very clean! Even my extremely picky husband commented on how clean it was. There was a locked closet that I assume had cleaning supplies in it, but we didn't have access, so if you want to clean up after yourself, plan to bring some disinfectant wipes. There is a really great deck on the front to enjoy the beautiful mountain scenery. While other houses are close by, the cabin does sit on a quiet back dirt road that was so nice to let the kids run on, and walk Teddy Roosevelt (the dog). As discussed in the description, you are exactly 12 miles to town, and apparently about the same to Purgatory, as the other rental property looked to have winter sporters staying. Easily a 5 star stay. My husband travels to Durango several times a year for work, and this will likely be our go-to whenever it's available!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This AirBnB was amazing! It was clean, well-stocked, the beds were comfortable, had everything my family needed, and the hosts were responsive and helpful.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Overall great stay! Sarah was very quick to respond and be of help. The house glad a beautiful location. We had to keep our dogs on leash because they aren’t the best “minders” and the yard is open. The house is literally right by the Mesa and it is beautiful. The house had everything we needed.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is our second time staying here! We absolutely love the place. The house is beautiful and peaceful but there is still a lot to do for the family. It’s located close enough to town that everything you need is just a short drive but far enough that you get the peace and quiet you’re looking for. Sarah, the host, is very friendly, responsive and helpful. We stayed for my son’s birthday and I mentioned that to her, so there was a birthday gift for him waiting when we got there. :) I’ve never had an air b&b host go above and beyond like that. We hope to stay at her property next time we come back to town. If you’re thinking about booking, do it!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice house with pretty view out back.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night but would of loved to stay more! This place was enchanting. Super clean, great amenities.

Sarah the host was very responsive and sweet. I'd recommend it to anyone visiting Durango."

Thanks!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a blast staying in this hidden gem! There were never ending activities to get into after long days of being outdoors - we soaked in the hot tub and played games all night long! Sarah keeps the place spotless, cozy, and is great with communication. Check in/out were both easy, and Sarah left very helpful tips all around the house (directions for use, labels, location of items, etc.)"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was like a home away from home. The place was big and very well put together.

Sarah and family responded quick answering questions and making us feel comfortable during our stay. We were very pleased with our stay and will be booking again hopefully soon.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sarah’s place was an awesome experience for the whole family! Everything was perfect from beginning to end. I can’t say enough about Sarah’s effort to make our kids stay exciting and memorable. ie the scavenger hunt and snowball fights! I personally have not had that good of a workout in a while after my kids found the snowballs! All the amenities we were able to enjoy were awesome on the day we did not ski. Whether it was the foosball table, hot tub, board games, the outdoor fire pit, cooking in the well equipped kitchen or the many selections on the television, we were ALL entertained!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I’d give ten stars if I could! Sarah was so responsive, welcoming and kind. The treasure hunt for the kids was such a perfect touch! Sarah helped us when we had an unexpected hiccup and had to check in quite late - the heat and lights were on, home was exactly as described. The lights in the Polar Express room were also a fun touch! Close to anything you’d want to do, but still felt like our own private getaway. Anything you need is already there, and instructions are clearly marked so we didn’t have to “figure anything out.” And who doesn’t love a nice warm (CLEAN) hot tub!! I sincerely hope we can come again, Sarah and her family are top notch - don’t hesitate to rent anything from them!!! Thank you Sarah, from the bottom of our hearts!!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect spot not far from town. Super peaceful and beautiful. Loved the game room and all amenities! Oh and the scavenger hunt that was set up was absolutely amazing and my kids loved it!!

It had everything we needed- lots of fun stuff for our kids, great running space for our dogs, and beautiful views! We enjoyed using the hot tub while it snowed and my girls had fun sledding and playing, we look forward to coming back over the summer, great space regardless of weather. Sarah and her family were so warm and friendly, very responsive and helpful. There were lots of great touches like a scavenger hunt for the kids and chickens to feed, and they even shoveled the driveway for us which was greatly appreciated. We will be back for sure, highly recommend!"

If we decide to stay in Durango again we will definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was wonderful. The house was comfortable and roomy. Sarah’s recommendations led us to the best meal we have had (Primus) and a beautiful trail I had not found on the AllTrails app. We were close enough to town while still having the privacy and space of living outside of town. Perfect stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Sarah’s place! The location is beautiful and the house was exactly what we needed. We especially loved the views, the red cliffs behind the property, the hot tub, and the ping pong table!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay at the Woodshed was so relaxing. Our kids loved the amenities. My wife really appreciated the thoughtful details—the host set up a wonderful coffee bar and had coffee creamer and eggs in the refrigerator. Our dogs also had welcome treats. The beds were comfortable and the outdoor patio was a great gathering place to eat and relax. We’ll definitely be back.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sarah was a great host. Short drive into town but far enough out of town to be peaceful. We could hear an elk bugling after dark. We were too tired to enjoy the fire pit but did enjoy the hot tub. Would stay again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was amazing stay. For sure we will visiting this place again.
Thank you Sarah."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Sarah is a wonderful host and sets the bar high! This is our second time staying in this home and Sarah went above and beyond in making us feel right at home. Definitely recommend this spot in Durango and will be back to visit again soon!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful property! Great area. Close to town yet private. If you get the chance to stay here, book it and don’t second guess. You probably won’t find a place this unique and comfortable for this price."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay! We enjoyed the beautiful views, the games and location. The house was very clean and the beds were comfortable."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was very beautiful & cozy, had very great views of the mountains! It was so amazing to be able to hear the train in the morning. Would definitely book here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,the place is bigger than it looks in the pictures! we walked in and instantly felt right at home. she accommodated my needs from a doggy bed to a highchair for my little one. the hot tub was a great way to relax after a long day of travel. my family and I would love to stay here next time we come to Durango. this spot is such a gem
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Awesome place for a smaller party. Great layout. Nice people! Lots to do, we had a lot of fun playing ping pong and enjoying the hot tub. Thanks!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Sarah was very helpful and responsive before and during our stay. She also provided recommendations for us.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,The Woodshop is a beautiful location and lovely home. We enjoyed out stay-wish we could've stayed longer there was so much to do.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, private setting! House was equipped with everything we needed. The host went the extra mile to make you feel welcome!! Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place with friendly hosts that made us feel like we where old friends.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love the spot! Close to town, far enough away to enjoy the quiet!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,a wonderful place to stay while in town
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, cozy, beautiful rental. We had everything we needed and more. Loved the view and enjoyed coffee on the back patio overlooking the red cliffs. The fire pit and hot tub were wonderful to enjoy in the evenings. Host provided tons of local recommendations and could not have had a better vacation."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A beautiful home with a great outdoor space! Lots of personal touches. Will definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This rental exceeded our expectations. The property was great and very quiet, but it’s only about 10 minutes from town so you still have easy access to all the activities.
The hot tub was great, and Sarah left a small welcome basket for our arrival.
Would definitely stay here again if we find ourselves in Durango."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great week with our 3 granddaughters in Durango at Sarah’s Woodshed. The place is very welcoming with several personal touches like complimentary refreshments with frosty mugs, which were greatly appreciated in the current heat wave! Also, the scavenger hunt was a great way for the girls to acquaint themselves with the house and blow off some steam after two travel days. We hope to come back in the future! The seven year old suggested I give a 10 star rating."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our family had a fantastic time at Sarah's Woodshop! Upon arrival, the kids were thrilled with a fun scavenger hunt, leading to a sweet surprise. We also received a thoughtful welcome basket filled with local chocolates and tea. The refrigerator was stocked with cold local beer, and the bathrooms had high-quality toiletries. Sarah even provided amenities for our fur baby, Max. The place had everything we needed, including a hot tub, games, foosball, cornhole, and a large TV with DVDs. Although we didn't use the ping pong table, the fire pit was perfect for roasting marshmallows and making S’mores (even during a heatwave). Downtown Durango was a short drive away, offering even more activities. It was a perfect retreat for our entire family, thanks to Sarah's exceptional hospitality and attention to detail."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house was huge and had everything we needed. It’s close enough to Durango that the drive into town is easy but also the drive to Purgatory is a little closer than if you stayed in downtown Durango. The metal bunk beds were super sturdy and didn’t make a lot of noise like some metal beds do. We came in July and the AC units upstairs really helped in the afternoons to beat the heat but we turned them off when we slept and it was great! The downstairs stayed really cool despite the heat and we loved the back porch! My kids loved the scavenger hunt clues! Thanks for the chocolate, fresh eggs and beer. We would stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a lovely place! We will be looking to stay here more often. Sarah was very pleasant and prompt. Plenty of room for family entertaining as well!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place. Feels like you’re in the country but your 10 minutes from town.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Sarah’s place in Durango was awesome! She was very flexible regarding pets which I’m sure guests really appreciate so you don’t have to pay an extreme amount for daycare and we loved having our doggos with us! We were worried about the weather and it almost made us cancel our trip, but Sarah was helpful in sharing what was going on in the local area and sharing her expertise on fire hazards and safety since she is used to living in the mountains. We appreciate her hospitality!!
Also - the games at the house were awesome and location was perfect, you’re only a 10-min drive into town :)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stunning views is right! You feel welcome right away, Sarah left friendly messages on dry erase boards by the front door and one near the kitchen. First of all the place was spotless inside, very orderly with plenty of room. The kitchen is finely updated and Sarah left us a welcome basket with snacks from local businesses, which we found to be really cool. We especially enjoyed the loose leaf tea. Also, thoughtfully, there were bottled waters for us which are very much needed when traveling to higher altitudes. The spacious deck off the back of the house has a neatly landscaped lighted pathway that leads to a hot tub. We soaked after dark and the star viewing was other worldly. The fire pit has an amazing back drop that made us feel we were far from any city. The king size bed in the main bedroom is extremely comfortable and the high thread count sheets were a nice touch, we slept like babies. Sarah came to say hello and was very friendly to us and our mini schnauzer."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sarah’s place was just what we were looking for. Peaceful and private, right next to the cliffside. Sarah and family were wonderful hosts and their home was well equipped with all the necessities. They live right next door and were extremely hospitable and kind. Sarah created a scavenger hunt for my kids upon our arrival and left local treats for us. Highly recommend staying here!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay in Durango! The house was in an awesome location -- close to town but it felt secluded and peaceful. It also had amazing views of the red cliffs behind the house! We were pleasantly surprised to arrive to a fridge stocked with farm fresh eggs, beers and local chocolate! Sarah was a great host, super friendly and gave us lots of local recommendations :) Would definitely stay at this place again and recommend to friends/family!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was, by far, the best Airbnb experience I've ever had! My girlfriend and I decided to take a last-minute trip to Durango, and VERY fortunately stumbled upon Sarah's listing. After a long day of driving, we easily found the residence and followed really clear instructions (posted throughout the house) to get settled in. We immediately fell in love with the rustic surroundings and the spacious first floor (there were only two of us, but we want to bring kids back soon...PLENTY of room!), but the best part was upstairs.
We were greeted with a handwritten note from Sarah along with local tea, soap, beer, and chocolate, not to mention four eggs laid by the family's chickens! We loved every second of our stay, but the highlights were definitely the hot tub and the incredible firepit area where we had the unique pleasure of getting to know our hosts under a gorgeous night sky and around a warm fire. I could go on, but I'm out of space, so I'll end with this...thank you, Sarah!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! What a lovely house and area. Sarah was a wonderful host and easy to communicate with. We were here for a girls trip and loved the extra touches, fire pit and roasting sticks for s’mores. The corn hole and hot tub are great for outdoor time. We will be back, clean cozy and homey!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I celebrated our 33rd wedding anniversary! The place was beautiful and peaceful! Everything we were looking for. Our hostess Sarah was so friendly. She made us feel very welcome.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! Wonderful home base for all of our activities in Durango . Sarah had a fun scavenger hunt for the kids and made us feel at home.
Would return again!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The property was lovely. The farm fresh eggs, local tea and soap were lovely touches.
If for the road noise, I would have given the property five stars. The back deck is lovely but you should know that you share the property with the owners home. The two acre description is mainly behind the property and does not feel as private as I would have liked given the proximity to the main house. Sarah was lovely, and we enjoyed getting to know her and family and dog."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah is a great host. She welcome us into her beautiful home. I wish we could stay longer.
The house had everything we needed. The beds are super comfortable. Amazing time.
I will recommend her."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great space would stay agin, really liked the personal local touches throughout the space."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was one of our very favorite Airbnb’s. Sarah and family were friendly and responsive. The amenities are top notch. We especially loved the hot tub and fire pit. The place was spotless and very roomy. Thank you for the personal touches as well :) A welcome basket with local goodies and the local cold brews with frosty mugs were very much appreciated. Would definitely recommend this place. Thank you for a great stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah and her family are awesome hosts they really made me and my babies at home. Sarah even took the time to do a little treasure hunt for my boys with many clues to keep us going. Beautiful home very cozy and loved the view of the mountains. Sarah went above and beyond my expectations, my little ones even got to feed the chickens they had a blast will definitely be back. Thank you Sarah and your family for a beautiful weekend getaway ❤️"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay very much. Plenty of room, house exactly as advertised. Sarah was extremely informative and responsive. We frequent Durango and will look to this house again on our next trip. Would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in that area."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great space in amazing location. Well equiped home away from home with plenty of space and a great outdoor area. Hot tub was a huge plus. Loved staying here.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I were graciously greeted by Sarah and a very clean and accommodating house. She had everything in order with a few tasty bits available from local shops. I wish we had more time to stay, and look forward to staying in her house again.
Excellent stay!
Scott"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place! We only had two people for the weekend, but man you could really fit quite a few people and it wouldn't feel cramped at all! I loved the area, it was so so pretty. We really enjoyed the hot tub and the overall feel of the place! It had everything we needed for the weekend, we had so much fun! =] Will certainly stay here again next time I'm in Durango!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay it was clean and the location wasn’t too far away from Durango. Loved the hot tub and Sarah was very helpful!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay. Really enjoyed the views and proximity to town and ski areas.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah was a wonderful host! She provided clear communication before and during the stay. She also left a lovely welcome basket that made us feel so special!
The home was a wonderful retreat for a group of six friends. There was plenty of space for all of us, and ample amenities too. My favorite part was sleeping there - so quiet, and the beds and pillows were very comfortable!
We did a bit of home cooking and found the kitchen well stocked with ingredients and all the utensils, pans, bowls, etc. that we needed.
This is a great space in a great town. I would love to visit again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place with everything we needed. We loved the hot tub and all the local goodies at check in. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our best airbnb experience ever. Worth every penny. Sarah tries so hard, her property is beautiful and I was amazed how clean and organized it is. Her family that lives nearby is just lovely. The red rock in the back yard is pretty. I was surprised how quiet it considering it was next to a road.
We felt like we stepped into her family's lives and am very impressed with what respectable people they are."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Peaceful location situated between Purgatory and downtown. Loved the hot tub and Sarah’s personal, local touches! Great communicator, too! Perfect ski getaway!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We just returned home from staying at the Woodshop. We enjoyed our time there very much. The location is great! Right outside of town so it’s very peaceful, but still close enough to everything within a short drive. The house and location is even more beautiful in person. We had 3 adults and 2 teens stay and the space was great for us. The hot tub had beautiful views and the house had everything we needed. We plan to stay here again next year! If you’re thinking of booking, do it. You won’t be disappointed"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Woodshop was exactly what we were looking for and Sarah was super great with everything. The place is well maintained and cared for. We can’t wait to go back.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful town, gorgeous home, and backyard. We choose this location, as the host was pet friendly. The host and the home exceeded our expectations. Dog bowls, treats, plenty of room to explore and enjoy the outdoors. Location was great! 5 min from hot springs, 10mins from town and 25 from the ski resort.
The host provided great recommendations, we loved El Moro. The home was furnished with all you’d need and more.. from bidets in every bathroom, to farm fresh eggs in the fridge.
We enjoyed our time and the attention to detail from check-in to check-out."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay at Sarah’s place. We came for a mini vacation to ski a couple days and our stay was perfect. Being able to take a dip in the hot tub after hitting the slopes was the cherry on top. We brought our dogs and Sarah was extremely accommodating to ensure they were happy too! The location is great, not too far from town and about 30 min from Purgatory. Overall I’d highly recommend and would stay again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was amazing! we had a great time! Thank you! Definitely recommend!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay very much.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Sarah was always very responsive to our needs and very attentive.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place! Beautiful area. Close to town. Very welcoming hosts!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and beautiful view
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place absolutely exceeded our expectations and Sarah is an outstanding host. Cold beer and iced mug waiting when we arrived was such a cool touch along with other goodies and extras. The home is far enough out of town it feels like the cabin experience but close enough to order a late night DoorDash snack! Will definitely stay here again and recommend anyone visiting Durango check it out. Thanks Sarah!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We visit Durango 2 -4 times a year, as we’re just a few hours drive. We’ve now found our favorite spot. The red cliffs are breathtaking. The hot tub is kept hot and sanitary. The MOST AMAZING fire pit I’ve ever experienced!
Our family had a winter wonderland adventure. The weather created some obstacles, which Sarah handled with true dedication and care for our family.
Sarah goes above and beyond with inviting treats for the young and grown. The kids sled right in the back yard off the beautiful deck. Our daughter has an incredible memory for her 13th birthday. Thank you Sarah."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, clean. Best host ever. Sarah had a lot of local recommendations. Would 100% stay again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Hot tub in backyard makes this place great. Pictures match description, easy drive to downtown and purgatory."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have stayed at a lot of Airbnb's. Sarah's place is tied with a beach house for my absolute favorite stay. I would give her 6 stars if I could. The location is beautiful and private but still close to downtown Durango and Purgatory ski resort. The house was spotless, modern, fun, and super comfortable. As a host Sarah went above and beyond. She communicated clearly and was extremely thoughtful and kind. I highly recommend this Airbnb and I will absolutely book with Sarah again in the future."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was perfect for my family of 6 to vacation. We came to ski and the location was the perfect distance between the mountain and town. It isn't he best of both worlds. Sarah was the most amazing host we have ever had. She was very attentive and left a sweet surprise for my kids. The house was a great size for us. The bunk room worked out great and my kids loved the chickens outside and fresh eggs. The beds were very comfy too. The driveway is a bit slippery and steep in the ice/snow so our 4x4 really helped. All in all we would definitely return.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home with all the needed amenities.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow what an amazing host and home! Sarah made us feel right at home and was super welcoming! I was disappointed that we only booked one day and wished we would have booked more days at her home! I won’t give away all of her nice surprises and how she makes you feel so welcome but one thing we loved was the fresh farm eggs! The foosball table was a hit for the kids and there was this hideaway that they loved too! Plenty of games to choose from for a great family night! The home decor is nice and home is very clean! Sarah when we come back we will definitely be booking your home again! Thanks again and do not hesitate on booking, highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home was a great deal. very comfortable and homely with all the necessities. The outdoors were great for a trail walk and climb. Then you can relax at the Hot tub while grilling some steaks on the gas grill. Picture perfect outdoors and indoors. there was no need to go anywhere else. We didnt want to leave but next time will book longer! We highly recommend this getaway location that Sarah has to offer.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"treasure hunt was perfect for my 8yr old kid, lovely place with wonderful mountain view. Will definitely be back.
Sarah also gave us a warm welcome."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Sarah was a great host! From the beginning she made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. She had many charming touches for our children and for us adults. The home was in a gorgeous location close to town. We loved our stay!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a gem! Sarah did such a wonderful job of making us feel instantly at home. She had a fun treasure hunt waiting for the kids when we arrived, plus cold local beers for the adults. The kids never wanted to leave: They played foosball the whole time and watched movies. The jacuzzi is private and close to the deck, and the views are spectacular. We roasted marshmallows and made s’mores, and when it was time to leave, my 10 yo (celebrating his birthday) said it was the best birthday ever. We had a lovely time."
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome stay in Durango! Perfect location just outside of town. We loved the hot tub and the fooseball table. Perfect stargazing location on clear nights and perfect for a quick getaway. Would definitely stay here again next time I’m in Durango.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay! Sarah was kind enough to have a treasure hunt for the kids, which the kids loved. It was nice to use the hot tub and have the view of the red mountains. It was so peaceful and relaxing. I would definitely love to stay at her home again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazingly beautiful property. Perfect for our reunion. the scenery is breath taking yet still close enough to town to grab a bite or go to the stores. We enjoyed the gifts from the local shops that sarah and family so graciously provided.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love this place! Very romantic for a getaway. Sarah is an excellent host and the space is very accommodating!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great home, very convenient location that has some amazing views of the cliffs.
Fire pit area and hot tub are great to relax after a big day of climbing!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This property was awesome and a perfect place to stay with family. We had a 3-year-old with us, and he was able to navigate the property inside and out without any issues. We had plans in Durango and it was so close to everything, but far enough away so you felt like you were in the country. The house was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed and then some. Next time we will stay longer to enjoy all the amenities this property has to offer. Sarah was an amazing host. I would definitely stay there again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,loved it here. Sarah is great and made us feel comfortable after a long drive. Firefighters love beer 🤘🏼 thank you again Sarah!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, excellent communication with host."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sarah was great! The place was exactly what we were hoping for. In a quiet area but still very close to Durango
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place, amazing people! The perfect get away. Hands down the best experience I have had at an Airbnb by far! Close enough to town and yet perfectly far away to be quite and relaxing. Sarah and her husband are so great. Such a great place to bring the kids."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pleasant location - thoughtful host.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a perfect location to access Durango, and all of its surrounding attractions. I would recommend it to anyone. The frostiest mugs were a bonus."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very great place to stay!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnB is fantastic! Don’t hesitate to book it or it will be taken! Sarah is a super responsive host. She even left us farm fresh eggs and a basket of local goodies for our stay. The location is close enough to town to take in all of the great restaurants and shops and a great, quiet place to relax after a full day of fun! The star gazing was amazing! We will definitely return to this beautiful place!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home and area is beautiful and clean. Sarah goes above and beyond in her welcome package and communication. We would stay here again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome VRBO for families with kids!! Love the location…it was stunning. Highly recommended
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend this place! Sarah was super easy to communicate with, gave detailed check in instructions, and left my group a few gifts for our stay! The property is beautiful, quiet, and peaceful, yet minutes to downtown Durango. The hot tub was perfect to relax in and Sarah was even nice enough to provide firewood during my stay. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Durango area!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah’s place is very clean, spacious, with lots of fun things to do- tv, games, books, puzzles - you name it she’s got it!
The home is very easy to find. Check in was a breeze.
Near town - just out enough to get a quiet night in the hot tub and star gaze!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loved our 3 night stay. Sarah was very welcoming and accommodating our whole stay. There was plenty of room for 5 biking ladies and all of our bags. The deck was relaxing, hot tub was perfect after a day of biking, and the beds were comfortable. The kitchen was a great size for us to cook and gather for girl talk and enjoyment."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Cute neighborhood with easy access to town. Clean and comfortable for large family. Sarah is just across the street. She is very helpful and kind hostess❣️ We do recommend this Airbnb💚
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah and her place are amazing. The house is so clean and comfortable. The yard and views are totally beautiful. We had a wonderful soak in the hot tub and had our coffee on the back patio while looking at the absolutely beautiful views, even got to hear Sarah’s chickens chatting in the background. I really do believe that Sarah’s place is definitely on my favorite list. Would LOVE to stay there again. Thanks Sarah!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Look no further - this is 100% where you want to stay. Sarah was the best host and went above and beyond to welcome her guests (beer in the fridge, local goodies, and even a personal handwritten note!) She and her husband were also gracious enough to give us hiking recommendations for the area we were going to and were super accommodating with some extra needs we had.
It's the perfect distance from town where you feel remote but are close enough to get anywhere, has designated workspace for remote workers, has a really nice open layout, and the best part - the outdoor area is incredible between the patio / hot tub / bonfire pit / views. Loved our stay here!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is even better than the picture’s and much bigger than it looks! Sarah was right there to greet us and even left little gifts with a personable card. We felt right home! The view was stunning and our trip was much better than we expected and Sarah played a huge role in that. She knew all the fun hotspots to go in the area and led us to some amazing places. Probably the best family vacation we’ve had and it definitely wouldn’t have been so awesome without Sarah’s help and guidance! If your planning on staying in Durango I would definitely choose this place!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed only for one night. We arrived later than expected, and Sarah reached out to make sure everything was ok. She was a great host. She gave her guests a glimpse of what Durango had to offer while supporting local vendors at the same time. Thank you for your hospitality, Sarah. The little gestures did make us feel more at home at your place."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect location and great host! Sarah is very responsive and thinks of little thoughtful gifts for the entire family to make the stay memorable. Downtown is a short drive but at this location you dont want to go into town. Home was clean and extra linens. Very thoughtful and descriptive instructions on everything to use in the home. The home is situated against beautiful red cliffs that truly make the property one of a kind. Due to the rain we were only able to use the firepit one night but so glad we got to. They definitely had a creative side in this design. The home has plenty of room for many guest or just 1 family. The first level of stairs is a bit tricky but my 3 and 1 year old managed without a hand rail just fine. The house was clean and very airy to enjoy the mountain air.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property. Sarah was awesome. Everything we needed to cook meals including propane, utensils, cookware, spices and condiments. Extra local amenities were very nice. Thanks for the eggs. Would definitely stay here again next time we’re in the area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay here. It’s a nice distance from town but not too far. It was a comfortable place to stay and convenient. The main level is the living room, a full bathroom, laundry room, and the guest room that has the bunk beds. The upper level is the master bedroom, master bathroom, dining, kitchen, and exit to the patio where you can grill, eat, have a fire and hot tub. I totally recommend this place unless you have someone in your party that cannot do stairs. The kitchen has many utensils etc if you plan on cooking. Nice size fridge and pantry too."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Really great spot for the weekend. The Woodshop has everything we needed and more. Sarah was very helpful and prompt in all communication.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A clean house in a great location. The cliffs behind the house make for a beautiful backdrop for relaxing after a good hike or bike ride. Sarah was a great communicator and left sweet little touches that made us feel very welcome.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location is beautiful, and the house was cozy and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family of 4 loved staying in Sarah’s home. The neighborhood and view are gorgeous. We drank coffee every morning on the deck and admired the mountains. My girls thought having a foosball table in their bedroom was the best! There was more than enough room for us. Comfortable beds, nice towels, stocked kitchen, amazing views! We would definitely book again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was great. Worth the trip.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice house, great location, wonderful host!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"From the time we booked to the time we checked out, Sarah was amazing. The property is situated just north of Durango along a scenic stretch of mountain meadow road. We enjoyed the ease of access to town and the areas destinations. We had a party of two adults and five kids. The sleeping arrangements were a perfect fit and the kids loved the bunk room. Sarah keeps the property clean and inviting. Would definitely stay here again on a future trip!"
2022-07-01,3.0,Group trip,"Great location. Nice people.
Too hot with only one air conditioner. Too many bugs."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If all Airbnb’s were like Sarah’s, I would never stay at another hotel in my life. I was actually about to book something half the price as Sarah’s place, but saw her listing right before I booked and her reviews made me adjust our budget so we could experience her place. I’m so glad we did. It was sooooo worth the solitude and beauty for her location. From the hot tub, you have beautiful red rock views from one angle, and beautiful green Mountain Views from the other angle. Usually when I’m on vacation, we wake up and are immediately out the door to explore, but I found myself wanting to linger at the property, making breakfast with the farm-fresh eggs, and just relax on the porch for a bit while the kids explored on the red rocks. We ended up wishing we could add on an extra night!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I'll save you time and make a list of reasons NOT to stay at Sarah's place:
1.
And that's a wrap. Great spot. Incredible attentiveness. You can be everywhere without putting up with anything. Quick trips to traipse around town, to stumble over to Trimble, or zip up the hill for countless Coal Bank adventures. Or just hide out in the Woodshop in quiet mountain town comfort."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sarah was an amazing host ! This house is great for families and great location! So many extras and fully stocked so you don’t have to go to store as soon as you arrive ! Loved the extras for the kids, she was very accommodating and gave us lots of info on the area
Kids loved the chickens that are right next door and enjoyed the outdoor games
Durango is beautiful and it’s only an hour from silverton so this is great place to stay if you are coming from low altitude so you can sleep at lower altitudes then head into the mountains"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location of this home is great— a bit out of town with great landscapes and views, but close enough to grab dinner or coffee out. Sarah is a wonderfully gracious hostess and left many local goodies for us to enjoy. All around, a very nice place to stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing last minute find!! I cannot recommend this place enough!!! it's a must if you're visiting Durango. Nestled away from the main town but just close enough! exceeded expectations from the pictures & reviews. I loved the short stay & I'll definitely be back :) What are you waiting for? Book it!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the best Airbnb we have stayed at in the Durango area. Complimentary Fresh eggs, local goodies like tea, beer, root beer, soap and chocolate (and a scavenger hunt😊) started our trip off amazing! This property has the perfect location less than 15 min from town but with all the perks of the quite with an amazing view. This is the perfect place for a relaxing vacation. We enjoyed hiking right outside the back door, ping pong, cornhole, foosball, roasting marshmallows and of course the hot tub. You won’t be disappointed. Sarah is a wonderful host!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect spot! We got super lucky finding Sarah’s place last minute - so grateful we did! After sleeping in the comfy king bed and making breakfast in the morning in the well stocked kitchen, we stepped out onto the deck to gaze at the red rock cliffs and just said, “Ahhhh…”
Although minutes from town, it has the feeling of being away from it all. The hot tub is nice and hot and we really enjoyed spending time on the deck.
Great as a couple’s getaway and great for families, you won’t be disappointed staying here! Sarah provided some lovely touches like local goodies and recommendations. If I could give 6 stars I would."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wowzer! This place is amazing. We got to see deer our first night. The hot tub, games, nice deck off the back, location, and pantry with extras was just what my guy and I needed. Sarah kept in communication to make sure our visit was good. I personally loved the chickens too. I will defiantly come back here and stay again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This host went above and beyond! Amazing home, property, location! Highly recommend this home for your stay!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"An authentic Southern Colorado experience. Private and beautiful. It was more than we expected. Sarah was a gracious host and the apartment served as an ideal home base for exploring Durango, Mesa Verde and Canyons of the Ancients."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was a perfect spot for exploring Durango, Purgatory, and all of the wonderful areas around the San Luis Valley. We enjoyed the hot tub each night and built a fire almost every night. Sarah provided lots of extras which made our stay special."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Beautiful home and wonderful host.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location central to the town of Durango and only a short drive to the mountain.
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place! Would 100% stay again
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"overall, this is a great place to stay at. no major complaints whatsoever. At one point, there was an item that needed immediate attention and the host was pretty responsive and took care of it right away. The house itself had everything we needed. I really liked the fact that the pantry already came with some leftover items such as ketchup, cooking spices and cooking oil, this made cooking handy (as I had forgotten to buy these). I loved the location of this place, close enough to downtown durang, like 10 or 15 min but far away to get the feeling of the countryside. I was really comfortable asking the host for recommendations or any tourist question icould think of. I would definitely stay here again. thanks for hosting us."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was so wonderful and Sarah was an amazing host! I would recommend to anyone looking for a perfect stay on Durango!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We can echo other reviews, Sarah was a very generous and very responsive host! The property was beautiful and the location was great!!! She is very thorough and thoughtful! So many special touches makes the stay seem even more special! Everything about our trip was lovely and smooth, partly due to Sarah’s help with suggestions and answering so many questions about Durango!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The space is warm and inviting, and our big family had plenty of room!! We are ready to come back!!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The place was clean and Sarah was friendly, helpful and responsive. A lot of extra nice touches which we appreciated and things were as described. Would definitely recommend."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an excellent stay especially if you have kids. Sarah was a wonderful host and went out of her way to ensure our infant and toddler were well taken care of. It is in the perfect location, not in the hustle and bustle of downtown, but not far from town and not far from Purgatory. Highly recommend. Plus there were a bunch of bonuses like beer in the fridge and mugs in the freezer. 10/10"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A lovely spot, with easy access to downtown Durango, and Purgatory. Sarah provides excellent communication, adds thoughtful touches (like a creative, fun scavenger hunt for kiddos, local handmade soaps, and adult beverages for the big kids), and has great suggestions for in and around Durango. Comfortable bed, well stocked kitchen, and the hot tub is a luxurious bonus!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sarah our host is absolutely a SUPER HOST!! She was very communicative throughout the whole process of booking, during our stay and after check out. Our stay started off with a cute scavenger hunt for the kids and a complementary s’mores kit, tea and chocolate from local stores. Sarah’s husband personally woke up each morning and shoveled snow off the drive way and scrapped ice off our cars for us knowing that we had plans to go out on the town during our stay! BBQ propane was out when we were there but they quickly came to ensure we had what we need. We love how clean, organized, and comforting the home was. The home is certainly fully stocked with supplies and responsive communication was very much appreciated! I love how clean and organized the home was. Views from the home was impeccable and heating throughout kept the home warm for us. We definitely would return again :)."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful home close to downtown Durango, and about 30 min from Purgatory. The house was really nice, the views were beautiful & Sarah is a great host! I’d recommend renting a car as Ubers and cabs are really hard to come by. But the place is amazing!!! Highly recommend."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beyond our expectations!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My wife, 10 year old son & I stayed at Sarah's place & absolutely loved it. The hot tub was great, the kitchen was great, the family foosball tournament was great. Durango was the perfect winter vacation for us & Sarah's place couldn't have suited us better."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy cabin was the perfect place to stay while visiting Durango. Minutes from town but quiet and tranquil, everything was clean and welcoming for our stay. Excellent communication from Sarah, and some great recommendations on things do to! We will definitely be back next time we come to Durango."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and considerate. Enjoyed the stars and the quiet.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was by far one of our favorite Airbnb’s! The house was clean, and well furnished the home gave everyone the space they needed to feel at home! The view was amazing in the mountains & close to town!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved this house! Awesome location, great hikes nearby, Stargazing from the hot tub and close to downtown. Sarah was very helpful with suggestions and quick to communicate. We also loved getting fresh eggs from Sarah’s chickens. Thanks for an awesome stay!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a perfect get away. Just close enough to town, but just far enough away to be alone. Very close to the airport as we flew in at midnight and had no problem finding the place. Sarah your host, will have the light on and the house heated before you arrive if you ask her to. The master bed, lined in wood logs, was incredibly comfortable and located right off the kitchen and on the same level as the hot tub. Downstairs was the foosball table and Net-flicks on TV. Full kitchen so we cooked almost every night, breakfast every morning and made sandwiches each day for our trips out to adventure. We will definitely be back and will bring others with us! Top notch place!!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here with 3 friends for a relaxing long weekend. We loved the hot tub & comfy & clean accommodations. Really appreciated the location between the town of Durango & the hotsprings. Very convenient with a car. Quiet & peaceful.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and a wonderful location! I highly recommend for a great relaxing getaway.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rent this home !!!! Make no plans and spend a week in a luxurious home with a lovely host and stunning Colorado views from every window. The back yard is a vacation destination in itself!! The pictures do this no justice. Plenty of delicious food locally , close to everything. Mesa verde was so much more than I expected and I felt rivaled Yellowstone and RNP (I have vacationed in both). Do yourself a favor and research the native history, put some flute music on your playlist and sit in that hot tub looking at that view and any worry in life you ever had will
Melt away❤️❤️. Perfect post covid reboot !!!! Ps although we did not travel with kids this time this home would be very welcoming to a family. There is a ton of things to do close to this home if you so choose but be pre -warned :you won’t want to leave the yard !"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place in a beautiful location! Easy to get to town, but far enough to get away from it all. Really enjoyed this place and will be booking again if it’s available!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A hidden gem! Close enough to Durango for easy access but remote enough to enjoy the quiet days and starry nights. Spacious accommodations with a delightful kitchen/dining and deck area. We loved our time here and can’t wait to return next year.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The host was excellent and the property is great. I’m the owner of my own Airnb property and have high expectations. Her house checked all the boxes for my family. We would definitely book her property again if we’re in the area.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I loved all the small details that Sarah provided: drinks, chocolate, eggs, and more. Sarah and the Woodshop are amazing."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great experience staying here for the week. The location is quiet and it’s a quick drive into town. Great views of the valley and nice amenities.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a magical place! Sarah went above-and-beyond to personalize the experience, sprinkling local flavors of Durango. It was wonderful to unwind here after long days of exploration. The place felt quiet and exclusive. We would absolutely recommend it. 😊"
,,,"Do not book this cabin until you understand there is no privacy (several cabins in close proximity) and the location is sandwiched between private property and the highway - so you have to get in your car to do anything - ride bikes, walk or go for a run.
With no AC, it gets very hot in the summer months and some windows were missing screens and other windows cannot open so limited ability for fresh air into the cabin. An extremely small fan was in a closet, but way too small to allow for any relief of the heat. Very disappointing and we did not stay. We rebooked immediately and found an amazing site just a few miles away. As of this posting, I have not received any refund since Vita seems to think it’s up to Airbnb to decide this."
