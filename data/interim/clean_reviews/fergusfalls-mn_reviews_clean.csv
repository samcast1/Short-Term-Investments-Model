2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were very comfortable at the Cherry Ave. house. We felt chilly after a few hours arriving there and a simple text to the owner resulted in a prompt response and he took care of the situation. (He controlled the heat/air from his cell phone). The beds were comfortable as was the bedding. The entire house was nice and clean. We enjoyed a couple hours sitting in the back yard between events we were attending. What a treat. Nice and quiet and relaxing. I would stay here again. Very comfortable stay.

Large coffee pot that was workable for all of us as coffee drinkers.
Quiet neighborhood and lovely location! We all said we’d stay at Steve’s place again if we were to plan a stay in Fergus. I don’t think you would be disappointed if you stayed here next time you’re in Fergus either!"

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely little house near Lake Alice. The lake is visible from the house. When I first parked at the house, I thought it might be a noisy neighborhood. But by 9:00 all was quiet. I slept deeply all 3 nights that I was there. The house was well-stocked with everything I needed. If you plan to stay here, do remember to bring your TV passwords. I forgot mine and, not being very tech savvy, I watched a LOT of “Lakefront Bargain Hunt!”"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our stay for one night. Appreciate that they accept dogs. House was clean in a quiet neighborhood. Lake is one block away and it was a fun to walk around in evening. Thank you!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the whole first floor apartment with two nice bedrooms, kitchen and comfortable living room. The bed was comfy, too.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The hosts did a great job with the space, making it very homey. It is a great option when you don't want to stay at a hotel!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy home. We had four people staying at the place and that was perfect with the three trifold padded mattress in the living room. The fire place is under the TV- we didn’t find it until the last day. Our fault for not reading the check in instructions closer. The house has the old house charm with some updates.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Whitford House is a real gem! So close to a nice lake walk. Just really enjoyed everything about the house!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Family friendly home. Had everything that we needed. Bedrooms are spacious with cozy beds.
We were able to enjoy the nice winter weather and take a walk around the lake with our teenager. We saw birds, ducks geese and squirrels along the way swimming and walking on the ice.
Beautiful location. Very clean and tidy home."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I stayed at Bee and Paul’s place for a weekend writing retreat. It was such a great experience that we extended our trip by one more night and reserved it again for a couple months from now.
The space is clean and comfortable, and it has one of the best outfitted kitchens I’ve been in with AirBnB. The beds and bedding are comfortable, too.
Plus, it was lovely to be able to walk around Lake Alice every day.
This is a GREAT find!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little home to stay. In close proximity to everything in Fergus Falls.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was traveling to the area for work and enjoyed my stay here! Very kind and communicative hosts, and several great restaurants in town. It is an older home. The place was very clean and had everything I needed."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice stay at this Airbnb. Everything was as pictured, clean and comfortable. This is an old house so the floor is not quite level due to settling. The neighborhood is quiet and the neighbors we encountered were friendly. Bee and Paul were also quite friendly, responsive and helpful with a suggested route to Fergus Falls. I appreciated the proactive communication! It was the perfect location for meeting up with family and the price was very reasonable!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very nice neighborhood and Paul and Bee were responsive.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Bee and Paul's place was a perfect little spot to unwind at the end of the day.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. Kitchen is generously equipped and there is all the necessary information available.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was as described. Cute little home with all the amenities described and even a recommendation for a local restaurant that we checked out (Viking Cafe).
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very charming apartment. Beautiful hardwood floors etc
It had a complete kitchen, living area and two bedrooms and full bathroom which was perfect for our needs It was in a quiet neighborhood
And great responsive hosts that checked in with us proactively as well."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful and peaceful space:) will book again !
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall the place was nice and very clean. Unfortunately when I arrived it had a smell to it that made me uncomfortable throughout my stay. Bee and Paul were willing to send someone to see if they could identify it but unfortunately I was there for my daughter’s wedding and no time to deal with it. I would say if you have an animal you might be more comfortable there. It is an older home and it was humid so possible old smells arising.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bee & Paul provide everything you need. This was another fantastic place to stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was delightful. Even the foam floor mattress was adequate. The guest who slept on it is very fit but in her 70’s & said it was comfortable. It would be nice if it wasn’t on the floor. Melissa, if I remember her name correctly, was Johnny -on-the-spot with whatever we needed. Our walks around the lake were lovely!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, responsive hosts, everything we needed for our stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this is a wonderful location to access downtown. charming neighborhood with hilltop lake
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an elegaic trip to Fergus Falls --my family lived in Fergus from about 1870 to 1982, and are all gone now. I had not been there since 2000, but the town looked about the same -- maybe a bit more upscale, but the same in terms of general appearance and feel. Lake Alice remains charming.
Had a very nice visit to the OCHS, which has a long association with my Grandmother's family. It was nice to see Lundeen's was still there, along with the Beall & McGowan building (but I do not like the modern windows). And, I enjoyed the River Walk and Viking Cafe.
The AirBnB house was cozy, clean and restful, which was lovely. The lighting was good, and we were greeted with a brand-new walkway! The kitchen was nice, although the floor had a distinct slope. The bathroom was very clean. The bed was supportive.
[In contrast to Fergus Falls, what has happened to Otter Tail Lake was manifestly depressing. It has been absolutely ruined by over-development. Very sad, indeed. ]"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Over all it was an ok little place. Not totally what I expected. Did smell like smoke/stale old home. Was almost 80 degrees inside when arrived and took a long time to cool down which made the first night a little harder to sleep. The neighbors were having their roof redone so that noise wasn’t the best but part of life. Overall they decorated it nice and for just a place to sleep and shower it’s good. It was my first Air Bnb and I think I just expected quality like how I keep my house or a hotel and it wasn’t. It’s an old home and that is what comes with an old home. They try very hard to make the best of the property.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Needed a quick to stay on way to minneapolis and was a perfect stop. My kids loved the toys and books available. They all slept great and there was a pack n play to use. Will definitely stay again if we need a halfway point.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying here and worked out great for us and our pooch.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Paul and Bee's place is the perfect place for a quiet, relaxing getaway. I highly recommend it!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks Paul & Bee, especially Mellisa! I was able to check in early to catch some sleep after a long and early drive! Great stay!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"As always, great place, fantastic hosts. You can't go wrong."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here. Bee was terrific. This place was just what we needed. Thanks. We’ll plan to stay there again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Same as my last reviews, very happy with my stay!!! I'll be definitely booking again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A delight again, everything I needed during my weeklong stay for work! Easy check in and check out and I know if I need anything, they are quick to respond."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay near Lake Alice, 5 minutes from downtown!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay, the home was nicely decorated, very homey, both my husband and I really liked it and would recommend. They had all the basics and even an extra mattress and dog kennel. Would have loved the weather to have been nicer so we could have tried out the patio. Thank you for letting us use your home."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I stayed at Bee and Paul's BNB for a week, and chose this listing based on A) availability, B) price, C) location, and D) what I needed in a place to stay while working my stretch at the local hospital. Because I strictly work night shifts, I appreciated the flexible check-in and ability to just basically show up and use the 4-digit code on the door to get in when I needed to with no keys or needing to meet up with someone. Since I was there for more than a few days, I wanted to have a kitchen to be able to get some needed groceries and have something better than things to be microwaved.
Bee and Paul's home provided me with everything I needed, and I appreciated the fact that not only are they very clear about what is expected of me, they provided multiple points of contact so if I ran into any issues, I would be able to get someone. I had no issues at all during my stay, and though there are tenants upstairs, I barely heard them. I plan on staying again, and have already booked :D"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Fergus Falls. The home was comforting and quaint.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,The view from the bedrooms of the lake is lovely. I wish we had been there in the summer. Bre was so good with communicating everything that we would need for our stay.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed much needed sister time. Comfortable couch and living room. Bedrooms were very spacious. We missed our turn the first time - but only once. Nice area - we went downtown to shop the local shops and had a really enjoyable time at the antique shop and The BRIC. We did not need for anything. I even learned how to use a French Press coffee pot. Bee & Paul, Thank you for your great accommodations , Kristine"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Bee & Paul's place is clean and comfortable. It has classic charm and looks to be in a nice neighborhood. Communication was great. Easy check in/check our process. We would not hesitate to stay there again if we're visiting the Fergus Falls area.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was comfortable to sleep. It was quiet. It was very clean. 3 employees stayed and we’re basically only there to sleep however it worked to have a place away from a motel and more like home. There were 3 trucks and a work trailer and they assisted in helping find adequate parking for the extras. They were very helpful, friendly and amazing to work with. Thank you."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks so much for letting us stay at your place cute little house . My granddaughter said cute house one of theses days I’ll have a house like this one

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place for a holiday home away from home. Hosts are ever so helpful and respond quite quickly. Thank you!
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is close in to town, and there's a thriving small business community in Fergus Falls. We enjoyed going out to eat and walking in town, and the place was cozy and quiet."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very friendly people and a great space to stay. Easy check in, good communications, close to everything in Fergus. Will definitely stay here again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bee and Paul were proactive prior to check in, asked if i made it ok on the day of check in and if I had any questions. I had to check out a day early due to winter weather and traveling and they checked to be sure I made it home ok! :)"
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, cozy place. Extremely limited parking, an unknown vehicle was parked in front so we had to squeeze our pickup in front of the vehicle without blocking the driveway. Also no parking on the other side of the road. The beautiful old hardwood floors creaked and so did the upstairs tenants. The hosts were extremely nice and accommodating. It would have been nice to be able to control the thermostat ourselves, but respected the rules that we acknowledged before booking. We would stay there again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was exactly as advertised. I would definitely stay there again. I bet the area is nice in the summer.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent communication
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bee and Paul’s Arbnb was the perfect location for a girls getaway! We were able to enjoy biking and went into the nearby State Park. It was the perfect location for morning walks around the lake and to walk downtown for dinner! The Arbnb was comfortable with great attention to detail. Would definitely stay with them again when we are in the area!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Weren't there long but really enjoyed our stay at Bee & Paul's. Great house and location in Fergus Falls. We went so Icould bike the Central Lakes Trail but my wife wants to go back for the pancakes at The Farmers Table (claiming they are the best she's ever had). She also enjoyed walking around Lake Alice (although just as an FYI if traveling with kids, there isnt really a defined walking trail for it). Both the bedrooms are spread out for any traveling with a snoring companion or another couple. Highly recommend this house for your next stay in Fergus Falls."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute little home nestled in an All-American town. Clean, quiet and comfortable accommodations perfect for a small family. The kid toys available was a huge bonus. Alice Lake is across the street with a nice waking lane to enjoy the scenery. Fergus Falls is a beautiful little town, highly recommend Union Pizza and the Fabled Farmer for meals!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Perfect, peaceful location. Close walk to walk around the lake. My only complaint was no access to local news."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little house! We enjoyed our stay. It was quiet and very comfortable. We enjoyed walking around Lake Alice and seeing all the birds and turtles. We could easily walk downtown too. The neighbors were friendly and we all had a great time!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute duplex stay very walkable to downtown (eating, ice cream, brewery and shopping) and also super close to Lake Alice for a nice walk!
Perfect 2 bedroom that was fully stocked for our kitchen needs. I was appreciative of the communication.
Could use slightly darker curtains lol but we enjoy trying to sneak in more sleep before our 1 year old sees the light of day busting through!
Old home with old home character!"

Bee & Paul excelled in hospitality & communication. Very thankful for our lovely stay in their sweet home."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little spot in Fergus Falls to spend a night or two. Easily walkable/bikeable to downtown area so park your car and leave it until you pack up to head home. It's a real bonus that this space is dog friendly even though we didn't bring our pooch this time. Considering that dogs have been there, it was free of dog hair and quite tidy. If we're ever in the area again we'll be back. Bring your own coffee if you stress about waste and K-cups (french press is provided which is nice touch too). Whoever was there before us left half an onion in the fridge not in any container so the whole fridge smelled like onions but obviously not the caretakers fault."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were traveling with out pup and this was a beautiful spot to stop, rest and revive after 10+ hours on the road. Everything is considered and provided, something I rarely see in air bnbs anymore. The space was warm and inviting, it smelt amazing! Herbs and spices, a variety of cooking bits, every type of towel, pup needs, bathroom requirement, blankets and more. The interior is exceptionally comfortable and the nearby lake is a joy to walk around. Chatted to neighbors and adored our brief time. The host is very explicit on what she expects and how to use all the bits in the home, I loved it so nothing was missed or lost in communication, it also helps to make sure there is no misunderstanding! Honestly you don't see this level of care anymore in air bnbs so you'll appreciate it. My only regret is staying such a short time. I would of loved to take up the recommendations provided."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The beds were comfy for sleeping and the neighborhood was quiet making for a good nights sleep. We were in the lower level, but we never heard any noise from the upper level.
We didn't do much cooking there, but if I had, I am pretty sure I would've had all I needed.
We appreciated the biking/hiking trails in the area.
The hosts were very good about communicating before and during our stay."

We enjoyed our walks around the lake and the people in the area are so friendly. Bee& Paul have thought about everything and it will be just as described. They have it very clean and ready for you. They communicate regularly for any thing you need. Don’t miss out on the hidden gem of the Viking Cafe in town! Amazing food!
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved ending our vacation here! We loved being able to take a walk around the lake before sunset. The house is well-maintained and clean and the owners add extra special touches to make you feel welcome. You’ll enjoy your stay here!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This a charming place. Clean and well stocked. Ideally located easy to find. Check in was a breeze with hosts following up to ensure we had every thing needed. It was very hot so wasn't able to enjoy the outdoor amenities (deck, firepit and outdoor seating) except the lake, which was a short walk. Will highly recommend for a nice stay. Fergus Falls is a fun city."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A gem. We absolutely loved our stay.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Quaint and Charming little house, nice little deck out back. Everything you need is there and Bee was quick to respond to any questions. Would love to stay again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I travel a lot and we loved this place.There was a little hiccup with check in but the owner was available to work it out right away. That was fantastic. It was an older house but it was decorated really cute and all the furniture was very comfortable. They also provided a cold water and ice in fridge, a morning cup of joe, breakfast bars and popcorn for a movie. All the essentials of home are here for you which included soap,shampoo,conditioner, body wash, and dish soap. The house was nice and cool on a warm summer day. The neighborhood is close to town and everything you might need for food, out door activities, specialty shops and entertainment. Also the neighbors are real nice and quiet. I would highly recommend this for a stay here!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! We would do it again in a heartbeat!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet and peaceful, just what we needed. The place is on a quaint sleepy road, very well kept, and very clean. Would definitely stay again."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Bee & Paul’s place was great. Easy check in, comfortable bed, and well-decorated. I really appreciated the granola bars and popcorn! As another reviewer mentioned, the place smelled like cigarettes, which was the only drawback. Also, bear in mind that people live on the floor above and sometimes you can hear footsteps. Overall, was a good, solid stay."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice quaint spot to rest . House is very comfortable. Walk in the neighborhood is great.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location, right by Lake Alice. Hosts are attentive and checked in with us after we arrived. Very comfortable and pleasant place to stay."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We were a bit disappointed in this Airbnb. It looked so nice in the pictures but when we got there there were a few things that made it not as nice as others we have stayed at. There was an obvious smoking smell. Also as an older home it had some quirks- slanted floors and doors that don’t stay closed were noted. It wasn’t as clean as we are used to- cobwebs on the ceiling, dirt on the window sills, and dust in the fridge grill. There was only one towel and one washcloth for each person- which one was dropped on the floor and thus dirty before we were even able to use it. Lastly, there were so many rules- many of which I think most people would do anyways. The owners were very personable though- they asked about our trip and gave ideas for things in the area."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, cozy, affordable. This was a great stopover."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"At Home in Whitford is an adorable, affordable, cozy, “feel like home” atmosphere. We had a great time at Superhosts Bee and Paul’s place.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay here for a week visiting family in Fergus Falls and Campbell. The house was just right and the kitchen was appointed with everything we needed. It was nice to be so close to town and the lake. We had great and prompt communication with the hosts.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adorable first floor of a house right next to a small lake in quaint Fergus Falls. Fantastic value alone, even more so when you think of it as a home base to explore the north woods of MN. I love the little instructional notes that Bee and Paul leave around the house -- it shows that they know what they're doing."
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great hosts! Replied quickly and graciously. Very cute and cozy!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent experience with outstanding communication.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a cute little place in Fergus Falls that offered us a relaxing spring break where we could just lounge around. Bee & Paul are very welcoming and thorough in letting guests know everything they need to have a fantastic stay.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charming old and cozy home and excellent location right near a lovely little park with lake and downtown. Very nice!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice and affordable place to relax for the weekend. It was too cold to leave and wonder the city, but that wasn’t a problem at all. This place had everything we needed."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend-this place is so sweet and cozy! It's full of character and decorated so well! Kitchen is fully stocked-we ate several meals there. We loved the location-right near the lake and so close to downtown! The temperature seemed really finnicky, which isn't surprising since the house is in the older side, so at times we were hotter or chillier then we like, but there are also great warm blankets throughout the house and even cozy socks to borrow! Would love to stay again!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great clean rental.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, cute home overall!! Grateful to Bee and Paul for the warm welcome and stay in Fergus Falls :)"
2021-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This place is cute and cozy, yet could use some updating. It's very clean and tidy. Anyone who books should expect a very long list of rules to follow (which was a little overwhelming to me, even as a 50-some year old woman who is a very neat and respectful guest). The floor is very creaky and kept me awake at night when my husband had to use the bathroom, and you can hear the tenant above walking around even at night. Some AirBnBs provide nicer touches such as bottled water, but Bee and Paul did leave granola bars and coffee pods (instructions noted one for each of us, which I thought was odd). The kitchen was nicely stocked with utensils and even had kids' plates and silverware. If you like a firm mattress, you'll find sleeping here very comfortable. There is a lake around the corner that looks like a nice place to walk. Unfortunately we didn't have time to explore though!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I came for the price, I'll come back because they do everything right — everything. At the risk of gushing, this place was perfect for a seven-night stay while on business. Coming home to a ""home"" and not a hotel each night was a huge psychological win. That it was clean, comfortable and managed by people who know how to anticipate and take care of every detail, was a big bonus. Bee and Paul do it right; I've stayed in Air BNBs all over the world and this was, hands down, the best. What would I change? Nothing."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a cozy place to stop over on our road trip. The bed was very comfy and the hosts were very communicative. We would defiantly stay here again!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bee and Paul are excellent hosts. Their information and instructions for check-in were clear and their responses to questions were prompt. We had to reschedule our stay to a different date, and Bee and Paul were very accomodating. When we arrived, the house was clean and comfortable. We would recommend it!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay, the owners definitely take the time to make your stay comfortable."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a nice and relaxing stay, checked in with ease, nice motion lights. The location was easy to get to. We enjoyed a few movies on Netflix and liked having the kuerig coffee in the morning. Just the right amount of comfortable space. Loved the bedspreads and deco. It sure beats a hotel."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was quite lovely! The house is so cute and cozy! The hosts are very quick to respond and also very helpful!

It was a great getaway and I would definitely stay here again!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful little Airbnb with a great area for walking and a cute town. The home is definitely old but that adds to the charm, it is very clean and the hosts are extremely welcoming. Highly recommend, my family (including the pups!) had a fantastic time."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A cozy home away from home. In this time of Social Distancing, why stay in a hotel when you can stay in this charming 2 BR 1 Bath apartment complete with kitchen and separate living area, and pay less? Convenient to Lake Alice and downtown Fergus Falls."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bee and Paul were wonderful hosts and their housekeeper communcated with me as well. I appreciated their timely responses and checking in to see if i needed anything.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Whitford for 2 weeks while vising family members in Fergus Falls. The apartment worked very well for a longer visit where I mostly cooked ""at home"", with a well-stocked kitchen (dishes, assorted pots, pans, even a muffin pan, etc.), and all equipment was in very good condition, which is not always the case with airbnbs. The dead-bolt lock system on the front door was also modern and secure and worked well with no need for a key. Nice touches like sensor lighting at the front entrance when I got back after dark."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay and Bee & Paul were amazing at communicating! The space was sparkling clean, smelled great and very warm and inviting. For dinner we at at Union Pizza & Brewery (amazing food!) and for breakfast we ate at Viking Café also a must!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m 5 foot nine and the wall next to the shower is angled so it’s easier for shorter people to take a shower in the shower. Plenty of hot water and very clean excellent supplies of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay in Bee’s and Paul’s apartment was exceptionally cozy. We would enjoy coming back if the opportunity presented itself.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, clean, and cozy place to stay. They have great communication and overall great hosts :)"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This place has pretty much everything you need. Bed is pretty comfy.
Had an issue unlocking the door when we checked-in, so had to call the housekeeper (Melissa). She was great! Answered right away and instructed us on how to resolve the issue. Exterior could use a little clean up. Arriving late at night, the lighting accentuated all the giant spider webs along the house.
Walked in and we were greeted by a couple spiders crawling on the wall and a dead green bug on the welcome table. Unfortunately that had me on my toes for the rest of the night and I didn’t have the greatest sleep. Had a laugh watching my 6’2 boyfriend standing in the low shower, but he managed! I’d say 5’4 and lower can fit comfortable.
Overall, has everything you need, but definitely shows it’s character, as stated in the description. The hosts seem like great people. Great communication."
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Pros: Bee and Paul were very friendly in their email communications. Their housekeeper was kind enough to get things ready for us so we could have an earlier check-in. Good location. The beds were super comfortable!
Cons: The house reeked of cigarette smoke and affected my asthma. Thankfully we only stayed one night.There is a steep set of stairs when you enter and the floors are slanted especially in the bathroom...to the point you can lose your balance. The ceiling in the shower is sloped and extremely low. The tap water an odd taste/smell (like corn). Probably only a summer time thing."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The hosts were so considerate and communicative. I felt very checked on and provided for. The apartment was cozy and clean. I’d definitely stay here again.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lots of things to do out in Fergus Falls. It was nice to be near Lake Alice. Our stay fell on a bit of a heat wave, but we never noticed unless we stepped out. Be careful on the stairs up to the place, low ceiling, and the floor is definitely not level. The rooms were quaint with plenty enough room for more than us two (2 bed, 1 bath, kitchen, and TV room); good second stop on a MN road trip."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location in a safe neighborhood, with plenty of recommendations for local activities and very clean and comfortable beds."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Fergus Falls was wonderfully cozy and relaxing. The beds provided exceptional comfort after long travel days.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was great and we’d stay here again. Hosts were proactively communicative and prepared to address whatever needs we may have had (we didn’t have any). Place was clean, in a good location, and accurately portrayed. Only teeny tiny complaints was the fact that the pics made it appear the place overlooked Lake Alice (it’s a short block off) and I would have expected enough coffee for our stay (though I’m sure they would have dropped some off if we would have asked). Overall good value and we had a great time."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place but hard to shower for anyone over 5 feet tall

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bee and Paul were very welcoming and sent me lots of instructions prior to my visit. This place is a great value - the beds are both large and super comfy, and it was nice to have separate bedrooms for my travel companion and I. We came in late after a wedding so I appreciated the self check in option. We did not cook in the kitchen but it was very cute, and I appreciated the variety of teas provided. As other reviewers mentioned, the shower is a little cramped and anyone over 5’9 will likely have some awkward positioning while using it (my friend staying with me is 6’4 and found it humorous), but not a big deal. Overall clean and cute place, friendly hosts, clear instructions and rules. This was my first time booking and staying at an airbnb and they made it easy to navigate!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A beautiful and convenient space near a gorgeous lake and small downtown within walking distance.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, cozy place close to Lake Alice, which makes for a nice stroll. Fergus is a pretty town I'm familiar with as I grew up in the area. Checked out Uncle Eddies ice cream and spent a bunch at the Falls Baking Company. I also consumed a bunch of Chocolate Terroir chocolate (local chocolate maker)."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Bee & Paul were great hosts, we appreciated so much their hospitality during our almist 2-week stay. Although we didn't meet in person, communication was great, as they ensured our stay was positive & what we needed.
Their cozy apartment was perfect for good sleep & neighborhood location very safe for long walks.
Bonus was, ""Lake Alice"" a mile long circular walk if you choose, & practically just outside the door! It isn't a traditional recreation lake, but so cool with various waterfowl & birds to observe while enjoying being in nature. Equally bonus was the location to city life perfect for shopping, eating, taking in sights. Our fav place to grab coffee & delicious food was ""Toast""- highly recommend! Definitely we will book again with ""Whit's Up"" because of it's sweet accommodations, & location, but equally because of the hosts-Bee & Paul!🙂
God bless,
Andy & Serina"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Not only was this place welcoming and cozy, it had everything we could possibly need. Every single time we murmured that we wished we had something (an extra quilt, a spare bread tie, scissors, a warm blanket while reading, even a cheese slicer) not only was it already there—it was in the exact place we needed it to be, right within reach. This was a great place to read, relax and unwind. And it’s so close to the wonderful shops and restaurants downtown. We’re already planning a return trip."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Bee & Paul were great hosts. I'd definitely stay here again, from the beds and linens to the decor, this place offers a bit of English cottage inspired comfort."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful place to stay in Fergus Falls. Felt right at home and had all the amenities we needed. Bee and Paul were extremely communicative, helpful, and accommodating. The shower ceiling is a little short, so keep that in mind if you're really tall lol... but not a huge deal for us. You can tell they care about their guests and making sure you're comfortable. They were very understanding and flexible when we needed a late checkout, and also one of the few places you'll find in the area that allows pets. Overall a lovely and affordable stay. We will always keep Bee and Paul's home in mind if we ever need a place to stay again!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot close to where I needed to be in Fergus Falls. There is a lake very close by but it was frozen and covered in snow.
Place is very nice. Cozy. Homey. Clean. We were on the 2nd floor so the ceiling is angled in spots which is fine except that it does limit the space to stand in the shower. I am 6ft 1 inch and it was a tight fit. I imagine that anyone over 6 ft 2” would have to hunch over a bit.
Overall we were very happy. Recommend it and will likely stay again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A lovely stay in a cozy spot. Super appreciated pets allowed and still so cozy and had personality. Well designed, clean, and had everything we needed. The shower head is short, but manageable for the couple days we were there. The location was good promiximty for our needs. Our teenager stated, ""I would live here."" So high praise. :) Great communication and directions. Would definitely return and try it out another season."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful girls’ getaway in this charming little apartment.
They’ve worked incredibly hard to make the place as charming as it is. The house is older, but it was cozy and was perfect for our girls’ getaway. The beds were comfortable, there was plenty of linen, and lots of cozy throws. There are lots of cozy little touches—extra throws, pillows.
The kitchen was thoroughly and thoughtfully stocked as well as easy to get around in. Cute dishes, wineglasses and corkscrew. Everything you need to cook. The bathroom has lots of towels, and a basket with some commonly-forgotten toiletries.
We loved just chilling on the comfy sofas while painting and watching movies. The living room is so nice, well appointed, comfy furniture nice TV, just remember to bring your login for your favorite ROKU channels! Everything we wanted to do was a short drive and we didn’t even notice the sounds of construction in the neighborhood, the house was so quiet.
Even though we didn’t need them, we saw amenities designed for families; toys, books games and even a pack n play and baby gate. They’ve worked hard to think of everything anyone might need.
Some things to know—the shower is not ideal if you’re more than 5’3” or so. It’s angled and is a tight squeeze. The stairs are also pretty steep, so just keep than in mind.

All in all, it’s a great little place to spend a couple of nights!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quaint, clean, well-appointed and convenient. The entire unit is up a steep flight of stairs, so may not be suitable for anyone with mobility issues or young children."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our sister getaway here at such a cozy place. Everything was perfect!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, quaint, older home. Incredibly cozy and clean. Everything was very well stocked! Super helpful info all around the home with things to do, see and eat at in town. The hosts always answered when I had questions and they made sure everything was smooth as possible. The communication was great!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely upstairs apartment with charming features of an older home. Bedrooms especially are cozy and comfortable. Nice walks around the nearby lake, and easy walking access to downtown and grocery store. It was also nice to sit outside in the mornings for coffee before work, amid the hostas."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bee & Paul we’re great hosts, very clear communication. House was as described. Clean and very close to the downtown area."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a very nice place in a great town near a very relaxing lake. Both bedrooms are relatively spacious, and the room I chose to unpack in had a very comfortable bed. I did not cook in the kitchen, but it seemed to be pretty well-appointed if you choose to do so. The AC kept pace with the outside conditions. the parking was easy, and the neighborhood was nice. The only thing to be aware of is that if you are tall, the shower may be a challenge as it is situated at the slant of the roof. I am 5'10"" and though it did not cause me any significant problems, I did have to duck a bit to avoid hitting my head. A walk around the lake will make you forget about all of that though - it has been one of the highlights of my trip. Very walkable to town, and a short drive to additional entertainment and restaurants. I would stay her again on my next trip through."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place for our family of 4 passing through on a cross-country trip. The high chair was really handy for our baby, and our 5-year-old had fun with the toys. Definitely recommend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place to stay in Fergus Falls. It is right next to a lovely lake, perfect for a morning walk or bike ride.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"House is located steps away from Lake Alice - a peaceful small lake great for an evening stroll. Home is also blocks from quaint downtown shops and restaurants. Responsive hosts who knows this town well - Bee recommended Fabled Farmer and Toast, both excellent food/drinks and MN nice service! Thank you! The Market (gift shop),Uncle Eddie’s (ice cream), and antique shop downtown rounded out our visit. Comfy bed and soft linen, luggage rack, well stocked kitchen, and clean/cozy home made for a perfect stay! We hope to make a longer visit next time! Ps: bring a book, there is cozy reading nooks!"

I recommend this place."

Most of all, we loved the quiet neighborhood, our short walk to downtown and the nostalgic front porch where we were able to just sit out on and relax and have a meal with some delicious local food.
It is a little gem to stay at while visiting Fergus Falls!"

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a charming, cozy home to stay in with easy access to downtown Fergus Falls! Unfortunately, our first night was quite noisy as one of the residents downstairs had loud houseguests until close to 1am. There was follow-up with the host and all was calm by the quiet hours at 10pm the following night."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It's always a great place to return to! I've stayed there several times and it always feels like home.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I LOVED our stay at the Pilgrim’s Inn! The space was so cozy, cheerful, and welcoming, and they had pretty much everything we needed for traveling with a baby and toddler! Our two-year-old was THRILLED by all of the Little Golden Books and the chalkboard doors. We loved how dark the blinds made the boys’ rooms—very helpful for nighttime and naps in the Minnesota summer! It was a perfect location for visiting parks, coffee shops, breweries, the Otter Cove Museum, and, of course, Otto the Otter! Check in/out and finding the location was super easy. It could not have been a smoother trip!
THANK YOU, Karen and Rich for hosting us!!"

Overall, it was more than we expected.
Cudos to the owners."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The only reason the lock didn't work upon arrival was due to a miscommunication with the person assigned to change the lock code.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a great little place to stay when we’re in the Fergus area. The place was clean, beds were comfy, and it’s centrally located in town. The extra room with the kitchenette was a bonus - it was just right for a simple cereal-and-milk meal in the morning. The only downside is the 3/4 bath - there’s no tub for our littles, but for a short stint where we can skip baths for one night, it was absolutely perfect. We will most likely be repeat guests here, and I highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Karen was a great host. A great place to stay on our trip back from the. West.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Our stay was work-vacay- long stay- my husband was away during the week but despite short weekends to enjoy, we both were extra impressed, & happy with the cozy, & peaceful, accommodations Karen provided!
For us privacy was extremely important, & this was the perfect lodging for our needs!! Yet whenever we had any questios both Karen & her husband were more then accomodating, while always providing us the space we needed. Their 2 sons were also very friendly & respectful to us-overall, a super cool family!
Neighborhood was really nice & I felt very safe on long walks by myself in the evenings.
Also easy to walk to great coffee shops, eateries, unique shops, & our fav healthstore- ""Dutchmann"".
Also lots small lakes, parks, & fun little towns within 1/2 hour drive which was great.
As cliche as it might sound, this is truth: coming back to our lodging from an outing, felt like we were always ""coming home""- rare & special experience these days!
Huge kudos to Karen, Rich, & family!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I keep coming back here for personal retreats because the place is so cozy and quiet. I get really good rest every time I visit.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karen was an exceptional host and responsive to any inquiries we had regarding our booking. When she had a cancellation for one of the nights we requested she immediately let us know it was available for us to book.
The upstairs apartment met our needs for myself and daughter when we were attending an event in the area. Loved the small sitting area where we enjoyed our relaxing morning coffee. Made us feel at home with comfortable beds, amenities as listed, and lovey antique decor.
Would highly recommend and would stay again when in the area.
Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This character home was very comfortable, filled with fun, vintage decor. The rooms were well appointed and the bed was comfortable. The muffins were a welcome breakfast treat. We would be very likely to stay again for future visits to the Fergus Falls area."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay, very cozy!!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I continue to stay at Pilgrim's Inn when I'm traveling to Fergus Falls, and Karen/Rich always exceed my expectations for my stay. I made a mistake for the nights I needed, and basically last minute asked if I could book same day and check out the morning after (Night Shift worker, so I needed to sleep all day) which they immediately responded to in the affirmative. It's a pretty good feeling to know I'm in great hands.
Quiet location, able to sleep well, and very private with an area to eat/heat up food/put items in the fridge. I also appreciate the addition of utensils in case I forget to bring my own. Very clear instructions provided on what I should expect and what is expected of me."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place to stay to lay our heads down for a few hours. Loved the decor! Felt right at home.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at Karen and Rich's home before, and as before I was very thrilled with the process and stay.
I had the whole upstairs to myself, it was quiet and had dark shades on the windows, very easy to get in with my own code, and clear instructions on what was expected of me while I was staying there.
I'm a travel nurse and I work night shifts so it's sometimes difficult to find what I need for a reasonable price. Pilgrims Inn provides me everything I need including an area to eat with a fridge, microwave and even some utensils so I don't need to bring all that with me.
I appreciate as well the small touches that make it more personable, such as the treat of chocolates, muffins, and small oranges when I first arrive. There's also a Keurig available for those who drink coffee.
I plan to stay again in the future!!! Thanks Karen and Rich!"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The rental was great for my short stay. Karen's place was welcoming and very clean. The beds were comfortable, and the linens were soft and clean.
The temperature is controlled by the owner, so it was a little warm (from heater) for my personal liking when I came in, but there was a fan I could use to cool my room down a bit. Other than that, my stay was great. Thank you Karen for sharing your space."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a easy and comfortable experience. I wish everything in life went as well as staying at this site.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I appreciated the little touches that made the place so cozy. The neighborhood is quiet and lovely and a short walk to stores and restaurants. There was plenty of space for me to spread out in the comfortable bedroom with an office nook for my computer work and walk-in closet. The bedroom across the hall was designed with a small kitchen area with toaster, microwave, small refrigerator and counter big enough for preparing a small meal. It had a table and couch and rocker for a lovely ""sitting area"" away from the bedroom area. It's a treasure. I was alone on this trip so left the other two bedrooms across the hall untouched, but in a few weeks I will return with my family and it will be perfect for our stay. The bathroom had a walk-in shower which was perfect for me."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Many thanks for hosting me again. I always feel safe, comfortable and cozy here in this house and in the neighborhood. Will be coming again soon. The environment is very beautiful and quiet, so relaxing. A perfect place to rest and recharge my batteries."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent experience! Such a treat when hosts like Alexandra and Dimitri are willing to share their home and a slice of their lives with a traveler like myself. The house is beautiful and warm, the decor exotic to me due to their Russian background, everything just as listed. Comfy bed, clean, the large private bath a plus, great kitchen which they were happy for me to use. Fergus Falls is a charming town to walk around in, a neat downtown with a beautiful river walk with interesting historical signage. Be sure to have breakfast or lunch at The Fabled Farmer."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alexandra and Dimitri were very helpful .
We had had conversations so now and then and that was really nice.
I could taste some of their food, when I arrived at 6 pm , so that was very special.
I had a nice stay , could make my own breakfast and diner.
So they showed me a lot of hospitality !
I would recommend everybody to go there even when you stay longer then 3 nights, as I did .
Rob"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Alexandra was so sweet. She wouldn't even let me make my own tea the night I got in but insisted on doing it for me. She gave me a quick tour and had little extras laid out. (Reminded me of a Bed and Breakfast with her little touches, intriguing decor, and hospitality!) Wonderful stop after a long day on the road!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"So happy to have met this amazing host! Streated you like a friend, fed you like your granny would have.
I was having one issue after another and she set up accommodations or found solutions in no time. She gave my kitten Amigo all he could need and more! carrying in a huge cat tree so he could zoom happily. Not one single negative aspect to list. Made my transition to a new town welcoming. 10/10 would recommend."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful house with lovely decor and very clean and organized. Host allowed us to use her driveway to park and we felt much safer than parking on the street.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I told Alexandra that we would give her 10 stars if we could! They had a little dog that greeted us and then they took her away to another part of the house. (I had asked her about the dog because our place the previous 2 nights wasn’t a very good experience.) She assured us that this is what they always do, because they want to be attentive to guests’ feelings . We had a chance to visit in the morning more over coffee and breakfast. She and her husband have worked hard since coming to America and their story was so interesting! She also asked questions about our life!
The home was lovely and she had special little amenities in the bathroom like a facial packet. Everything was in pristine condition!
She gave us several recommendations for dinner and the one we chose was excellent.
If we are ever in the area again, we will definitely stay with them! ❣️"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay, very accommodating. Felt right at home."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying with Alex was wonderful. She and her husband gave me all the privacy and space I needed, but she made sure I knew she was available if I had questions about anything. The house is enormous, colorfully decorated with charm and care, lots to admire, but it’s their home so it had a very welcome feel. Lived-in, not sterile or stuffy. :) There are pets in the house, as well as the occasional aroma, but everything was kept out of sight, and I didn’t see a single pet hair anywhere. Candles and air fresheners thoughtfully spread about kept the common areas fresh. One thing that was odd: the lack of electrical outlets. (Not surprising, since the house was built in 1880, lol). It was a trick to keep the lamp, AC, and my chargers plugged in the same room at the same time, but overall I smiled at the quirks of an older home. I would highly recommend Alex and would definitely stay there again! :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic environment.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying with Alexandra was wonderful! I was nervous because I had never stayed in a room of someone’s house, but my sister and I felt so safe and welcome! She was so friendly and took care of us well! I loved having tea in the morning!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I made a last minute decision to attend a graduation open house. Hotels in the area where either sold out or too expensive. I have had great luck w/the Air b-n-b’s in the past, so I thought let’s go for it. As a former travel agent & former employee of a legacy airline it is the little things that make a stay that much better!!!
Alexandra’s place is in my list to stay at again when I come back!!! The house is beautiful right down to the original crown molding that frame the doorways. The room was comfortable, close to the bathroom as well. I slept like a baby & it felt good!!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We appreciated the clean bedroom, although, the bathroom counter was rather grimy. The location was great and we could walk to our destinations very easily, which was so nice! Upon arrival, the scent in the home and in our room was very strong and rather overwhelming- it made me feel unwell. I was glad the aroma seemed to have dissipated a bit when we returned from dinner! I believe it could have been the diffuser in the bathroom... overall though I would definitely stay here again!"

I personally like staying in small towns which is why I decided to check out Fergus Falls….. Alex and Dmitri are wonderful hosts. Their home is beautiful and inviting. The room is comfortable and clean and the bed is just right. We appreciated the ac in the bedroom and slept comfortably and soundly. This was a perfect spot to get some really good rest and a shower before hitting the road again. I super appreciated all the coffee Alexandra made for me in the morning and the good conversation! 10/10 would recommend staying at their place!
Ps. If you ask you can also meet their super cute and sweet foster critters!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We book many stays for our employees around the nation. I have never worked with such a supportive, responsive, and kind host.

Pretty chickens living their best life. It's close to town too. This is minor, but I really appreciated that there was ice and ice cube trays in the freezer. I've stayed in multiple places that didn't bother."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the best airbnb I’ve stayed in. If anything, they are underselling the place. From the moment you walk in and they have a cute little sign for you all the way through the simple check out, this was a lovely place. I would definitely come here again. It felt like home while still feeling like a fun vacation. If you’re considering booking, do it! You won’t regret it."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Danielle was responsive and we felt right at home with our little one. Having sold our farm, I truly miss living in the country and having farm animals. Right before checking out, I noticed one chicken continuing to stare over. After giving them a few calls they all came running over to the pen area. I may need to work on my husband again and get a few Australorps and Barred Rocks myself, again. Anyways, we felt right at home and the property is beautiful! Only regret, we weren’t visiting during the summer. Thanks again for everything! Nelson Family"

My buddy and I were on a hunt with Feet Down Waterfowl out of Fergus Falls and decided to stay here. Beautiful scenery, cozy and comfortable. The hosts communicated very well and made us feel right at home. Plus the cat outside begging for attention made it very welcoming! This spot is a MUST STAY!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, clean environment. I felt at home and the host responded and answered every concerns I had. If there was 10 stars, I will give this host 10 stars."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a weekend for us 3 to be at Danielle’s place! She did above and beyond to help me with the surprise bday! She put up the signage and balloons for us before we get there.
Comfy coaches and bed! Did the spa and she made it works for us 3 to get pampered.
We are discussing about going there again for next year! Thanks again for everything, Danielle!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I didn’t get to spend much time at the space, but it was exactly what I wanted- quiet, country setting close to Fergus. Clean, beautiful art inside and a cozy farm feel outside."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time and Chris and Danielle’s! Danielle booked us right away for a massage which was AMAZING and I could write another amazing review on it itself. Danielle makes sure her instructions are clear and answers quickly when needed just incase you misplace a remote! The view was beautiful from sunrise to sunset. Easy place to find. It was very clean and felt comfortable. Mini golf on site, cutest place for a fire and friendly cats! Need I say more?! This is the perfect place for some relaxation and resting!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place - exactly as described! We have been coming frequently to Fergus Falls to visit a family member at the vets home, and were happy to discover this lovely place in the country. It's a perfect setup for our needs - we can roll the wheelchair directly into the apartment, and watch TV on the large screen setup. All of the instructions were easy to follow and spot on. Danielle responded to my many questions within what seemed like seconds and not minutes, and took care of all of our requests. I loved the country setting - friendly cats, chickens and lots of places for a walk. Unfortunately it rained most of the time we were there, so I can't speak to the sunsets. Otherwise a perfect trip! We will be back for sure."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was just what we were looking for. It was cozy and clean and meant our Ned. We love the rural setting and wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the walking trails and campfire. The only thing that was a frustration was there were glitches in the texting system when we tried to communicate with them. My texts were not getting through to them but it was finally resolved.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had an amazing stay at Sunset Acres!! It was a very beautiful place, close to town so getting around was very easy and quick! Their local recommendations were great! We went to the Union Avenue pizza place, which was very good! Then we got coffee at Scooters on the way home, which was also good! We also enjoyed the nice walking paths on the property, the mini golf course, and the cats! Danielle and Chris were also very friendly and both greeted us when we arrived! The sunsets were also very pretty!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and easy to find!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our visit to MN was very nice. Coming from AZ it was nice to see the tree colors changing and experience some cooler weather. The set up of the place is great.... private and comfortable. The hosts were respectful of our privacy so much that we never even got to meet Danielle - we did see Chris outside and asked him a few questions about the area. The family was very nice! We will be back in December. Doug and Julie
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place great people
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you have the chance to stay at this property, I would highly recommend it. We had such a lovely visit filled with beautiful views followed by peace and tranquility. The walking paths were lovely and it was always fun to see the cats roaming around! I only wish we could have spent more time on the property, especially to see the sunset and try out the mini golf!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best 12 hours ever spent in an airbnb. It was just a very short overnight stay, but it was great. Excellent value in a beautiful, peaceful setting. The host was kind and responsive and had everything prepped as if a friend was staying.
The trails were an excellent way to stretch our legs after a 12-hour drive, and the kitty cuddles were appreciated.
Would definitely stay again if we find ourselves in the area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cottage was perfect! We stayed here on the last night of our road trip and it was probably the best air bnb we stayed in during the trip. I booked the day of and Danielle responded right away saying we could stay that night. This is the only Airbnb we stayed in that had an actual coffee maker instead of just a Keurig-thank you!! There was even a pack n play for our baby to use which was really handy. I thought I forgot something at the cottage and when I messaged Danielle about it, she went and double checked the cottage right away to make sure we didn’t leave it behind. I really recommend booking with Danielle and Chris."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was easy, peaceful, and a great location. Thank you!!!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolute tranquility! The perfect night stay before a working weekend. The couch and big screen were a comfy and cozy place to unwind before heading out the next day. Wish I had more time to soak in the area and get myself a massage!! Will stay here for sure if I'm ever in the area again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, relaxing environment while traveling for work."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked a somewhat last minute gals weekend with Danielle, and things went perfectly! She managed to book us massages, and invited us to an outdoor movie with their friends and family! The airbnb was great, we got to use the projector for a movie night, cooked meals, and enjoyed some time by the lake at sunset. The little cove where the firepit is was almost magical with the amount of monarch butterflies flying around! And we found tons to do in the area between breweries, the farmers market, ice cream, restaurants, hiking at state parks, and swimming at a beach! We absolutely recommend this place and wouldn't even question visiting Danielle for another weekend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Danielle and Chris’ cottage is a peaceful place to stay in a farm setting by a pretty lake. We got to meet and chat with them and they are lovely people who put their whole heart into making a special experience for their guests. We loved the personal touches inside and out, especially the artwork by the family. We enjoyed watching the birds on the lake during a lovely sunset. They left us chocolates, snacks, and beverages, and we had a good night’s rest in this relaxing place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Danielle and Chris have a wonderful place and are very accommodating! I can’t wait to come back and have another massage and explore more of the lakeside path. Thanks for sharing your wonderful slice of the world with us.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome and peaceful stay out in the country, yet only a few minutes from downtown Fergus Falls. Enjoyed walking the paths alongside the private lake, and the spectacular sunsets. Three nights, three beautiful sunsets! Loved the indoor movie theater, we truly were spoiled. Great mini vacation!
Lots of fun activities to do in the area, we drove to neighboring North Dakota to visit a zoo and the county museum. We also, stopped by to see and take pics of some of strange roadside attractions in this part of Minnesota. Started with Otto the Otter and ended our journey seeing Pete the Pelican in Pelican Rapids. This guest house was just perfect. Thanks"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time at Chris and Danielle's we felt right at home our son loved playing outside, and going for walks on their trails. We did have a lot of rain on the first two days so we stayed inside and we would just get cozy and watch a movie on there in the movie theater screen. Ss someone who does a lot of cooking they had a good spice selection and the kitchen had pretty much everything your needed to cook a meal. In general, everything was labeled which was nice, and if I ever had a question I could just reference the manual and there was the answer. Just a few other things we loved. The shower was awesome and very relaxing. The twin air mattress with bedding made setting up our toddler in the living room really nice. We did lock ourselves out (our bad) at one point and within less than a minute Danielle was heading down to let us back in. They made everything very simple and are extremely responsive! I feel that Chris and Danielle have cracked the code as Airbnb hosts."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to retreat to in the countryside near Fergus Falls. Everything we needed as a couple for a few days of unwinding sans children.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, clean, peaceful, and quiet! Not a single issue during my entire week there. Notable is that the AC was more than adequate for the heat and tropical humidity. Chris & Danielle are wonderful hosts. This was my second stay at their place this year and it was just as enjoyable and relaxing as the first and I look forward to staying there again in the future. What a gem."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had the best time at Danielle and Chris’s AirBnB.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Honestly a really clean place. The host was really responsive which is so important when hosting air bnb’s. We did not have a problem with anything. They have cute postcards with instructions and we really had a great time there. Their house was right across where we were staying at but, it was so quiet and we really respect the privacy they gave us."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I booked this cottage for my in-laws. Overall, they were mostly pleased with the cottage. However, they noticed that there could have been more attention paid to the smaller details. The communication with the hosts was great, and they appreciated the beautiful scenery."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a beautiful place to spend a weekend away! The only thing I would change is that we could fish on their lake, but I understand why! It did make for an amazing view though when we took our evening walk! There is a ton to do here, so if you haven’t been to this part of the state I recommend it! I don’t even think we would have had time for fishing anyway! ;)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I would 100% stay here again, quiet cottage with amazing views! Not far from town but still far enough for a peaceful night in. Hosts were super responsive to all of my questions and we had a great week!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a peaceful and quiet place! Great for sleeping and rest. Enjoyed the movie experience on a bigger than life screen. It had all that I needed for time away.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Danielle and Chris are amazing people! We had a great time.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Words cannot describe how beautiful this place is! I will definitely be coming back. The hosts went above and beyond to make a private little house even more amazing and comfortable. You are close to their home but still feel like you are alone. You can tell the hosts own a spa because everything is super relaxing and invites serenity. Also, keep an eye on the sunset! It didn't look like much and then Bam! Gorgeous. Seriously."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay, and we'll likely stay again! Clean, beautiful area, and nice home theater. Danielle and Chris were nice enough to share their fresh batch of cookies with us!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Pretty close to perfect, by our standards. 5-10 minutes from town, the cottage is out far enough to eliminate all highway noise, and the only sounds were wind in the trees and birdsong. The cottage was spacious, clean, and well furnished. Plenty of windows provided fresh air flow when temps allowed and, when the outside temps got hot, the air conditioner worked wonderfully and quietly. An ample selection of appliances, pots, pans, and tools were supplied in the kitchen. There were plenty of easy-access electrical outlets. The bathroom was spacious with a large shower stall; there were no issues with running out of hot water at shower time. Danielle quickly answered the few questions we messaged to her. The sparse interaction we had with family members was very pleasant. We are already thinking about another vacation in Fergus Falls (we're birders and cyclists) and we want to stay in the Elliott's cottage again when we do."

The space was so very comfortable and clean. we had a lovely stay.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place. I would definitely stay again. I loved that it is a little bit out of town but not too far away from everything. I wish I could have scheduled a massage but they were too full. Next time maybe!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our cozy night here! Danielle and Chris were helpful and flexible with a snowstorm making our travels difficult. The parking and sidewalk were shoveled out. A very private space with blackout curtains for sleeping was nice. We enjoyed watching a movie in the home theater — once again felt very cozy. We were bummed we couldn’t see the sunset with the storm, but the pictures looked gorgeous! Very clean. Nice big spa-like shower. Lots of clear info on how to use everything we needed."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a place to stay near Fergus Falls and have come across Danielle and Chris's listing - book it! I was so thrilled with the entire experience from beginning to end. Hated to leave and can't wait to go back!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first experience using and Airbnb and the experience start to finish and messaging beyond has been nothing but amazing. Right off the bat Danielle was very personable and quick to help me with any questions.
My bonus son and I had a few hiccups because of a blizzard cause of me to arrive at night in awful driving conditions. Danielle and I stayed in contact throughout the day so she knew what to expect from us. Once I got to the college to pick up my son, I the roads were too much to continue to drive 2 more hours in the storm.
I messaged Danielle that we won’t be there to check in as planned but we will head her way as soon as we get up. She wished us a good night sleep.
The next morning I was surprised to see she went ahead and refunded us our first night which she absolutely did not have to do but I was ever so grateful for the help.
Now the stay itself…DO IT.
Also, book a massage. You will thank me later."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the perfect cozy spot for any family get away. The space is the perfect ammount. Our 2 year old thought the kitchen/living room area was perfect for dancing. The views are quiet and beautiful and the home theater great for curling up at. The hosts went above and beyond to add personal touches and share their personal story on how they took a leap of faith to start their business.
We are adding this spot to our favorites and will be sure to book it next time we are in the area."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chris and Danielle had a beautiful place for us to relax and enjoy our time at Fergus Falls. They made it very easy to find and get into our rental. I would highly recommend their AIRBNB to anyone interested in making Fergus Falls a destination!

There was a pack n play for us to use for our 4 month old, drinking water, a full kitchen and the screen was a nice treat for us adults and our 23 month old."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The facility is charming. You will feel as comfortable as being in your own home but with added benefit of all the charm, decor, setting, and hospitality that lets you know you are truly on a vacation getaway!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a peaceful and charming little place with gorgeous sunsets and lots of birdsong. We would open the windows in the evening, then watch the sun go down over the lake before watching movies on the projector. Great sound system too. My husband appreciated the coffee options and it was helpful to have lots of towels provided (day hiking = lots of showers!). Check-in was super easy, not too far from town and the highway, and hosts were super responsive. We would definitely stay again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The hosts were amazing and accommodated us very last minute. It was a beautiful stay and impeccably clean.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place very clean, well kept and great hosts. Beautiful country area only a few minutes from a nice little town. Lots of extras, coffee, tea bags, coffee creamer, snacks, sugar, mayo, mustard, etc. Wonderfully relaxing shower. Guest book info is informative and very well written. Would definitely stay there again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic stay. Beautiful guesthouse and even better people.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Danielle and Chris are friendly and provide a beautiful, secluded, conveniently located property at a great value! We wish we could have had more time there to take advantage of the grounds. We’ll definitely check back when we’re in the area."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place. Mini putt was fun and the movie screen and projector was awesome.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was excellent. The Elliot's pay attention to detail, clean everything very well, and provide so many activities to do. Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location! Comfortable cottage - I stopped with my boys and they loved the open area around us, the putt putt AND the in home theater!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My family and I were utterly delighted by our stay at Danielle and Chris’ place. The surroundings were lovely and the bed was super comfortable.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed staying at this cottage for a few days. It was located in nice quiet spot, & all the animals running on the property were a real treat (especially the cats!). Would definitely recommend & visit again"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Danielle and Chris' Cottage is wonderful~! Quiet, just outside of town with a beautiful little lake where you can sit and enjoy the sunset. The cottage has such nice touches, including their children's art on the walls, and a neat movie screen to watch movies. The bed is SO comfortable and the bathroom in spacious. Definitely a great place to stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We needed to spend one night in Fergus Falls, and this place was perfect. Just a few miles out of town, it felt very rural and quiet. The view of the small lake is lovely, communication was prompt and clear, and it had everything we needed. The hosts left us to ourselves but were very friendly when we asked if they wanted to meet. It was a good value and we will come back if we need to stay in Fergus Falls again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Danielle was so welcoming when we ran into her on the property. The walk around the river was so peaceful and the fire pit was in the perfect location to watch the sunset. The cottage itself was very clean and well kept! Had a great time!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, amazing people. Would recommend 10/10. Expect a cozy quiet place with a touch of farm life and a cozy guest house, LOVED the movie theater!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great little spot away from the hustle and bustle, but close enough to the city you can forget something and not regret it though. We didn’t even have to pack food. We just bought it all when we got there."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're reading this, and you're on the fence about a few other places to stay, rest assured this one is a home run! My wife and I stayed for four nights to celebrate our 10 year anniversary, and our stay was just perfect. The Elliot family made us feel so welcome on their beautiful country property. There is a peace out there that we desperately needed. The cool spring breezes, lakefront view, and wide-open horizon were gorgeous. The cottage was clean, cozy, and everything we were looking for. The home theater setup was perfect for movie nights. They set up a great little patio space where you can watch the Minnesota skyline. You might even get a visit from some sweet kitties!
To be honest, I can't tell you much about Fergus -- we didn't want to leave! But Danielle and her family put together a very helpful little binder of some of their favorite local sights, shops, and eats.
Book a stay here, you won't regret it. I hope we get to come back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Danielle and Chris’ place was clean, spacious and had everything I needed! Their place was perfect for a much needed relaxing weekend :)"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are lookin for a quiet place to get away, this is it!! The Elliotts are very welcoming. The property is serene. The sunset was fantastic! My husband and I needed a break from an 1800-mile, work-related road trip. This was SO much better than staying at a conventional hotel: we had room to lounge, room to wander, room to breathe."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, loved the atmosphere a lot. it was so nice being able to really relax and enjoy myself after being stressed from work. It was so much fun too because of the cute animals and all the great amenities."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was perfect for a weekend away. Had everything we needed and the projector was an awesome addition!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house and country setting was absolutely beautiful. It was the perfect little place to stay (and warm up) after opening a friend’s cottage in cold Battle Lake.
We arrived a little later in the evening than we’d hoped and Danielle and Chris were incredibly accommodating; even allowing us to play a little mini-golf at dusk (in the snow)! ⛳️☃️
We also watched a movie on the big-screen with impressive surround-sound and popcorn! 🍿
We wished we could have taken advantage of the owner’s highly-rated on-site massage parlor (and could have really used it too after a long trip from Detroit, MI), so we will have to return to do that next time!
If you enjoy a little country peace, charm, serene view of the lake, sunset and country… (and of course a little evening fun on the putt-putt course), this is the house!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love love love this cozy little respite! Will definitely be back again. Perfect place to unwind and get away for a night.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! Everything looks just like the pictures. Really comfortable bed, a nice welcome note when I arrived, beautiful art on the wall which left me amazed that they were done by the kids, and will definitely be back again!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re passing through or just need a quick escape, check out this AirBNB in Fergus Falls. Danielle was extremely accommodating, even getting flowers for our arrival for my husbands birthday. The cottage is extremely clean with all the amenities you’d expect. There’s even a drop down projection screen perfect for movies. The walls are adorned with really great artwork from the kids, making this a real family home away from home. We look forward to returning one day."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and clean. Great place to get away to revive.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay . They had an awesome response and helped my family out when we had an unexpected emergency. Beautiful area and so close to anything one would want(food,shopping and entertainment). It was truly enjoyable weekend. So stress free due to Chris and his calm response and immediate help. The mini golf was a blast with the kittens that helped up play. I hope my family can come back. Great getaway, family vacation spot. Or just a place for one to unwind."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Look no further, this place has everything you need. Perfect location, clean, lovely hosts, and so fun!! Can’t write enough positive things about it. We will be back!! :-)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The little house was beautifully decorated with his own photography. The house was a great place to stay for my week in Fergus. I would definitely stay here again
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was as wonderful as it was the first time we stayed. The day of checkout we got lots of rain and thunderstorms and we ended up running late when trying to pack up the car with 3 kiddos all while trying to stay dry.
Rolando pulled up and after introducing himself, let us know to take our time and not to rush ourselves. He was so sweet and accommodating. We will definitely stay each time we make our way up to Fergus."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I hope to come back to Fergus and stay at this location. Very friendly host!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Came up to Fergus for a family emergency that turned into a close member of the family passing away. Being able to return to Rolando’s house and sit on the couch with my family and get cozy in front of the electric fireplace made things a little easier. It felt like staying at a friends house, warm and comfortable."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent in every aspect super comfortable and cozy we enjoy every moment of our stay at the property
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Kaitlyn is a great host, always communicated promptly, I just extended the reservation :)"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, clean, small apartment located downtown Fergus Falls. Quiet, safe location. Restaurants and bars within walking distance. No issues using the keypad to get into the building or apartment. Parking is located in a lot about half a block away (just a heads up). Would stay here again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaitlyn’s AirBnB is just as pictured! Getting to/in the location was extremely easy and the street was very private with low traffic. Perfect for a couples retreat/anniversary in the area! I was very impressed with the Kaitlyn’s responsiveness, willingness to make the stay as good as possible, and flexibility. This unit had a great inner city “loft” style feel, all while being located in Fergus Falls. Cancel that staycation to the Twin Cities, because you will get more for you money here!"
2023-10-01,2.0,Stayed about a week,Great place very clean
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful apartment and great location! Plan to stay in again in the future.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"A very nice, clean,quiet apartment that is conveniently placed. Was a great stay."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Kaitlyn’s place was great for the 1 night we spent in Fergus Falls. It might be a bit small for more than 1-2 people.
Note: If anyone plans to stay on the pullout couch there is beautiful, bright sunlight in the morning!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautifully decorated!
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"It was a very well decorated apartment. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were very soft.
It was not easy to get in as the lock box was cumbersome when holding luggage and the lock was tricky. Once inside there were 2 lights going up the stairs in the hallway that were not on. Probably not something the host can control.
I did not like that I needed to do all of the pre-cleaning such as taking sheets of the bed.
I went to get dishes out of the cupboard and they were not well washed.
My biggest complaint was the smell. It was overwhelming with perfume smell from the glade plug ins. I did unplug them but that smell takes time to go away and my allergies were going insane.
Overall if not for the smell I would stay again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect cozy spot for a couples getaway! We stayed here for an anniversary trip- Perfect Minnesota staycation. The time and effort that went into making this apartment beautiful, cozy, and trendy did not go unnoticed! In walking distance to many great places and easily drivable to other nearby destinations (state parks, breweries, wineries, movie theatre). Only “complaint” was that the front door lock took a bit of getting used to and was finicky to open up but we weren’t in and out of the building too many times for it to really effect our overall stay or impression of the place. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaitlyn’s place is fantastic! Very nicely appointed and impeccably clean. The neighborhood is quaint with nice shops and restaurants all within walking distance. The apartment is in an older building and you must walk up several stairs which I only mention if stairs aren’t your thing. Also, the lockbox that allows you to enter the building can be a little ornery. Once you master that and get to the apartment you will be rewarded with a beautiful place to unwind and enjoy your Fergus Falls stay. Kaitlyn could not have been more responsive and down right delightful! Thank you for the enjoyable stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space was exactly as pictured and described. Spotless, with everything we needed for our stay. Super-convenient location, within walking distance to restaurants, great ice cream shop and local brewing company with nice outdoor seating along the river. And our host was very responsive. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cute place! The pictures make it look bigger than what it is. It worked for our short 1 night stay. Very clean!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cute, clean, and conveniently located downtown Fergus. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a lovely vacation rental, but it is very important for guests wanting to use the sofa bed to note there are absolutely no window coverings in the main living area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed Kaitlyn's apartment. Very clean and decorated so cute. Really homey and comfortable. Great communication and such clear instructions for entry. Definitely will book again when we are back visiting family.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kaitlyn's place was super clean and aesthetic! The bed was comfortable and the place had everything you would need including coffee and creamer, which was a nice touch. Would definitely recommend to stay here if you're looking for a place in Fergus Falls! The only thing I would say (and this is out of Kaitlyn's control) is that if you're a solo female traveler, I would come during the day--for parking you will have to park in a public lot and walk a block or so to get to the place."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,really sweet cozy apartment at a great price. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little apartment that was perfect for a week stay in Fergus for work! Thanks for being a great host Kaitlyn!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We would for sure stay again! Super cute place and very responsive host. Thank you!!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We’ll described and great location in lake country. Would have liked curtains in the living room/kitchen area to keep out the morning sun for those using the hidabed. Lots of stairs to get to the floor where the room is, but worth the rental fee."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute as a button and location was fabulous. Nice touches, hair dryer and quality shampoo and conditioner, etc. There are a few things that could have made it a 5 star. Number 1, would be easier entry. We would have preferred a key but a lock box is at entry and the key is required to stay in the box. We were in and out and many times carrying things. It was cumbersome coming and going. The other is to note that there is not air conditioning in the one bedroom. We had a hot sleepless night the first night. It would have been nice to know. The next day we found a fan in the closest which helped. The other is the long check out list of cleaning. I always keep my stays very tidy but to pay a good cleaning fee and have a long list at check out was tedious. On of the many items on the list was , The trash had to be taken out a few flights of stairs and down the alleyway outside. There are definitely positives to this rental, fun location and great building."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's a really nice place! I appreciated that the AC was on when I arrived."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very adorable small apartment in the downtown area of Fergus Falls. I enjoyed all of the little touches in the apartment (it had a quirky lovely sayings on the walls, cute mugs, etc). The space is smaller than the pictures make it seem, but since it was just me that was no big deal at all!
The key to get in is a bit tricky, but manageable. The one thing I wish I had realized was the amount of steps to get up to the place.
Overall was a really cute and fun place to stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kaitlyn was flexible about a last minute extension, since it was available for an extra day. Super responsive to messages and friendly! Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable, cozy, and well-appointed apartment that was just perfect for our needs.

Beautiful surroundings but I just wish the lake we had access to was good for swimming. But of course, that was listed in description and we knew that ahead of time. But the hot tub does not disappoint!"

Kids didn't even miss tv (which tons of dvds are provided), but with all the arts and crafts, toys and games for all ages provided screen time wasn't missed. Still had lots of snow and the sledding was a big hit (sleds provided) there's also an ice rink and nets on the lake available. Between the ping pong, Foosball, pool and air hockey everyone had so much fun. The hot tub was an added bonus. Lots of memories were made. Tanya, the host, was very helpful through the entire process and answered all questions. She was great to work with. The pictures don't do it justice and would definitely recommend this place for a family and friends get together without hesitation."

2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"The ""Gathering Place"" is amazing! We have a large family and everyone had a warm cozy bed to sleep in. Every area of the home was warm and inviting. The kitchen is big and has every thing needed to make and serve our meals.
The game room was a hit with everyone! We were blessed with a huge snowfall the evening we arrived, so the sledding hill right out the back was great. Those of us who were not up to venturing out in the cold could enjoy the the fun with a great view from the windows. We also loved the area in the garage for all the wet snow gear! Our grandchildren were entertained, on the last morning of our stay, by an otter family on the pond. Tanya is a wonderful host! We appreciate her attention to detail and her prompt responses to all our questions. My granddaughter said as we were packing up to leave, ""We didn't stay long enough, Grandma! Next time we need to stay a week"" ❤"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,It will be beyond your exceptions. Get ready for an awesome experience.

You’ll find everything you need as there are labels and extra supplies provided throughout the home. Plenty of beds and separate living areas for a little extra privacy. Our favorite part was the entertainment area. We spent the majority of our time indoors, and there was never a dull moment because this home has so much to offer! The host was very responsive and had excellent communication. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place and will definitely visit again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing place. Well stocked, well labeled and excellent layout. House is large with many sleeping options including the awesome lookout loft.

2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wow, this place was absolutely amazing! Hands down best ever Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. The best memories of my life were made here and I will cherish them forever. Tanyas communication was great, the lodge has EVERYTHING you need, the beds were so comfortable, and there is so much to do there! This place was so warm and welcoming and fun. Not only that but the Lakes Area Paddle company that you can rent a pontoon from are so nice and great communicators as well. 10/10 highly recommend the Gathering Lodge! Thank you , Tanya!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home is huge and there are so many beds. The mattresses were very comfortable and the blankets were super soft. The kitchen is the best stocked kitchen I have seen in a rental. We even received a welcome basket from the host. We took full advantage of the kayaks, canoe and paddle boat. It was a nice perk. The only downside was we got notified the day before that they were temporarily using their shop on the property to run their business out of so they have clients coming and going each of the days of our stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I'm not sure where to start my review about The Gathering Place. I've stayed in quite a few rentals in my travels, both reserved on my own or by other friends/family. I'll start by saying it is certainly one of the nicest, most well-stocked places I have ever stayed. It's even more spacious than it looks in photos-there's plenty of indoor and outdoor spaces for a large group. The kitchen is one of the most well stocked kitchens I have every used in my airbnb travels-you'll find just about everything you need to cook for a large group there, and then some. It's definitely set up to cook for a large group. There's plenty of sleeping spaces and nooks and crannies for quiet reading time or playing games or taking naps. There's enough bathroom space for everyone in the group-which is frequently lacking in other rentals. There's more than enough towels, hot tub towels, and beach towels for everyone-and every drawer/closet is labeled for easy access to supplies. The game room is fabulous, the hot tub is fabulous, the sandbox and playhouse/swingset was great for the kids. We so appreciated having the paddleboat, kayaks and canoe-we kayaked all over Swan Lake. And, although the water levels are low near the cabin, we were able to rent a pontoon from Lake Area Paddle Sports (another highly recommended company!) and navigate it back and forth between the cabin access point and the main lake. We had a BLAST on the pontoon. Finally-the hosts. They have been nothing but wonderful from the time of booking to the day we departed. They responded promptly to any questions we had and kept us informed of directions, access, and anything else we needed to know during our stay. The welcome basket with snacks and coffee from a local roaster was a really nice touch. Our only regret was that we weren't staying longer. It went by so fast! I would highly recommend this place for large groups-you will create wonderful ""forever"" memories here."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed with a group of 18 for a joint bachelorette party. Everyone was absolutely blown away with this space and wished we could stay longer. The host has excellent communication. The space itself provided endless entertainment with all of its amenities. We especially loved that every room was wired with a built in sound system. The lake was pretty mucky as we haven’t had much rain but we had a blast taking the canoe/kayaks/paddle boat out! Every cabinet and drawer is labeled so things are easy to find. The kitchen was fully stocked so cooking for our big group was a breeze. The hosts had a fun welcome basket and provided any small extras we had forgotten (shampoo, toothbrush, etc.). The cabin is HUGE (bigger than it looks in pictures) and everything was very clean. These hosts have thought about every last detail. We can’t say enough about this space! We will definitely be back again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location with tons of space!!!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Property was well maintained and the beds were incredibly comfortable. This property was well equipped with all the necessary and essential supplies. The hosts were very accommodating to our requests. Great functioning internet and a fabulous game room. The ping pong table in the garage was a really big hit.

This is the perfect place for a winter get away. our weekend was jammed packed with sledding, snowmobiling, fishing, soaking in the hot tub, playing games and enjoying each other company."
2021-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Has to be one of the best places I’ve ever stayed! Very spacious and I love how everything is labeled so it’s easy to find things in such a big house. My group had a blast(:
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is beautiful and extremely comfortable. The design and floor plan give all members of the group their own space, and then some. We appreciated the attention to detail: very clean, clear signage for how things worked, plentiful towels, high quality furniture and bedding, and plenty of options for things to do. Tanya and Bill are local owners and were extremely responsive if we needed anything and even shoveled out the sidewalks and driveway almost immediately. The property is great for any group size and is very kid-friendly as well! We would definitely stay here again."
2020-12-01,5.0,Group trip,I highly recommend Tanya’s house. They were a nice family. The house is an amazing value and did not feel crowded at all even with a big group. It’s a great winter location with sledding and ice fishing opportunities and would be a dream location for the summer.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lovely home to gather with friends or family. Spaces felt roomy even with a full house!
Everyone had something to do. From littles to teens and adults.
Owners were very responsive to questions."
2023-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"Really the only complaint is the the bathtub was very slippery and my mother and father came with who are borderline handicap. Otherwise, the place is super clean very well taken care of. Shows absolute pride of ownership. it would’ve been nice to have nice to have a few toys for the lake, Nothing major just a kayak or a canoe. The views were amazing."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice Lake house, a few of the patio chairs had been broken but other than that the house was spotless and it was a very peaceful stay. stainless steel cookware can be a bit tricky though"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed the house, lakeshore, dock, loons and campfires. It was a great beach for the grandkids to play on. The lake is so clean. The deck was nice to enjoy early mornings on as well as during the day. The dock and boat lift were very nice to have. Grandkids had fun fishing from the dock too.
The living room furniture could use an update. Otherwise everything else was very nice."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family had a fabulous time. The sandy beach was wonderful for the two children to play in as it had a gradual slope. The water was crystal clear, plus there was hardly any boat traffic on the lake. We were able to rent kayaks and paddleboards from a nearby town. The company delivered and picked them up."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay here on Lake Jewett! Very clean and well-kept house. It is very well supplied and furnished. We had a great time!

The house was well stocked - beds were comfortable- kitchen tools were all there. Our grandkids loved the beach area. Was a great week for our family!
,,,This location is near Alice Lake. I arrived late and was taken back by the musty smell of the house. It seemed that every time I looked at something it was not as the pictures were online and it was filthy. I failed to contact host while there as I had schedule events during my stay. I was just out of the time frame. The host was aware of the differences from real and online pictures. Offered $50 refund. In my opinion the issues could not have resolved during my stay and the refund should have been at least half! I will not recommend this or other locations hosted by the same couple.
