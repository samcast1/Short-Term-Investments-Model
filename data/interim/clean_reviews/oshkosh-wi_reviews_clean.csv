2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 2nd time staying at Twyla's, and it was as good as the first! We love this quaint, quirky, cozy place."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as advertised and as others had described on reviews. Clean and cozy.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little apartment to stay in for visits and we'll definitely book with Kyla again if it's available next time we're in Oshkosh! The apartment is well stocked with anything you might need and Kyla was proactive to reach out during out visit to see if we needed anything! I expected a small, cramped place based on the pictures and was pleasantly surprised by how spacious it actually was. The furnishings and decor were great and well thought out, it left us feeling like were staying in someone's home rather than some cheap hotel like many places do. The little gifts are thoughtful and certainly unexpected, showing that Kyla doesn't treat you like just another customer, you truly are a guest."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great little spot, comfortable, and all amenities provided! Will definitely stay again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the stay very much. Great location for our needs and very affordable. Thanks for a helping make a fun weekend great!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we had a wonderful stay it was a very nice place for the weekend.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Words cannot express how much every one of us loved Kyla’s place - from the instant we set foot into the place until the moment we had to leave!! Comfy, creative and inviting decor. Everything you could ever need in every room and more - kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms, living room. Truly relaxing and heartwarming weekend!! Cannot wait to visit again!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is super cute (decorations). Nearly everything you could need is there. Kyla's parents are really nice. They left a few surprises too.
Internet speed was great (over 200 mbps). Off-street parking. Had AC but only in the living room and bedroom with two beds. A fan would have been nice for the master bedroom.
There is a street light that streams into the master bedroom but I do travel with a sleep mask so it wasn't too annoying.
I did have a few issues (three) with the keypad not working - they said it was the first time it happened. Hopefully the issue gets identified and fixed for future guests. They did quickly refund me the base rate for the night I was unable to get into the property due to the lock issue.
The stairs from the first floor landing to the unit are rather narrow due to the ""turning"" so this could be a difficult unit for someone with mobility issues to get into.
All in all, a good stay. If my son stays where he's at, I'll stay here again in the futur"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Convenient location and a very well-kept apartment close to the heart of downtown Oshkosh. Kyla was a great host that had check-in details and all other logistics perfectly laid out to make our trip to Oshkosh care free.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The entry way was amazing and interesting. The Airbnb is just as decorated and special.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice place to stay, a quirky but not to quirky
Friendly they went above and beyond downtown is very nice lots of shops,farmers market and some bands on the square
We would stay again"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a quirkily and delightfully decorated apartment in an older building close to downtown, convenient to the farmer's market and some good restaurants. It was cozy, charming and well-stocked with everything we would need. The owner left us some treats, which was very thoughtful (and delicious!). We will definitely return."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome stay.really neat design schema
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kyla is always helpful, everything was great and the amenities are unique. Thank you very much!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay in Oshkosh. The apartment itself was extremely charming and the balcony was great for morning coffee and breakfast. The location was a few blocks from Main Street and we really enjoyed being able to walk to the Farmers Market they hold on Saturdays.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kyla made my first stay at an airbnb simply outstanding. She was always responsive to messages (and I had many), kind, and full of information to make our stay seamless. The check in process was simple. The description of the property and amenities were spot on. All the extras included in the bathroom, such as shampoo, body wash and other toiletries, hairdryer, curling iron, first aid kit, bath salts and special lotions were incredible. The bed was super comfortable and the property is located in a quiet neighborhood. The little kitchen had everything we needed. When we realized the refrigerator was not cooling properly on day two of our stay, Kyla was immediately responsive and brought over a small refrigerator so our food would not spoil. What can I say about the fun and unique decor? Loved all the little quirky and fun things that were lovingly placed in the space. I would love to come back when we are in the area!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kyla's place was super fun -- so much to see inside the apartment alone! The decor was very lively and artistic. We received a surprise donut delivery one morning, and great suggestions to visit the local farmer's market. The place was very clean and offered many amenities, and was just a quick walk to Main St in Oshkosh, where we found some great coffee shops, bars, and some fun shopping."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved it! Super funky and cozy! Great for a weekend away with our littles. Lots of pillow options, cozy furniture and great shower pressure. We loved our stay and would stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy to find and check in. Rooms were very clean.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Oshkosh! Very comfortable and we loved the artistic decor!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely stay there again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. Loved all the little decorations and all the items that the host included in the case we forgot something. We felt extremely welcomed here.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a very cool and unique AirBnB. From the moment you step into the atrium and head up to the apartment, the whole thing feels like a work-of-art, or like you stepped into a theater. Interesting antiques, movie posters, and other decorations throughout. Very quiet, peaceful, relaxing and cozy. Lots of personal touches and it’s clear the host(s) take pride in their space. Everything is very thoughtfully laid out. Lots of cool, artsy utensils and kitchen items. Big fridge if you need to store groceries. Immaculately made beds, and snacks and tea and other things set out if you need or want them. This is the second time I have stayed at this AirBnB and I hope to stay again next time I am in town. Highly recommend. Thank you for another great stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very adorable 🥰
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best thing is the bathroom*, especially if you just arrived and it’s super cold from the windy lake breeze. Why, because the heating vent is right next to the toilet, cooks you back into normal temperatures. Very nice for couples with young children especially if you have a baby, Kyla provides a large mirror that lays around 6ft by 3ft. A nestled area with 1/4 inch thick rug surrounded with abc, youth friendly, and wholesome books. Nice Johnson & Johnson baby lotions, soaps, and shampoos.
Great water pressure, so great shower experience, watch out for the little discretion of lightly warm water, to that melt your skins heat. Big tub so if you wanted to share the moment y’all aren’t going to have a toe jammin war for that water.
*(good toilet paper, not no Scott’s but that sweet, soft, strong. Charmin ultra-soft.)
The kitchen was a literal hurdle to different age, but it justiciable because many Wisconsin homes are over a 100yr old.
Little balcony. Beds don’t creak at all, its a blesn"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really cute place, very clean and lots of personal touches! Being so close to the college campus was really convenient for why we were in Oshkosh, but we could hear students partying outdoors until late at night. Kyla was great about getting the portable air conditioning set up on an unseasonably warm weekend which was so helpful!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy stay! We really enjoyed our time here. Great amenities, within walking distance of bars and restaurants. Quiet neighborhood. Kyla was great about checking in if we needed anything."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very lovely decorated and cozy place to stay, we enjoyed and can definitely recommend!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Very clean and exactly as listed. Loved the little extras that were provided!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place with tons of extra amenities and thoughtful touches. And very clean! Thank you!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Everything is very nice and cozy. Convenient and practical.
There were no problems.
I advise everyone.
I will return if the need arises."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Charming and Cozy! This apartment is so cute! The host made sure that we had everything that we could possibly need and then some. The location is perfect! I was able to walk downtown and enjoy the Saturday farmers market, boutiques and restaurants. The stay definitely gets a 10 out of ten 10!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location downtown. Go and check out the farmers market while you’re here every Saturday! It was great! Located near historical homes and very short drive to nice trails and parks. Great value for what you’re getting we would absolutely stay here again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was so adorable and in the perfect area for what we needed. I recommend this place if your getting away for a weekend and want plenty of places walking distance.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Quirky but rather charming. The bedrooms and bath are fine but the kitchen is pieced together in a tight attic which is barely manageable. The best part is Kyla who is wonderfully responsive. We would stay here again.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy little apartment was so incredibly charming! We can not express enough how awesome this stay was. If you're an artsy fartsy, this ones for you. The detail and attention Kyla put into this apartment really speaks to her dedication to being an incredible host. Absolutely recommend 10/10! Fast response and eager to accommodate. Thank you for a great weekend getaway!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well-located, just what we needed for our visit and clean as a pin. Eclectic decor, nicely done. We had everything we needed and then some."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice spot! Clean and well taken care of.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second time staying at this location. The host is very responsive and everything was as we expected. Will definitely be back.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Aiden's home was comfy and cozy. He has gone the extra mile to provide all the essentials you'll need. The beds were comfortable, and the shower has a rain shower head and plenty of hot water. Light switches were a mystery at first as to what they went to I would suggest bringing an extention cord or two."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We felt very at home in Aiden’s place. The beds were so comfortable with quality linens. The kitchen was well equipped. The shower in the bathroom is very nice. The washer and dryer with laundry detergent and dryer sheets was great. Neighborhood is very quiet. A short walk to the lake. Look forward to staying there again.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was pretty cozy and in a good central location to the rest of Oshkosh, had an issue with the dyer and being down which wasn't disclosed until after i asked why it wasn't working when i went to dry my laundry but Aidan was quick enough to respond and help come to a solution for the problem. Other than that place was nice and cozy, well laid out internally as well."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! Upstairs neighbors lied on me and I was threatened with eviction due to that, but I'm very understanding and respectful so I'm not going to blame the host and leave a negative/bad review. From a business/ renter point of view the host was very professional and respectful. if you're looking for a nice quiet clean place this is 100% the place for you."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Aidan's place accommodated my needs for my trip I would come back
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a great stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had fun in Oshkosh during restaurant week.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy is the right word. It was a comfortable 2 large bedrooms for my husband and I and our adult daughter. Nice size kitchen and bathroom. While we didnt use the laundry they were large capacity machines. Might suggest shades for the bedroom with the French doors, but otherwise a very comfortable space."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Oshkosh. House was very nice and the owner was easy to work with! Highly recommend!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super comfortable and small apartment. The beds were very comfortable. The smart TV was a nice addition to sign into our accounts for our shows.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice place to stay. We were able to bring our dog. Well equipped place with everything you may need in a kitchen. Aiden communicated well and helped with any questions. In the summer it is probably a pretty area because it is so close to the water.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Aidan was a great host and very responsive to any questions we had. Would highly recommend and definitely stay again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was super comfortable. Nice safe neighborhood to walk around. Lake is right around the corner. We enjoyed our stay! Thanks again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This spot is an awesome value! We were so appreciative of having our dog with us and really enjoyed having a place that fits our needs of the weekend.
The kitchen island with 5 stools was awesome for hanging out and catching up with our group at the end of every night. Kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed. Beds and bathroom were comfy and stocked also stocked well.
I loved all the photos included with check-in instructions to simplify the process. I feel this is a great value and photos/descriptions match the listing. We would stay here again & definitely recommend to others :)"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Lovely neighborhood and host! We will be back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute and cozy Airbnb. Short drive to a beautiful park off Lake Winnebago. The home is located central to a lot of popular tourist destinations/parks which is exactly why we picked it. Airbnb had 2 wall ac units which worked great. It was easy to find and had plenty of parking.
Thanks!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very comfortable stay! Big beds, nice shower! Very cute!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We found this place to be a place we could look forward to returning to each day. Felt home like after a day.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute apartment! Clean, comfortable and most of all affordable.
The unit was kept cool by the AC units. Bed was amazing and super comfortable. Overall we loved this adorable apartment for our weekend get away.
Neighborhood was quiet and close to everything."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Aidan’s place was great, we enjoyed our stay very much! The a/c’s kept the apartment very cool and everything was as described. We felt very comfortable there and it was super clean with all the utensils needed to cook anything you need. Overall great place to stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We booked this rental because it was close to Oshkosh for the air show. It was nice to come back after a long day and sit and relax in this home. The beds were large and comfortable. I have a hard time sleeping even at home and I slept like a rock both nights. Having the laundry room available was a bonus. I was able to come back home and have one less thing to do as a busy mom.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stayed at the house for Oshkosh and will probably book next year! The air conditioning was very nice for the hot weather. Host is extremely responsive and helpful.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy house was exactly as expected, located in a neighborhood just a couple blocks from Lake Winnebago and close to the event we were attending. My husband & I felt right at home with all the amenities and comforts we could want. The rooms were spacious and the bed we slept on was VERY comfortable. The 2nd BR has an enormous CA King which looked equally inviting if you have more travelers. The kitchen is stocked with everything you need. The bathroom was spacious, clean & updated. It was quiet and so inviting that we brought our local friends over to see it in case they had Oshkosh visitors in the future. We highly recommend this property!
I also want to add: there were no bugs, it smelled wonderful, the bed was super comfy, it was quiet, and the window air conditioners kept the space very cool...exactly the opposite of the negative comments left by a previous guest. The driveway is narrow (it's stated in the description) but we maneuvered it quite well in our full sized SUV."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfy, homey. Only wish there would have been complimentary coffee available. Otherwise, it was fantastic!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable. Excellent communication.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had just a quick one night stay at Aidan's place, and didn't need anything too over-the-top as we were going to be out and about most of the time.
The place looked as it did in the photos, and in a quiet neighborhood. Good price compared to some of the surrounding options!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,What Boyd said
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute place 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom house. Nice size kitchen with table and chairs at the kitchen bar. Window air conditioning unit cooled the kitchen at living room nicely. The bedrooms had large standing fans and ceiling fans to help with cooling the rooms. Good parking in the backyard. Within walking distance of the lake. Overall cute house, nice, quiet location."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had such an amazing time staying at Aidan’s place. Very clean, spacious and comfortable! Thank you letting us stay at your home!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for a weekend in June. Clean space and Aidan was very responsive to any questions I had. Not much to say, but I was satisfied with my stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Aidan’s place. It was exactly as described in a quiet neighborhood close to the lake, with everything we needed for an extended stay. The beds were extremely comfy, great WiFi, huge tv, washer and dryer, and convenient parking right outside the back door. We cook a lot and the kitchen was well appointed with all the basics and then some. Aidan was quick to respond to questions and we had zero problems during our long stay. Highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Aidans place was so cute, airy and welcoming! Close to the lake and walking trail as well as a quick drive to Main Street, which has lots of great restaurants and local shops! Loved my quick stay at Aidans place!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was a great place to stay and perfect for what we needed it for. Felt right at home. Definitely recommend staying here if you’re ever in the area! If you’re traveling with a boat, the driveway was a little tight for it but we made it work! Either way it was a great experience."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I enjoyed my stay at Mark's home. It was beautifully decorated, clean and had all the amenities needed for a stay. Check in was simple with clear instructions ahead of time. I was able to concentrate on work while there...which was much appreciated."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place and clean. Thank you for letting us stay with our Great Dane.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Thanks for hosting!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a cozy home! Very clean and beautifully decorated. Would recommend staying at Mark’s place!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great house and very helpful host. There are about three parking spots end to end in the driveway, which is good, because despite the lack of signs on the street, the city tickets for street parking without a permit."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a pleasure staying at Marks properties while visiting the area for work.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mark's place on Oak St had eye-catching accessories & was clean. He had everything necessary for our stay to be comfortable. The place was short a couple items for our lenghty stay. We contacted Mark who had the items sent over within a couple hours.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was exactly how it was described by home owner. Loved how peaceful the community is as well. Interior is lovely and amenities are well described as well. I would stay at Marks place again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice home and comfortable beds
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was spacious, nice and clean. My wife and I, including our fur babies enjoyed our stay. Mark also has great recommendations, don’t hesitate to book."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We fell in love with Wisconsin! Mark’s place was so cute and well cared for. The fan in the bedroom and complementary box of chocolates were a nice touch. The coffee was our favorite. Thanks for having us!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thanks for the nice stay and for accommodating our needs!
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mark was responsive. When I questioned him wanting to me to log into a third party website to get check-in info, he adjusted so that I could access the info without needing to input my personal info. The location and neighborhood were good, as was the cute little house. Nice TV. We enjoyed walking around the area.
However, when we entered, there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke, even though the house rules adamantly state no smoking. There were 3 Glade Plug-ins throughout the house and they made the smell worse. We opened all the windows. We stayed 2 nights and had to wash all of our clothes afterwards to get out the smoke smell, even items we had not worn. A box of chocolates for us looked like it had been there for months. Many pieces of furniture had stains. The beds did not have mattress pads and the pillows did not have pillow protectors. The sheets and blankets were synthetic fabrics that did not breathe. The cushions on the deck furniture were ripped and falling apart."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great choices
Things to do nearby:"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was impeccably clean. It had snowed prior to our arrival and Mark sent someone right away to clear the snow
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was heaven sent for our trip. We booked it last minute. It felt like we were in a very pristine house and slept like kings and queens on the beds.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Mark's place is great. Just a block away from the lake and a 5 minute drive to downtown restaurants. It snowed several times while I was there, he was great about making the drive way and stairs to the home clear of snow and ice. The kitchen is great, good range of cookware and tools. We enjoyed our stay very much."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,I unfortunately had to cancel but Mark refunded me about a third of what I paid
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great comfortable stay in Oshkosh!

You could really tell that they thought of everything and we really appreciated it. We will definitely be staying here again if it's available. There is also a very nice little park with ponds and fountains nearby. Everything was just lovely."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we’ve stayed ! Same Great experience as last year. Quiet , clean , had everything we needed , plus the milk , juice and gluten free cereal snacks were so helpful , so that we didn’t need to bring coolers up the stairs !! WiFi worked great, and was important cause I needed to do some remote work there . Neighbor was also very friendly and showed us some newborn kittens 😊. Next trip we hope to have time to sit on deck and explore the park that’s about a block away . Thanks Rose 😊"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great. The only downside was that the shower drain was a bit clotted so there was a puddle that build up. Besides that Rose’s place felt super homey and it had everything that I needed. I also appreciate all the little things in the bathroom cabinet. I forgot my dry shampoo and there was some for me. Thanks for the quick breakfast & drinks!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely lovely, clean, quiet. Rose was very responsive and helpful. Will definitely stay again."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,They place was very clean. I liked food beverages and breakfast items. I also like the many personal hygiene and bathroom products available.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stay every year as I do a craft show near there annually. What a surprise to find the pajama pants that I left there last year sitting on the table. Thank you Rose for a wonderful stay!

Wonderful place, if we ever end up in the area again we’ll be sure to be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was a return trip to Rose’s. We enjoyed the quiet neighborhood with a nice city park only a short walk away. Great host with many extras to make our stay very enjoyable. Thanks again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"rose's place includes the entire upstairs of an old refurbished house in downtown oshkosh. you have everything right there--large bedroom w/2 beds, kitchen which is well furnished and has cereal, milk, drinks etc. bath is clean. there is also a living/eating area. the neighborhood is peaceful and has an historic vibe. there is a nice backyard if you want to spend time outside. its very centrally located, for example the eaa site is just 5 minutes away.
the place is good value, but unfortunately the taxes are (to me) shockingly high. i guess its the way oshkosh funds its government! not rose's fault.
didnt meet rose, but had quite interesting chats with donn. he is a wealth of information and a very nice fellow."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super easy check in and great communication. 😊 Place was cozy and great for a nice weekend getaway from Chicago and closer to hiking. Didn’t see much of the town but was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant a couple of blocks away called Jeff’s on rugby that Rose mentioned. Good fish fry! Parking behind the house was super convenient. The upstairs unit was really well stocked and she had so many snacks and water and anything you could need. The bed was comfortable both mattress and sheets. Having a kitchen was also convenient. The heater worked well so it really was nice and cozy and at one point we spent time reading on the nice chairs in the living room area. The shower is a little small which was totally fine with us but just noting in case that matters to you/you are a larger person. It was great having a totally private space with a full bathroom and kitchen! We didn’t use the kitchen but it seemed fully stocked. We also didn’t meet Rose which was fine since we were out hiking for the three days but we heard amazing things about her. Maybe next time! The block was super quiet and peaceful.

Residential neighborhood. Chain stores and restaurants within two miles, local places nearer.
Fox River Riverwalk about a half mile away. A nice big park 1/4 mile away. I enjoyed walking and biking. A little dark for reading (I had to move a light) and I bumped my head a couple times on slanted ceilings in the corners (I'm six feet tall). A very good experience."

Rose had a variety of snacks set out for us, along with breakfast foods, fresh milk and fresh fruit.
The apartment was clean, warm, and nicely decorated; in a quiet neighborhood with nearby restaurants, stores and activities.
We’ll absolutely stay at Rose’s for future visits to the Oshkosh area.

If there was any downside, it was not having a kitchen table, but thankfully it was beautiful outside for us to eat."

It was a pleasure to stay the weekend with 2 friends, though many more could have fit as the full finished basement offered lots of extra room. We enjoyed cooking in the well laid out kitchen. We also enjoyed the view of the lake from the front or back yards. Oshkosh is a quaint college town that was worth visiting for a quick weekend trip. I'd love to go again and hope this house will be available, as I felt very at home."

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very beautifully updated Character Home with gorgeous original-looking wood windows, doors, and trim - and everything else nicely and tastefully modern, a refurbishing that feels high-end. Home felt very clean. For instance, the bathroom mats had been cleaned. There is a very large Maytag washer and dryer combo in the basement. Our kids seemed to like the beds. Our bed seemed pretty good, not lumpy and not creaky. It seemed to be memory foam which is not my personal preference but given the high quality of all of the touches, I assume it was on the expensive side. I was excited to share how beautifully done this home was - I had my Wisconsin family members stop by and meet us there before we went out on an excursion. Also yes, it really is just steps away from public access to Lake Winnebago and a short 10 min walk to Menominee park / zoo. Great place and we will definitely want to stay there again for our next trip."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, very clean, wonderfully comfortable beds, and quiet neighborhood."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I thought the house was absolutely perfect. It literally is half a block from the lake shore, and about 5 minutes to downtown. The space is incredibly clean, very modern with the cozy space. This property could easily accommodate 3-4 couples or groups of 8. Everything is updated and passed touch of extra things provided; outdoor grill, towels, dishes, laundry utilities (very helpful when you're sandy from the beach or stuck in a torrential downpour!!) etc. Love the stereo sound system as well. The neighbors were friendly, they would wave and say hello. Parking was great as we had 3 vehicles, the driveway allowed 2 and the entire street on 2 sides had parking.I would definitely stay here again. Shane always responded to my inquiries within minutes and allowed us an early check-in. The entire experience was awesome."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice house only steps away from Lake Winnebago. Close to a nice park with a zoo and close to downtown. Two bedrooms are on the first floor and the third is in the basement with a full bath. The place was very nice and clean, well-maintained and updated. Note that there is no dining room table. Worked out great for my sister and I and our five children."

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Shane's airbnb while we were in town for a wedding and we couldn't have been happier! It was close to the water, zoo, and downtown area and the self-check-in was quick and simple. The rooms were extremely comfortable (I let Shane know the two friends we stayed with felt they had the best sleep in a while on their beds) and we were very happy with how clean and spacious the house was. This would be a great spot for a small group lake getaway weekend."

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very straightforward and easy place. Owner was communicative, and beds were comfy. The downstairs space could use some side tables, which, if that’s the worst thing you can say about somewhere, is easily fixable! Thanks for letting us stay st your home."

Six of us (students) stayed here for two weeks while we completed required labs at UW-Oshkosh. The house is cozy and feels like home. It has all the amenities you need: a nice kitchen, garage parking, internet, comfortable beds and living area, as well as ample bedding, towels, soap, etc.
I would definitely stay here again."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was a great little find in Oshkosh, WI. Having 3 young children, staying in a hotel is not really the best option for us and up until now, that is what we have had to do when visiting family in Oshkosh. The house was clean, easy to get to, and close to everywhere we were going. When we arrived, we found Shane shoveling the driveway as there was recent snow and he was so friendly and welcoming. He is very responsive and eager to assist in anyway. Definitely will stay here again when we come back to visit family (if it isn't already booked.)"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay at this home over the Christmas holidays. Plenty of space for two families with young children. Home has been completely remodeled recently and shows well. The host is helpful and communicates promptly. Would recommend and use again.

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a gem of a place! This house was everything we needed for my family and then some! Location is great for the town and the amenities inside were top notch. The finished basement provided a great space of separation for us with a little one. Shane was a great host and very communicative. 10 out of 10 will definitely stay again should we find ourselves back in Oshkosh!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just an overnight stay. Got in late but needed a place to stay after a family get together. Place was nice with hardwood floors and modern appliances. Place was well kept. Since the arrival was late, I hope it wasn’t an issue"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was clean and cozy. Perfect for our stay. Train went by a lot but never blew its horn so all we heard was a slight rumble. Not loud at all. We would stay there again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay! Nice house and area! Great hosts!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for 5 nights and had a great experience, the house was exactly as described and Ashley, our host was very helpful and responsive"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The house was exceptional value and there were no surprises. I was worried that the train noise would disrupt sleep but it wasn't loud, probably due to speed restrictions in the city. The kitchen is a bit small without room for a large table to eat at, but for a couple or small family it was easy enough to adapt to, and reasonable for the price. It was easy to get to the grocery store, and other shopping. The hosts were willing to adust our reservation on short notice when we needed to arrive a day earlier. We would stay here again if it were available."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"I really enjoyed how comfortable Ashley’s place was! I visited with my son and there was plenty of space for the two of us. Lots of entertainment choices, like multiple TVs and a pool table. Nice dishes and bakeware and a Keurig for coffee. The beds were VERY comfortable and we slept excellent! While we had a pleasant stay, there were a couple of things that could have been improved upon. The window lock in the main bedroom didn’t lock properly (easy fix I’m sure) and I was charged for towels that I’m positive I didn’t take. It’s so silly and random and I’m sure it’ll be resolved. Also, the pool sticks needed chalk. And the laundry detergent was empty but of course, I bought my own :-) other than a couple of small amenities I’d have liked, it was a nice stay and would recommend to travelers!!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great mini getaway. Great access to many local places to explore and walk around. Home was clean and cozy!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lovely place to stay, cosy and comfy, coming over from the UK I needed a place to stay for my second month of being here with my partner. Ashley was quick to respond and was helpful and friendly throughout my stay.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was a lovely, small home to stay at. The area was very safe and close to the lake for a great view. There were no issues with amenities and when there was a blizzard the hosts were incredibly helpful by snow blowing the drive and sidewalk. Would really recommend if trying to get away on a small vacation with another couple or as a family."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at a lovely home!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home. Clean and exactly as described. Checking in and out were both easy. Best of all, a great value!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. My son and I were in town for the Chargers-Packers game. Not too far from Lambeau, quiet, and out of the way. Close to Lake Winnebago, which would have been nice in the summertime. Pool table in the basement was a bonus. My son and I used it every night for some epic pool battles. Home was clean, neighborhood was quiet, and we didn't notice the train that a previous guest mentioned. Stores, gas stations, and restaurants are within a few miles, great location. Loved our time in Oshkosh, and would definitely recommend Ashley's place."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great play to stay
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley's house was my perfect home away from home. It was so convenient - literally down the street and around the corner from my daughter's. The house is so cozy! The kitchen was great. The bed was really comfortable - I slept very well! The shower is fantastic. I don't know what the shampoo and conditioner are in the dispenser in the shower but they are lovely. All in all, my new favorite place to stay in Oshkosh!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved how cozy and homely the place was,really nice hosts A+..."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We needed a short term place to stay during a job transition. This was a nice option. The home was spectacularly prepared and clean as a whistle. Very nice kitchen, which my wife loved. And a nice living areas to relax and watch movies.
I was a bit surprised the first night that there was a train track just a block away. The train runs somewhat frequently around the time that we were going to bed. It also runs extremely early in the morning. The first week we struggled to adjust, but finally bit the bullet and bought earplugs and turned on the fan. With this, we were able to sleep soundly. I wish the noise from the train tracks would have been communicated.
All said, we had a very nice stay and would recommend staying here. There is beautiful lake winnebago not far, you can walk there and it is very pleasant and peaceful. And the town of Oshkosh is very cool and lots of fun coffee shops and restaurants."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,loved the place very comfortable

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and comfy, cant complain."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place and lovely stay. You can see the lake and the marsh from the kitchen windows. It's off of a main road but the road noise was minimal. This AirBnB gets the prize for the most comfortable couch ever! It's so nice to have a comfortable couch like one would have at home! Everything was as described. I am sure this would be a wonderful place in the summer when one could enjoy the yard and the lake! It was a great place for me to do some work and relax.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was exactly what we were looking for. We just wanted a quiet place to relax and hang out kid-free. Everything inside seemed newly remodeled. It was clean and comfortable with lots of streaming options and even a few games in the cupboard. This time of year we wouldn’t use the lake anyway, but I don’t know how accessible the lake would be even in warmer weather. It is technically on the lake but a very small marshy section."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Worked out great for 3 adults and 2 children on the pull out couch.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kent was very kind and was very responsive! he did a great job to make sure we felt comfortable, it over all was a great place to stay! only wish we stayed longer!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We didn't have much time to enjoy this wonderful house. If I could give it more stars in the rating I would. We were only there for a night but and very warm cozy feeling as soon as you walked in. I highly recommend it!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was delightful. Just enough room to be cozy and relaxed. Quiet, cozy, comfy, and relaxing are all terms to describe the home and location. The home itself seemed to radiate relaxation.
-Fully functional and equipped kitchen for cooking basics.
-The beds are excellent. Probably the best mattress I’ve ever stayed on away from home. They’re firm but form fitting.
-The location was about perfect. -Travel was about equidistant north or south to Neenah or OshKosh. The other majors sites of the area are not far off as well.
-Home is in a very quiet peaceful area.
-Once booking and location obtained, don’t worry about the road it’s on, the road is truly not that busy, and this is from someone who hates traffic noise.
-I would be more than happy to stay here again next time I’m in the area.
-Kent was also great to work & stay with. Responsive to messages but not invasive at all. His super host badge is well deserved."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very close to everything I wanted to do, museums, nature, convention center. For me, so much better then staying at a hotel!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable home with nice furnishings.
2023-07-01,2.0,Group trip,"This house is small for about four people only. Appliances are tiny as well as the dining room. The water comes from a well, so the house has this machine that filters the water and it is noisy. When you take a shower the water on your skin feels slippery. The house was humid and when we arrived, it was so dusty that I immediately got allergies. I contacted the host and thank goodness they placed an air purifier in the living room. It is a good place for less than four people and if you like to deal with the well water issue. The property was for sale and so when we got there we felt wired to arrive at a property being sold."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay! Responsive host and clean.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,House was just the kind of peace I was looking for after working 10 hours. Location was clean and had everything I needed to prepare dinner. Would stay again and recommend.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The place was cute and cosy as seen in the photos. The host was very responsive. It was noted in the welcome binder that the local water has a high sulfur content but that a whole-house filtering system has been installed. At the beginning of the stay, the sulfur smell was as issue, but the host was helpful to increase the filtering frequency and improve the smell. They also had a water filter pitcher for drinking water. Additionally, there was an issue with boxelder bugs. The host offered assistance with this initially by sending someone to spray for bugs, which helped for a day or so. However, the rest of the stay, I spent squishing 30-40 bugs per day that kept entering the house."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is beautiful, comfortable and has a very peaceful feel. Everything we needed for our stay was provided. The beds are super comfortable in addition to the living room furniture. We will definitely stay again the next time we are in town!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The host communicated well and the home was clean and comfortable. The view of the lake was relaxing and we enjoyed the deer in the yard. The house was clean and tidy and nicely adorned. We found a nearby county park to enjoy a walk and had food delivered from a local restaurant. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay Kent’s place again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This home is pristine, warm and welcoming, and nestled in a beautifully serene location. The kitchen and main living area are tastefully renovated and decorated, containing everything you might need. I especially appreciated all of the natural light, both in the morning and afternoon. You can even see the sun coming up over the lake through the window from the corner bedroom in the morning - beautiful! Kent was very helpful and prompt in answering my questions about check-in, and left detailed and clear instructions in the House Binder. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a nice one night stay. The house was clean and just what we were looking for. The host was very easy to communicate with.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Staying at Kent’s lakeside home was a great experience! The home was spotless, and had everything we needed. The views of the lake were just what we needed to disconnect for a couple of days. I ended up having a question on something and he responded really quickly. The beds were really comfortable as well."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tranquility awaits you. Everything was exceptional. Clean, cozy, and peaceful. Kent and Jill were attentive to every need that might arise during your stay and they were amazing to work with. The beds and linens were amazing, the towels felt like a spa, and every detail was covered. The sunrise was stunningly gorgeous and it was so fun to watch the deer frolic right outside. If you need an escape, a comfortable place to stay; you’ve found it. We were incredibly impressed with every aspect of our stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kent's place -- a beautiful location with views of Lake Winnebago, and really convenient for visiting Oshkosh (as well as the rest of the Fox Valley, which is just up the road). The house was spotless and really tastefully decorated, and we had everything we needed for a relaxing visit. The hosts were very responsive and helpful with all communication. Overall a great place and we'll be back again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Kent and his wife are very responsive and helpful. Any issue I ran into during my stay they were on top of. Snow was plowed before I even saw it! House is quiet and peaceful. My only issue was that the water is well-water and had a very strong odor to it. Would recommend to bring bottled water to brush your teeth/drink. Kent and his wife did everything they could to make my stay comfortable within their means!

The space was cozy, larger than we anticipated and Kerry's personalized touches were great."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at the airbnb. Being on the lake to see the sunrise was a nice touch to the already adorable upstairs rooms. If we ever come back to Oshkosh, we will be looking to see if this place is available again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I can’t say enough good things about these hosts! Their place is cozy and welcoming. The fact that it remains affordable speaks to their great character.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely time! Kerry was a great hostess; very responsive and clear with communication.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Hands down one of the best AirBnBs I have stayed in! And I travel a lot. The little welcome note was really sweet and it feels very private and safe in the guest area. The neighborhood was lovely with the view of the water being a big bonus. Highly recommend! They go above and beyond to bring the best to their guests and accommodate their needs during the stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic place that was close to downtown! highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kerry's place is located very close to downtown and right by the lake. The place itself was very clean & I loved the extra thought she put into the place. I'd definitely recommend staying here to anyone who was going to the area!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kerry's place was fantastic! You can literally see Lake Winnebago from the living room and bedroom windows. Everything was nicely laid out and she even left a welcome message for us. Highly recommend, we definitely would stay here again next time we are in Oshkosh."

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Pros: off street parking, good size bedrooms, location, remodeled bath, and strong internet. Cons: the house is 130 years old and needs some yard and exterior maintenance. Windows do not open so you must rely on AC units."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you we had a great stay
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I didn't have any communication with Kerry other than emails. She did make it clear that if I did need anything, not to hesitate to reach out to her. The place was clean and cozy. Just note that the only ""dining"" place is the little table in the living room. The beds are low to the ground and not super comfy. This little apartment was perfect though for what I needed as a little overnight getaway with my daughter. Since nobody was scheduled to arrive the day we were leaving, she was very flexible with our departure time. I would probably stay here again if I need a night away that isn't too far from home. Thank you Kerry!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend staying at Kerry's. Lovely place to relax and close to the lake, you can see it from your window. All the necessities in the kitchen. Very quick to respond. Would stay here again."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Was a good location, 15 min from lifefest, and by the lake. Was an older home and had just a portable A/C in the living room, luckily it wasn’t to hot to sleep since it didn’t really reach the bedrooms very well but otherwise nice."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, I will do so again"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place matched the description! It was an upstairs apartment-style unit. It was very hot inside (a/c unit only worked in living room) but great location and the hosts are kind, polite, and helpful! First time in Oshkosh and will definitely plan another trip back soon!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, close to downtown area. Unit was clean and comfortable. Will definitely consider staying in Kerry's unit again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the second time we have stayed here. This is a great location where you can see the lake from the windows. It’s a short drive to downtown. Wonderful spot.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Always a great sign when a host has excellent books on the shelves. I was nervous about a ""no cleaning fee"" place, yet it was clean and just as described. Very nice neighborhood."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We definitely enjoyed our stay at Kerry's place - check in was easy and it was very clean and spacious. Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised, if your a loud group, this wouldn’t be the place to stay. Lots of space to spread out and had all amenities needed."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The inside steps are not too steep, and are carpeted. The stairway ceiling has a section that might catch your head at 5'7'.
The rooms are spacious and clean. Alot of the original decor in trim and doors. And a remaining built in early 20th century phone shelf.
wonderful hosts, quiet dogs, at least when we were in.
Did I say GREAT HOSTS???!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kerry’s place is the perfect embodiment of an Oshkosh home. It was clean, quiet, and offered the amenities you look for in a home-away-from-home (with the bonus of being able to walk to the lake). It really was the nostalgic “upstairs at Grandma’s house” like another reviewer mentioned (if your Granny lived in Oshkosh!). We absolutely would stay here again. Thank you, Kerry!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Private entrance. Friendly & responsive host. Would recommend.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for what we wanted. Quiet neighborhood. Cozy yet roomy. Very clean. Quaint!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay for a few days. Private access and really nice neighborhood to walk around. I enjoyed the views of the lake too!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Needs to mow lawn more
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"""Grandma's upstairs"" is what we thought after the great stay. Many layers of paint, sticking doors and windows that were either painted shut or wouldn't stay opened had us recalling tome at grandmas house, for us, good memories. It reminded us very much of grandmas. It was well furnished with everything you could need, the beds were comfortable. The kitchen was fully useable and stocked with things you'd need. Temp upstairs was 79 and we got hot but we found an air conditioning unit in the closet and set it up in the window to cool it down. There was plenty of hot water for all of us to shower and great pressure. Nice plush towels. Full sized fridge was nice. (Run the kitchen water for a while before you use it.). This was a wonderful value for the money and a good hostess. Will stay again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Kerry’s place! It was a good price for what we got! Very clean and quiet. It is not an entire unit, but you do have the entire upstairs unit to yourself with a private entrance.
I would gladly stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great neighborhood, perfect for long walks and very quiet."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I appreciate you guys for holding a slot for me and letting me extend last minute. I truly appreciate it and I enjoyed looking out the window and seeing such a beautiful and calm view of the lake and mansion like houses.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A lovely stay over Easter weekend! Very beautiful view of the lake. Clean, quaint, and cozy. The beds are SO comfortable! Enjoyed our weekend stay :-)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay! Everything was great and loved loved the view. Such a great spot. Thank you for having me and for being so accommodating.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was relaxing and quiet
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Yay! An inexpensive place to visit, cute and cozy with well thought out amenities. I would bring your own pillow if you are (like me) picky about fluffiness.
My assumption is the a/c works well just be advised it is a portable room a/c hooked up to a window. We didn't need air conditining. The neighborhood is walk friendly and it was quiet. Very satisfied!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot with a view of the lake!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kerry’s place was super cute! I loved the decor. The beds were comfortable. If traveling with kiddos, make sure to put any breakable items where they can’t reach! My 2 year old son is autistic and spins in circles (stimming) to self-soothe. When we placed breakables higher, it was a charming place to stay. Also, my husband is a professional athlete and is 6’7. I doubt many people are that tall (as I’m only 5’4) but the ceilings are lower. My hubby couldn’t fit through the doorways and while slightly inconvenient for him, it gave us both a good laugh. For me and my children and anyone under 6’5, you’ll be fine ;-) list of recommendations for food were posted on the fridge and board games, Roku, and books kept everyone entertained. A unique and cozy spot! Enjoyed our stay."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed for 2 nights , it was very easy to book , get in and check out. The are is really nice and quite with a nice lake with walking distance"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great! Quiet, close to the Oshkosh Arena (where we were visiting). Provided local recommendations for food, had lots of complimentary items (water, coffee, towels, etc). Nice place! Has a view of the water too."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Oshkosh for 3 nights and had a great stay!!! The unit was spotless and quiet.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay definitely recommend
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is the exemplar of an Air BnB experience. Host Kerry was a great communicator, offered clear instructions, and was responsive to questions. The unit was beautiful, impeccably clean, and very well-appointed. The home is probably at or near a century building. The ceilings were lower by contemporary standards--I'm of average height and had no difficulties. The kitchen had everything a visiting cook could ask for. Beautiful sitting room, overlooking the lake. Pristinely quiet. Completely convenient to the cool Oshkosh downtown and accessible to the hiking trails and parks I wanted. Off-street parking. Truly an excellent experience."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! The place was exactly as listed. Area was quiet and check in was easy. Kerry was super friendly and very responsive.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Would def stay their again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Got in late and left early, so didn't have much time there. But the time that we did spend there went fine. Seems like it would be a fun little lake town in the summer for sure!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Nicely furnished, private, very responsive. Would rent again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kerry was a great host! Top flight! The accomodations were on point, everything was just like the pictures. The house is a home away from home. So very comfortable and very nicely decorated. I will definitely stay there again when I come in town to visit my daughter and her family. Love this place, great location, they let you know where all the great spots are for food and everything. Definitely will give Kerry a five star. Great host!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Helpful hosts and convenient location.
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house had many large spiders, uncomfortable beds and loud portable air conditioners. The bathroom was up to date and there were many extras in case you forgot anything. Good location for air show."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,it was very comfortable... slept like a rock!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at Kerry and Linda’s home. The place is cute and comfortable. The view of the lake from the window is also pretty good. One of the most well-stocked Airbnb’s we have stayed in!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Lovely apartment comfy sofa and beds, just lacking in bedroom furniture, perhaps the chest of draws in the living room cupboard could be relocated to a bedroom. Plenty of shower gel, shampoo etc, lovely soft towels. Shame about the kitchen rather sparse, if you intended staying more than one or two nights and want to cook a meal you may be hard pushed. A visitors book to add any hints to leave for future visitors, would be good. On the whole a nice comfy stay in a very quiet area."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice experience! there were small and personal touches that made the place feel like a home away from home.
no need to communicate w hosts, but they were easily accessible if needed.
place was clean. it was so close water! everything seemed to be within a 5 minute drive or short walk.
really liked everything about the stay and hosts."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was pretty much perfect for us and our stay in Oshkosh. It was clean and cozy. Nice closet space to hang my daughter’s pageant dresses. It has fairly low ceilings and doorways so if you are 6 foot or taller just remember to duck. But overall a great stay.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kerry's communication couldn't be better. Even when I miscommunicated on something, he worked with me to correct the situation and was more than fair. The value of his AirBnb rental property is second to none. I cannot highly recommend him enough."

I'll be back there when in Oshkosh!"
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful neighborhood. The place was nice, cozy as well as clean. The only two drawbacks were limited electric plug-ins and very basic. Not a ton of amenities for a longer stay."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great communication & quiet neighborhood by the lake.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kerry made our stay very easy. Including allowing us to stay another day because of a scheduling snafu. Check in was flawless and the location couldn't have been better. Everything came as advertised. I would recommend Kerry and this place!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very economical! And the host, Kerry proved that he will go the extra mile for you! Great location as many places is within walking distance. I would highly recommend this BnB for travelers and professionals alike. Good people and good location. Thanks again Kerry!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kerry was such a great host in having the place prepared for our stay with amenities I wasn’t even expecting. The place itself is great! Located on the lake. Probably better in the spring and summer but a nice little getaway whenever. Would definitely stay here again!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful quiet stay!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice apartment, with so many cute touches! Had everything we needed and a great location across from the lake. Kerry was so nice and responded quickly to any questions I had. The beds were super comfy, although I wish the bed that I slept in had a bed frame so it was higher off the ground. My bad back protested a little bit, but that’s only a very minor issue. Our stay was perfect and I got to spend some quality time with my daughter. Thank you, Kerry!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb apartment was perfect for our vacation. The Airbnb came with almost everything that you would need. From toothbrushes to coffee to soap in the bathroom it has it all. Also a nice plant in each room for fresh air was a plus. It was super clean. Would definitely stay here again. Do yourself a favor and book this Airbnb for yourself.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was perfect! Highly recommend this listing. The bed was so comfy, and we had everything we needed. The neighborhood and view of the lake was a nice addition!"
2021-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check in. Blinds by the window facing street was broken, had to cover it with towel. If you are 6ft over watch out for the head. No hair dryer, so bring one if u plan to wash your hair and not get icy cold hair.
Run out of shower gel (wish they would have checked in between guests) and maybe a more neutral scent. It was for men. Had toothbrush toothpaste make up remover which was nice. We were out most of the day so i guess it was ok."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place is nice, quiet and clean. The shower head is a little on the low side but being 6ft tall I just had to crouch a little bit, nothing too drastic. Kerry was quick to communicate and instructions were easy to follow to check in."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great unit in a great neighborhood, right across from Lake Winnebago. Very clean and the best deal I found in the area. Thanks for a nice stay!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very amazing stay!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ceiling is on the low side in this second floor apartment in an older house. Otherwise, it was spacious, clean and felt very solid. Plenty of room for 4. Great for overnight, not for extensive meal prep or sit down dining."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Friendly and helpful host; quiet, clean, and well equipped place!"
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"A charming host, brought us up wine glasses when we asked, made sure we were comfortable. The TV works only with an smartphone (iphone?). The bath was well stocked with wonderful towels, extra toothbrushes, deodorants, etc. We would have liked to sit down at a table for breakfast - there is only a low living room table in front of the couch. There are only large pastic tumblers to drink out of - Kerry brought us some wine glasses when we asked. Also only plastic plates. Not really a kitchen to cook real food and eat in. A nice apartment."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great in every way!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kerry's place was great and she was very prompt with responding to any queries. The kitchen and bathroom were well stocked and there were also some games in the living room. We enjoyed our stay!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful home near the lake! Centrally located near several parks: Stevens Park is only 2 blocks away and Menominee Park is an easy drive-great for families. There are wonderful restaurants near by as well. Kerry was very attentive and responded to all questions very quickly. I asked Kerry about utensils for pumpkin carving and there was a carving kit waiting for us!! We really enjoyed our weekend stay at Kerry's home!
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Accommodations were fine. Lots of stairs to climb and is an older home, but it is charming. Beautiful view of lake across the street."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little duplex suite with everything you could need! Great spot to stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Shawn's place was a cute old home with a beautiful view of a creek in the backyard. The house was very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed access to the kayak and the fire pit. We have family in Oshkosh so would definitely stay there again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Shawn's. Everything is as described. The area is very peaceful and close to everything. Shawn was very responsive and helpful.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was perfect for our stay. It is an older home, with old home charm, and exceptionally clean! It was cleaner than some hotels honestly. We loved have the backyard and peaceful creek and willow trees to sit under at night with a fire going. Perfect way to end our days. Only regret is we didn't have more time to kayak. Host was most responsive and easy to work with. Would definitely return."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home’s location was perfect for our family - great for kids to play at the park next door, and close to other attractions we had planned for the weekend. The house was neat and tidy, and the beds were very comfortable. There was a bit of an odor, which I assume was from previous pets. Overall it was a great place to stay for a weekend away. Thank you!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place has all that you need and is very cute and quaint! The location is great, and if you have kids, there’s a park and fishing right out the door! There’s also some kids stuff at the house which was nice! The bed was comfortable and host is very responsive. Will stay again when we are in the area."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shawn was a wonderful host. He was on top of things the whole way through our visit. This location would be great for a quiet getaway as well as a place to take advantage of the local areas, amenities and attractions. Probably better suited for family with kids who like to be near the water access. We used it as a “fishing cabin“ and it worked out perfectly. It was somewhat small for our group, four adult men, but we managed to make it work for us because we are family members. We were close enough to Milwaukee to see a baseball game because it’s not only quiet area. It is close to major highways and access roads."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. Very cozy. Beds were comfortable. Great location to restaurants and shopping. Host was very accommodating and very responsive!
Would definitely stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Home was clean and cozy. Everything we needed was available for kitchen needs, towels, blankets, etc. Appreciated the knowledge that pet dogs usually go on furniture and offered a sheet to use on the couch vs saying ""no dogs on furniture."" Neighbors were friendly, park could be seen from living room window so kids could play. Everything was great."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place next to a park. Shawn was very great to work with!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Good location. Enjoyed our stay.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Shawn’s place perfectly met our needs. It was centrally located so easy to reach the activities we had planned and the house was very clean and cute with lots of light and nicely decorated. The beds were comfy. We will definitely use again!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed the house. It was perfectly located for us to visit the in-laws. It was clean with many nice amenities. It was less expensive than a hotel and we all had a bed. Shawn was very responsive and helpful with any restaurant ideas and so forth. The check-in was extremely flexible and easy. I would recommend this house, and would use it again on future visits."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stayed at the house for 2 nights for a wedding. The house was nice & very clean - looked like the pictures. The area was quiet. Shawn was very quick to reply to any questions we had. Enjoyed our stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our second stay at this location. Clean house, well appointed, plenty of space, things for kids to to nearby outside. Good value. Recommend."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for my brothers and dad to stay as we traveled up to a Green Bay Packers game. Lots of places to go explore nearby and easy access to and from Lambeau Field.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,my family and i had our Thanking here. we have a very nice time. well worth it. I will stay again
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here for 5 nights to visit family & friends and this was one of the few listings that had what we were looking for - pack ‘n play for toddler, laundry, wi-fi, location, price, kids toys, and more! There was a playground literally next door along with a fire pit and kayak which we didn’t get time to use.
The bedrooms had very comfy beds & pillows, the kitchen was stocked with everything you need to eat & cook meals, and Smart TVs where we watched cartoons on Netflix in the mornings. It is an old house so the floors squeak, low ceilings in certain parts of the house, and there was an old wood/musty smell at first but it got better.
Shawn was an awesome host and would always get back to me super quick when I had a question and was very accommodating to our changing travel dates."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for myself and 2 buddies to stay a couple of days and take in a Thursday night game Lions vs Packers … checked Lambeau Field off the bucket list. Sorry for your Packers Shawn😎
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Shawn's place! As a host Shawn was very responsive and gave us some great recommendations for food and family activities in the area.
The house was clean, easy to access, had everything we needed. A great bonus was the canoe and kayak which the whole family loved!
Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our group of ladies were in Oshkosh for a long weekend of crafting, but did venture out a little. Shawn gave us a lot of dinner suggestions that fit our group perfectly and enjoyed every place!!! The house was a great fit for us, sure beats a hotel😊"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our weekend at Shawn's! Location was great on the river, next to a park, and close to downtown. We'd stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a great stay at Shawn’s place. Enjoyed the kayaking and fishing and access to the bike trails. We appreciated his flexibility and responsiveness. We stayed with 6 adults and had enough room to move about comfortably enough. It helped that we could be outside. Kitchen was well equipped as we ate most meals there. Nice big backyard and spacious park next door. Internet was good. We love Oshkosh!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Close to many other attractions in Oshkosh. Nice cozy place and quiet neighborhood, but close to main drag."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Shawn’s. The place was perfect for what we needed!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute vintage Oshkosh home. Close to everything. Clean and well stocked linen closet and kitchen.
2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"It was a very nice stay for me and the groomsmen. Clean, and easy to access. The waterfront is beautiful, lots of alge though. Also i wish there was more than 1 kayak, that way we couldbe gone out onto the water. There was a sketchy basement and an unfinished room upstairs, but other than that it was great."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice stay for Airventure. Easy access from here to the terminal, and the show grounds."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Shawn and his family were extremely nice to deal with.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for us! Loved the creek in back and having a fire in the pit with s’mores! Best trip to Wisconsin yet!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Booked it due to there being a park next door for the littles to play at, and because it was right on the creek. Did not disappoint in either respect. The location is also great because Fox River Brewing is right across the river, as is Paine Art and Gardens and the Public Museum. Not far from Pollock Community Water Center as well, which was a hit with the family. Great location all around."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shawn’s place was in the perfect location for our wedding at The Paine. Unfortunately there was a very strong musty smell during our stay, not sure if this was from a previous guest or a persistent issue. Smell aside, the home was very clean and welcoming, Shawn even took the time to make a cute sign congratulating us on our wedding. If the smell was corrected, this would be an easy 5 star rating."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient location for our weekend plans, everything as described, would not hesitate to book again should we be back in the area"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Well-maintained, clean older home in a quiet residential area. Beds were comfortable!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Shawn was hospitable, responsive, and kind! He and his family were very welcoming. We pre-ordered groceries because we arrived late at night and they were kind enough to put them away for us.
Our kids had the best time at the park next door. My husband enjoyed the beautiful scenery with my son in a kayak ride down the creek. The location could not be better. Close to everything! Nice neighborhood!
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we definitely appreciate their flexibility on checkout. We would definitely come back!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay 👌
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location for a wedding at the Paine Art Center! Shawn was excellent and put together a sweet stay for our family! Love the decor, location and it’s close to a park!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Shawn immediately responded to any questions I had. We tentatively requested a late check out and Shawn was happy to accommodate. Very quiet area, comfortable bed, and plenty of amenities. Would stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We very thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Shawn’s and the fact that we were able to bring our pup along! We spent the weekend in Oshkosh for my sister’s graduation from UWO and the only negatives I have to mention is that my 11 month old is a crawler and her socks and knees of her pants were pretty discolored from crawling all over, otherwise I probably wouldn’t have noticed that. And that it had been raining off and on and that took away our motivation to use the fire pit! We were super bummed to not be able to participate in a little bonfire since the temps were perfect for it! All in all, I would definitely return! It was large enough for the whole family and strategically located right next to a park/playground for my daughter! Thank you for a fantastic stay, Shawn!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shawn was very helpful and all food recommendations we tried were awesome. Home was as pictured and check in/access was a breeze.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house worked out better than expected. It's a cozy house situated on the river and next to a park. There are plenty of restaurants in the area and we were able to catch a guided fishing trip out of the boat launch right up the street. The house is nice and would be a great summer get away relaxing by the river while sitting around the fire pit.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had an awesome time in Oshkosh. The house was close to everything. Only a ten minute drive at most from most places. Shawn answered all my emails promptly. I would recommend the place to friend. Thank you so much! Our special weekend was a blast.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place and views!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We reserved this home last minute due to a family medical emergency. Host was super responsive and flexible on the last minute planning and checked in throughout the stay to make sure everything was ok. Location on the water is super peaceful. House was super clean. This place was perfect!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great! Very hospital and cozy. Next time will stay there too! Recommend!!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice three bedroom house, with bedrooms spaced apart which was good for early birds and late-risers. Has a full kitchen which we didn’t use since we weren’t there much but loved and appreciated the provided coffee and creamer. TVs we’re easy to use and worked great.
Nice driveway for parking."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect for our stay. Friends joined us and we participated in Battle on Bago, which was nearby. I had mentioned this weekend was our 30th anniversary. We entered the kitchen were pleasantly surprised to find a lovely note, popcorn from OSHPOP Gourmet Popcorn, and chocolates from Hughes' Home Maid Chocolates. What a wonderful gesture and great way to support local businesses. I would highly recommend staying here."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay. Thank you
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you wants to stay in a place that feels like a home… this is it. The bedrooms are spaced out perfectly to give everyone their own space. I had to wake up 2 of our family members at 10am or they would have slept all day… the beds are so comfortable! The family room and kitchen are wonderful gathering spaces. The house is stocked with everything you could need as Shawn has thought of everything. Outside there is a beautiful waterway. We stayed in February and the water was frozen over with a huge walking path plowed on the frozen water. It was a beautiful walk ON THE WATER. Everything was perfect on our arrival - lighting, house temperature, welcome book…. I know we will be back to enjoy this home again. This is a true gem. I hope you can enjoy it too. Shawn is a fantastic and responsive host. If I could have given 6 stars I would have."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Shawn,the host was great very prompt and eazy to talk to.I had great stay at this location. Plenty of room and space in driveway.The neighbors where outstanding..."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Love love LOVE staying at this place! We stay here during our work trips to Fond Du Lac. The place is super clean and has an air purifier. They have cleaning supplies for you and laundry, a huge bonus for me personally. They had poo bags for our dogs and towels for dog paws (hate walking in wet paw prints with socks, worst feeling in the world) owners are very responsive and they got up at the butt crack of dawn and shoveled my husband's car out so he could go into the office! Seriously Shawn and his wife go above and beyond when it comes to Airbnb. It's like you are staying with family. It's clear they care about the property and their guests. Recommend this place highly to everyone looking for a place to stay with dogs!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house - immaculately clean, super cute, very comfy beds, beautiful view of the creek."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I stayed for a short weekend. What a darling little house. So much room even though it looks small from the outside. Great location on the river and with a park next door. Had a fire pit for us to use and canoes. Downtown Oshkosh is close by with lots to do. We were here in the fall so we were not able to take advantage of the many waterfronts. Will have to come back in the summer.
Shawn was super responsive. Never met him but he replied immediately to every message we sent."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was exactly what we needed. A quiet spot by the water where we could have a fire at night and walk to the art museum and a few local pubs/diners. Everything was as advertised and easy! Shawn was a responsive and accommodating host.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect stay for our trip to Green Bay. The house was very clean and has a beautiful back yard to sit around a fire by the water. Great location to get in and out to Green Bay for a Packers game. Shawn had great communication and was very helpful. Perfect for our trip!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, and awesome host! Quick to help!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is my new go to place for our business trips! It was very clean it had all the adminities you could ask for when staying at someone's home. The place is like a home away from home now. They had air fresheners that kept the place smelling nice. A fully stocked coffee station (my personal favorite!) A very nice quiet safe relaxing place to stay. We go on work trips to the area 2-4 times a year and we hope to be able to stay here when we do! As a side note I absolutely loved all of the windows it let in a cool early fall breeze. For everything included in the price it was a really good deal, access to water(&water activities), a fire pit, pet friendly(we brought our 2 doggos), cleaning supplies(another personal favorite!!❤️❤️❤️) the owners themselves were attentive to one of my inquiries. I only have good things to say about this place and the fact I already booked our next business trip to this place will be further proof how much I enjoyed our stay. If you want a peaceful and outdoorsy place to stay this would be the place! I only wish we had had the chance to work less and enjoy the house more lol!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Quaint, charming, older house right on the water. Good for kayaking/fishing. Decent proximity to the college. Wonderful yard space. Great for walking dogs or entertaining with yard games. Fantastic, understanding and accommodating host. Would recommend Shawn to anyone."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great. Close to everything but on the creek and next to a park so you are tucked away. Nice modern touches in a century year old house. Good WiFi, all smart TVs, lamps with USB plugs for charging.
The owner was super responsive and even let me go back after we checked out because I forgot something!
Really loved having our own space and the peace and quiet for the same price as hotel room!!! Great central location between Milwaukee and GB."
