2023-04-01,3.0,Group trip,"When we first arrived to property Annette was very prompt with exact details for opening the lockbox because we were having issues. However I was uncomfortable because there was no remote for the garage which meant I had to leave the garage door open when I left the property. The property was somewhat clean but cleanliness need to go a bit further with cleaning wall stains, baseboards and pots and pans were not properly clean. The dust pan used for cleaning was filled with hair and dirt. I had elderly relatives with me and the noisy cars driving by was almost unbearable for them. The appliances, dishes and washer and dryer were clean. I also appreciate that there was supplies available to do laundry. Lastly the sound of the heating unit was loud and startled when it came on late and night."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Annette's place was exactly like the pictures, very clean, and easy directions. She responded very quickly whenever I had any questions. The check-in process went so smoothly. The only problem was something completely out of her control-the street noise. I had trouble falling asleep, as it was very loud until midnight. Everything else was very great. She even let us check out late so we could shower after our race. Thanks!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This definitely fits the name! Although it's on a busy street it's still a pretty dope spot. Unfortunately, another guest accidentally took the garage opener so there was a slight inconvenience there, but not a real complaint. The closed in garage was one of thee best features!!

The sheets on the bed were super soft! I was there in my home town laying my Grandmother to rest, Annette immediately acknowledged that, was super responsive to my questions and even shared a decorative tip from the house with me. Slept like a baby! Hopefully it’s available the next time we come down for a visit."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The photos are an accurate description of the property design and decor. It was very clean and the alarm system did provide my family a bit of comfort, since the property is not located in one the better and safer parts of Greenville. Furthermore, the house presents as a cheap flip. In every room the floors slope away from the center of the house and the shower tile appears as if a new home owner used Tic Tok as a guide."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The BEST kept secret in Greenville for lodging! We will never stay in another smoky, overpriced, questionably clean/safe commercial motel/hotel in Greenville if we can stay here. 27 years of sketchy lodging is over! I can’t say enough good things about this gem. Clean, safe, well appointed, great communication, NO complaints. This is a 10 out of ten."

We arrived during a festive holiday season for Leland with Deer Creek adorned in decoration awaiting their famed Kermit/Santa Christmas float, so needless to say, we were enamored.
Only briefly in town for business, the well-kept abode with a plethora of adorable decorations, was a perfect retreat !! We each had our own themed room and made extensive use of the well-stocked kitchen and pantry !! We will definitely re-book on our next adventure to Leland !!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Carol's pink cottage. It is very spacious! I was in town for the Highway 61 Blues Festival and I couldn't believe how close I was to downtown Leland. As a visual person, I appreciated the pictures that Carol sent to me for check-in instructions, etc. I loved having the eggs, bread, coffee, snacks and water bottles! I slept really good in the front bedroom as the sounds from the highway didn't bother me. There's a nice room, with a firm mattress in the back of the cottage for a quieter rest. The water pressure in the shower was nice too. I also enjoyed being so close to where Kermit lived (the Jim Henson exhibit) with the cotton patch garden and the creek. Checkout instructions were the easiest I have stayed at. I highly recommend Carol's place and would love to stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a brief but lovely stay at Carols. She is the most hospitable AirBnB owner we have come across. Amazing communication once we booked and leading up to our arrival. And very generously provided snacks and breakfast foods. Thank you Carol.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,George says everything was clean and comfortable. Thank you!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mrs Carol’s hospitality and accuracy in the description was spot on. She’s very responsive to answer any questions you may have no matter what time of the day or night it is. We didn’t arrive until late in the night and she had went to the house and turned on some lights so we wouldn’t have to walk in an unfamiliar house in the dark. Before we got there some bad thunderstorms had came up and the temperature had dropped some and she messaged us and let us know exactly what was going on. We would recommend her lovely home to anyone wanting to spend time in that area.
Sincerely
Henry Dillard and. Jane Stockstill"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"OMG! The host made this place feel like home from the minute I walked in the door! From the personal hand-written notes she left throughout the house, text message updates, snacks and toiletries to the ambiance and decor...it felt just like home! There was NOTHING that I could have needed that Carol hadn't already provided and/or thought of. This host thought of EVERYTHING! (Ya'll, it was the dark makeup towels that did it for me though! LOL! - Very very smart lady!!!) Even though I never met the host, she made me feel as though I was greeted personally because all of the personal touches she left for me throughout the home. THank you Carol for making my trip back home a pleasant one!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute cottage and perfectly located next to the Kermit museum which was why I visited the area. I love the eclectic decorations and all of the amenities included. The house was spotless too. Bed in the Africa room was super comfy (not sure about others as I didn’t sleep in them). Would love to come again and bring my niece (11 yo) who also loves Kermit to this cottage. A really memorable experience!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were passing through Leland just to visit the Kermit Museum and the Pink House was right across the Creek from it. In fact, we could see it from the yard! Totally charming and I appreciated the inclusion of snacks and breakfast items, so sweet! It made me nostalgic for my grandma's house!"

The rental is right off a very busy well traveled road so if you are able stay in the back bedroom. The front bedroom is a little noisy."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ll forever be indebted to Ms Carol and Bobee, who went above and beyond to make me feel at home in Leland. The Pink House is adorable, full of character and charm. Every element inside and out – from the furniture and decor to the snacks and manicured garden (Yard of the Week during my stay, and totally deserved) – is curated with the utmost care. I loved my whirlwind trip and only wish I’d stayed longer. As Gonzo sings in The Muppet Movie, I’m going to go back there someday (if you stay at Carol’s place, be sure to visit the Kermit the Frog museum just across Deer Creek). Thank you for looking after me, Carol! Until next time. x"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We recently traveled to Leland to visit family in the area. Pink On The Creek was clean and well stocked with goodies. There were plenty of clean towels for me and my 2 boys. Carol was super responsive. We would definitely stay there again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The guest experience was phenomenal. Mrs. Carol and her husband really goes the extra mile to make you feel at home during your stay. The home was clean, spacious, well lit, peaceful and quiet, and in a safe area located close to downtown.
The level of the service provided by the hosts was amazing and far exceeded any expectations. Mrs. Carol was thoughtful in having snacks readily available upon check-in, leaving the lights on for my evening arrival, and preparing a handwritten note. I just truly loved the gracious hospitality offered in the Mississippi Delta.
In addition to providing a surprising welcome, Mrs. Carol is the epitome of communication and responsiveness. Before I arrived, I asked about a walking trail so that I could continue my daily workout routine. Mrs. Carol not only messaged directions but also images of landmarks so that I could become familiar with the path in a strange city/town. I followed those directions and was able to complete my 4 miles each day and I’m truly thankful for that. Note: There were no dogs or loose dogs around, so that made everything so much better in unfamiliar territory.
Overall this stay was great, the service was great, and the overall guest experience was phenomena as mentioned in my opening paragraph. The host are indeed Superhosts and should forever more be rated beyond five stars. I will definitely consider this property for all future stays.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is PERFECT!! So peaceful and accessible, and the host were the best. If you’re looking for a nice quiet vacation, you will love the place.

We hope to visit again in the future."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We spent a week in this wonderful cottage while visiting the MS and ARK state fairs.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My 3 daughters and I decided to go on a weekend getaway, so I went on the website and looked and found Ms Carol's house. We had a wonderful experience.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house was the perfect place for our daughter and her family to stay! She said there was room for everyone to spread out and rest after a long day of traveling.

As we approached Leland, our gps was not providing correct directions so I contacted Carol and she provided very precise directions. The house was very clean and she left snacks as well as breakfast items at no extra charge. Carol is by far the best host that I have rented from. We will definitely book again for our next visit to the area."

Mrs. Carol & Mr. Bobee took great care of us from the beginning to the end of our stay. My family & I can’t thank them enough!! This trip was a memorable one and they both played a part in that! The southern hospitality is unmatched! From the bottom of my heart I appreciate them so much!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We travel a lot and this was the best Air bnb we have ever stayed at. All of the little touches added to make our stay more comfortable we’re so appreciated. The owners Carol and Bobee were so hospitable and kind. They even left a Birthday card for me knowing it was my birthday week. We had an unexpected change in our plans and they graciously allowed us to stay longer. We traveled from Oregon to visit family and this home made our visit relaxing and stress free. We left feeling blessed to have had this experience.
2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Carol and Bobee and their wonderful little vintage pink cottage encompass everything I love about going to Mississippi! It was truly the best of everything we needed and could have wanted for an airbnb experience. Hope to stay there again real soon!!

I definitely will be booking again!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I had the pleasure of staying at Carol’s place.

Carol truly made our stay relaxing and enjoyable.
She is such a kind person. The hospitality was great! We can’t wait for our next trip back! We will be booking again with her."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Many thanks for sharing your little slice of heaven with us. So peaceful and loved watching and listening to all the farm animals. Enjoyed our fresh eggs for breakfast that the host brought us. Felt like home with the kitchen being well stocked with essentials including spices. Hosts were so quiet tending to animals, we never knew they were around. Great selection of DVDs to watch before turning in for the night. Would highly recommend for anyone traveling through the area. Highly recommend Nola's restaurant in Indianola and Lillo's in Leland."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Let me start with FARM FRESH EGGS!! This place is absolutely beautiful. Super clean. Recommend to anyone wanting to be one with nature. Lynde is an excellent and responsive host.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment above the barn seemed like a great experience.
We're not convinced.
The place is quiet and peaceful. It's fun to see cows from the living room.
Lynde is kind and very responsive.
But the space is dark, the hardwood floor sags. We avoided walking in certain places.
Cleanliness, including the floor and toilet, could be improved.
The bed for our son was not ready and we had to pick up the sheets ourselves for him. He didn't even have a blanket! Disappointed."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"In terms of cooking equipment, this place had the best stocked kitchen of any airbnb we’ve ever stayed in."

I loved the animals and the place was convenient to Indianola.
It is unique having the animals right there with you (which we loved)

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I were looking for a one night stay to get off the road on the way to Arkansas. This place was the perfect place to rest our head for the night. Description says rustic, but I would also consider it more cozy. We had coffee on the balcony watching the sunrise. Lynde had some great recommendations for restaurants as well. We ended up at Betties Place because we had our dogs, but some of the best home-cooked food I've ever had on the road. Would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, lynde was a great host. It was easy to get find, get in. Lynde brought us some southern food to try!

The bed and linens were super comfy. The only thing we wish was that the apartment had wifi, but we definitely could manage without for a night! We will definitely be back if we’re ever in the area! We absolutely enjoyed every second in the country at your place! Thank you so much!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lynde’s place was exactly as described very easy to get too. And me and my dad enjoyed our stay while up there hunting.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scenery! Like something out of a book. If you're a real city person it's not for you but if you got a lil country in you this is it! Perfect for a weekend stay for a couple or couple plus 1 child. Farm living at it's best. Place was clean and exactly as described. Wifi spotty but we knew going in that it would be, lots of bugs around porch light but you're on a farm. My hubbs and I will definitely stay again and bring our 3 year old. She loves animals! Lynde was quick to respond to any and every question or concern I had. Great host and we can't wait to return."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Cell reception is spotty inside but worth the stay

Enjoyed the scenery and was really nice and peaceful on the farm. Lynde had some fresh eggs from her chickens waiting for us upon our checkin.

We’ll definitely be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Host communication was excellent. The animals on the property were amazing and fun to watch. Location was close to town and easy to access all that the town has to offer. Would definitely stay again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was the best Airbnb we have stayed at so far. Peaceful, relaxing, watched the farm animals, etc. The inside was a great space with plenty of room, kitchen was fully equipped. This is a must stay at and we are looking forward to coming back. Great job guys!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Barn Apartment was simply serene. There was a chill in the air, with a bright blue sky and beaming sun, the sounds of birds singing and flowing water constant amidst the gorgeous landscape. It's a very peaceful spot, with scatterings of farm animals throughout their and their neighbors property. Speaking on the neighbors, they're far enough away that you feel private but not so far that you feel completely cut off from the world. Lynde was very responsive, there was a problem with the convection oven that was ultimately unresolved, but it did not diminish our stay and her husband was kind enough to take a look while we were there. Overall a quiet, relaxing, and refreshing spot, ideal for relaxing after work or a long week with a single guest. We will probably be coming back."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was definitely worth the price. Place was very clean, as described, my dogs had the time of their life it was a lot of grass for them. Host was very flexible, nothing bad to say here. Highly recommend for a weekend getaway"

Especially the flexibility if the check in was extraordinary. Originally we wanted to come Tuesday, but due to the severe weather we couldnt make it. So we just came a day later. No problemo :-) The appartement was open and the keys on the table - check in: easy peasy! Upon arriving, the cat greated us - I love cats.

One thing to know when deciding if it is the right place for you is your comfort with having cameras in the living spaces (living room, kitchen, etc.).

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We rented this Beautiful property when we traveled to the Delta for a funeral. This house was absolutely perfect for my family. It was spacious, well equipped, and immaculately clean. The size and set up allowed us to be together, but also to have personal space. There was plenty of space for parking and lots of outdoor seating as well. The home was stocked with extras that are not always available in an Airbnb-toiletries, extra paper products. Perhaps the most amazing part of this stay was the kindness, communication, and understanding of the host. Even when I messaged late one night, she responded promptly and answered my question. This was not a vacation for us, but this home and host made a trying time a little easier for my family and we are grateful for that."

The house is well decorated and served us well as a place that offered great sleeping accommodations and a place of comfort and fellowship for many family members after formal activities of our family reunion. Although we did not exercise pool privileges the pool area is beautiful and served as private get away area for small groups of the family who had not seen each other in years to reconnect. Some of us used the area as a quiet area to reflect and meditate.
The layout of the house. is smart and included several private spaces that allowed multiple couples to experience their own private quarters while creating large beautiful space for family fellowship. The master bedroom is huge and fit for any king and/or queen.
The workout room offers equipment for anyone who wills to work off the calories from all the tasty southern food.
My family found the house to be well organized and beautiful, yet comfortable and a great value."

2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is BEYOND beautiful, the pictures doesn't do it justice. Check-in was easy. The house was very clean and there was more that enough room for 10 people. This house is seven bedrooms and four baths. There is a pool in the backyard and multiple seating areas. We really enjoyed hanging out by the pool. The host was easy to contact, we didn't have any problems with anything. We were very happy this rental. Stay here, You will not be disappointed."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tashandra, had great hospitality!! Beautiful home and she was very welcoming. She made my family feel like we were at home My family enjoyed ourselves.

2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is beautiful.
The small upstairs gym even inspired me to work out for about ten minutes! The pool is just right. The decor is elegant with inspirational posters and original art. Surprising little details everywhere. Silk flowers. Glass sculpture. Plenty of soft pillows. New televisions in every room! Elegant dining room. Cozy kitchen eating area. Quiet neighborhood. We were a few minutes away from the University, restaurants and boutique shopping.
Our hosts welcomed us and offered directions and suggestions for our stay that were helpful. I don't know how one could ask for anything more."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Lars is great host and very knowledgeable about the history of the Mississippi Delta.

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Can’t say enough about the beautiful sunrises and the convocation of birds! I loved the old tub and the very comfy bed😉 it’s a great at central locationtion from which to explore the Delta.

Lars was a wonderful and thoughtful host, and I can honestly say that the bed and the shower are among the best I’ve experienced, at home or in other airbnb stays!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lar's place was just a little piece of heaven. I came to visit family and also to have some time to reflect and write. It was just perfect. Lars was flexible and communicative and I appreciate his efforts to make my stay perfect.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The word bucolic came to mind when I drove up to the Peacock Cottage.
For me this was like stepping back in time. I grew up in the Mississippi Delta not so many miles from Peacock in the Delta. The Delta has changed so much from my 1960s childhood, so much of the land has been cleared of trees to make room for crops, so much of the crop land leveled to facilitate irrigation, YET this farm has been kept pristine, as I said, for me, literally like walking back in time.
The host, Lars, a quintessential Delta character, was a perfect host.
Oh yea, I was traveling solo, without my dogs, and Lars even arranged for the family Bernedoodle to greet me at my door each morning. Then there are also horses, pigs etc. which may come up to the back fence, just beyond the cottage, to speak.
The stay was more than a stay, it was an experience."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful and well kept place to visit, excellent accommodations!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at this fantastic little jewel smack dab in the delta.
There is a peace to be felt and I’m grateful to get the chance go experience it again. I could have stayed a couple of days longer but left feeling rested. Rejuvenated.
Thanks for sharing your place with us."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time to the Delta to visit family and the.cottage was the absolutely the highlight. The location was perfect to go to the surrounding towns to get to a few attractions like the BB King museum. But the farm itself was the best place to be. Lars was warm and receptive. The cottage is cute and comfy. The porches allowed for coffee and breakfast in the mornings and every morning the puppers, Levi and River came to saw hi. There are beautiful horses and sheep and a huge piggy Lucky. Archie took us horseback riding through the farm and even showed us his carriage horses. We loved our stay at the Peacock and will be back soon."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had a lovely stay, playing tennis, swimming, and walking around the beautiful property!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are planning a trip to the Mississippi Delta I would highly recommend Peacock in the delta. It was an amazing place in country with beautiful woods and fields. The host was friendly and great to talk with. I can't say enough about this place but I would not hesitate to book here again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I can say it was my first time In the delta it was amazing the view was perfect it was nice and quiet we took plenty of photos beautiful horses it was so nice to wake up to nature I can’t wait till next year we will be back thank you Lars for the amazing stay ❤️
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had such a fantastic time staying at Peacock!!! This place is a gem, quiet & serene, the perfect getaway from my stressful life! I relaxed in the pool & listened to the cicadas & all my anxiety just drifted away. I couldn’t have stayed in a more beautiful & perfect setting. Thanks for sharing your beautiful piece of the MS Delta Lars!!! You are so blessed to live in such a gorgeous part of this planet, and I appreciate your hospitality! If I do this event again, I know where I’m staying again!!! ❤️"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed out stay at Peacock in the Delta! It was so peaceful and relaxing. We enjoyed having the swimming pool right outside our cabin door, and loved walking the property to visit the beautiful chapel. I would love to come back in the fall when it isn't so hot. Lars was so helpful and friendly as were the two dogs who greeted us when we arrived. Great little getaway spot off the beaten path."

Plenty of farm animals and Lars was great to take us on a tour of the 1700 acres!
Hands down, highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There's a lot to love about the Peacock cottage - too much to list. Highlights were the beds and quality bedding, porches, views, swimming pool, and cypress trees. We met Lars and he was super friendly and interesting. I would love to come back when we have more time, as there was much more to see and do on the farm than our brief visit allowed. We were in the Delta to visit civil rights and music history sites, and we did get lessons in those that we will never forget."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second time staying here and everything was just as amazing as the first time! Thank you!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved staying here, Lars is extremely friendly and was very generous with his time showing us around the farm."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at Lars's cabin. His property is beautiful and the cabin is perfect for a peaceful getaway in Mississippi. Lars was a great host, he drove us around the property to show us around and shared his knowledge of the area. We were passing through while doing the Mississippi Blues Trail which Lars had lots of knowledge of. We would love to stay again for longer someday! Highly recommended!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"If you really want to experience the true essence of a Mississippi Delta farm, take a trip back in time and escape to this country refuge and gift yourself with the privilege of getting to know the place and the good people who share it with those of us fortunate enough to stumble upon it."

Can’t wait to be back."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third time to stay at Peacock Cottage, and we already have it booked for next year! It is such an amazing little treasure in the middle of the Mississippi Delta. It is the perfect place to go to and get off the grid for a few days. I really can't articulate in words how much we enjoy this lovely little place."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful and beautiful place in the Delta!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect place for a weekend getaway! The cottage was absolutely beautiful & had everything we needed. Our three toddlers had the best time playing with the pups, swimming in the pool, & watching the horses. We were close enough to town to pick up dinner & lunch. Lars was such a great host & made sure we had everything we needed. We are already planning our next visit!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was a perfect place for my husband and I to rest and relax while we dropped our son off at Delta State! I highly recommend staying here for that perfect getaway we all need.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful! Lars and his family are excellent hosts with a beautiful place to stay, enjoy the cicadas, swim, and relax. It was the perfect place for our stay and we can't wait to return."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of our favorite Airbnb stays. It’s a hidden gem of the Delta. The land is beautiful and the inside of the cottages look like they came straight out of Architectural Digest. We would recommend Lar’s place to anyone!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in the cottage! We loved the farm and playing with the dogs. It made for a perfect and relaxing weekend getaway! We will definitely be back soon.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just spent a relaxing weekend away and it beautiful and peaceful.
Levi and River are so friendly and the hosts were kind and helpful!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous 2 night stay in this charismatic cozy cabin. It was comfortable and we particularly enjoyed sitting on the porch for breakfast and in the evening. We BBQ’d both nights and would have used the fire pit had it been a little cooler. As to be expected in the Delta, bug spray is advisable. We loved the dogs Levi and River - they became constant companions.
We really enjoyed chatting to Lars who showed us around the farm and was really interesting to speak to. The cabin is in an ideal location for exploring the many Blues attractions in the surrounding area, and of course the Kermit Museum in Leland. Highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The coolest place. Feels like you’ve stepped into a fairytale story book. Archie took us for a horse ride and the dog - Levi, is just the sweetest boy. We loved our stay and can’t wait to come back."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience! A small piece of paradise that was just right for recharging our batteries! Super quiet and a beautiful area!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lars is a great host. He’s always available if you were to need anything during your stay.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was the perfect Delta setting—great central location and tons of beauty and charm. We loved hanging with Levi and waking up to seeing the horses outside!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lars was such an excellent host and the cabin was gorgeous. I can’t speak highly enough for why, if you’re in the delta, you should stay here. This is a hidden gem, no doubt. The weather got the better of our fishing trip, but Lars’ cabin made up for the rainy weather. Excellent communication, great price, great location for a delta visit. You can’t beat it."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Really enjoyed our family stay at the cottage! Our two little ones especially enjoyed the puppies greeting them each morning in addition to seeing the horses each day! The cottage is centrally located to a number of things to do in the area as well as a number of good restaurants (NOLA and Blue Biscuit were our favorites). Lars even was kind enough to take us on a tour of their family farm which our girls really enjoyed! We’ll definitely stay here again if we ever make it back to the area!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Peacock in the Delta Cottage is the perfect place for a your Mississippi Blues Trail tour headquarters or for a quiet, serene getaway. The setting is maybe the most relaxing place you'll ever visit and the location is smack in the middle of the Mississippi Blues scene. The cottage is elegant with a lean toward history. It is clean, we'll kept, well appointed, and romantic. A big plus is all the animals on the farm (especially Levi the dog). Without a doubt, this is the best AirBnb we've ever experienced."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely recommend this cozy little cottage for a get away from everything kinda wknd
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great vantage point for seeing the Mississippi Delta. Staying on a cotton farm made history come alive with the privacy of a charming guest house to ponder the experience.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice cozy cabin. Not too far off the beaten path. Beautiful surroundings. Would definitely stay there again.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great weekend at the Peacock. Highly recommend this property for a farm stay getaway.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great hospitality and unique southern experience

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in the delta. Loved the cottage, and it was very comfortable and well-appointed. Enjoyed the fire pit, the porches, the hammock, and the dogs. I hope to be back with friends!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful piece of land, warm cottage & amazing animals! A perfect retreat for anyone looking for some peace and quiet! Can't recommend highly enough!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The little cabin was the perfect place for me to stay while visiting the Delta. I could easily go places from there and then return to the quiet cabin to reflect.
I really appreciated the art work and the selections of books, they made me feel at home."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This cabin made for the perfect relaxing weekend for our little family! We loved exploring the grounds and lounging on the screened in porch.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cottage.
Wonderful hosts.
Thank you for everything"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of those gems that you’re tempted to keep to yourself…the Peacock in the Delta is something really special. But like most good things in life, they’re better when shared. The cottage, the setting, the people, the animals- absolutely idyllic. We truly didn’t want to leave. If you enjoy horses, ask Lars (an awesome human and impeccable host) to set you up with Archie (also an amazing guy) for a ride around the property. You won’t regret choosing this little slice of heaven!!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely clean house, exactly as represented. Host responded quickly and efficiently to a small problem that we had and was easy to communicate with! We were in the Delta to visit family and enjoyed driving the back roads."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second visit to Lars' cottage and it won't be my last! I arrived feeling stressed and weary and left feeling peaceful and rejuvenated (even with some work thrown in during my visit!). I did a little walking with Lars' dogs around the property, but it was a warm weekend, so I mostly just hung out on the screened porch or in the hammock. I was visiting by myself this time and felt totally safe. It's the perfect place for a getaway either with a friend or partner or on your own! I brought all the food I needed for my time there and never left the property. Ahhhh!!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed this Delta gem! Beautiful property and the Peacock cottage is wonderfully upscale while retaining a rustic feel. Lars went above and beyond to give us a great visit! Thank you!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely AMAZING stay! Me and my family needed to get away from our busy lives in a busy city and this was just what was needed. Every aspect of this stay was 5 stars from Lars communication, hospitality, and the charm of the cottage and property. The small touches such as providing coffee, sugar, and cream was great. Lars even allowed for my entire family to go horse back riding which was the most amazing experience. My 4 year old has not stopped talking about this trip yet and fell in love with Lars dog Rider. We will be back later this year and would absolutely recommend this airbnb to anyone. Lars, Kay, and Louisa treated us like family. This is absolutely a hidden gem!!! 5/5 stars (would give more if we could)."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful and peaceful place! Truly a little slice of paradise tucked away in the Mississippi Delta. This was our second time to stay at Peacock Cottage and I've already booked our next stay.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to getaway for a weekend… the cottage was perfect and Lars was super nice and helpful!!! We look forward to getting another chance in the future to stay at the Peacock!!!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredibly charming cottage! This is JUST what we needed for a peaceful kids free girls weekend!! There are no pictures that can do this farm justice. No road noise, just nature at its finest. The cottage did tend to stay a little on the warm side bc of all the windows but all those windows also provided stunning views!
We were fortunate enough to have a small rain shower right at lunch & we loved picnicking on the screened in porch. It was perfect!
Every morning we enjoyed coffee & Bible study time on the porch and then walked right out the door to the pool. It was fabulous!
Levi, (the bernadoodle) was super friendly
and was the perfect tour companion as we walked around the property.
Lars was gracious and available but not overbearing. The cottage was closer to their home than I had realized but we still had plenty of privacy.
We brought most of our own groceries but did enjoy a delicious meal at NOLA and at lost pizza.
If you want to sleep in you might want to bring a sleep mask because the cottage does have lots of natural light ☺️
We look forward to returning in cooler temps to take advantage of the fire pit! Our time went too quickly and we look forward to coming again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay on the farm. We really got to relax and enjoy the country. We loved the tennis court and the pool. River and Levi were a big hit with our daughter! We went on a horse ride with Lars and thats was just so fun. I really reccomend this place for a realxing country stay !
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We thoroughly enjoyed our last trip before our son starts school! He says his favorite things were swimming and of course riding the horses! Lars was so patient with him (he’s 4) & so kind! Can’t recommend this place enough!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I loved everything about this property. The nature, the cozy cottage, the pool, the location…..it was the perfect recipe for a relaxing getaway.
There are many things to do within an hours drive, but I also spend some days walking the grounds, reading on the porch.
I would stay here again and hope to!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lars is a wonderful host! Quick to respond and making sure we had everything we needed!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great host. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the activities, and I got to talk about sustainable agriculture too."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tranquil. Comfy. One of a kind. Perfect.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our second time to visit the Peacock. We just love it! It's definitely One of our favorite Airbnb's! The cottage is just so cozy and perfect. The view is incredible. The pool is so relaxing. Lars has thought of everything to make your stay so nice and stress free. Lars is a wonderful host. He's very easy to communicate with and very quick on responses. If you book here, you will not be disappointed! It truly is a gem!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You will be greeted by River & Levy two of the sweetest dogs. Lars is very kind & accommodating. He is a great host and quick to respond to anything you may need. We loved the cottage, so comfortable. It was just what we needed for a quick getaway. The pool was relaxing and refreshing. You couldn’t ask for more from a host. We also really enjoyed the two porches, very comfortable. We had a great time, beautiful property!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a true gem! Can’t recommend it enough. The cottage is cute, comfy, and well equipped. Lars is a great host and graciously took time to show us around and make sure we were comfortable. Peacock Inn is really well situated to visit a lot of the interesting spots in the Delta. We loved it here and would definitely return!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we can't say enough about this treasure in the delta. the host was so welcoming. the farm stay was lovely in every respect. we especially adored the front porch with the fan. the beds are to die for. The setting though is what really sets this Airbnb apart. don't pass up an opportunity to stay.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay at Lar’s and Cay’s Peacock Cottage! It’s beautiful! Stayed with my husband and our two boys 8 and 13. The boys were kept busy playing tennis, basketball, swimming and exploring the farm. The pool was cool and refreshing! We spent time in the local towns visiting the pottery shops, restaurants and stopped by the Winterville Mounds all which we enjoyed. Lars and his family are gracious hosts!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The cottage at Peacock in the Delta is absolutely charming! To be honest, I can’t remember the last time I called something charming. To be clear the cottage is small (one room attached to a full bathroom & a kitchenette but there’s a screened in porch and an open porch out back) but it had everything I needed for an 8 day stay in the Delta. Lars’ is an awesome host. You won’t regret booking a stay here."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here was absolutely magical! The farm and landscape are stunning and just what we needed. The cottage is cozy and beautifully decorated. Lars was a fantastic host, and we were grateful to learn more about his family’s land and get a tour. I would come back and visit in a heartbeat!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful peaceful place!
Very beautifully done, quiet little cottage. All the necessities we needed for a peaceful weekend. We had a great time just sitting on the porches sipping coffee."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely charming cottage! The pics and descriptions are spot on-- I wish we could've spent a few more days there to take full advantage of all that was offered, but we are already planning a return with our kids.
The cottage is bright and lovingly decorated, the scenery is gorgeous, Lars, Cay, and their family are extremely kind and gracious, and their doggies are adorable! My husband chose well, we will be going back (not soon enough!).
- Doe's Eat Place, get the filet!
-Betty's Place-- oh my goodness, amazing BBQ!
- The Carriage House-- get yourself a candle and tell Alice the Brownlees sent you!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A little piece of Delta paradise..great hospitality, idyllic landscape, beautiful & comfortable cottage. Perfect spot to spend a slow, relaxing weekend. We came with our two children, 8 & 10, and we all had the best time exploring the farm, relaxing on the porches, playing tennis, swimming, horseback riding, playing with the sweetest pups, and riding in Mr. Lar’s truck around the farm. We hope we can return soon!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm a repeat customer, which should say a lot. If you're looking for a quiet getaway, in a unique and interesting area, this is your spot. Lars is an amazing host, and the farm is a beautiful and peaceful place. I'll be back again."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is *amazing* - I'm really not going to do justice to how beautiful, relaxing, and gracious a place this is. We've stayed in many, many Airbnb's, nearly all of them good to great, and this one is our family favorite. The cottage is even more beautiful in person, and those beds, whoa, we slept like babies. The land is just gorgeous. What really makes this place, though, much as with any place, is the people: our hosts were so gracious and welcoming that we just immediately felt at ease. There's much to do onsite and it's a great base for exploring the delta, but the best thing is to just sit on one of the two porches and do nothing at all :) (really). Highly recommend.
Ps: Great shower. Kitchen has everything you'd need. Yard with fire pit is another bonus."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A charming cottage in an idyllic setting! We can’t wait to come back!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay. The photos do not do it justice!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If I'm ever back in the area I'll be staying here again.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great find! Cant wait to visit again!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. I was surprised by how well the cabin kept warm when the temperatures were cold. Very nice place with everything you need for a weekend stay
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lars was extremely accommodating & River (the pup) was the best tour guide of the property! A beautiful space with rustic, country views."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is comfortable with great views of the farm. The land itself is beautiful, and the host is exactly who you want to hang out with when you’re in the Delta. Lars knows tons of history of the land and can tell you all about the Delta, farming, hunting, horses, and Southern writers and artists. A true Southern renaissance man."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is magical! The cabin may be small, but I can't think of a thing that would improve it. My husband and I enjoyed a short getaway, but I could also imagine coming here for a solo retreat or even a cozy stay with the kids. (Though they're about to list a new, larger cabin on the same property, so we'd probably stay there if they came.) The weather in mid-November was unseasonably warm, so we got to play games on the screened porch and read on the front porch that overlooks the horse pasture. We took long walks around the property and saw deer and an owl. Even Lars' and Cay's dogs were hospitable, welcoming us as soon as we pulled up and accompanying us on our walks.
You could certainly stay on the property your whole visit without getting bored. There's tennis, basketball, horseback riding, and even a lovely pool in season. But we took a drive to Cleveland one night and ate dinner on the patio at Hey Joe's (which felt safe because of the open air, even during Covid) and then took a long stroll through the impressive downtown Christmas light display. The next day, we drove over to Greenville for a catfish sandwich at Gino's (thanks to the recommendation of a previous reviewer!), a peaceful walk through the Greenville Cypress Preserve, a drive to Warfield Point Park to see the Mississippi River, and finally a stop by Winterville Mounds to see some of the largest remaining mounds constructed by indigenous people a thousand years ago.
All in all, it was a fantastic getaway and I'm trying to figure out how soon I can get back!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you guys so much for such a wonderful weekend! The farm, the cabin, and the hospitality where everything we hoped for. The cabin was so comfortable and had everything we needed for our weekend stay. Thank you for allowing us to walk all over your farm and meet all of the animals—our kids haven’t stopped talking about the old mama horse and keep naming every pig after Lucky. Lars was quick to respond and very accommodating with any request we had. We can’t wait to be back!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the perfect get away spot. It is so relaxing and clean. I enjoyed getting up with the sunrise and drinking coffee and knitting on the back porch. You are close enough to Cleveland and Marigold to enjoy other spots in the Delta. But, you could easily stay there and never leave. We enjoyed the pool and just sitting outdoors by the fire. If you want to get away and unwind this is the spot. Read a book, play a game, nap or whatever you enjoy! We plan to return. The cottage is plenty spacious. The decorative touches are thoughtful, and everything is very comfortable and cozy! The host is kind and responsive and provides good communication. Book a stay here and be prepared to fall in love and return’"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a very peaceful getaway at the cottage. Sweet place with lots of windows and light. Two great porches — one screened-in. Coffee on the porch in the morning was lovely. Lots of bird watching. We would stay here again.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a BEAUTIFUL place and the host is amazing!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at this quiet, quaint cottage that provided beautiful views of the sunrise and the feel of complete escape from the hustle and bustle of life. Coffee on the porch each morning was our favorite!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lars’ place is a secluded, beautiful and peaceful place in a unique part of the country. While Lars and family are nearby, the space feels entirely yours, but Lars is quick to respond to messages if needed. We spent mornings on the back porch enjoying the early sun and evenings having dinner on the screened front porch, and of course enjoyed the pool and tennis courts. Be sure to ask for Archie’s number for horseback riding around the property, he’s got a wealth of knowledge and plenty of good jokes to share. Nearby are several good restaurants and bars (with safe distancing during pandemic), including Hey Joe’s in Cleveland which seems to have the most affordable craft beer in the world and Gino’s, a drive through with one of the best catfish sandwich I’ve ever had. We can’t wait to come back."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our birthdays. It was wonderful! It's so quiet, so peaceful, and just a great place to unwind for a few days. We loved the pool and sitting on the back porch taking in the view. If you book here, you won't regret it!! The host made check-in super easy and was very quick with responses.
We hope to get back soon for another stay!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time at the cottage. We took our children with us. We swam, played board games, grilled, reads books and just enjoyed being away from it all. This is definitely a special place to stay. It is beautiful, cozy and a real home away from home. We hope to visit again!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cottage is just as special as shown in the photos. Great experience for our first Airbnb. Lars communication made it easy. Very comfortable and good location for touring the Delta.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The farm is a little slice of heaven, and the cabin and the grounds are even more beautiful than the photos. Cay and Lars are gracious, wonderful hosts. We are sure we will be back soon, as we can’t imagine staying anywhere else in the Delta.
Thank you so much for a fantastic stay."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super relaxing getaway! Would be the perfect artist retreat, small family weekend, or romantic weekend."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time. Just the quiet getaway we needed.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful couple, Lars and Cay, thank you for letting me stay your beautiful property. I was very impressed with your way of life. For me, Lars is a man of independence, intellectual and full of curiosity and challenge, like Clint Eastwood. At the same time, Cay is a thoughtful, bright lady with a philosophical mindset like Susan Sontag. And both of them have warm hospitality.
My gut feeling is saying that this experience in the Tennessee Delta will bring me something unforeseen to my future life. I will return here someday. Let's keep diving ""into the unknown"" until then!"
2020-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,A quaint cottage with plenty of nature to enjoy!!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay and it was as great as I remembered it. Nothing quite like waking up to see the horses running around in the adjacent field. I hope to come back soon.

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is perfect for a quiet get away. If you want to go somewhere with some peace and quiet, than I suggest you stay here because that’s just what you’ll get. We had a wonderful stay here and are definitely planning on coming back soon!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The perfect retreat for solace and relaxation! Thoughtful touches abound throughout. You will not be disappointed!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I rented out Lars’s cottage with the hope that I’d have a relaxing and quiet getaway by myself, and I was not disappointed. Everything about the cottage was just right. The space was beautiful, and everything you need for a weekend getaway is all included. I hope to return in the near future!"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"HIDDEN TREASURE!
This place is amazing!
I was looking for somewhere to get away for the weekend to unplug, unwind and exhale and this beautiful property did not disappoint! It is such a unique place and I’m already looking forward to going back again."

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific, out of the way place to stay. The farm setting provides a quiet peaceful environment. I would highly recommend."

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay in a really secluded spot
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very relaxing cabin!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic spot to relax and enjoy the Delta! Small cozy cabin with an awesome setup for full relaxation. We brought four 4-year-olds and it’s still a trip they’re talking about ... from finding frogs, to the splashing in the pool, to running around the tennis courts, and the horseback riding ... it’s a trip they won’t soon forget. Lars was a fantastic host! Informative and helpful, but not intrusive at all.
Definitely recommend this spot for a nice relaxing trip to the delta. We hope to be back!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's a piece of Mississippi paradise! Awesome place for unplugging!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My first visit was so good, I brought my family back for a relaxing weekend. Just as good the second time as it was the first. Lots of space to lounge around and relax in the pool."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Soo beautiful , tranquil , Peaceful & perfect ! Everything about this delta property was just amazing !! Loved it !! The land is lush and to die for ! The cabin is cozy and charming ! Thank y’all for having us !"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This vacation exceeded all my expectations! Such a beautiful setting and the cottage is beyond explanation – clean and artfully decorated to fit its surroundings perfectly. We traveled with a 3 and 1.5 year old and the pool was a big hit! Lars even took us around to see Lucky the pig, horses, chickens, and his beautiful farm. We’ll be returning ASAP for another quiet and relaxing weekend!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a quite cottage in the woods u have found it!!! Safe and secluded, miles from the main towns. We loved our stay the cottage was cute, cozy and well stocked with everything u may need pulse it has a swimming pool!!!! My husband and I enjoyed ourselves the first night just unhooking from the world. The second night our kids joined us and we had an afternoon of swimming. We ended the night with beautiful thunderstorms across the Delta, which are some of God’s greatest masterpieces. We sat on the screened in porch listening to the rain and went to bed to the sights and sound of the thunderstorm thru the wallnof windows inside the cabin. Perfect weekend get away. U will not be sorry to book “the peacock”"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"From the bucolic view to the art, books , porches and comfy beds the cottage is one of the most charming Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. Very clean, just as pictured and great communication from Lars."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best place on earth to relax and enjoy the beautiful nature and farm. They thought of everything in the cabin. We really enjoyed the farm, the horses, pig and swimming pool. We even stayed for 2 more nights than planned because we were already homesick. :) Spend a night or 2 here, you will love it!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Lars' place twice. We stayed 2 nights longer because it was so beautiful and wonderful to be there!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cottage and surrounding area are unbelievably tranquil and we will be returning again soon. Lars was so accommodating, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was sparkling clean.
Note to out-of-towners/folks unfamiliar with the Mississippi Delta region: there are LOTS of LARGE BUGS, especially at dusk. We stayed in the beginning of June, so other times of the year it isn’t usually as “busy”, but don’t be surprised by lots of insects! That being said, Lars had some bug spray and a porch that was screened in which definitely helps."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is one of the most incredible places I've stayed using Airbnb. Such a calm and peaceful space. It's the perfect retreat and I was completely blown away by Lar's hospitality. I can't rave enough about what a dream the cabin and farm are and can't wait to come back for a longer stay.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We truly enjoyed the lodging and hospitality we received. The home was very comfortable and met all of our needs. We'll definitely share this treasure with others. Our only hesitancy was the entrance to the property. The brush leading to the property was a little overwhelming (I'm sure due to the amount rain that has fallen), but once we got beyond the brush, we felt as if we'd reached a small paradise."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was an absolute dream. So incredibly peaceful and comfortable. The property was absolutely beautiful and really made you forget about the rest of the world. The cottage was very well decorated and well equipped with a little kitchen. Only thing I would note is that the cottage is just right across the yard from the owners house, so you are not completely secluded, but it didn’t bother us at all."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful host and wonderful place ❤️. Hopefully will return for a girls weekend to enjoy the pool and tennis court.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful cottage - perfect place to stay in the Delta! We will be back!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed my stay. The outdoors view was great and there was much to explore. The sunrise was amazing that morning we were leaving. It made me feel really good to be out in the country again.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very special place in the middle of nowhere. The small house is located on a farm next to the owners house. It has a bed- / livingroom, a bathroom and a small kitchen. There is also a terrace were you can just sit down and relax a bit. As two sides of the house are nearly complete made out of windows, it gives you a very special feeling in the night. You feel like you are a part of the nature sourounding the house. Lars is a very nice guy who gives you a warm welcome. We recommend this airbnb and would come back everytime."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The MS Delta is such a unique place to visit. This was a great location and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I look forward to coming back!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was such a GREAT cozy place to stay
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Your hosts Lars and Kay are the definition of southern hospitality. Beautiful cottage and land that is a complete experience!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lars is an amazing host.
2019-02-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,The Delta Cottage was better than expected! Everything was so clean and very comfortable. I did stay in the cold winter/rainy month but I stayed warm with the nice linens and the heater in the bathroom helped a lot . The horses and wildlife are beautiful and super cool to watch and appreciate. I didn’t ride because of busy work schedule but I will certainly come back to take them up on it! Archie was super nice and helpful as well. Kitchenette is small but efficient and while I don’t read much the selection made me want to. There wasn’t any storage for clothes like dressers or closets but I found the hooks on the bathroom door and the front hanger hook very helpful. Luggage racks came in handy too! All in all I recommend anyone to come stay I was happy and very pleased with my stay!
2019-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome location, wish there was a lock on the door as you leave, if there’s been a rain your vehicle will get dirty and a you may have to trek a little way to the cottage, the heater wasn’t working properly so it got really cold, Lars gave Us a free night because of it, I would go again because it is a very Vibey place!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an amazing place to stay if you're looking for a memorable and authentic Mississippi Delta experience. Incredible sight to wake up to... looking out over acres of picture perfect farmland. The accommodation is super cosy, friendly hosts... couldn't recommend it highly enough."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful place with a great host. If you try to make a big dinner, you may have difficulty in the very small kitchen. Live simple and eat simple... will be a good idea."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,By far the best place I've stayed so far
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin is picturesque. The windows are wonderful, the decoration in the cabin is eclectic and oh so pretty, and everything was clean! If you’ll be in the delta (anywhere from Cleveland, MS to Greenville, MS) I highly recommend!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A Transcendental experience in the Delta. Perfect in every way. Thanks Lars!
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful and cozy cabin

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Future travelers can expect very good hospitality, clean, quiet and comfortable."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re thinking about staying at Lars’ place then don’t hesitate, just go ahead and book it now! We had the most brilliant stay and are so sad that it could only be for just the one night.
The cottage is so peaceful with only the sound of wildlife all around. It’s beautifully decorated and we enjoyed looking at all of the books on the bookshelves. The photos do not do this place justice!
Lars is such a great host and very kindly took us on a tour of the farm in the morning. We feel very lucky to have spent some time here and will be recommending it to friends if and when they pass through. One of our best air bnb experiences for sure.
Thank you so much Lars, we really hope we can come back one day.
James and Ester"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a special and uncommon place, do yourself a favor and book some time here."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Southern charm with solitude and character 💜 great place to relax and decompress from the hustle and bustle of everyday life ! You won’t be disappointed !
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peacock Cottage is such a beautiful place in the middle of one of our favorite places - the MS Delta. Clean, inviting and peaceful- with little touches that just say welcome all throughout!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lars' place is just as perfect as you would expect. My partner and I were looking for a quiet weekend away from the city and we found just that. Lars met us as we pulled up the driveway, was friendly and respectful from the start. The cabin is perfect for a few days away; it has a small kitchen with range, sink, mini-fridge, microwave, and a few pots/pans/utensils. The bathroom had clean towels and a new bar of soap, bath/shower, and a few board games in the closet. The linens were clean and the cabin itself was fresh and tidy. We watched the sun rise from the SW facing porch, strolled around Lars' cotton fields, swam in the pool, and enjoyed the night from the screened in porch. The cabin is full of windows so you feel outside even when the mosquitoes push you in. We saw thousands of stars and the Milky Way, and even on hot days, the nights were cool and breezy. If you're looking for a safe, quiet place to hide out in the Mississippi Delta, I couldn't recommend Lars' cottage more."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lars’ place was a wonderful respite on my way down to Texas from New Jersey. He was so gracious during the entire process as I had to arrive late and leave so early. I’m so sad I didn’t get to see the property during the day light— from what I could see it felt like a magical lush forest accompanied by the summer songs of crickets. So peaceful! The cottage itself was clean, cozy and the books were incredible selections. Like another reviewer said on here, I would definitely come back to spend some quality solo time to write.
Thanks again Lars for your hospitality and flexibility with my travel plans! Can’t wait to come back for the full experience!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you want a place to get away from a too busy world , this is the place. Very quaint, secluded , and peaceful . If you don’t like this place , I doubt that you would be happy anywhere!!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Magical location!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the best place we have ever stayed in. The cottage is beautiful, set in a picturesque farm."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very special place. Worth a detour to spend a night at this gem of a place. Lars was an excellent host. Highly recommend!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lars and his wife Cay created a little piece paradise- everything was perfect! Lars' warm welcome and constant attention to make our stay something unique made our stop in the Mississippi Delta a unique experience! We'll be back again. Katty Michel and Loïck
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best of Airbnb!! Just returned from my second trip to the Delta Cottage in Shaw. Such a great experience!! Lars is an incredible host, and the Delta Cottage has so many thoughtful touches on a beautiful property in the Delta. Great for writing, reading, and quiet."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Once we arrived, we viewed staying at the Peackock as a once in a lifetime experience. The pictures and descriptions do not do this place justice. Lars is such a great host and gave us a lot of information about surrounding areas and also the history of his wonderful farm. He took us in his 4 wheel drive and showed us buildings on his property that have true historical value, including a 1860 crop sharers store. That's the sort of building that you'd normally only see roped off on a tour.
Lars wife Cay gave me flowers on my birthday - a lovely gesture. Finn lived up to his celebrity status! Full of character and mischievousness.
The cabin was delightful and very clean with all the home comforts you need. The pool was a very welcome addition as it is very hot in June and we loved looking out to the fields whilst swimming in the cool water.
Cannot recommend this accommodation highly enough. We wish we could have stayed a lot longer."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful hidden jewel was just what I needed, it was centrally located to many small southern towns, restaurants, music and museums. Not enough time though, I do suggest at least a week to go to all the local hangouts for music, festivals, food and museums. They are within 30-40 miles from the cottage in the woods. The pool was great after a hot day riding with the top down. It was so quiet and peaceful . Just absolutely breathtaking scenery. Just needed more time. I will definitely be back and soon... Loved the dog Finn, he was a great companion. Lars was a fantastic host. Thank you!
Mary Kaye"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely lovely cabin with a beautiful view. When I arrived, everything was neat and homey. Adorable decorations and the home, pool, and tennis court looked like it just belonged where it was at. The horses weren’t out when I got there. But, Archie, a helper, took me to see them my second day. Truly wonderful experience that left me feeling refreshed. Exactly as expected, with a few surprises like 2 rainbows, butterflies swimming around the pool, and lovely hydrangeas growing out front."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A utterly beguiling cottage in the heart of the Delta. The accommodations were lovely and the decor was whimsical and delightful. Our host was very communicative and helpful.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exceeded our expectations. Quiet and relaxing setting with a very hospitable host. Could not have asked for anything more.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great host. Very relaxing get away. Wish we could have stayed longer.
Loved relaxing by the pool during the day and watching the fire flies in the evening."
2018-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Delta Cottage is a nicely hidden spot not far from Indianola and the B.B. King museum, for the real Blues lovers. However, keep in mind about a number of things:
- ask Lars in advance the access code to the gate, otherwise you cannot enter the property (and it takes an hour for you to get in, as we had);
- the pool is sometimes not usable, we were there at the end of May and there was unfortunately no water in it (while we had explicitly chosen the Delta Cottage because of the pool);
- it has windows all around, not all of which can be blinded, so that means you will be up very early;
- and bring all the food and drinks (water and for your breakfast on the porch, among other things) yourself."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderfully aesthetic little cabin, surrounded by meadows and interesting landscaping. Quiet. Could’ve hung out and read here for a week.
Lars was a thoughtful, attentive, and engaging host. A highlight of our visit.
Appreciated the good coffee that was provided in the morning, since it’s far from commercial areas."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay. Lars was very responsive. The location was convenient to a number of towns and was remote enough that I felt away from it all. I hope to be back!
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here while in the area for a baseball tournament that was being held at Delta State University, which is less than 20 minutes away. This small cottage on the farm for my husband and me was just perfect. It was so peaceful and beautiful there, and much better than being stuck in a hotel room. Being on the farm surrounded by the horses, Lucky the pig, Finn the farm dog, and the croaking of the frogs was so relaxing. The kitchen is small, but is well equipped with everything we needed. We would eat breakfast each morning on the screen porch while listening to the sounds of nature around us. The cabin is very clean and nicely decorated, with a rustic touch. Lars was not there when we arrived, but he contacted us to make sure we had directions and everything we needed when we checked in. During our stay, Lars gave us a tour of the farm and told us about his future plans for growth, including a baseball field. We brought our bikes, and went riding on the farm trails one morning. His house is next door in case you need anything, but far enough away so you have privacy at the cottage. Staying here was definitely one of the highlights of our trip."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lars’s place is amazing! It is way better than even the pictures show. It has a ton a great touches and is very well thought out. We even got to pet some horses that walked up in front of the cabin in the morning! Truly a one of a kind Airbnb experience!
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a unique place with a friendly host. Would be a little hard to find after dark but worth finding for its Peace, view, quiet, and nature all around. One of the best places we have happened upon on AirBnB!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"""And we all shine on"" - John Lennon The stars. Oh, how I loved the stars! This is a lovely getaway with plenty to do within a short drive. Clean with tons of touches and a great little library. Lars is a kind and attentive host, as is Fin. Thank you for sharing this space this with us."
2018-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The best kitchen amenities: an iron skillet & nesting Pyrex colored ceramic bowls!
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the most special place we've ever stayed at and we can't wait to go back. Lars wasn't their to receive us, but the communication was impeccable."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I was surprised to arrive and find Lars working on the gate to his property. Rather than a typical check-in it was an interesting way to begin a month long journey. The cottage is perfect for a retreat or a brief respite on a journey. I spent a month there and immensely enjoyed the experience. The setting is unusual for it is not simply perfectly flat fields, sculpted and maintained for farming. It is a farm with gently rolling hills (for the Mississippi Delta), pasture, cultivated fields, and woodland. The cottage looks out on a pasture that is a peaceful and serene setting. Lars and Cay Ely are outstanding hosts and make your visit to Peacock a wonderful experience."
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a little gem and the perfect way to escape the hustle and bustle! Situated between Indianola and Cleveland, it provided a great, central location for access to sites like th Grammy Museum and B.B. King Museum. The porch was the perfect spot for a cup of coffee and a beautiful Delta sunrise. Lars was just delightful. We will definitely be back!"
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place— tucked in the Delta down a gravel drive about 1/4 mile. A darling light filled one room cabin with a front and back porch, gliders and comfy couches on both. Inside you have a seating area with two good size leather chairs, a little writing desk, a small kitchen and two perfectly appointed beds—and I am a sucker for a nice bed. Crisp sheets, down comforter, an easy-to-read-by light ... right up against giant windows displaying a magnificent thunderstorm. I woke the next morning to horses playfully scampering in the field, cardinals scratching at the ground, a fog lifting— or maybe not lifting. So the weather wasn’t perfect, but the stay was delightful. This place was on my radar by recommendation of a friend, but we booked at the last minute when we decided we didn’t want to drive any further that day. Lars responded immediately and got there to meet us right away. ( He actually lives right there but wasn’t home at the time.)
And as soon as we loaded the car to leave he appeared to see us off.
We weren’t there at a time for tennis or swimming, but yes! Both are right out your door.
A wonderfully peaceful respite. A few days here and I’m thinking I’d find myself writing the next southern novel... I would stay again."
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Mississippi Delta cottage is a magical little spot with a gorgeous view of fields where horses roam. The cottage is comfortable and there are lovely thoughtful touches throughout. It would be an absolute dream in warmer weather with a pool and tennis court just outside as well as two porches to take in the view. Lars is an outstanding host and took us and our kids on a rip roaring tour of the farm which involved a swamp tour, picking pecans and turnip greens, petting horses and the pet pig and all round fun. Lars and family are lovely and generous and left us with a strong desire to come back as soon as we possibly can."
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin and setting were perfect for a quick getaway.
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the dreamiest place in the world. I really wish I had more time there. Would love to go back in the warmer months. Lars and his family were so sweet and made sure we had everything we needed. The house was perfect and everything was so thoughtfully designed.
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lars 's place is a great place for a getaway. The scenery is nice and the cottage is excellent with a lot of extra touches. We enjoyed our one night stay.
2017-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a gorgeous, rural cabin, and it is absolutely worth the drive. We loved our stay and hope to be back."
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The pictures of this BNB don't do it any justice. The view is breath taking! The horses are amazing and Lars' dog was very welcoming! The cabin is clean and has a great personality. Would love to stay again.
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you’re thinking of renting this cottage, do it. One of the magical places I’ve been. My children loved it. We will be back!"
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to get away from a busy life. Makes you stop and realize there is more to life. Enjoyed the sunsets and sunrises. Will never get over Gods beauty. Blessed to experience this
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A nice place in the heart of a thriving farm in Delta...
It was very clean, well maintained, and equipped with everything you need for your stay, and the host, Lars, generously gave us a tour around his farm and explained his business and its story."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great place to stay! I wish I was able to stay longer.
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved it and so did our 1yr old little girl. The cottage was clean, and cozy. It was exactly what us city folks needed."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,a bit of William Faulkner. ...
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful respite on our vacation. When Lars tells you you will want to stay for at least two nights, he is telling the truth! It was such a tranquil spot, the horses were lovely, and FINN is the friendliest dog. We truly enjoyed our stay, once it cooled off. It was a HOT day to begin with."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for an out of the way perfectly appointed accommodation this is the place for you. As a bonus you'll meet Finn - the cutest little Jack Russel terrier. Sit on your back porch and gaze out on the ""back 40"" and watch the horses cavort. You're 15 minutes from Indianola or Cleveland. The kitchen is small but functional, the beds HUGE. Lars wasn't there the first couple of days of our stay but the minor start up problems we had were solved quickly by text and once he came back Lars took us on a tour of the farm and explained his plans for developing the property. Very ambitious but that's the kind of guy he is. Rest assured that if you book you will have a stay to remember."

2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect place for our group. Nice to have the separate upstairs bedrooms and a door that can close off that space for privacy and quiet. Waking up and having coffee on the deck and watching the hummingbirds was a great way to start the day. The lake was so peaceful and relaxing before everyone woke up.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Megan’s place was very comfortable for our family visiting from the Northeast. There was plenty of room, the home was clean and well furnished and Megan was a great communicator about the neighborhood, how to find the house and any other questions I had."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Best thing about this home is it is available in my hometown. The number of shocked people faces when I said I was staying in an Airbnb is unheard of. The house is on the water and was great waking up to the view every morning. The home is beautifully decorated and had everything we need for our stay. Covered parking and even shelter under home during storms. This home is my number one go to from here on out when I go home.

We really appreciate it and THANK YOU VERY MUCH for having us as a guest!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place with beautiful Lake View
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This is a beautiful home. The view is spectacular. The lake view is awesome. Location is ok but there is an abandoned home next door. The pictures are accurate view of the home. The host Megan stayed in contact and that was refreshing.

2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing views Amazing house Amazing communication with host. Just need a truck for the drive in with gravel lol but i will still bring my sedan because it’s just that nice 10 out of 10
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved meeting Lars and the gorgeous home! His land is so beautiful and peaceful, and we even took a dip in the pool, and met the animals. Already booked another stay. What a gem!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It’s always a pleasure to stay in one of Lars’s cottages. Beautiful property, great pool, friendly host, and centrally located to all of the best of the Mississippi Delta. We could easily stay for several weeks. Lars goes above and beyond as host to make sure you have everything you need - he even brought us a grill. He is responsive to questions. We hope to visit regularly!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Came to the area with our family and enjoyed staying ‘on the farm’ as that is what we are used too. The children loved the swimming pool and we all enjoyed walking all the beautiful trails. Lars was a terrific host and would stay here again. One thing to note which probably wouldn’t affect the majority of people staying, but we love to cook our own meals and there wasn’t a lot of amenities in the kitchen, but we made do."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay, and would stay there again. We loved the screened porch and swings. The beds were very comfortable and the room A/C's worked great. Baths were nice also. We enjoyed seeing the horses the morning that we were to leave. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and hope to be back next year. Thank you."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and enjoyable. I was working from out of town and had a trailer and he offered me a place to park it without extra charge.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The most beautiful cabin in a serene setting. I drove in late from out of town and Lars made sure I made it safely. We had issues with the gate to the property and Lars was immediately available to assist! We loved staying here and hope to be back very soon!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cottage and location. Lars is a wonderful host! Wish we could have stayed longer!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great spot to get away and relax!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fun little cottage on the farm. Woke up to horses grazing in the pasture. And had to keep my wife from playing with the pig. Great stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you everything was great.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I loved our stay at Sycamore! Our trip was planned around attending a class at the Viking Cooking School in Greenwood, but we all agreed the time we spent at the cottage was equally enjoyable!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very beautiful property that is so peaceful and secluded. Very spacious, well decorated home with plenty of space. Had all of the amenities listed and then some. Lars was extremely helpful and responsive. He gave very clear instructions of how to navigate the property to give us the best experience possible."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lars was great! Amazing setting. Very peaceful and quiet! Looked just like the photos!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lars was a great host! Very friendly and easy to talk to! He gave us a tour of his lovely property and we learned the history of his family farm.
I must say the photos do not do it justice. The land is very peaceful and picturesque. We enjoyed the quiet and listening to the cicadas. We also enjoyed the rain on the tin roof while swinging on the screened in porch.
The space is just beautiful and very clean. We loved the decor and cozy beds.
The pool was so nice too! Lars even provided us with beach towels! It was cool to watch the horses while we swam!
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would love to visit again. This place is a real gem. Best kept secret in my opinion!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lars was a wonderful host. The Sycamore Cottage was just what we needed for our party of 6 - comfortable to sleep and hang out, but centrally located for us to tour around The Delta. The setting was lovely, and we were able to enjoy the pool a few times as well. The favorite spot was the screened porch, and we had to take turns lounging on the bed swings. That was the spot for morning coffee, reading a good book, afternoon naps, and evening chats."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lars' farm in Sunflower County was absolutely AMAZING! The cottage we stayed in was stunning--it belongs on the cover of Architectural Digest! The views of the surrounding farm were beautiful and it was so quiet and peaceful. We spent most days sitting on the front and back porches enjoying the view and sitting by the pool watching the horses stroll by. Lars was so friendly and welcoming, he even gave us a tour of his farm. We would highly recommend this stay to anyone visiting the Delta."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lars is a fantastic host. Highlights of the house include two renovated bathrooms, a screened-in porch, and bucolic surroundings. Don't miss the opportunity to stay here!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was out in the 'country' Quiet, remote. Was lovely to wake up to the birds chirping outside. Enjoyed sitting on the porch on the bed swings and just enjoy the serenity. The cottage was exactly as in the pictures. Good place to step away and just get some R & R. It was about 20-30 minute drive to get into town (depending on where you needed to go)."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the house and the location! It was perfect for us! The ONLY issue we had was locating the driveway at night. Could be marked a little better. But other than that, it was great!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Highly recommended.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a wonderful location and home. Highly recommend
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"From start to finish, Lars was a fantastic host. He was always responsive in communication, met us when we checked in to make sure we found everything ok, and was wonderful with our kids when they wanted to ride the horses. The house itself was perfect, with an idyllic setting and beautiful finishes inside. We stayed two nights, and would have loved to stay longer. Whenever we are back in the Delta, we will absolutely be staying here!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is the second time we’ve stayed with Lars and look forward to coming back again! The property and the cottage are gorgeous and beautifully appointed. Lars is an awesome guy and extremely helpful and responsive to any questions. My husband and I both work remotely (on Zoom and FaceTime) and had no trouble at all. The beds are very comfortable with wonderful bedding. We enjoyed spending time on both porches in the mornings with our coffee and in the evening with a whiskey. If you’re looking for a beautiful spot in the Delta, this is the one! Thank you, Lars! See you soon!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I've stayed at Lars and it was just as fantastic as the first time. It is the coziest, most peaceful cottage; the furnishings, art and amenities are perfectly curated. It is quiet and comforting, and you can sit on the porch on either side of the house and stargaze or see the animals (horses and one giant pig) grazing on the land. It is the best the Delta has to offer ;), and both Lars and his wife are friendly, responsive and always helpful."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Even nicer than the pictures. Wonderful place, amazing porches! Great location in the heart of the Delta, easy drive to places we wanted to visit. Great host. We will definitely be back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing long weekend stay at Lars' place in Shaw. This is the real Delta and it's always a pleasure to visit with Lars, who's conversant in everything from farming (natch) to Faulkner. Will be back next year to relax and visit. Can't recommend highly enough."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The best stop for anyone wanting to see and experience the Delta
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"this place represents everything that is great about Airbnb. the house was unique. Their sense of style and originality was first rate. best of all however, and something that is missing from so many airbnbs, was the personal touch and connection. Lars was a great host personally, showing us around the farm and telling the history of the place. this is what traveling is all about."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay. Such a cute quiet little cottage. About 7 miles from the nearest store and gas station.
The kids enjoyed the horse back riding and the pool. The pool is across the field right in the side yard of the other cottage. My favorite was the bed swings. Also the regular beds are some of the most comfortable ones I've ever slept on. Perfect weekend getaway spot for adults but our kids enjoyed it too."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Lars’s was a great host. He had every thing set when we arrived making it very easy for us.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My kids and I enjoyed this little getaway out of the city! The beds were super comfy and the modern showers were fantastic. We cooled off in the swimming pool, and Lars helped us arrange horseback riding and a tour of the crop farm with his daughter. My kids loved seeing the horses roam around and the two farm dogs, River and Levi. We ventured into Leland and found the Birthplace of Kermit The Frog Museum, as well as a Railroad Museum with the most incredible model train system we've ever seen. It was a perfect weekend trip for relaxation and family time!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely the greatest little place to get away from it all. I live nearby and rented this cottage for my mother and adult children to stay at while they were in the Delta for a funeral. It was quiet and peaceful and completely surrounded by some of the best parts of the MS Delta. We wish we had had more time to enjoy it. They said it was their favorite AirBnB experience and they want to do it again the next time they come.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were delighted by our stay at Sycamore Cottage. Cay and Lars are gracious and welcoming hosts. The accommodations were charming and comfortable in a well appointed repurposed and renovated old Sunday school building. (The rest of the chapel is on the property.) We loved the comfy beds, beautiful art and decor, and huge porch swings, not to mention the beautiful views of horses on this farm. We look forward to returning and seeing our new friends again:-)"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! The cabin was exactly as pictures and peaceful, beautiful and cozy. We bumped into Lars and he couldn’t have been more gracious. This is a wonderful place to stay for peace and quiet. We even met some of the horses!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay all around. Just what we were looking for. Very peaceful & cozy.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It is not hyperbole when I say this is hands down the best Airbnb experience we have ever had. The cottage and the property itself are truly a dream. Not only that, the hosts are so warm and welcoming and some of the kindest people you’ll meet. We watched beautiful sunrises and sunsets from the porch, and man can you see some starry skies at night! It’s located smack dab in the middle of all of the biggest Blues Trail sites, but is worth a trip just on its own. We cannot wait to come back."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This property & the owners are wonderful. I felt safe traveling with my kids alone. Would love to return someday!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family visited the farm for a few days and had a great time! It's very clean, the water was hot, and the kids loved the swinging beds in the porch. The beds in the bedrooms were very comfortable. On our second day, it snowed and looked beautiful Lars was always there when we needed something or just to talk, but was not intrusive at all. Thanks for our great vacation in the Delta!!"

Overall I will be doing airbnb from now on."

Very nice couple, fun to visit with and very helpful if you need anything! I highly recommend and would definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The property was very nice. Being in the south, it was unsettling to see a cotton plant inside of a vase at the entrance of the home. There was also a movie poster of “The Help” framed and signed by the actors hanging up by the entrance as well. This was not included in the pictures posted on Airbnb. It did make us feel very uncomfortable and uneasy staying for the weekend. The property also has ants. We left my son’s burger on the counter and when he returned to eat it he could not because it was covered in ants."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This guesthouse is charming with personal touches including a stained glass sun hanging in an octagonal window in the bathroom and a beautiful glass swan dish for the shampoo. There was a heated tile floor in the bathroom. It felt like a home away from home.

The owners have everything you can think of, even for the pool and outside play. Before we arrived they set up a toddler bed and a pack n play for my baby to sleep in. When we did see them outside they were so nice (and respected our privacy as well) and we had quite a few things in common. Small world. I would def rebook with them!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mr Bill went above and beyond what was expected of him. My arrival time was late as I am a truck driver who needed a place to stay for the night. He very graciously offered to pick me and my son up from where we had to park my truck and trailer. If in the area again I will most certainly be looking to stay with him again and many more times I hope as I’m out that way quit often with the work I do. Thank you again to Mr Bill and his kindness!!!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough about this beautiful oasis in the Mississippi Delta. Clean, relaxing, and just what I needed for a week of writing and reflection.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were so glad the Alluvian was booked because it brought us to this gem of a place. Everything was just as described. Bill has a very clean, accomodating space supplied with all the amenities. (Heated floors in the bathroom and bath robes in the closet were a happy plus.) The bed was very comfy (after a Viking Cooking School class about 15-20 minutes away in Greenwood). The hosts were so easy to communicate with. (Thanks Bill for the restaurant recommendation.) We definitely want to go back in the near future to enjoy the pool and the beautiful grounds and anything else we may have missed. Thank you again for your hospitality."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great and luxurious place with all the amenities you could wish for. The salt water pool is a real relief after a hot day. The hostesses are very warm and welcoming and you’ll feel right at home.
Very relaxing time we had there even only it was for one day."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax and be cozy. Peaceful location a short distance away from the city of Greenwood. The pool and outdoor shower were awesome! Already missing Schlater.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really lovely home. The outdoor shower was a huge perk, and the breeze coming off the lake means you can enjoy the porch even in hot weather. The pool was big, deep and partially shaded…absolutely perfect! The hosts are so kind and quiet and give you all the polite privacy you could want."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect setting to unwind after a long day on the road. The hosts were friendly and unobtrusive. The guest house was well equipped. The pool, outdoor shower, hammock and patio were hits with everyone. My wife and I both had a great night’s sleep in the king bed—would stay again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this properties pool house was more than sufficient and very comfortable! Plenty of towels, comfortable bedding, kitchen dishes, ice, bath robes, etc., were provided! plenty of seating inside. Very cute and nicely decorated. It feels very homey. Our one time needing communication was promptly available and they were super nice to speak to! The pool is an awesome bonus . We spent our Friday walking downtown Greenwood shops, ate at the Crystal Grill, our Saturday in the pool, and Saturday evening with a Viking cooking class! Great location to stay as an alternative to the Alluvian hotel. My only notation is that the outside area was a tad bit unkept adjacent to the pool and was “junky” and the porch furniture was pretty dirty and could have used a blowing off. It did not affect our stay in a large way - this was our only notable negative. There are also plenty of fans set i’m up so that you may still enjoy the porch in the Southern Delta Summer! this was a huge plus! I would definitely return to this property again& recommend!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Cypressbend! It’s a beautiful oasis in the middle of the delta. Peaceful, secluded but still close enough to Greenwood for our activities. The guest house had everything we needed (even fresh flowers!) and the porch and pool were perfect.
We will be back!!"

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This is a nice cottage for a reasonable price. The owner was very nice and helpful. There was some noise from loud music from a nearby park at night but not unbearable. We would stay here again if in the area!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This bnb is so lovely and Bill is the most welcoming and helpful host. It was a breeze checking in and checking out. The lake and areas to walk are just incredible. Stay here if you’re looking for sunshine and breath.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in a handful of Air B&B’s and while we haven’t had a bad stay yet, this place was the best. If you are going to be in the area I don’t think you could find a nicer place. My wife and I can’t wait to come back, so very clean and comfortable. The heated floor in the bathroom just makes it feel like you are in luxury. Perfect for an overnight stay or a long getaway!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little cozy cottage
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely cozy house. The heated floors in the bathroom were a welcome addition given the snow storm. The kitchen is well equipped and we were able to cook dinners with everything there. Fridge is only a small bar fridge though. We found this to be a good base for a few days of birdwatching in the Mississippi Delta with some good winter birds on the property too.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay in schlater. Not to far from Greenwood and lots of good amenities.

The kitchen was fully stocked and we cooked a lovely dinner with our family. The beds and pillows were a dream! Best sleep!! Beautiful scenery, we look forward to future stays!!! Thank you so much!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To all who are thinking about booking this Airbnb, DO IT NOW! It is the absolute best. Honestly, if I could have stayed a day longer, I would have just to hang outside in the courtyard. The property is so beautifully maintained and gives such a calm experience. The cottage is perfect. It is extremely clean with all the amenities you need for your stay. It was so warm and cozy. I loved every moment of my stay.
Finally, Bill… Is the perfect host. He was quick to respond and so kind. I can’t wait to return and stay again. If this property is available during my visits, I will stay here over any other Airbnb or hotel."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this small cottage with plenty of room for 3. We were glad we arrived in the day time to find our way, just because we were unfamiliar with the area. A great relaxing weekend!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"☆☆☆☆☆ Very quaint Air BnB! My friend Melynda & I enjoyed our stay for the weekend. Very organized, spacious, and the King bed is really comfortable. 20 minute drive into Greenwood for the Viking Cooking School experience. We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay. Bill had anything and everything you could possibly need. Much more pleasant and relaxing compared to a hotel. Will visit again soon! ♡"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful stay! Such a peaceful, clean rental. Would highly recommend if in the area."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mr. Bill was amazing to communicate with throughout my visit. The weather was crappy, but the cottage is so inviting that it didn't matter to me that I was ""stuck inside."" Read the directions to find the cottage carefully because it will take you around the world on your GPS! HA. Be mindful the owner's home is very close to the cottage, but it was quiet and not intrusive in the least. The grounds were beautifully landscaped and the pool was clean! You will have everything you need such as towels, clean sheets, kitchenware, utensils, and so much more. Enjoy your stay!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend this beautiful place for a peaceful and intimate getaway. The accommodations were cozy with just about every amenity you could think of. We will definitely be repeat customers!!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Another great visit to Schlater! If you want a beautiful and relaxing home base to explore the Delta this is the spot. Bill and Jane go above and beyond to make your stay an enjoyable experience and couldn’t be friendlier. It was just the trip we needed to close out the summer.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great and attentive hosts. Romantic setting.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Place makes you want to live there!!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Go ahead and enjoy some of the wonderful restaurants in and around Greenwood. We went to Websters which was wonderful and heard lots of good things about the Crystal. The house had a wonderful kitchen and with a Walmart within 15 minutes, we were able to cook a wonderful meal in."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A beautiful place. We enjoyed our time.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Friendly, gracious hosts without being obtrusive. Good location for our day trips to Greenwood and Indianola. Nice, relaxing guest house to come back to! We also enjoyed the pool and the outside shower was convenient! Wish we could have stayed longer!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely spot for a getaway. It's secluded and quiet but still close enough to town for groceries and/or venturing out to one of the few local restaurants. The bed is amazingly comfortable, the pool is fabulous, and the outdoor shower was a fun touch. The kitchen is well-stocked with dishes and utensils, but be sure to bring whatever ingredients you need (there's a Walmart about 15 minutes away where we got our groceries)."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is quiet and comfortable in a beautiful setting. The interior was very clean, with some lovely touches. The outdoors was a lovely setting among the trees. I especially enjoyed the pool."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay and unwind a bit from the world and was not too far from town.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and Bill's Grand Rentals was just that! GRAND! I haven't another name for it. Refreshing, new upgrades, beautiful textural decor, relaxing, and tons of surprising luxuries. Grand Rentals is small but very cozy and befitting. I would call it a cross tour oasis of the city and country vibe."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I don’t even where to start! We needed a place to stay overnight because we had a long trip home with a 16 month old. Bill was beyond kind and hospitable. Truly treated my son as if he were his own grandchild. One of the best hosts, if not, THE BEST, we have encountered.
The house is as beautiful as the stories behind the property. They have thought of everything to make this space perfect. Beautiful pool and garden area, outdoor shower, quiet porch and sitting area, and the inside was welcoming and comfortable.
We would recommend this place to anyone and we would love to come back and spend more time than we were able to."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing! My family and I have stayed here twice now, definitely our first choice when we come to visit family in the area. Bill and Jane are great hosts, and keep their property so beautiful, and at night it is like a magical fairytale land! Thanks again for a great stay!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we arrived to the welcome drinks by the pool, we felt welcomed and completely at home. Southern hospitality at its best!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This lovely guesthouse is large, comfortable and equipped with everything needed for a relaxing escape. It is behind the owners, Bill and Jane's house and has it's own large porch looking out onto the pretty garden, with pool and fountain. It is fairly remote so you may want to bring your own breakfast supplies and snacks. Restaurants in Greenwood are about 25 minutes away (Giardinas was very good). We enjoyed meeting Bill and Jane who were very responsive before our stay and nearby if you need anything."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cypressbend is perfection. Our family of four enjoyed the guesthouse and learning of it’s history from the most gracious southern host. We will definitely be back.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,If you need a place to relax and unwind this is the place to be! We loved every minute of our stay and cannot wait until our return! Hosts are amazing and we could not have been happier with this AirBnB!!!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Southern hospitality is alive & well at Cypressbend! This place is so beautiful & the hosts, Bill & Jane, couldn't be more accommodating. The house was sparkling clean & had everything you'd need to enjoy your stay. My wife & I felt very welcomed by our hosts but enjoyed absolute privacy while we were there. We felt so relaxed as we lounged by the pool & read our books in the oversized hammock in front of the fountain. The house is so tastefully decorated & the bed was extremely comfortable. We slept like babies! The outdoor shower is an extremely cool & unique feature that we very much enjoyed as well. The grounds are immaculately well maintained with a garden bursting with colorful flowers & fruit trees lining the back of the property. We loved taking walks in the evening down by the cypress lined river that runs in front of the main house. There is also a fire pit that Bill provided wood & fire starter for so that we could make s'mores! Our stay there was extremely peaceful & we left there feeling very refreshed. You know it's an amazing place when you're planning your next visit on the drive home, right!?"
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing property with a great host.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a delightful weekend and really was impressed at this little garden escape. Completely away from the city and so peaceful! Everything was so nice and clean and had plenty of towels for the pool. First time swimming in a salt water pool. Not a big fan however I'm sure it has it's perks. Love how big and unusual deep it was! Would have preferred it to not have been so murky but understandable it's still early in the year for swimming. The outside shower was delightful and so enjoyable! Makes you want to stay there all day however the hot water does eventually run out. Our weekend went by way to fast! Would love to visit again! My nephew and son was so excited about their new friends they made with the wild life. Coming home from vacation with pets is an unexpected treat!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Friendly service, that truly makes you feel more like family than guests!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful oasis hidden within the Delta. We almost felt as if we had walked into a Southern Living photo shoot. The home is lovely, peaceful, and inviting. We enjoyed exploring Greenwood, Indianola, and Cleveland and then relaxing on the front porch while gazing at the fountain and pool. Plan to bring a few provisions as the nearest groceries and restaurants are in Greenwood. We would love to return to this property. Bill and Jane are exemplary hosts!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect! My husband and I were looking for a relaxing getaway, and that's exactly what we got.
This was the first time I've rented an Airbnb in which the host was on site. I had wondered how the experience might be different, and quickly realized it was in all the best possible ways! Bill greeted us and gave us a tour of the guesthouse. He's put a lot of time and thought into every detail and it shows. Speaking with him was like visiting with an old friend. His place is just as warm and inviting as he is.
A short drive to Greenwood to visit the local shops and restaurants made this location perfect. Bill gave us suggestions on places to eat and visit that were spot on.
If you're looking for a place to stay as a couple, family, or a girl's getaway you've found it! We can't wait to visit again ourselves."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great place and the hosts were wonderful!

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bill, thank you so much for sharing your beautiful home with my family. The skill and work put into the house is astounding. Last night, we were able to relax before a funeral and look out unto the beauty of Quiver River. The garden, coy fish pond, wood ready for the fireplace... all of it! Thank you for hospitality!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great relaxing spot way out in the country. Enjoyed drinking coffee on the front porch & relaxing in the hammock. Easy access to Greenwood. Also thoroughly enjoyed visiting with the host!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The area is quiet and beautiful. The host was kind, attentive, yet respectful of our privacy. The lodge is close to Greenwood and one can reasonably drive elsewhere in the Delta. My family enjoyed our time at this lodging and would return again if we’re in the area."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at this cottage for our annual girls trip. The hosts were out of town but were easily accessible and checked on us to make sure we didn’t have any problems checking in and made several dining suggestions. We ended up just staying in and eating our meals in the guest house. We only ventured out to shop for pottery. The guest house was very nice, clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. We really enjoyed the beautiful pool and sitting on the front porch under the fans. The hosts provided bug spray as mosquitos are bad this time of year. Fresh flowers from the hosts beautiful yard, comfy robes, and big beach towels were nice touches. We had a wonderful and relaxing time. We will definitely be back!"

Driving in was slightly confusing, but that’s no fault of the owners, it’s just tricky to find. The pool was so pretty and the surrounding scenery made for such a picturesque experience. We ate dinner outside and got to see some fireflies dancing around the yard as it got darker! So pretty! Check out the swing across from the house that overlooks the swamp area, it’s so peaceful and pretty. We would definitely come here again!"

Bill was a great communicator and very hospitable! We will be back!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This lovely home is hosted by some of the kindest, most gracious hosts. This was our second girls’ getaway here, and this time we decided to spend more at the home, choosing to prepare some of our meals there - easy since the kitchen is very well-equipped.

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow...walking out the front door, passing the hammock, and diving into a swimming pool--a pretty exceptional way to begin your day! Bill was the consummate host, supplying plenty of tips and local lore. At once feeling removed from the world yet lacking none of its comforts, this is the kind of place that begs more than a single night."

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A beautiful gem in the middle of nowhere. A gorgeous southern getaway!!

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is an exceptional place to stay, I couldn’t have asked for anything more during my stay. Very welcoming, extremely peaceful and phenomenal hosts!

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed in loads of AirBnBs, almost all truly good experiences. Every now and then, though, one is an oasis. This was an oasis.
Beautiful grounds. Gorgeous space. The AirBnB is a mother-in-law cottage. A beautifully-appointed mother-in-law cottage.
Four of us stayed there. My wife and I stayed in the bedroom. My daughter-in-law and her beaux stayed in the sofa bed. Everyone had a good night’s sleep, and there was plenty of space to not feel as if we were tripping over one another.
We met Bill briefly on the front end. Generations-deep Delta resident. A delightful soul.
This would be an excellent base from which to explore the Mississippi Delta. Highly recommended."

P.s. that bed slept wonderful!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Booked for some of my company’s executive team to stay at while in town for meetings. They absolutely loved it. Very comfortable & clean.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We can’t recommend the darling bungalow highly enough if you’re looking for a charming piece of Delta Blues vibe. It is quirky, rustic and laid back. Proximity to the BB King Museum and The Blue Biscuit only added to our enjoyment. The only minor disappointment was that the restaurant isn’t open during the week, the Wi-Fi wasn’t great and the pool was still closed for the season. We will definitely stay here again and look forward to being able to spend quiet time by the pool."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this air bnb. A historic shotgun cottage right by the Blue Biscuit ! The interior is kept to time period of when house was built and so cozy for two people. We walked to the bb long museum and the biscuit both nights of our stay for delicious food and great music. Everyone was friendly and Trish is an excellent host. Highly reccomend !

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This has to be one of our favorite places now. The pictures do no justice. This camp was the cleanest place we have ever stayed by far. Great appliances, comfortable furniture, plenty of room, and a stocked kitchen to list a few things we found amazing. The host is the kindest person and so responsive. We didn't want to leave. We hardly came in from fishing off the large pier that comes right out of the back door. A hidden gem to say the least. We discussed how soon to come back on the way home."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very responsive, great recommendations, hospital and just overall great host. Thank you"
,,,Do not stay here- the host will accuse you of eating her food. She yelled at me on the phone that I ate her ribeye steaks which is impossible as I don't eat beef. We brought our own food but mostly ate at our family reunion. Look out of a crazy host.
