2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect weekend getaway spot. Just big enough for me and my wife, but not extra large.
A quick hike up the hill reveals a fantastic sunset, but it is also breathtaking from the fire pit.
The only thing I I would have wanted different is if there were more shades on the windows. Especially the widows showing the master bedroom, the were small windows and the weren’t easily visible from outside, but I would have liked a touch more privacy."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute & quite retreat for a quick family getaway. Outside area was great and the two trails were fun. Everything you need when away from home with out the responsibilities of home. The Hitchcock
Nature Center was our favorite place to hike near the grain bin. Would stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I reserved this beautiful Silo for my daughter and son-in-law's anniversary. It was a surprise and they had no idea where they were going (the Loess Hills) or where they were staying (The Silo). They loved every bit of it! The location was amazing and peaceful. They were able to walk the property, sit under a beautiful night sky full of stars, enjoy a bonfire and the twinkle lights. For them it was perfect! Christy made it so easy and welcoming, even leaving them a bottle of champagne for thier anniversary celebration! Every detail of the place was perfect and it was an experience. They have not stopped talking about it since they got home. They loved it!
On my end, as the coordinator of this anniversary trip, I can say that Christy is probably the best communicator I have ever encountered in my time getting vacation rentals. Not only in relaying needed information at the outset but even answering questions promptly, in some cases in real time! Amazing stay, amazing hosts!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a very comfortable home, I would like to come back again, it is recommended and the host very attentive"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the Grain Bin Getaway for our mother/daughter weekend! Everything was perfect!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I spent two nights at the bin. Having grown up on a farm, it was the nicest grain bin I’ve ever been in! 😄
Very well-decorated, extremely clean, and easy to find. Really unique lighting, too. The staircase was steep and spiral but easy to manage. No worries there.
We enjoyed the hiking trails behind the bin that wound their way up into the Loess Hills. Quite the view from up there!
We took a short and easy trip to Omaha to the Boiler Room for dinner. We enjoyed hiking the trails at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge just down the road and had a nice visit at the nearby Loess Hills Lavender Farm, too.
All and all, it was a great stay and a perfect place to relax and enjoy the great outdoors while having all the comforts of home!
The host is great to work with…responsive to any questions you may have!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had wonderful stay for a 2-night girlfriends trip. The space is unique, and well appointed. Enjoyed the firepit and the abundance of stars at night. Walked up both paths on the property to see the beautiful views! The location is convenient to many natural areas including Desoto Wildlife area for birding and Loess Forest for hiking. (Preparation Canyon was a truly beautiful walk!!!) We highly recommend you stay at this wonderful home!!!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very unique place and property. Place was clean and could tell it was well taken care of.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little getaway! I spent the first two nights solo as there is some of the state’s best hiking nearby and the location has a great centralized spot for the hikes. My family joined on the third day and fell in love with the place. You can tell there was a lot of pride with this renovation and no corners were cut. The place is in great shape, has many amenities, appliances, and a beautiful view. We hope to visit again!
TIP: if you are able to make it to either of the two lookout spots on the hills (short little hikes), absolutely take advantage of it and catch a sunset. The view is stunning!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was the perfect get away for us to spend some time with our kids. The weather wasn’t the best so spent a lot of time indoors in this cozy grain bin! Has all the amenities you could ever need during our stay. We adventured around to some of the small town restaurants and hiking in the Loess Hills which also kept us busy. There’s also 20 acres of hiking to 2 look-out points right on the property! Would highly recommend for anyone wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle of city living! Beautiful property.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little location tucked in the Loess Hills, near some beautiful parks and a scenic bypass. Many things to do no matter the weather!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best staycation at this cute, clean, and cozy unique property. It’s quaint, beautiful, peaceful and fun. Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was looking for something other than a hotel for an anniversary get away. This place was perfect. It was so nice and clean and the location allowed for a lot of things to do. I would love to come back when the weather was better so we could enjoy the outside space.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay regarding place and surroundings. Coffee maker is super slow and it would be nice to have more mirrors in bedrooms/living room to free up the bathroom😉! Those are just small things. It was amazing!!!! Great host! We will
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful getaway and a beautifully done space
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! Exceeds expectations! If it was available for one night I would go back often. Amazing stars when the sky’s finally cleared ! So enjoyed this amazing space.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I brought a group of friends for the weekend to stay at the bin. Very clean with everything we needed. The stay exceeded our expectations.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a one-of-a-kind getaway with beautiful surroundings and a creatively renovated grain bin. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Definitely make sure you are able to manage steep steps. If you are planning to sleep in, you need to know that there are no window coverings (except in the bathroom). You will know when the sun comes up. Although there are no window coverings, the grain bin mostly faces the hills where no one can see in."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super unique experience plus so comfortable and clean!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easily 5 stars!
One of the cleanest AirBNB properties we’ve stayed in. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom and kitchen amenities were just perfect.
We didn’t have any issues whatsoever, but when I did contact the host, they were very responsive.
We stayed in November and still made use of the bonfire pit for dinner and s’mores. The sky, the stars, the ambiance was so relaxing.
Our family enjoys hiking - and the Loess Hills in Iowa is a perfect destination. We enjoyed the hiking trails right on the property,
Including catching a sunset from an overlook. We also drove north to the state forest and hiked! The binder on-site has super helpful information for local hikes.
This AirBNB property is just as described! You’ll enjoy the unique setting and retreat-like getaway. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I came for a quick getaway, and we both enjoyed the peaceful and scenic location. We would definitely recommend staying here."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would definitely come back again and recommend to others
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This grain bin was seriously incredible! It was my first time staying in one, and I was blown away by the attention to detail, peaceful location, and surroundings, and the cleverness of the design! Brent and Christy have done a wonderful job designing it! You can see the intricacies and effort that they put in to designing and building it! The trails and overlooks we’re both awesome, and my favorite was the LED lights in the ceiling!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the Grain Bin! We traveled to go to the Omaha Zoo, which was only a 30 minute drive. It was lovely to stay in a private area and walk around the property. The sunsets from atop the hill were breathtaking. Although it was close to the road, you couldn't hear anything from inside. I would recommend bringing an eye mask if you are sensitive to morning light, but was a beautiful place to wake up in! It was so clean and had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! So much to do within driving distance. Beautiful place!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Grain Bin was exactly as described. Very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed sitting on the porch watching the combines harvesting the fields across the street. My wife is a little leery of heights so the stairs were a little intimidating but she got used to it in no time. All in all this was a very peaceful and relaxing stay. We would definitely stay here again if we are back in the area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Booked a stay at the grain bins for my parents anniversary! I was getting photos almost every hour of the gorgeous place. Fireplace was perfect during the fall weather. Beautiful place to stay! Christy was very friendly and quick to respond to any questions and gave very clear helpful instructions for the stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as we expected. Very quiet get away.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home for a quiet get away, loved having a campfire, and all the accommodations. Will stay again and highly recommend to others."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent accommodation and very comfortable, it really is extraordinary... I hope to return soon"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Would highly recommend. Unique experience! Great host
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is our second trip and it will be a tradition yearly for us! Our 7 year old truly thinks the grain bin is better than Disneyland. Unfortunately both visits the weather was 100 plus degrees but the bin was air conditioned perfectly and zero issues! We had so much fun ! We are thinking about a December family getaway!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for our little vacation getaway with the two of us and our 19 month old. My husband has scooped out a lot of grain bins in his day and this was pretty cool to say that we’ve stayed in a legit grain bin house! It was very thought out and modern. We loved the windows and how they kept it a circle shape on the inside! One thing I will say is that the steps are very unique, hard to get used to and very custom-made (which is awesome), but difficult to trust your child going up and down them. The other thing I would say is that there are no shades on any windows, so if you have a child, bring a shade of some sort. Otherwise, they will be up when it’s light out."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful space and location. Well worth the drive!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful, relaxing time!
I had always envisioned fixing up a silo and this way exceeded my dreams of my silo repairs."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful getaway for our 25th Anniversary.Scenery was beautiful. The Grain Bin was amazing from top to bottom.We definately will be back again.Loved it!!!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Christy’s place for a girls weekend getaway and it was absolutely perfect! The place is adorable and looks exactly like the pictures!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Grain Bin was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We experienced amazing sunsets with little bunnies hopping around to drinking coffee while watching a storm roll in over the fields that sit in front of the bin. Christy had great communication and clear expectations for check out. We’ll definitely be back.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place to get away and decompress. Peaceful and quiet with beautiful sunsets!!! The place was immaculate!!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and unique place to stay for a getaway. Enjoyed hiking at Loess Hills Hitchcock Nature Center, Murray Hill and Preparation Canyon. Relaxed by the fire pit and watched gorgeous sunsets."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place for my family when we visit my grandmother. Very clean, easy to get into, and beautiful location. Would definitely rent again when we come back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a beautiful and unique stay. The home is immaculate. My wife loved it. My daughter loved being on a farm with so much open land. The sunsets we saw were beautiful. We traveld to Omaha for the College World Series and this was very driveable to commute back and forth to Omaha. This was perfect stay for everyone in the family and the hosts are awesome. Can't say enough about this place. If you are considering it, book it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED staying at the grain bin. We came down for a family wedding in Woodbine. The drive back and forth there for the few days we stayed was absolutely beautiful especially for Iowa! 🤪 The grain bin was so gorgeous, clean, and comfortable. My husband and 2 kids loved it as well. We hiked up to the lookout with another family of 4 who was also in town for the wedding. Such a fun and unique stay. Highly recommend if you are looking for a rental in this area! We were not crazy about the eateries in the small town but the kitchen is well equipped so we made a meal for dinner our last night there. The aquatic center in town made for a fun time but the water slide is super slow (also they only take cash so be prepared). Surprised to see that in the town!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the Grain Bin. It is very clean, comfortable, and so cool! The finishes are excellent! Nice job! Great stay!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property and house are spectacular hidden gems.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here during our wedding wknd and we loved it! We’re going to come back and stay again when we can enjoy being at the Airbnb a little more. So cute & peaceful. I’m even using the bathroom for my inspiration for our home bathroom lol!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christy, The place was awesome and will be using it in the future."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We booked the silo home for a weekend getaway for the family. Christy was proactive to giving me check in/out instructions which I appreciated. Taking little kids up and down the spiral staircase was a little daunting but doable. We loved the hiking and views available on the property. Feels far removed from everything but has local amenities for anything you need/forgot only 5 minutes away.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a stunning place this was. The inside pictures don't do it justice. Every little detail was perfect and I would definitely stay here again!! Cheers

Check in was easy, communication was prompt, and every amenity you could need was provided. We highly recommend this unique getaway!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really cute place to stay! Has literally everything a normal size house would with really nice modern touches! Only issue we had was the message sent out about the lock box was not correct. It said we needed to open the lock box get the key and then open the door but the door had a key pad on it.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very unique property. perfect for weekend get away. well stocked and clean home. would highly recommend.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We've driven past this property many times while heading to a local campground and I can tell you without a doubt the property is just as beautiful in person as it is in photographs. Unfortunately due to a medical emergency with one of our group members, we were unable to stay this time. Christy was excellent with communication and answered any questions we had. The whole group is pretty bummed out we couldn't stay this time, but will hopefully we will be re-booking in the future."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,All around great. Will definitely visit again
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Grain Silo was a very serene getaway, perfect for a romantic trip or just needed a break from daily activities. Very well designed, with lots of wonderful details and all the amenities you need to truly feel at home. We took advantage of the hiking trails on the property. Don’t forget to take your camera and take advantage of the clear skies and beautiful sunsets. I highly recommend this hidden gem just outside of Omaha!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Grain Bin Getaway is perfect! So unique and cozy. The simplicity of the place was so peaceful. I would definitely recommend it anyone!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and unwind. Loved the unique house and surrounding land. We will definitely be looking to stay there again next time we visit the area. Only note for future visitors is to be careful in the shower, it has a tub bottom that’s extremely slippery with nothing to hold on to."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at this property. It is a beautiful, peaceful getaway spot. Christy is a great host and we hope to be back again soon."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great tiny home. LOVED it. Appreciated the experience the most. Loved the location so that we could hike all over the area. The place was so fun and well kept - we are SO glad we came. We got used to the spiral staircase and went up and down carefully with ease at age 68.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Charming! This home is so unique, but you almost forget that you're staying in a grain bin. Great design elements, and very cozy. Loved the personal touches. Beds are VERY comfy. Bathroom is large with a huge countertop. Only 30 miles from downtown Omaha. Our family drove 40 min to Bellevue for an unbelievable TreeRush experience at Fontanelle Forest. The sunsets from the Grain Bin were exceptional! Loved the trails we could enjoy right outside the home. Will definitely be back."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend this Airbnb! A favorite fit many reasons! Cleanliness #1 and everything you need! Cozy like no other!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were unfortunately unable to stay as we had family hospitalized during our reservation. Christy was very responsive and offered suggestions to try and help us out. We unfortunately did not get insurance to cover our cancellation and we were not able to cancel until after we should have been checked in. Christy was very kind and offered a discount if we choose to stay in the future. Will definitely try to stay there in the future. Thanks Christy!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Grain Bin was truly a unique and wonderful property. Quiet, private, comfortable, and perfect for romantic getaway. All the amenities you could possibly need. The trails on the private acreage were a pleasant surprise. We’ll definitely be back."

It was very easy and convenient. I’d love to come back with a few girlfriends for a girls weekend in the future. Thank you Christy!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Grain Bin is an absolute delight to stay in! We had an amazing time! We wanted to relax and recharge-and this was the perfect spot! Good short hikes, fire pits, quaint town, and a perfect place to cook, watch movies and un-wind."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The bin was perfect for my girlfriend and I to spend a couple days at away from responsibilities, quiet, extremely clean, craftsmanship was out of this world inside and out. 10/10"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This little place was amazing! My boyfriend and I had an amazing time! We went for the weekend and were stuck indoors due to the crazy wind! Saturday we spent the WHOLE day outside play games and grilling (weather was perfect). This place was exactly what we needed! A perfect weekend getaway!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A quiet and comfortable getaway, much bigger than expected but cozy! Loved that everything we needed was there!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Grain Bin Get-a-Way is in a very private and beautiful nature setting. We loved the spacious layout and design of this unique home. We enjoyed hiking the trails and the beautiful sunset. It was such a relaxing and enjoyable stay. We highly recommend this wonderful place!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This is an incredible spot to rest! Amazingly clean! Full kitchen, comfy bed, huge bathroom with a delightful heated floor! Everything is brand new! And you can go hiking on the property. It’s only a few minutes to a grocery store, and 30 minutes from Omaha. It was our anniversary and there was a bottle of bubbly waiting for us when we arrived!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful! It was incredibly clean when we arrived. Cristy does a fantastic job of telling you what to expect before, during and after your stay. The grain bin and location are beautiful. The hosts thought of everything when designing it. Lots to do nearby if you enjoy hiking and site seeing."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was easy to find and well taken care of. Host was easy to work with.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Worth a special trip to Missouri Valley!
Made a weekend getaway with the girls. Everything advertised and more. The place was immaculate when we arrived. The decor is perfect.
And there are special touches throughout - a sign greeting us when we arrived, heated floors in the bathroom, the best smelling hand soap (Mrs. Meyers lavender).
The hosts were great and we can’t wait to stay there again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful sunsets and a unique experience. The grain bin was clean and very well decorated. It was a wonderful start!!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved our stay!! It was in the country, for sure, but close enough to Omaha that we could have taken the quick drive down for a day/night out, but once we arrived, we didn't want to leave! The bin is so cozy and beautiful, we just wanted to soak it in. It was a wonderful two days of relaxation! I booked this as a Christmas present for my husband, but didn't tell him where were going. He was so surprised when we got there and kept saying several times during our stay, ""This place is really pretty cool!"" We'd love to come back sometime. Highly recommended if you want something private, peaceful and a little off the beaten path!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You won’t regret staying here! It went above and beyond my expectations! Very clean and cozy.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"One of a kind experience right in the Loess Hills! Close to town but far enough away for perfect star gazing. Walking trails into the hills, fire pits, a full kitchen, and plenty of hot water made for an exciting and cozy stay. The custom wood work, heated bathroom floor, and ceiling design were all extra points that really made this a unique experience. Also, Omaha is very close!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s was an amazing weekend away to get some wedding planning done with my girls 😍
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent getaway location! Perfect for a relaxing trip.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This off the beaten path, but so close to big city comforts AirBnb will fulfill the ""unique"" and ""quirky"" bucket list item for any traveler.
Close enough to Omaha to enjoy the activities there, but far enough away to truly allow for peace and quiet. It's an accommodation that gives the best of both worlds. Inside is an oasis of comfort and style and outside will put a smile on anyone's face. Every comfort of home and high-end amenities that feel like a luxury hotel. Can't say enough good things and will highly suggest to friends and family who come into town.
Great for a local single or couple looking to getaway from the big city lights, College World Series goers, and those just passing through wanting something special to remember."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. It's exactly as described in the photos and notes. We stayed 4 days here. Its in a peaceful location with beautiful views out front and tu ked in just under the Loess Hills. We hiked up all three evenings to watch the sunset and it was totally worth it. We used on of the 3 firepits and there were zero issues. The kitchen was well stocked and the living room/bedroom loft were comfortable. Best part of the house...the heated floors in the bathroom. Overall a perfect getaway and I'd happily stay there again!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,m
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely unique stay! we enjoyed every second of it. The place was very clean & inviting, Christy definitely thought of those small details that make a stay extra special. Also, the trails around the property make for a good sunset view! We will definitely be back."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place exceeded my expectations. I've stayed at many places over the years and this has to be one of the nicest- impeccably clean, modern and comfortable. It had all you could ask for, from comfortable luxe bedding to every kitchen gadget you might need. All within the backdrop of a beautiful 20 acre property with excellent hiking and gorgeous views. I have no complaints about this place."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the perfect place for a little get away. They thought of everything and made it so accommodateable. Very comfortable stay. My kiddos didnt want to leave. Such a unique place.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christy's place is both unique and beautiful. It is well decorated and designed and just right for a quiet getaway. Situated at the base of the loess hills it was just far enough away from Omaha to be a nice escape yet close enough to not have to deal with long distance travel. The house had everything needed, was quiet safe and had beautiful views in the morning and evening, as well as plenty of land to hike and explore. We look forward to coming back again thanks!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and very tranquil.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at their grain bin was amazing! We would recommend it. It was clean and comfortable. We hope to come back some day!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic place to get away and relax. Very clean, comfortable, unique, and accommodating. Far enough away to feel like a get away, but still close enough to amenities."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay for a little get away. Beautiful inside and very clean. The pictures are very accurate. Loved the propane fire pit. Stairs are very steep but that is noted in the hosts description of the place so it wasn’t a surprise, just something you should note. Loved it!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tranquility. So peaceful out in the hills. Incredible experience. 14/10 would recommend.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property, great for a weekend getaway to explore the Loess Hills or to just relax. We hiked one of the trails on the property and the view from the bluff was stunning. The sunset views from the patio are incredible. We got a fire going and watching the sunset was a great way to unwind after a long day."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, such a cute place! Would definitely recommend."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Grain Bin getaway is a wonderfully clean quiet oasis in the middle of farm country.
It is close to many fun things to do. It was a relaxing time for us under the stars. We would recommend this to anyone. Christy and Brent take great pride in ownership and it shows. Their communication was awesome, and everything was just perfect!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this grain bin getaway, it was a unique place to stay and we made great memories! There is so much to do around the property and it is a quick drive to Omaha! Brent and Christy were great to work with. They made our stay very special by leaving us with sparkling wine and a welcome sign for our honeymoon. We loved our stay here and would recommend it to everyone!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome location. Great hiking and beautiful country. It was a wonderful experience for our family!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to get away from home in, awesome sunsets, and trails to hike to get better views. Have everything there you could imagine in the kitchen to cook with. Also a nice grill outside to use and several fire pits to enjoy your night watching the sunset. Communication with them was great, if you have any questions they will get right back to you."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved almost everything about the Bin. Definitely not a child friendly environment. Stairs were a little scary to walk up and down after having a couple drinks. The accommodations were great, they really thought of everything. View and outside area were beautiful."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very romantic spot for you and your loved one. Ambiance is beautiful inside and out. My first time staying in a grain bin and it was designed perfectly! Home is clean and very inviting. Enjoyed my stay with hubby over the 4th of July weekend. A great getaway from the city and just enjoy a more quiet moment.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,A great place to stay with a great patio and great view.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an incredible stay! This was a perfect getaway for our anniversary. The amenities were great and we had plenty to do during our stay.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The views were beautiful to wake up to. The walking trails were well maintained and peaceful. You can easily walk to the Platte River with some lovely sitting spots to soak in the view. The space was smaller than we anticipated, think tiny home style, but great use of space to still feel comfortable and cozy not crowded. Would recommend for a great peaceful get away to relax. There is very limited cell reception so keep this in mind."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time! Just wish the weather was better.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was very nice. Unfortunately, I had to leave early and didn't get a chance to enjoy the private fire pit, the walking paths around the property or the private pond with the sand beach. Maybe next time."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful get away.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,A perfect little getaway. privacy but a bunch of activities available.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was very cute. It is part of a retreat center, so there are several other amenities, such as conference rooms, a shared kitchen, and lots of outdoor space. There is no wifi (which is mentioned in the listing) and the service is spotty, so it is a great place to disconnect and enjoy some time in nature. Hosts are responsive, and live on the property so they are nearby if there are any issues."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place, for vacation in the local area. Cozy, and relaxing! No issues the entire 3 night stay"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I stayed at Bob’s place for the Christmas holiday. This house is perfect for entertaining. Our holidays were so comfy and everyone loved the decor. It’s a super fun spot close to everything in Wahoo.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the location as it was walking distance to shopping and family home.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Maybe one of the more unique places weve stayed at. As advertised with a great and respinsive host. Loved it!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed here twice visiting family in town. Bob is very accommodating and his place is exactly what we need! Kitchen is well stocked and beds are comfortable!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Irish Pug was everything as advertised and more! Bob is very welcoming and the Pub is just a fun space which well decorated and entertaining! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at the Pub for the CWS to watch the tigers win and couldn’t have been more pleased with the experience! Bob’s place was perfect for our trip. It was a bit of a drive from the stadium which wasn’t a problem because Bob helped us find a driver to bring us there. Bob greeted us after we confirmed our arrival and was most pleasant. We would stay here 100 times over. This unique home enhanced our first experience in Nebraska. Thank you Bob!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place is definitely a bar atmosphere, so if you are looking for that, it is great. Though the atmosphere would probably not be one that our family would choose if there were other options just because of our personal preferences, it was a good place for us to stay for a few days while being in Wahoo. It definitely beats the hotel in Wahoo! The beds were very comfortable, the air worked well and the house was nice and cool at night, and the shower was great. We loved being able to sit on the porch and watch the fireflies and our kids really enjoyed the tire swing in the front yard. Bob lives next door and met us outside when we arrived to tell us about the place. We will likely stay again the next time we are in Wahoo."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great host and place to stay!
2023-05-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Great place to entertain old friends around a genuine bar environment..however, unless all you plan on eating is your alcohol, youd better bring your own pots/pans/baking sheet/utensils/ silverware/ etc. Cause there wasnt any. We showed up as a family any couldnt cook anything. Also, big surprise, owners live right next door and spend entire evening out on porch which would be fine if there were curtains on any of the windows for privacy but there aren't any. Some of the blinds are tied up in such a way so they wont go down anymore. Place was clean for the most part and looked just like ad, but expect owners stuff to still be in fridge/ freezer and in various places, kinda like owner has his family living there until you show up. Also important to know, if your service animal leaves any hair behind youll be charged additional cleaning.
Otherwise our stay was truly unique and a great experience, my son pretended to be a bar tender for 4 days. Lots of root beer was consumed."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice. Enjoyed our stay
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a really fun place to stay. It looks just like the pictures. You can tell they put a lot of care and effort into making this stay an experience.

The bedrooms are very comfortable and we took advantage of them as well.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place that captured a big piece of the community. The uniqueness of a pub setting mixed with a homelike living area, is one of a kind. Will definitely stay there again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is super clean and well maintained. Lots of amenities to enjoy including an ice maker and super comfy beds. The decorations alone make this place worth the visit, but Bob is a great host and I couldn't be happier with my decision to stay here. Thank you for hosting Bob!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to stay. Love all the details that Bob has placed in the pub. Everything was top notch. He is working on a new part of the pub that will add even more ambiance to the already fantastic surroundings. If you are not wanting to be in the city but close by this is the spot to be. Great location. Will definitely be back if in the area.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying in this unique and home! It’s spacious and has a ton of personality! Thank you, Bob!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a cool one of a kind experience. The Irish pub atmosphere was incredible, a great place to watch a football game, hang out with family and friends, or just relax. The inn had all the amenities that we needed and the decor was fabulous! We could tell that the owners spent the extra time on the little details that gave it so much character. There is a great walking/biking trail one block from the house that takes you to Lake Wanahoo. Wahoo is a quaint little town, with some of the nicest people we've ever met. We had a great breakfast at the Branding Iron Cafe and stopped at the Wahoo Bakery and had the best kolaches that we've ever had. Thanks for a great weekend! JNoon"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Perfect launching point for a Husker game
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bernardo’s place was exactly as expected!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for my brother's wedding and Bernardo's place was very close to the venue. We spent most of the trip running all around Omaha, but having a home base that was clean and relaxing was great. Highly recommend this AirBNB to individuals, couples, or small families that need to be in West Omaha."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Although we were able to spend only one night, we enjoyed our time at Bernardo's place. The basement apartment was roomy, clean and well-equipped, and the bed was comfortable and conducive to good sleep. There even was a curved pillow similar to what I use at home to avoid neck pain. The host provided good instructions with the information we needed. The location was excellent in that it was near my husband's Elkhorn office and close enough for him to walk there. While some people might not choose to stay there because the route to the entry at the back of the house involves walking through grass, we had no problem with that and would definitely return."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The neighborhood was really nice and it was an easy stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing host!! Very responsive, friendly, and super comfortable space! Will definitely book here again if I’m ever back in Nebraska! :)"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This space was perfect for our family to visit our kids in college. Everything was just like being at home and so we were able to make it feel like home for the kids since they’re so far from Texas.
Very thoughtful, not lacking a single thing. Unlike any other air bnb we’ve stayed in before. Cathy’s place is above and beyond and we will be staying here every chance we get to come visit."

2024-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Cathy was wonderful and communicated clearly, but because of the people renting the downstairs unit, we didn’t feel safe there with our daughters. In the middle of Saturday night, the renter was pounding on our door because he couldn’t get inside of his. My daughter foolishly got out of bed and opened the door to a very drunk male and told him we weren’t the owners. He went away, but within an hour, we were awakened to knocking on both our front door and the back one near the garage as well as ringing of the doorbell. We explain that we didn’t know “Matt” and couldn’t help them. This didn’t stop for almost 30 minutes, so finally I went into the garage to the back door they were pounding on, and found out that Matt had called them for a ride. I didn’t even realize that I had walked right past a passed out Matt on the garage floor, since I was in my pajamas and hadn’t turned the light on. We didn’t go back to sleep and left early the next morning. Scary experience!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was wonderful to stay in and had everything you could ever need and then some. Beautiful and quiet place.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent stay, we came in a blizzard literally, they shoveled before our arrival, very kind of them. House is spacious, do not feel cramped at all, has literally everything one could need or if you forgot something. Beds are good, were buried in snow and crazy cold outside but looks like a cool screened in porch! Quiet neighborhood, no worries on safety. Good place to stay, easy to communicate with all good!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family had a wonderful experience at Cathy‘s home. The bedding and towels were particularly cozy and fully stocked. I had four little kids with us, including one baby and Cathy had extra blankets and a pack and play which made our stay that much easier. I particularly appreciated how clean the home was. That’s always a game changer for me, especially when I have a baby crawling on the floor! The second half bath was larger which made getting ready for our event easier. Communication was seamless. Would definitely rent from Cathy again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife was delighted by the decor and was finding all kinds of little things that charmed her. She said it hit the essentials: cute, quiet and comfortable.
Super firm beds, snacks, games and mid-century themed even down to the LP on a turntable. A wonderful place to spend our holidays."

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house is very cozy, the beds are comfortable, and the kitchen had everything we needed. The private backyard and screened porch are great for relaxing. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. We had some trouble opening the front door. It is an older house, so you have to really push on the door to get it to open. If you are bringing your pet, ensure that you specify that very clearly when communicating with the host, and there is a pet cleaning fee."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"this little gem of a place was perfect for our family of four's visit to my husband's hometown for a reunion and birthday. we were able to spread out between the two generously sized bedrooms, 1.5 baths, spacious kitchen and living area, and back yard. everything was clean and well appointed - super comfy king beds, quality linens, stocked kitchen with plenty of cooking gear, oils and spices, and laundry facilities. the kids were thrilled to be able to watch cartoons on the big screen tvs and slept soundly in this quiet neighborhood. we used the beach towels on trips to Ronin Pool and Fremont Splash Station - highlights of the trip for kids and adults alike (the many lifeguards meant we parents could actually relax!). the kitsch game was strong and i desperately want that '50s snowflake-pattern formica on all my surfaces now."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was such a delightful home .. inside & out !
The mid century modern theme of the style of the house , & its furnishings.
Quiet backyard… lively screened in porch .

I’m from Fremont , but visiting … I invited friends over to show them how great your Airbnb was .. they will spread the word !!
A great addition for Fremont .
Thank you both !!!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect quiet, cozy and comfortable place to stay. Had everything a person needs! Super nice host!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay felt like a home away from home. Cathy provides lots of amenities in case you forgot something. My stay at her basement apartment was so much nicer than a hotel. I will definitely be staying again soon, and frequently!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We loved our stay here. Cathy was super helpful and responsive to make our stay perfect. The basement was completely spot free, the WIFI was fast, the kitchen well stocked. No cost on site laundry amenities is always a plus. We will stay here again if we are back in Fremont!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Out crew loved it.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,There was everything we needed for a great weekend stay! I would recommend staying here if in the area!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for a family event in Wahoo. The place was great and easy to find. Everything was neat, clean, and it had plenty of supplies. There was only one tv in the living room to watch, but we weren't there very much any way."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The little cottage was very homey and cozy. We felt right at home in the quiet neighborhood in the little town of Wahoo. We enjoyed leisurely mornings and quaint small town life during the day. We also ventured into Omaha for some shopping and thai food in the evenings. We had a great time!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I were in town for my father’s birthday celebration and enjoyed a wonderful stay at this peaceful cottage. The house was close to good restaurants, a grocery store, and just a quick drive to Lake Wanahoo where we spent the majority of our time. We definitely recommend and wouldn’t hesitate to stay again. Thanks for the great hospitality!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,AMAZING place. Having 60 days a year vacation time I stay at a lot of air bnbs. This was by far the best. Amazing host and house felt like I was at home. Highly highly recommend!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely spot to stay. We will definitely be back to visit
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was wonderful! Best place I’ve found in Wahoo. So thankful we had this while we spent the week in Wahoo after the death of my brother in law. It was a clean, comfortable place to be and felt as close to home as it possibly could without actually being at home. It was in a quiet neighborhood and we were able to get good rest. It was kid-friendly and had plenty of space for the kids to play. We weren’t comfortable putting our kids in the basement by themselves since they are young, but we found plenty of soft blankets so they could camp out in the living room. The kids also thought the basket of treats was the greatest. Laura was helpful and quick to respond. This will definitely be where we stay in the future when we go to Wahoo to visit family and I would highly recommend it to anyone needing a place while they are there."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was centrally located, with easy access to the local life. It was just as described and very clean. Laura the host was very accommodating making it very comfortable and homey for us."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a charming little place which was very clean. All the little extra's that were left were very thoughtful. A basket of snacks, coffee and fresh eggs in the frig. We will definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The host was very accommodating, even when we needed to change dates for our stay. the house was immaculately clean when we arrived,amd although we only stayed one night, we couldn't be happier with out stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great stay! The house was exactly as described and was just like being at home!
The location was also very convenient and we had a great view with friendly neighbors.
Thank you for the amazing hospitality!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were comfortable staying for couple of days feeling like our home. The host was very friendly and always respond whenever you need something.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great home for our family of four! Clean, welcoming, and same price as a hotel room."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place to stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Eating establishment within walking distance. Clean, quiet and comfortable. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property! Highly recommend!!! Neighborhood was nice and quiet, very peaceful stay"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was beautiful! The host was very friendly and responsive. The place was very clean and it was such a peaceful place to stay! The pool was kept very clean as well which was super nice to go for a swim! Definitely will book with Maria again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home! My family and friends had a great time. It's just what we needed. The home is very private and secluded amongst the trees. The pictures do not do this place justice. It's gorgeous and highly recommended.
Brian was very responsive and respectful. He cares about his home and wants it to be treated with care."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is beautiful and we could not have asked for a better stay!! This place is incredible!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,This was my second time staying at this location! Still a wonderful spot!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is better than the pictures portrayed. It was clean, warm comfortable and great for our family get together of 5 adults and 2 children. The amenities were on point, loved the assortment of coffees. Brian you were a wonderful host. Thank you"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is an amazing property. One of the coolest we've ever stayed at. We had a group of 4 adults and 2 kids. Plenty of space to sleep, but unless the weather is nice there is a limited space on the common areas for a larger group (mainly for dining). However there's also a TON of outdoor space that can be used to spread out (patio with 2 tables, another table on the ground level, on the rooftop by the hot tub). We didn't use the bar area much, but that can serve as separate living quarters for a larger group which has its own entrance and full bath. The pictures do a great job of representing what it's like, but it's better in person. 10/10 stars. Thanks Brian!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I recently enjoyed a wonderful weekend retreat at Harmony House. The impeccable cleanliness and prompt responses from the host contributed to a seamless experience, even accommodating an early check-in. The master suite and terrace level nestled among the trees were the standout features, especially for stargazing enthusiasts. The walk-in wet room was a nice touch, and the tub offered a truly relaxing experience with excellent water pressure and hot water. I highly recommend this home to others!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely incredible place, perfect getaway to unwind and relaxed. we can't wait to come back!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,This place is very impressive! Nicely put together. Awesome amenities! Brian is a great host and has great communication. I definitely recommend this experience!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Brian's place is so unique and was fun gathering space for my family. He was very responsive when I had questions. It was a great weekend!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed staying in the very unique and well maintained home. The setup was great for being together and the wooded area is very peaceful. The beds were very comfortable and we appreciated the responsiveness of Brian.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay here! Beautiful house and amazing attention to detail.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A really unique stay in a great location. Beautiful home, peaceful outdoor area, and dog friendly!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, tranquil modern oasis. We had a wonderful stay at this container house! The detail and design of this home was outstanding, especially the kitchen, stairway and master bedroom space. Surrounded in trees but close to town. The multilevel deck space was unique and spacious. Didn’t get the chance to utilize the additional lounge space but what a cool bonus space! WiFi is a little tricky but nothing to complain about as it is a steel structure. The details put into this home was purposeful and on point. Had plenty of kitchen utensils but would recommend a few more blankets for the ladies. Definitely a work of art and would stay here again. Thank you for a great weekend with friends."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous peaceful modern place to stay! The host was very helpful and immediately available when we got ourselves locked out. The host was very kind and went above and beyond to accommodate us after we missed some pieces during our initial booking. This place is a complete 10/10. The house is very well laid out for all to be together, but also provided privacy for everyone as well.
We loved sitting on the top deck watching the stars by the fire making family memories. We shared so many giggles here and highly recommend anyone curious about this place to book. We only left once to visit the De Soto nature refuge ( check it out) otherwise this location has enough to keep your family occupied day and night!
Peaceful lovely stay."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Brian’s place surpasses the pictures!! Very clean, top notch appliances, great amenities, and beautifully decorated! I would recommend this for any group looking for a nice getaway in a very memorable Airbnb like this!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brian was the most communicative, kind and helpful Airbnb host I’ve ever experienced. And this house is absolutely gorgeous, more impressive than the photos. I booked the container house for a laborious film shoot and Brian was more than amenable, which helped considerably. I highly recommend this spot for any event you may want to throw, or simply for a getaway."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brian's place was a wonderful! We had weekend stay to relax and spend time with friends and the property accommodated just that. We were able to enjoy the outdoor spaces and the bedrooms were cozy with a wonderful kitchen that had everything we needed for making meals. A lovely experience and could not recommend it more! Hope to be back.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Beautiful design.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Harmony House for 4 nights in August 2023 and really did not want to leave.  We returned to really nice homes in the suburbs of Houston and suddenly they felt inadequate.  This amazing house is so creative, so filled with light and surrounded by a forest of green, and so full of places to hangout that is truly one-of a-kind.  We took more photographs of the house this trip than of our ourselves and each day we felt privileged that the creative genius who designed and built this house let us stay in it for a few days.  We travel from Wyoming to Vermont to the Blue Hill Mountains and we have never seen or experienced a house like this.  The owner was very attentive and for a couple wanting to get away for a few days, this amazing place is perfect."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was stunning! It was everything we hoped for and more! We wanted something off the beaten path, yet close enough to restaurants. During our stay, we felt like we were back in Costa Rica in the the rain forest, yet we were just outside of Ft Calhoun! The house itself was a piece of art!! It has inspired us to look more into container homes. We will definitely be talking about this house with our friends and family!! Put it on your list!! I can’t say enough positive things about it!! LOL :-)"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,If you are looking for a TV show like build in the midwest this is your place. The property is very fun. Enjoy the non-conventional construction.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"My sister, two cousins, and I stayed at Harmony House this weekend, and we loved it. It's even better than the photos. The space and decor is beautiful; the grounds are gorgeous. Brian (or someone) obviously put a lot of thought into the design and decor. There are so many places to hang out outside, but we were perfectly content just being on the main deck (and I spent a little time in the hammock), surrounded by nature. Everything about the booking and stay was straightforward and easy. Brian was a suburb host, providing everything we could possibly need: toiletries / towels / cleaners / stocked Keurig machine / etc. etc. The place was very clean. I've stayed in several Airbnbs: this one was PERFECT."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,There isn’t enough space here to say all of the amazing things you could about this house. It is in and of itself a magnificent art piece. The setting is secluded and stress-free. I loved all the amazing houseplants that made the space feel very zen. The house was very clean and all of the provided amenities were of nice quality. Brian was super helpful not only with questions we had about the house but also with giving other recommendations with questions we had about Fort Calhoun in general. There are places to eat nearby and a cute apple orchard where we bought some amazing peaches that I would drive back for. We loved our stay and can’t wait to go back. Thanks Brian!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"From the moment we pulled up the driveway and saw the Harmony House, we were awestruck. Upon entering, we were taken into such a beautiful space that it really is hard to describe. It’s more of a feeling, like you can breathe. You can’t get much closer to nature. There are floor to ceiling windows and a large garage door that opens to a huge deck outside the living area.
My husband and I like to stay in different places to have new experiences, and the Harmony House is, by far, the best experience we have had. There is just a calmness that comes over you. If that isn’t enough, it’s so beautiful it’s almost hard to imagine. The craftsmanship is top notch and everything is so well appointed. Brian did an amazing job with the design and building of this house. Brian was an excellent host as well. Communication was there immediately after booking and all of the instructions are easy to follow. Checking in and out were a breeze. I I highly recommend this beautiful treasure in the forest."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place is amazing! Well decorated, the upstairs bathroom was spectacular. My family and I were looking for a relaxing place to spend a few days of quiet and we certainly found it. Top notch."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing and unique place to stay, surrounded by trees and rolling hills. So peaceful! We loved everything about this place! We hope to come back again in the future."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very unique property! Really enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and layout.
Brian was very helpful and ready to help with anything!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Half of me wants to keep this place a secret and the other half wants to scream it to the world. Pulling into the driveway you are awestruck by the beauty of the home and it’s surroundings. Once you step inside you have entered another realm. The craftsmanship is impeccable and widely inspiring. Seriously, so grateful that we got the opportunity to experience the Harmony Home."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Harmony house hosted a beautiful wedding for me. I reached out to Brian when I first found the house to see if it could accommodate a 25 person, small, private wedding. The home had the perfect setup for a bridal suite upstairs and grooms area below. They have an outdoor area that became a perfect backdrop for the ceremony. We enjoyed a cocktail hour and then dinner hosted on the large patios. The rooftop deck became a beautiful spot for dancing.
Brian and Marcy worked with us to accommodate all of our ideas and put on a wonderful day for us. They provided us with a wedding package in addition to the house to help us prepare for everything and allow our families to enjoy the day. Truly went above and beyond as hosts. My husband and I are looking forward to celebrating future anniversaries here!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Incredible stay, it’s the most beautiful unique home my wife and I have ever stayed in. It’s a good reason to visit Nebraska!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"We are from Omaha and were looking for a cool space for an annual weekend friend gathering. This checked all the boxes and more!
The house itself was amazing and unique. The huge windows, great natural lighting, and indoor water feature really added to our relaxing weekend. The space was also well-stocked with all the basics you need for a weekend getaway. We visited in February, so the trees were leafless, but the natural surroundings still made the home feel nice and secluded (we even saw deer in the wooded area outside)! Definitely plan to come back in some warmer months to take full advantage of the awesome outdoor deck and patio spaces.
Brian was a friendly and super responsive host. We really can’t say enough positive things about our stay here! Would highly recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,An amazing and unique place! Great host with great taste! Overall a great experience to bring in the new year!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A fabulous get away!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. Just wow. Guys, this home is SO cool! The details and finishes were over the top - I wasn’t expecting it.
We had the best time. Brian was a super accommodating host, and the town was so friendly and fun! We received great customer service everywhere we went.
I’d love to make it back when we can enjoy the outdoor spaces; they look awesome!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"GUYS!!!!! if you’re in this area, Brian’s property is a MUST!!!!… the ONLY downfall was the weather.. I wish it was a littler warmer so we could have enjoyed the amazing outdoor spaces!! We’d love to go again when we don’t have all our kids…"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"This shipping container home is a work of art and pictures can’t do it justice. It’s beautiful and only made better nestled in the trees. Brian was responsive, helpful and kind. The home, other than being gorgeous has nice appliances for ease of cooking, an incredible bath/shower for relaxation, and is perfect to enjoy the beauty of nature. We didn’t want to leave!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The shipping container in the woods was very unique in a good way! It was private from other houses and plenty of room for the 8 of us. We might have to come back next year to see what improvements have been made. Highly recommend to others!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house! Enjoyed our weekend!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing shipping container getaway! Secluded and tucked away in a wooded area.
Wake up to the natural light and enjoy coffee on the deck while listening to the wildlife wake up.
10/10 recommend for anyone visiting the area!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with plenty of things to do for the family
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Paradise is right! What a great place. We will return. Fishing, swimming, and nature. Great place to spend time with family."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! My sisters and I loved the cabin - watching the deer play in the lake, fish jumping, a blue heron. Enjoyed taking the kayaks out, roasting hot dogs in the fire pit, and just enjoying the serenity of the place. Couldn’t think of a thing that I would change (except more time😃). Thanks Hannah for a wonderful time - may end up being an annual event!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This listing was perfect for our family! The house is amazing - lots of space for everyone! Absolutely beautiful beach for the kids to play on and swim! The stone fire pit was so perfect, we used it every night! We really enjoyed all of the amenities! Kayaking, swimming mat, horseshoes, fishing and other yard games! The grill and patio set was perfect for outside family dining! Hannah is a perfect host! Responds immediately and extremely accommodating! Do not hesitate to rent this property! You will not be disappointed!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Beautiful setting. It was close to town but very peaceful. Spent one morning watching a great blue heron searching for his breakfast on the other side of the lake. Most mornings the deer came out to get a drink. Would definitely come back.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, cozy & easy to communicate with!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"This place was comfortable and fun! It was very clean, beds were all comfortable and the outdoor amenities are a bonus. We didn't have ideal outdoor weather to enjoy the large deck and the sun shades, but those would be great in the summertime. There is a sandy beach and fire pit.
On a 40 degree, sunny, calm day, we enjoyed the kayaks and paddleboat on the little lake! We could also enjoy a few games of horseshoes in the yard.
There is a lovely, wooded hiking trail at nearby Hormel Park.
The one downside was the sulphur smell of the well water. We brought drinking water for cooking, coffee, even brushing our teeth.
Would definitely stay again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The experience is amazing!
What’s included is way more than expected! Definitely under sales the experience!
10/10 recommend!
Our stay was perfect in every way and more!
Don’t hesitate and book this place! You won’t be disappointed!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,This house was amazing! Everything was absolutely top notch and we couldn’t have had a better time! This will be the house of choice for us any time we are staying in the Omaha area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, as advertised. Wonderful for a family gathering. Uniqueness for our needs for spreading out of wanted, or gathering together."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The place was absolutely gorgeous! My friends and I had a blast over the weekend, especially using the kitchen and the bed I slept in was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! The pool heater didn't work when we got there, but Dan got ahold of someone to fix it that evening. He was a great host! 10/10"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay and lots of fun
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We loved the pool!! Loved the house!! Would stay again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay with family.
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,"This was a great place if you needed to accommodate many people. Dan/his team was very responsive, the pool was fun, the space was unique, the patio was great for the evening and the kitchen had everything you could need.
The cons we found were:
It was kind of dirty. For example, there were some leaves in the entry way that also made their way inside. The dining area wasn’t swept very well. We noticed crumbs/dust bunnies on the carpet and throughout the rooms. Not a big deal, but it looked like it would have been easy to clean prior.
The pool door was hard to open and close. We ended up not using the inside pool door because we couldn’t get it open after a certain amount of times using it.
We wish there was a door for the master bedroom bathroom. It would have been nice to have a bit of privacy since two of the guests shared that room."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Dan was very accommodating and responsive.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was what was promised with nothing to fault. Had a fantastic time and it was the perfect place to celebrate with loved ones
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice and fun place. The kids had a blast in the pool.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Dan has a wonderful place! It was perfect for my sister's weekend! Everything was easily accessible & Dan was very responsive with any questions I had! The only thing we had as far as a 'complaint' was the excessive ants in the kitchen; even with our food packaged up and put away! All in all, it was an AMAZING weekend& we will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time, we wish we would have booked for one more day! Next year we will take that into consideration! The kids had a lot of fun as well as the adult. Only thing we found difficult was the 10 AM check out time other than that we were extremely pleased and will be considering again for our 2025 spring break!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect spot for Spring Break in the Midwest! Great layout for families to spread out and to be together. Beautiful, fully stocked kitchen. Pool was a big hit!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Great house for our family of 15 to celebrate an 80th birthday. Had fun with the karaoke machine and game room. The house included everything we needed for our weekend stay. Plenty of room and a quiet location.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Our group had a wonderful stay at this home. It was a great weekend getaway with lots of amenities.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Easy check in, responsive host, well stocked kitchen."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"This was a wonderful place to have a staycation. We enjoyed this clean & lovely home, chef’s kitchen with pizza oven, hot tub & pool, and comfortable beds. It was a hit and would highly recommend."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great house and pool for a staycation with friends or family! Spacious house, doesn’t feel like you’re all on top of each other all while in the same place having fun!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our extended family of 12 stayed here with 8 adults and 4 children and we couldn’t have asked for a better house. Room for everyone with so much to do, plenty of room, and everything you would need for a night or a week. Loved this place and will highly recommend it to anyone looking for something similar in the Omaha area."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lots of room for a family get together. Kids had a blast in the pool and hot tub.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Enjoyed a long New Years Eve weekend at the villa. The chef's kitchen was a dream. It was family entertainment just to prepare our meals there. Pizza night is a must! We utilized the 4 refrigerators and 3 coffee maker througout the house. The ice maker and blender helped us make fun drinks! This villa has plenty of space to spread out and the two living rooms were great for watching the football games. All TVs are smart TVs and we used the YouTube TV accounts already set up (but we also brought our fire stick). Family karaoke night was a blast! This place is very uniquely decorated with many eclectic features, a mix of industrial, 80/90's modern and updated touches. There are different areas to take photos, it is swanky! The primary bedroom gave off an 80's ""Todd and Margo"" vibe. Everyone slept very well, having 5 comfy king beds was nice. The property is kept very neat and clean."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,We loved this place. It met all of our needs. Dan was so accommodating. We enjoyed and used all of the spaces. My son made the best pizza using the pizza oven. We played cards next to the pool after swimming! We had the music and lights going. So much fun! And so warm!! We did have a few issues with the hot tub being on a timer so you had to go in on a certain schedule and no way to add water. Master Tub out of order and things could have been a little cleaner for the money. Overall it was a great place. I feel like when you are paying top dollar you should expect it to be pretty darn clean.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Dan and his team were very helpful during our stay. Our family had our Christmas gathering there, and the kids loved the indoor pool!
Dan even went out of this way and rented a movie for me on his amazon account because it was not letting me load into my account. Thanks again for the experience. I would highly recommend this property for family/group gatherings!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home that we would use again. Only drawback was that several amenities were disabled due to work being done on them. All three fireplaces and only bathtub in home were down for repairs. The pool was clean and well stocked with lifejackets for the kids and pool toys. The hot tub was nice to have and enjoy but only runs jets every four hours for one hour with no schedule and needed manual adding of water every day. Chef's kitchen is nice and a great place for a family of 11 to spread out. Host was very responsive to questions. All the TV you could ask for as host shares major entertainment apps.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay! Everything was great!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,great place with plenty of things to do
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Host was very friendly and responsive, and the house was perfect. Highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome house! great space for our family gathering. All the extras made it a very special experience.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, spacious & clean villa. The pool was an amazing perk!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,This is a wonderful stay for friends to get together. Many different options for activity and relaxing. Nice area as well!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place for our family to get together for the weekend. Kids loved the pool and the diving board! Also loved all of the fun perks like the game room, karaoke, games, coffee selection, great towels, etc. it was all great! The kitchen was amazing and so fully equipped. So glad we found this place. One thing people might want to know is that there are lots of different levels so you have to be able to navigate stairs, but that wasn’t an issue for us. Good times and fun memories!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an absolute blast at this home. The space was so clean and has any accommodation you would need. We had an issue locking the pool door and Dan was very responsive and helped immediately. All the beds and furniture are so comfortable and top notch! We will definitely look at stay at this place again.

We couldnt have found a better place to r3st and rejuvenate!"
2024-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed for a week here. Great quiet area. Hot tub available if desired. Pool in summer. Nice owners!
May have been a miss on our part, but this is basically a room and bathroom. All other areas are open to whomever is on property. We didn’t realize that part. It wouldn’t be that bad if there were a private area for paying guests. The kitchen, living and work area are not private. However, the way it’s set up is awesome!! Blackstone grill, stove/oven, microwave, coffee pot, etc. Now we want a Blackstone 😃
The bedroom is just a bed, no chair or bench to put a suitcase & no closet, so you’re living out of your bags/suitcase while you’re there.
Overall, more of a hunting camp type of feel. Gorgeous property!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Although we only stayed one night. We had a wonderful time! They even brought stuff for our children to play with. We can't wait to stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I reserved the place with my siblings for an anniversary gift for my parents. Jim and Kathy were extremely kind and made it a really fun and easy surprise. My parents loved the area! They said:
5 stars.
We enjoyed our time at the nest. Everything was clean and tidy and the location was great, right next to the river. Had it not been so windy, it would’ve been perfect! The hot tub was an added bonus we enjoyed even in the cool weather (the provided robes were a nice touch. There was a chance of nasty weather, and we were even provided with an emergency weather radio. Should you decide to stay, the District 10 Schoolhouse Bar is a unique place to visit and enjoy a drink."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We chose this location because it looked like it would be a peaceful place to visit with friends. We were unsure if this would work since this was a shared space, however, we felt very comfortable and private while visiting. Having the river right there was like staying at a park, which is what we needed. It works well for mild weather months to have outdoor living. The shared space is an open garage setting as pictured with couches and open cooking area which worked well for us. We had a pleasant time."

She stayed up to let us in and give us a tour even tho she had school starting up tomorrow and kids showing up the following day which she had to be up early. She was kind and talked to us and asked about ourselves. The place was beautiful, peaceful and quiet even with two other people staying there and I never saw them only Kathy which amazed me. I was sad I had to leave early as I had a family emergency and had to leave to Missouri immediately:( it was very well priced for such a lovely stay. Thank you again Kathy for all the help and im sure if I got to meet Jim he would have been just as kind. You both have a lovely home and we enjoyed it so much I might have to come back with a S/O it’s a beautiful romantic place as well as homie for a family"

We were very late arrivals on our first night and they stayed up to welcome us even with their early morning departure the next day. We walked inside to find beautiful flowers from their garden on a table. We were encouraged to pick vegetables that were ready and cut more flowers if we desired. The well stocked refrigerator was the best AirBNB experience thus far. Additionally, the well labeled kitchen area made it easy to find the cooking utensils that we needed. Everything from the inside living areas to the pool and hot tub were pristine and very clean. We enjoyed eating breakfast outside every morning under the covered patio with the amazing view. We look forward to staying at the Nest again in the future."

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Perfect for our famil wedding
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay. It is in a quite small town, a short drive to Omaha. It was hot the week we were there and the AC worked great throughout the house. The beds were very comfortable. The house was clean. Being able to use the garage that connected to the house was a nice perk. Having three full bathrooms was great. The kitchen had everything we needed."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, spacious, comfortable, and beautiful home. First Airbnb experience and it was great!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,This house is awesome!! Great location and a great host!!
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I were in town for my niece's graduation and stayed here for a week. Jan allowed us to stay with our 2, 1 year old great danes, so long as they were trained and were capable of staying off of the furniture. This of course wasn't an issue for s since we have them trained to behave this way at home. She left clear instructions for everything and the entire house was spotless. I've gone to other Airbnb's and this has not always been the case let me tell you. Upon our arrival back home, we realized that we'd left our FireTv there and Jan was kind enough to put it in the mail for us. She also found some sticky areas in her carpet and instead of freaking out, she kindly reached out and explained the issue. We of course paid for the service to have the carpets cleaned since one of the children must have spilled something. She was very understanding and kind the entire time. There were NO issues at all. The only downside to the location for us is that we're used to delivering in food and that's not an option here since there aren't restaurants near by. This of course isn't Jan's fault, but if you're a Californian like us and are used to this ""luxury"", keep that in mind when staying here. Over all, we felt super comfortable and enjoyed our stay. We will definitely stay here again if we come back to visit my sister in law in Fremont."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A very calm, quiet and peaceful place to rent in a seemingly very safe area. Would definitely rent again."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Jan's house. It was clean, cozy, and comfortable and we had plenty of space to relax and enjoy time with our family.

2019-08-01,5,Group trip,"Jan is very hospitable, easy to get in touch with, and she keeps a very clean house that has a very welcoming and comfortable environment! We liked that it was outside the city, because we could relax after a busy day at the zoo."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was perfect for our group (4 adults, 4 small children). It took about 40 minutes to get to the zoo in Omaha. Small town was great, however if you're looking for a restaurant to go out to I'd suggest going to Omaha."

2019-04-01,5,Group trip,Jan’s house was much bigger than the pictures make it look. Plenty of room for the 7 of us that stayed there. Everything was clean and she had everything in the kitchen you would need for preparing meals. She personally called us to make sure we got in ok and if we needed anything so that was great. We loved all the games she had downstairs available along with the pool table. I highly recommend her place if you are looking in this area. It will not disappoint!

Everything was so beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. My teenage sons enjoyed the pool table down stairs and we enjoyed having coffee in the front sunroom. Jan was friendly and very professional. She invited us to call/text her at any time if we had any questions. We texted each other several times prior to our arrival and she was very prompt in her answers to our questions. This was a great experience for our first Airbnb. I would definitely stay at Jan's again!"
2017-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We have had such a wonderful stay at Jan's home. It is beautiful and has every amenity we need with a 1 year old. It is clean, up-to-date, and comfortable. Jan was so accommodating with last minute plans when we ran into unexpected events during our move to Nebraska. Yutan is quiet and people are friendly. There is a great children's park and splash pad within walking distance. It is a short, quick drive into West Omaha and there is so much to do in the city. Thank you Jan!"
