2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect! I was working for a job for a week down here in Jackson, Ohio. It was a very relaxing and clean/peaceful apartment. Very spacey for a 1 bedroom/ 1 bathroom as well. Amenities were all there. Plus it was above a coffee shop which you can walk down the stairs and around the corner to get to! Would recommend for anyone staying in Jackson for a couple days to weeks for."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was very pretty and posh looking, right out of a magazine. Everything was very clean and the city sounds and lights outside of the window added to the uptown feel of the place. There was some noise from the restaurant below but not terrible just occasional hustle and bustle of a coffee shop below. We weren’t expecting the stairs leading up to the door way but to be fair I didn’t read the description throughly so perhaps I missed it. It is a very beautiful place though and offers a posh city atmosphere. It was a fun get-away for me and my husband, who normally are surrounded by the woods."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place. We will rebook very soon!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really nice place. Didn't really get to enjoy it much as we were only there to sleep one night then go to Bob Evan's Festival but the place was VERY nice. Highly recommend!!!

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice spot, but the walls and floors are thin which makes it hard to sleep in the morning. When the Spot on Main opens for the day (7am) you can very clearly hear the music and chatter from the coffee shop below."

Their dedication to providing outstanding hospitality was evident throughout my entire experience. The property itself was an absolute delight. It was immaculately clean, tastefully decorated, and equipped with all the amenities one could possibly need. The attention to detail was remarkable, with thoughtful touches like complimentary toiletries, coffee, and bottled water. It truly felt like a home away from home! The location of the Airbnb was also fantastic. It is situated in a charming downtown and located above a delightful coffee shop.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent spot...we stayed at this central location as we explored frozen Hocking Hills State Park, Athens/University of Ohio, and Serpent Mound (largest animal effigy in North America!).
Jenny gave us great food recommendations (Pi Express) and coffee at The Spot below was outstanding. The apt was very cozy and made for a great movie hangout!with plenty of space after hiking all day. We appreciated the natural light in the mornings paired with the beautiful church bells while we slept-in on a very comfortable bed.
Another small, but nice touch was being made aware that the cleaning fee actually covered things like dishes and stripping the bed, which made for a real quick check out. I know that doesn’t sound like a big deal, but having stayed at many Air BnBs with pricey cleaning fees that don’t do this it was very much appreciated and added to the luxury of the space."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is where we always stay when we come home to visit family. Always spotless and clean and perfect. It’s like our apartment in Jackson! Thank you Jenny! And the coffee below is the cherry on top! (Also Jenny always leaves treats for the guests 🥳)

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is a very lovely and clean place to stay. Jenny was very attentive to inquiries and responses. My only set back was the TV, because it is a smart TV. This was noted in the description, so we were aware of it needing passwords, etc. we do not have these types of memberships so we were unable to watch tv. Very nice stay otherwise!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy’s home was so beautiful! As others have said, the pictures really don’t do it justice. I stayed here with my parents and they absolutely loved it - my mom has always dreamed of living in an old farm house and she couldn’t stop taking pictures. The location is extremely close to Jackson’s city center, and is also super easy to access from the highway - great if you’re visiting Athens, Hocking Hills, or Point Pleasant!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is worth the stay just to see the inside of this treasure. The late 1800's home has just the right amount of updates. I grew up in Jackson Ohio and have stayed elsewhere on my visits, but never again. I'm more likely to schedule this visit when this great home is available. Cindy was great at communicating with me and she leaves little notes here and there where she thinks a little extra information might be helpful. The decor was fun and interesting I think I took more pictures at this home than any other we have experienced. My wife only went out for part of a day. She was totally relaxed and loved every room. We will be going back soon."

Every nook and cranny had special touches that made you laugh, smile and sometimes snicker. This beautifully restored home filled with love deserves 10 stars!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is amazing. Lots of room, large kitchen and fridge. I had the whole house to myself, but I never entered most of the rooms. Upstairs and downstairs are zoned separately for heat. The heat came up very fast and kept it pretty consistent overnight. The house itself is very nice, very open with high ceilings. One of the few places where I have gotten the tv to work; using my Netflix info. The beds in the main 2 rooms are very large. The one I slept in was very comfortable. Large bathroom with over a dozen towels. Since the house is so big I am guessing large groups use it and they would be very comfortable.
The house is just off the main road as you go into town so it's convenient to local restaurants. The classic country ""Main Street"" is just down the road. There was some traffic noise at night, but that is because the area is so quiet otherwise.
Parking is right next to the side door that is used. The door has a keypad that lights up, and goes right into an outer room, a ""mud room""(?) that is well list, where there is a small bathroom, and a laundry area.
I had great communication with the Hosts. They have notes around the house explaining how things work, and restaurant suggestions.
If I return next year to do the race I was in, I will definitely stay there again."

This is a special place, and the price can’t be beat!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value for your money!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have a million things to say about this house.
The value was unbelievable, first off.
We pulled up and awed at the fall/Halloween decorations straight off of a magazine cover. This is my favorite season!
When I walked in the door is when it hit me. My jaw literally hit the floor. It was straight out of an episode of HGTV’s Houses With History. I really appreciated the preservation of the house’s historic value. Paired with so many modern touches. Every corner, of every room, has a personal touch to it. It was so cozy! The beds were wonderful, and both bathrooms (along with the rest of the house) spotless.
I’d give it 100 ⭐️’s if I could. Can’t wait to come back and spend time there vs. just passing through!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Apple of our eye is an amazing beautifully decorated and very homey farmhouse! Located close to everything in Jackson and Cindy has made sure you’ll have all the basics and even extras like Q tips and dental floss sticks which came in handy after a great steak dinner at Dakotas roadhouse!!! We definitely plan on visiting again!!!❤️
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This beautiful home is full of picturesque opportunities and was adorably decorated for the holiday. The perfect spot to just tuck yourself away from the world for a night or more. Not quite a step back in time, as Cindy and family have been hard at work updating the home with modern touches that don't overwhelme the classic woodwork and farm antique feel. Will be staying again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is as perfect as an airbnb can be. I love writing reviews so this is a pleasure to write about.

We will 100% stay here again next time we are in town!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying in this home while we were passing through Jackson! We only wished we could have stayed a few more days.

I have already told some of my family members about this place and hopefully I will have the chance to come back! Thank you again for a memorable overnight stay."

She loved the tour and pictures with the Cows and chickens. Breakfast was wonderful!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were super grateful to rent both upstairs rooms for our growing family at Mary and Greg's house as we traveled from North Carolina to Michigan and our return trip! It's a great halfway point for us.
Our kids loved the large rooms with soft beds and large bathrooms, amazing breakfast, petting dogs, feeding the cows, views from the windows, stars at night, playing pool or air hockey in basement, and watching TV in the rooms, and the country feel. We appreciated the hospitality and pleasant conversation with Mary and Greg. Benders B&B on the Rise is a family favorite for us!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great stay for us when we visited Hocking Hills State Park! It’s about a 45 min drive from the park but it was well worth it. Our kids (3) had plenty of room in the bedroom and absolutely loved swimming in their pool!

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stop looking! Book now! We are typically a “whole place” renter but this place has made us reconsider private rooms.

The Bender family was very warm and welcoming. I hope to see them again.

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a peaceful retreat in the country then look no further! The house is beautiful and clean and Mary makes an amazing breakfast! We had the master bedroom on the first floor and the bed was so unbelievably comfortable and the attached bathroom was huge! There’s a large back deck with a pool that looks out over their property (over 100 acres!). They do have animals (cows and pigs in the pastures and dogs that roam). The dogs are kept outside while there are guests and you’d never be able to tell from the inside. However, if you’re a dog lover like me, then the pups can come inside and they are adorable! We had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay again! If you’re not used to winding backroads I suggest arriving while it’s still daylight and taking Mary’s suggestion on the alternate route, however GPS does lead you right to their front door."

The apartment was wonderful! It was easy for me to settle in and get comfortable, and although not a very big place, it had a nice sense of spaciousness about it. Jenny thought of everything! I had no wants or needs.

Her place is spotless and everything necessary for a comfortable stay was waiting for me. The bed was very comfortable, plenty of hot water, even coffee. I never heard anything but the wind. Jackson is about 10 minutes if you need anything else.
I was lucky enough to be greeted by Mac their Lab. He's a big sweet boy.
Highly recommended!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jenny is a terrific host who kept a clean and welcoming atmosphere during my stay. The town of Jackson is about a 15 minute drive away, so grabbing a bite to eat shouldn't be an afterthought. With that being said, there is a full kitchen to be utilized. Which you are better off taking advantage of anyway, opposed to the many fast food chains that you are left to choose from otherwise.

The one parking spot available in the rear was an obstacle my freind and I found a little troublesome. (It's a 2-person max Airbnb, but we had to drive in two seperate vehicles to meet up for the event located in the area.)
But all-in-all the rooms were clean! A drastic and refreshing atmosphere as opposed to the gentrifying alleyway lingering right outside the main door. And, once found and adjusted to our new environment, we found it welcoming. No bedbugs or worrisome leaks. Jason was very nice and receptive. Would come back and use again."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect for our needs. Peaceful and beautiful location!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay! We will be back!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beth is great with communication. Her home is clean, and all the basic needs are supplied. There was a lot of road noise even with my white noise on , other than that it’s a great place to stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Quaint little place to stay. Kids loved petting the horses!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful Quite Farm😍 Very inviting, Friendly,They even have horses you can pet in the back yard! Very clean Big home! A retail store next door,but mostly farming,We loved it!! We will be back"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect spot for us. We were motorcycling in the area. At first because it was so close to the road we thought it would be noisy, but it was very peaceful and quiet. The place was very clean and very cozy. Beaver, a little town nearby was having their fall festival and they had great food. If you’re in the area and you need food, try Sally’s, which is only about a 15 minute drive away."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,I had no issues with the Beth’s place. It could use a little freshening up but I felt comfortable. The location was great and the store next store was really nice. We had an early morning and the sky was like a planetarium.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay. Definitely recommend.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My cousin is visiting from South Africa. The two of us used this rental as a waypoiint on our way to Chicago. We loved the peace and quiet, the horses outside the back door and the Amish buggies that clipclopped down the road"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,A very nice place with a good amount of room and accommodations for multiple people. If I'm ever in the area again I'd look to see if this is available 👍
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect for our needs. We arrived about 8:30 pm. We didn’t have any trouble finding it but it is really out in the country and probably would be best to arrive during daylight if possible. Exactly as described.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Don’t let the fact of being a mobile home fool you it’s in a peaceful setting clean quite surroundings updated and clean inside
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home was exactly as described. The setting was beautiful and we enjoyed saying hi to the horses. Beth answered immediately when I messaged her with a question. This was a nice place to stay overnight to break up our road trip.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Overall our stay worked out great as it's hard to find a place to stay overnight with three dogs. The trailer was as described including the horses 🐎 outside that were very friendly. The air-conditioning was fabulous 😍 with the 90° + weather. Furthermore, the furniture was extremely comfortable, appliances were in good working condition, surroundings were quiet.
The only issue we had was confusion on the location we were staying d/t being sent wrong directions from Beth. It was immediately resolved with a phone call around 1:00 am. Cudos to Beth for answering the phone immediately, to straighten things out and getting us to the correct rental. It was partially our fault for arriving so late. My apologies to the person and dog I woke up in the middle of the night."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was very cozy and we loved the neighbors (horses)
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a lovely secluded home with beautiful surroundings. We were even able to pet the owners horses and my girls loved watching them. There was plenty of space and places to relax.

Thanks for the accommodation"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very peaceful. If you are looking for a relaxing place to stay this is it. Things were clean and ready for us when we arrived.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the horses and the area. Nice and peaceful. If we’re ever in the area again we will most definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Quiet and large space. A little update would make it even more enjoyable.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We needed a place to split our trip from Tennessee to Michigan to let our 2 year old and 7 month old run around and rest- and this was PERFECT. The carpet in the living room was super soft so our baby enjoyed crawling around and the horses with the large yard was a hit with our 2 year old. There was a Walmart about 11 minutes away for food and necessities. It is a mobile home or trailer (whatever one calls this type of structure) so it’s not “perfect” but we have paid way higher prices to stay at hotels in HORRIBLE condition so we did not mind at all. Couches were comfortable, sunset was gorgeous, price was right, and the store literally next door was outstanding. We will absolutely stay here again if we’re passing through!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the countryside at Beth's rental! It was great to be able to take our normal evening walk and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. Our baby and toddler LOVED the horses out back & we enjoyed checking out the owner's shop next door. Would definitely return!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My 2nd time staying there and the only place i will stay.The horses are beautiful even seen 2 babies that were born while staying there this trip. Very clean and country feel. Great place
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would encourage guests to give Beth’s place top consideration if you will be in the area. We had a nice stay, in a very safe area with plenty of nice views and even with the house very close next door, we never felt like our privacy was in question. Beth’s place is located in a easy access area from the main road. We had the pleasure of seeing the horses in the back yard, were able to walk over to the arena across the road to watch some of a horse show, and we saw quite a few horse and buggy rides going by the home.
Just an FYI, there is no internet here ( I didn’t read in the listing that there wasn’t any) but the cell service was great. The tv wasn’t the greatest. The signal was lost more than it was found. You will need to bring paper products and anything you might want for the kitchen. No basic supplies were there such as salt and pepper or cooking oil. But overall it was a nice stay, in a really nice, safe area and I recommend this place to others."
2023-05-01,4.0,Group trip,Clean and good value.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable, nice, and clean, Highly recommended"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Locating was a bit confusing at first. We might have concerned the neighbors next door when pulling into their driveway.
The home was immaculate with all of the comforts of home, plus gorgeous views of the sunset and horses right across the way. Having 2 bathrooms was an added bonus. If you’re looking for a quiet spacious family friendly gorgeous place to stay I highly recommend this one.
We would stay again!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Needed a place to stop for the night on our trip to North Carolina with my husband, brother-in-law, infant daughter and two cousins. This place was worth what we paid for, roomy, and perfect for a quick stop for the night."

(I didn’t realize that I had gotten into the “Flexible Dates” part of the app. 🤦🏼‍♀️) I didn’t realize that we’d missed our reservation until I was asking for clarification on directions the following day. She was so kind and understanding. She didn’t have our original booking site available for that day, but did have another one and made us a reservation right away. It was perfect and just what we needed after a long day of driving. I can’t say enough wonderful things about her!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a great spot for us and our small dogs to stay for the night to break up our road trip from Chicago to Virginia. The space was very cozy and had everything we needed. The horses on the property were a special treat for us “city folk”. 🐴😀

I would not describe our night as quiet. ;) Thankfully, our five year old slept through it. The space was clean, but not meticulously clean depending on how picky you may be. The trailer was set up well and met our space needs very well for my husband, son, mother-in-law and I. Thanks, Beth!"

Great communications. We enjoyed being around the horses, watching the buggies driving by, and checking out the log cabin."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was exactly what we needed to rest and continue our journey. We were happily surprised to get to meet some horses in the morning before we headed out. All we needed was a bed and it was perfect:)
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beth was kind and helpful! It was very late when we arrived and we had trouble finding the place on the dark country roads. Beth answered her phone right away and was patient with us while we navigated the area. It was the perfect stop for us while passing through town. It was lovely to wake up and see horses right outside!

The kids loved seeing the horses in the pasture every day!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is a gorgeous little cabin tucked into a very high-end neighborhood. It’s attached to the main house by a shared patio. Hot tub and pool are on that patio. Super cute and perfectly comfortable. And pet-friendly so we were able to have our fur baby with us. Tons of windows and natural light. The down side of that is there are no curtains on the living room windows. It’s a very quiet & secure area so it’s not a problem, but just be aware if privacy or darkness is needed. Holly was a wonderful host! Super quick response anytime I needed her. Even on arrival when we couldn’t find the driveway in the dark! I had read the other reviews that said it was kind of hard to see the driveway so I knew to be on the lookout - but I still missed it! It really is tucked away right off the little turn around. Holly responded to my text super quick & reassured us we just needed to keep going:) Great experience & would definitely recommend."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Holly's home for work purposes. From check-in to check-out, everything about my stay there was perfect. Holly was great about making sure that I had everything I needed. And I enjoyed the location of her home, the hills and trees that surrounded it - as well as the open space that gave room to unwind and relax at the end of a busy day. Grateful and appreciative of it all."

It was a cute cozy cottage with very nice personal touches like snacks, water, teas, coffee, hot chocolate, spices for cooking and the best thing a dozen farm fresh eggs. We enjoyed walking around the farm and watching the pony and goats right outside the door. The night sky was gorgeous and so peaceful. We loved that there was a list of resturaunts and attractions surrounding the area and we found lots of thing to keep us busy. We would definitely love to visit again and would say this is one of the best airbnbs we have stayed at. Thank you for being a wonderful host."

I had trouble with the doorknob and lock, wasn't sure if I locked the door while I was inside for the night. As a single female, I was a bit nervous about that, but it didn't ruin my stay. Outside was cool, too. Didn't have enough time or daylight to explore, but before I left in the morning, it was a gorgeous view!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jen was such a hospitable host. Friendly and very responsive which I appreciated since I was getting in well after dark and I never know how accurate googlmaps will be outside of larger cities. Just what I needed to lay my head for the night and continue on my way. Her place was easy to find and just as described. A welcome basket with some snacks was perfect since I was coming in late night.
The place had any of the amenities I might need and it Had every kitchen appliance I could need (the hot plate was perfect and I did not miss the lack of stovetop. The farm fresh eggs from her chickens that she left in the fridge were wonderful to have for breakfast in the morning.
I’m short so this was a non issue for me but to note the ceiling in the bathroom is low so if I was a 6ft tall individual I’d be very close to the ceiling.
The mattress was on the softer side so if that’s your jam this is your spot.
Overall a cute cozy place, perfect for the solo traveler or small couple."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed my stay at Lyndsey’s place. The home was comfortable and clean. Lyndsey is a fantastic host. She set up the place so well and really thought of everything. I’ve stayed at Airbnb’s all over the world and Lyndsey’s place is definitely among the best I’ve seen. I would stay here again and would recommend it to anyone without question.
,,,"NIGHTMARE STAY! I ended up canceling my reservation and having to get a full refund from Airbnb and stay over an hour and a half away and a hotel. When I arrived for this reservation the trailer had not been turned over there was pubic hair in the bathroom, stains all over the beds, torn curtains, and no key. Additionally one of the bathrooms has a floor that’s bowed way up and collapsing on one side. This place is not safe and should not be available as an Air B&B"
