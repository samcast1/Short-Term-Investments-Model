2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay here! It is immaculate, modern, and we felt right at home. Great view of the lake in an awesome location that is close to everything. The host was excellent with communication. So glad we found this place!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such a good time at this cozy two person cabin. We loved having a microwave, waking up to the beautiful lake. We even went on a kayak adventure to watch the sunset.
Nancy was very accommodating and had the cutest doggo too."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin was adorable, clean, cozy and perfect for a weekend getaway! There was a little artificial fireplace that kept it nice and toasty and the views were stunning. Sweet little touches made the small space feel so comfortable. The location was also great!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"everything was perfect, great spot for a weekend getaway."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was great. Beautiful location.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little cabin! Highly recommend.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nancy was fast to respond. The cabin is so cute and very comfortable. I booked it last minute for a solo birthday escape and enjoyed every moment of my time.
The river was stunning, there is a heater to keep the cabin cozy in the cooler months, and a coffee machine to assist with the perfect morning!
I will stay again and already shared with my friends! Thanks Nancy! Such a sweet hidden gem!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don't let a this cozy, quaint hidden jewel pass you by! This place was a gem! I loved it was off beaten path, in a quiet area..and right next to the river! Nice & cozy inside with a queen bed, seat & table just to your left, with a plank seat, and a heater, and even a tv (if one would even need that). There was also a one cup coffee maker, with fresh drinking water outside. Seating with a table and loveseat could be found outside, along with a grill. Gather around a firepit, with free wood to use. I thought the outhouse was quaint. The seat was a bit chilled, but to be expected. Didnt bother me none, as grew up with one. I will definitely be back, as the fall colors took me away to the North Shore. But the quietness of this little cabin was just what I needed! Already looking forward to my trip back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic place to stay just outside of Duluth. Enjoy the peace and quiet on the river!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay! it is so cozy and the bed is very comfortable. The host really has thought of everything and includes a microwave, coffee maker, and even a little light for the outhouse. The outhouse is clean and well kept, only a few feet away from the cabin. There is even firewood for the fire pit so we could just roll up and enjoy."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome stay! Highly recommend for a weekend trip up north! Awesome location right next to the river and sure beats a hotel

2022-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"As advertised, this is a cozy, clean and quiet little cabin. In terms of value, running water and just a composting toilet would give it another star or two."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,So so cozy and comfy!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great stay. The river is literally 15 feet from the cabin deck! This stay was better than I thought it could be.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"nancy's cabin was so adorable!! the bed was majorly comfy, I laid down to nap and slept for 7 hours on accident. waking up to the river is gorgeous and seeing the stars at night while u go out to the outhouse is so beautiful. the outhouse was a bit smelly but it's an outhouse so ... yeah to be expected lol it was really clean though! no running water was fine with the giant jug, plus i got to brush my teeth outside hehe. perfect for a night alone on the way to ely :-)"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time. Owner respected my privacy
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a great little spot that we both enjoyed.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great quaint and cozy cabin. Has everything you need. The view from the bed of the river was picture perfect. Amazing neighborhood. Would totally stay here again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful quiet spot. The bed is comfy and the place is really well set up. We built a fire and looked at the stars and enjoyed the peaceful evening. The wifi was too weak to connect but that wasn't a problem for us, just don't count on it working. Otherwise everything was great and Nancy was very communicative!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute little cabin right on the gorgeous river. Great place for our quick one night stay near Duluth. Outhouse was very clean for being an outhouse.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect place to stay in Duluth, far enough away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to see the sites. It is such a peaceful place to unwind and have a fire. Nancy was gracious, friendly and kind and the room was perfect. The neighbors dogs even stopped by to say hi. it's right on the river and I couldn't recommend it enough for a night or two. If we make it back to Duluth would definitely stay here again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin was so cute! The perfect stop on my way up north. It was so peaceful and cozy. I will definitely stay again when I’m the Duluth area.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Absolutely charming rustic cabin. You wake up to an incredible view of the St. Louis River. Close enough to enjoy Duluth, you are far enough away to have the quietness lend to a truly refreshing time. The only reason we gave 4, instead of 5, stars is that the outhouse was a bit too malodorous for us."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice rustic cabin! Location is sooo peaceful and quiet.. Host is very responsive and gracious! Highly recommended place.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The host was friendly and quick to respond, the cabin was beautiful, and the location was amazing. We would definitely stay here again!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place! Tranquil setting, and beautiful views! We loved staying here and will come back!!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a very quaint place to stay. Almost like glamping! Just a bit of a distance from Canal Park and Duluth.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed this cute little sleeper cabin for our one night stay. Small town cuteness in nearby Gary, too"
2019-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"Small one room without running water. If you want to get away and like glorified camping, this is it. Clean, and unique. Cool experience."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,this little cabin with it's own outhouse was ever so perfect for a get-away night. it was as quiet and peaceful as one could ask for. i loved it and will be back!!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it here! We will be back
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful views and a cozy little cabin!
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I booked a night stay for my mother's b day she has been wanting to go up to Duluth for years as like a girls trip so I finally did it and she loved how relaxing and beautiful it was. The nights sleep was amazing and couldn't of asked for a better place to stay. If we ever find ourselves going back up to Duluth we will definitely be staying there again
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wow! This place was incredibly beautiful! Great hospitality.
2019-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nancy provides a really nice, rustic place to stay. It is out on the water and not far from Duluth. When I came out the door in the morning, I saw a deer just a few feet away! So cool!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time using Airbnb and I couldn’t be more impressed. Nancy and Judd’s little cabin made our trip perfect and we couldn’t have asked for anything better. This cabin is perfect for a couple looking for a getaway. They had everything you would possibly need and made you feel right at home. We will be visiting again.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little getaway! It is peaceful, tidy, and Nancy was very accommodating!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"quaint, great riverside location and super friendly. it was very simply appointed (i dont mind no running water and an outhouse) and i would stay again in a heartbeat! thanks again!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nancy was great. She clearly communicated and gave us the utmost privacy. Great host. I would highly recommend this location, host, and guesthouse to anyone!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nancy was a wonderful host. Cabin was clean, ready for us, and full of amenities to make our trip cozy and enjoyable. Cabin has a gorgeous view in the morning, and a great back deck to have your morning coffee on and watch the fishermen. Highly recommend for a couple"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We were there very short time. Checked in around 10:30pm then had to leave early at 5:30am next morning. Nancy was very understandable and made accommodation for the time. We had really comfortable stay and we will definitely come back next time!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nancy's place was the perfect place to unwind with nature. I enjoyed the serenity of being right on the St. Louis River and the peaceful surroundings. Both the cabin and outhouse were clean and well cared for, with detailed touches that showed the host is committed to a positive guest experience. I'll definitely stay at Nancy's place again!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, very clean, great value! Space heater works great"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at this cabin. We really did. Being so close to the river was so lovely, and having access to a canoe AND a fire pit was everything we needed. Made the different between choosing a hotel vs. this cabin. So secluded and nice."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10 recommend this cute little space. very much worth the time and nancy is such an awesome host!!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute and cozy cabin. Took a quick one night trip to explore northern Minnesota. The location is close enough to make driving anywhere easy, but also secluded for a chance to get away from it all."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a great little one room cabin! Right on the river with a nice big window. Super easy check in.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"It's as clean and lovely as it looks. Had a terrific stay, great location that felt cozy under all weather circumstances."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin is in a beautiful location, and the host is very responsive to questions. We had a great time!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This little cabin was the serene getaway we needed, cabin is very cozy and has everything you would need. No worries about not having running water, the outhouse is very close by and is kept cleaner than most public restrooms. My boyfriend usually has issues sleeping and passed out early with no issues. The river is beautiful, quick 20 min drive from Duluth. Thank you so much!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nancy’s place was adorable and cozy. Even the outhouse was cute. Note to those who stay there: make sure you take the key hanging next to the door in the cabin with you when you go to use the outhouse to avoid accidentally locking yourself out (learn from our mistake!) Nancy had to let us back into the cabin in the middle of the night and was very gracious about it (sorry again!) All in all, a wonderful and affordable experience for anyone who wants a unique place to stay and doesn’t need access to a shower."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We chose this cabin on the river just outside of Duluth and were so happy! The cabin is sweet and although really small the weather was perfect so we spent the evening outdoors with the bbq and a fire. The bed is really comfy and the coffee set up is great. If you're planning to grill bring your own plates and cutlery-treat it like camping but with a really comfortable bed instead of air matress! The outhouse is really clean and well stocked and the availability to use Nancy's canoe or kayaks is a nice touch. We would stay again for a couple nights instead of just one.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at an very exciting place!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Delightful little cabin on a dead end street. Though it only has an outhouse, even that was clean and welcoming. Also, loved the birds and sunset on the river. Wish i could have stayed longer!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice. Quaint.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute little place good for a night or two, good parks nearby, lovely view of the river, very quiet and private."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nancy's guesthouse was perfect for a weekend getaway! Great location on the St. Louis river and the little thoughtful touches like coffee, tea, and snacks made us feel right at home."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great area and hosts
2019-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Quaint and secluded from the bustle of downtown Duluth. Clear instructions and easy check-in. Complete with nice touches like coffee, plates, grill, flashlights. Great spot on the river."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little house. Lovely views and excellent hosts would definitely stay again!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication. Great location. Great value. There’s a dog that likes to steal your shoes but he’s sweet! And do not lock bottom lock, only the dead bolt. Everything was awesome. Thank you Nancy."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Nancy's cabin the night before the Grandma's Marathon and had a very relaxing sleep in a beautiful setting. Nancy was prompt at communication and provided everything I could need, including some energy bars! The property is practically surrounded by water, which means lots of great birds and seclusion. Highly recommended!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy little cabin with a beautiful view on the river. Makes roughing it easy!!!
2018-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and cozy little cabin right at the bank of the St Louis river. Very friendly host couple, can be recommented."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is fantastic! Wonderful location on the St. Louis River, adorable one-room cabin, and nicely hospitable touches— great value for the price. The lack of running water was not an issue, as the outhouse is well kept and drinking water is provided. Highly recommended."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing experience!! The location is beyond beautiful and the place is very cozy. Nancy was a great host. We highly recommend this place as we will be coming back someday!
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great value! Close to Spirit Mountain and Duluth activities. Wonderful, rustic and host is very easy to communicate with. I would definitely stay here again."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved Nancy’s place. Great for a quick sister trip up north for some hiking and fall colors. Can’t wait to visit again.
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Nancy's cottage is lovely and cozy. My husband and I just stayed there for one night- but we felt very welcome!
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I feel pretty lucky to have been the first guest at this charming cabin in a stunning setting. It's right on the river and close to state parks and Duluth too. I've stayed in enough AirBnBs to know that this spot will be quite popular. Nancy was attentive and friendly, the outhouse is really clean, and the bed in the cabin is very comfortable. I could go on but discover it for yourself."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Westin has a beautiful home, quiet, peaceful location l. The hot tub was a great amenitie. Very comfortable beds and pillows. Westin was very helpful in helping us find the ATV trails, there was ample parking for our trailer. The kitchen was stocked with every appliance you can imagine which is a plus if staying for a few days and want to cook. We will definitely check availability when we are back in the area."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,The price was ok but the one night cleaning fee was excessive. There's too much unnecessary stuff for our taste.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The accommodations were wonderful, we would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed Barbara's cozy apartment! It was very clean and a lot of thought has gone into making it a welcoming, enjoyable space. And thanks for the surprise in the fridge!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Barbara was a wonderful host and you can tell she cares about your comfort with all the detail amenities she includes in the apartment!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Take everything as advertised.
Such a great stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There was so much to like about Barbara's place. I was on the 7th day of a cross-country road trip and Barbara's place was the perfect stop. It was so cozy and inviting. I felt right at home and was able to take care of laundry with the washer and dryer inside my apartment. Everything was decorated so nicely with taste and charm. I used the upstairs porch for morning coffee the first day but a storm was rolling in and by the afternoon I was sitting inside with the wall fireplace on watching the rain fall and listening to wind chimes as I sat in the cozy chair with a warm blanket while watching the storm. I could see Lake Superior from my bedroom window and from the porches. I used the lower porch the second morning despite the windy storm before I packed up and had to hit the road. I was sad to leave the space after only two nights. I will, also, add that I felt like the house facing the alley made it much more private and quiet rather than on a regular road."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great 👍
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and quiet space with plenty of special touches. Very worth it!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was nothing short of perfect! The bed was soft and heaven to sleep on. There were so many great touches and available supplies for me to use including an air fryer microwave, utensils, Tea coffee, and more! The location was perfect walkable distance, if need. About 10 min walk and 2 min drive into downtown. 10/10"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Was perfect for what we needed. There was lots of amenities and details. Felt that it was also very private. Would highly recommend to friends/ family and would stay again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay at Barbara's place! The apartment is cozy, quiet and very clean. The lovely wood paneling makes you feel like you're staying in a cabin! And it's well stocked. She's really thought of everything! The location is also great! Very convenient to Canal Park, downtown and even the mall area. I would definitely stay with Barbara again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, nurturing space! Barbara has thought of all the “little things” guests may need, and I felt very cared for. Easy and prompt communication. Short walk to downtown."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute neighborhood with a great view of the lake. Also quite easy to walk downtown!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Barbara outdid herself on amenities for such an affordable space. Unfortunately I screwed up on my end booking one for one night when I’d thought I booked for two. Barbara handled the mishap respectfully and hopefully no harm was done. Very clean; very comfortable bed and lots of little thoughtful gestures to welcome guests.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cozy, eclectic spot, perfect for me, traveling alone for work."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cozy place! Perfect for a weekend stay. Barbara is responsive in communication and keeps a clean and tidy space with many personal touches."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Super cozy place! Loved the cabin walls, space heaters, fuzzy robes, and fluffy slippers! She had a mini fridge, coffee bar, utensils, etc. All these touches made the place very comfy, since it was cold (to be expected in MN). Easy check-in too, and Barbara let us check in early for a wedding! Wish there was a bigger sink for dishes. My husband and I thought it was private and cozy; overall great stay! :)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Wonderful location and Barbara has everything you could need for a fun stay in Duluth!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,It’s a very enjoyable trip living in here. The place is close to the downtown. Barbara is very kind and nice to give local recommendations. Highly recommend to live here!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,I stayed at Barbara’s apartment for 1 week between 12/16/23 to 12/23/23. Her place is huge in privacy. I would easily not want to stay anywhere else when I come back to the city.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was a true gem. We found everything to be spotless and welcoming. An absolute must stay place! We will be back again :)
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment. Was cold however. Would have been nice if space heater had been turned on before I arrived. Otherwise, well worth the price!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice quiet private room.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The visit went well. The space is well-located for everywhere I wished to go. Down Lake Avenue to Park Point and Lake Avenue Restaurant, up Lake Avenue to connect to the US-53 to Sax-Zim and best of all easy access to Hawk Ridge Bird Observatory. The easy-to-make coffee made the morning enjoyable. The parking space makes transfer to the quarters especially easy! The cold beer, with good variety, makes the first evening transition enjoyable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Barbara’s place is adorable and she thinks of so many little hospitality extras that make this place so special.. Great location!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a fabulous stay!!!!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy and comfortable place. My go to stay place in Duluth."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,It was good place to spend the night
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Barbara was very responsive and even gave me the option of early check-in. The place had everything I needed for a comfortable stay- great bed, fluffy towels, lovely lotions and soaps, etc,... Very clean also."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location that was walkable to Canal Park/coastline, great value, and lovely space with so many nice touches. Barbara is friendly and hospitable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve lost count on how many times I’ve stayed at Barbara’s place! I can always count on a responsive host, plenty of amenities, spotless bathroom, and a cozy room. Already looking forward to a future stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this location! Barbara was helpful and responsive whenever we needed anything. We were within minutes of downtown Duluth and Canal Park and getting on the highway to head up the North Shore. It was a great stay and we can’t wait to come back.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara is an amazing host. So thoughtful for my comfort. I also had an opportunity to enjoy her company on Saturday evening, very relaxing and comfortable conversation as we watched the storm from her porch. I would recommend Barbara's place to stay 200%!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our second time staying with Barbara, and we’ll honestly probably always choose to stay with her every time we come through Duluth."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was very nice and comfortable. Barbara was accommodating and worked with us with our phone/app issues. There were detours in Duluth which made getting around challenging. Would recommend.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place! Private area nicely set up for guests!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed out stay. Thank you!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another year, another great visit. Barbara’s space couldn’t be a more perfect fit. Everything needed and more is here with a gracious nod to a very accommodating host.
Five Stars across the board!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,A very homey room-like staying with family.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and felt like home away from home. Definitely want to return again in the future.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was amazed that there was such attention to detail for what one would want at an Airbnb especially since this was listed as a bedroom plus bath. Small fridge & microwave, toaster, keurig, air fryer/toaster oven…..the list goes on. Communication was clear from the host as well. We were just there to sleep for one night as we dropped our youngest off to UMD. It was perfect!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable. Lots of amenities. A very good choice.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, would definitely come back"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barbara is a fantastic hostess. I had a bit of trouble with the lock because I'd never used one like it before & she came right down to help me. She was very kind and understanding about it all. We spent a little time getting to know one another and I found her very pleasant and refreshing. I am staying with her again in September and very much looking forward to it. Her place was wonderful - everything I expected and needed. I would recommend her and her place to anyone and everyone. Just terrific!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely little bedroom and bathroom with all the amenities you need. Barbara was very communicative.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara's place is very ""homey""- with lots of touches to make you feel like you're at your own place. She privides little things like bathroom shampoos and a nice coffee service. I'm not saying that she offers a luxury, ultra modern place. Hers is a quiet, orderly, clean basement unit with a direct shot down Lake Avenue to Canal Park. It's a apartment that is close to Duluth's downtown at a good price."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara's Inn is a wonderful place to stay in Duluth. The location is perfect and close to everything. It is a great value, clean, and I would happily stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The room was very nice and quiet. It had all the amenities one would need over the course of a day or two. Its also within a few minutes of downtown and the lake which was super convenient. Would definitely stay again in the future.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Barbara’s house is very nice and very clean. Although I only stayed one night i feel it would be a very safe and inviting place to stay when visiting Duluth. If I ever visit here again I will surly try to stay at Barbara’s!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful place to stay in Duluth! Very cute, clean, cozy, and nice place! Very easy to find and close enough to downtown to walk, however the walk back is up a steep hill. Had lots of amenities and everything needed for our overnight stay. Would definitely stay here again when we come back to visit Duluth!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place felt like I was staying at a friends house! Had everything for a relaxing stay. Wish I could have stayed longer. Very comfortable! Central location but also tucked away so you don’t get a lot of traffic going by. Would highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara and her home is a gem. Her place is a throwback to the old AirBnB days where you truly felt like a guest in someone else's home. Her personal touch and care is present everywhere you look. From the welcome beer in the refrigerator to the towel warmer after a long bath, every part of the stay was excellent. She is incredibly responsive and caring as well, so add wonderful human to the list of attributes of the stay. My new favorite place to stay in Duluth."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara was a responsive and kind host whose place provided all of the amenities needed for a comfortable stay, as well as being centrally located to a variety of places to visit (restaurants, breweries, biking/walking trails) in Duluth."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara was very helpful when I had trouble checking in. She came down to help in person. Then when the smoke alarm started acting up she came down again with a new one and she got it set up very quickly. After that, I left her alone!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara was a great host, with an excellent space for your trip to Duluth! When we return we will definitely book with Barbara again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very much enjoyed our stay here. Close to the harbor, but far enough away from all the noise. Could walk there, but the hill is something else! Beautifully decorated. Had everything we needed. The towel warmer was 10/10. Will stay here again if in Duluth."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, nice conversations, over a glass of wine.
Great hospitality!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Barbara's place was the perfect spot for my wife and I before our trip to the BWCA. Within walking distance of many breweries/eateries and ofcourse a delicious wild rice burger at Fitger's Brewhouse. It was everything we needed for a last evening in civilization not to mention the parking is private and off the main and side roads and I much appreciated that. Barbara is a very responsive host and I would absolutely stay again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara’s place has a fantastic location just 5 blocks off from bars and restaurants. One note is there’s a steep hill you need to descend to get to the main drag, so those that have a physical impairments should consider consulting Barbara prior to booking to ensure it’s a good fit.
The space itself has a separate entrance, full bath and queen bed as described. Probably better for shorter stays as there’s no kitchen in the space, just a mini fridge and coffee bar. Barbara is an incredible gracious host with kind messages, a candy bowl and a couple complimentary beers waiting upon arrival. Would totally stay here again for more Duluth adventures in the near future!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barbara’s place was absolutely perfect! She included all of the comfy touches. Walkable location. Lots to see and do. Super kind host. We hope to return!

There were scones set out for us and fresh water for coffee. The bed was comfortable and cozy. Our accomodations were clean and the area was quiet and we felt safe.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely weekend stay at Barbara's! It was my husband's first time staying in an Airbnb, and he was impressed! The room had everything we needed for a short stay, and we loved the homey cabin feel to it--much cozier and with more amenities than staying in a barren hotel room. We spent most of our time out and about in Duluth (go to Bellisio's for some great Italian food!) but it was so nice to come 'home' at the end of the day and have a comfortable place to relax. Thanks, Barbara!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my third stay with Barbara and it exceeded expectations. Clean, quiet, and comfortable with so many amenities. After a week in the Isle Royale backcountry the towel warmer, cozy robe, and locally-made biscotti were a wonderful indulgence. Being just up the hill from Canal Park made for easy access to ship watching. Looking forward to next time!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at Barbara's place several times before and it never disappoints. The amenities are fabulous, location is perfect, and it is just a fun place to stay.

She is just up the hill from everything, so if you're not afraid of a little walking, it's a nice walk. If walking is not your thing, still very easy to get to everything. Will be checking in here again the next time we head to Duluth. Thanks Barbara!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy with everything you need for your stay at a reasonable price. Good location with easy access.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"i needed a layover while on tour. this was cheap, easy, and perfect. i had no need to wash dishes or cook so the kitchenette area was perfectly fine. a few cups of coffee and a few beers were all i needed. well, and the bed, so thanks.
the shower head and toasty hot shower water was perfect as well. the night was below zero, so i had the space heater on for a bit, but everything else was great."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"nice place to stay, comfortable bed & a very very short drive to popular local spots."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy spot. I had fun walking down to the lake & shops on the steep winter sidewalks. Everything fine. Fyi no place to wash yr dishes, just bathroom sink, no place to cook other than toaster oven.
And a nice variety of free locally sold beer offered ( just 2 per person. :)). Maybe it's one per night. 😆. But it's a nice welcome at the end of the day"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a very cozy spot.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great stay. Close to local restaurants and bars. Amazing view of the lake.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara’s place is the best stocked place I have stayed yet! Comfy bed, super clean. Highly recommended!"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed one night,Barbara was a wonderful and responsive host! Her home was decorated for Christmas and had adorable amenities that provided a homey and welcomed feel. My only complaint was a very obvious basement smell that caught me off guard upon entering the home. Still recommend staying here for a short overnight visit!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as expected, excellent stay."
2022-11-01,3,Stayed one night,"Our bags and clothing smelled of a pot smoke odor when we packed them into the car for departure. Host was very responsive, but location was tricky to find. Not sure how that could be improved, though. Nice amenities!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Greatat place with EVERYTHING you need and then some! Would stay again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place continues to be my favorite place to stay in Duluth. Its easy access to Hawk Ridge, down Lake Avenue to Minnesota Point, and up Lake Avenue to head towards the Sax-Zim black spruce bogs is a bonus. It is only blocks from many restaurants of Duluth, a short drive to many others and the activities available at the foot of Lake Avenue.
Being able to park within a few yards of the entrance door is a plus. The keypad entrance is easy to use. The place and area are very quiet at night; I got a good sleep every night.
The accommodations are comfortable, sort of like hanging out in a north woods cabin with the pine board interior walls. The kitchen area is small, but cozy, and there's one of everything that I looked for. The microwave is small, but was more than adequate for my needs. The Keurig coffee setup is easy to use, with a variety of types of coffee provided, and takes only a minute to have steaming hot coffee on a cold Duluth November morning.
The hostess is accommodating and responds quickly to queries.
And having a complimentary cold beer waiting in the cooler after a long day's drive to Duluth is one perfect way to begin the vacation!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hi Barbara, your place was great. One note we found the bathtub a little tough to get in and out of and suggest you put up some grab bar‘s. We love the little fireplace heater next to the bed."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara has literally thought of everything! If you don't see what you need right away, just send her a message and she'll direct you to what you need. Forgot your phone charger? Need a screw driver? I'm not kidding - EVERYTHING is there, including the scissors that another guest comically complained were missing. They're in the top right drawer, under the TV, haha! Barbara's place is cosy and filled to the brim with amenities. Bed is comfy, and how delightful to top off our stay with a gift card for a WONDERFUL local bakery on top of everything else. Thanks, Barbara - we'll definitely be staying with you again!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara is the epitome of a super host. So responsive/kind/generous, clean cozy private space packed with amenities, perfect location right off the main drag but so quiet! Got a glimpse of BW (her kitty upstairs) & fell in love 💜🐾 can’t say enough good things!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara’s space is a great place to spend a little time in Duluth. It’s small, but cozy, and has a lot of really thoughtful touches for a space of it’s size. Very convenient location to Canal Park and downtown."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This private suite had everything you need for a cozy night away from home and more. The host left a selection of local beers and ciders for guests to try at their leisure. There was almost a full small-scale kitchen (everything except a stove and oven) in addition to the private bed and bathroom. The private entrance to the room was right next to your parking space, making your move into suite effortless. I would also like to note that the location is halfway up a large hill so if you are planning to walk around Duluth, you may want to reconsider."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara made us feel so welcome! Her place is a gem, and she is someone we would love to stay with again. She stocked our mini fridge with local IPA’s and gifted us a bakery gift card! TOP NOTCH."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at Airbnbs all over the country for the past several years and I can say that I have never had as many amenities as Barbara provided! Kurig coffees, teas of many flavors, umbrellas, fluffly towels, bath salts, etc. I can't think of a single thing that I could possibly have needed (or just wanted) that wasn't available! The room was spacious and airy, bed was comfy, location was private and close to everything, I loved it! A great value and Barbara was a perfect host."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an exquisite venue. Barbara offers all the highlights of a perfect stay; a gracious host, comfort, a great vibe, and close to all things North Shore. My second stay was no different than the first ~ splendid in all ways!"

2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and clean accomodations
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a top notch stay. Clean and quiet and anything you could conceivably want was present and more than you might not think of. Very convenient to the action downtown but you probably would want to drive the short distance because walking back up the hill would be challenging. Highly recommended.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice, quiet location. Very clean. Bed was very comfortable as where the pillows. I enjoyed a nice cup of coffee before I left. I appreciated the amenities - including the large hand mirror for getting ready to go out. I would definitely go back next time I'm in Duluth."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Barbara’s place was nice—lots of amenities and thoughtful touches. The neighborhood isn’t exactly great but that is kind of Duluth as a whole.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Barbara’s was perfect. It was my husband and I taking a ‘staycation’ and we couldn’t have asked for a better spot.

It is perfectly centered, with no more than a 5-10 minute drive to some of the best Duluth sites and activities. Im definitely bookmarking this spot in hopes of one day returning. I genuinely cannot recommend this location enough."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cozy little spot made for a great place to crash for the night on our way through Duluth up to the Northwoods. The on-site parking was a bit small, which was fine for us in our Mini Cooper, but may be tricky if you drive a truck or SUV. Excellent location, only a short walk from Canal Park."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cozy get away offers an incredible view, a ton of amenities, and a super responsive host. Taking a stroll to the very near Cascade park outlook over the town was 100% worth the steep walk. It was good evening to trek down a few blocks for some yummy food. The $5 can ride back up the very steep hill was easy to arrange and worth saving my legs for another walk with glorious views the next day. Highly recommend this cozy little getaway Can't wait for my next trip back."

Close by many restaurants and downtown businesses, it's a great base for exploring Duluth. Check-in was seamless, and Barbara was a responsive host. We met her near the end of our stay---could not have been nicer! I would note there is a step up into the shower, so those with balance/mobility concerns should keep that in mind. Little details really make this a memorable experience---would definitely come back!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent communication and very thoughtful with all sorts of extras offered in the room. Highly recommend.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara's inn was amazing and exactly what we needed for a couple day getaway to the north shore. Super close to local restaurants and grocery stores, and a short drive to the highway to get to state parks. The space heater and matching robes kept us extra warm and were a super cute touch! Since it was negative a million degrees in Duluth, the hot water didn't last as long as we would have wanted for multiple people showering, but overall we couldn't have had a better experience. Can't wait to come back!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a great place. The view is pretty amazing and Barbara has LOT’S of great amenities.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So warm and cozy, with a phenomenal location near Canal Park, this spot was absolutely perfect for my weekend snowboarding trip. Would absolutely stay here again"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful space! Such kindness and accommodating host. I highly recommend staying at this delightful spot. Thank you Barbara!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb offers the maximum experience as far as Airbnb’s go. It was perfect. Great location, all the amenities one could ask for and perfect for couples. I will definitely be staying again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was incredibly cozy! There is so much thought put into this place and it made even our one night stay really memorable. Also in a great location- we were able to get everywhere we needed to go in under 10 minutes.
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara’s Inn was fantastic for my SO and I. Cute and cozy and very clean. SO MANY different amenities and extras such as a towel warmer and whole drawer of slippers. I will be looking to come back in the near future.
Only downside is there was not a full kitchen however plenty of things in the kitchenette to make up for it. Microwave, toaster oven, Keurig and a mini fridge make it a great place to make easy meals or heat up leftovers from one of the many close by restaurants!"
2021-12-01,3,Stayed one night,"Barbara responded very quickly to our unfamiliarity with her electronic key system. She was right on the spot to show us how it works. The room is clean and neat. The view of Lake Superior is mainly seen outside the door, where there is a bench to sit."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barbara's place is very cozy! She has everything you could need and being able to walk downtown is super convenient. I enjoyed my stay!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've lost count how many times I've stayed at Barbara's Inn but it gets more charming each time. Communication, location, and check-in went well and smoothly! The space is cozy with a lovely view of Lake Superior. Amenities were plentiful and abundant. One of my constant favorite stays!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great spot for anyone staying in Duluth. Has all the amenities and is close to all the action. Well kept private setting.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara’s place is a cozy bedroom in her basement, with a little mini-kitchen set-up, and a bathroom, all to yourself in an occupied house. I heard only a little noise from Barbara and co upstairs, and assume they heard me running the very loud bath, but it was comforting. The room is sunny, and the door opens up to a view of Lake Superior (around some garages).
The location is unbeatable. Downtown is a few blocks down a steep hill, the better to work off the delicious calories from Duluth’s fine food and beer on the way back up.
The space had a number of nice touches, especially appreciated by someone unused to winter. There are 2 space heaters, a drawer of slippers, a spa towel heater in the bathroom, and piles of extra blankets. I have chronic back pain so I always choose Airbnb locations where I’ll have enough space to sleep on the floor if I need, but the bed was firm enough for me.
Barbara was a communicative and helpful host. I highly recommend her place, and Duluth in general."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great space, cozy, quiet, and loaded with a ton of extra amenities. Our only regret was that we were only staying one night. We will be back and we highly recommend it!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,When we decided on a trip to Duluth in the middle of the week we didn’t know what we were getting ourselves into. Barbara’s inn helped us to have a home base and know that after all our exploring we had somewhere warm and cozy to settle into. 10/10 would recommend to my friends and family!
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Barbara’s place is centrally located to everything in Duluth. The room and bathroom have everything you need for an overnight or weekend away.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little place. The bed is super comfy and the space was very welcoming.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay in Duluth, or anywhere. Easy access, tremendous location, friendly hostess, parking a yard away, wonderful views of Lake Superior and down the Lake Street hill!
Coffee great to get the morning off to a fast start. And decaf in the evening.
I arrived on Halloween and appreciated the seasonal decoration and even a sweet treat and a cold one in the cooler."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great value and great location. Easy access to Duluth without all the chaos and the restaurant below was DELICIOUS!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy spot for a quick overnight with friends! Private. Incredibly kind and tasty venue beneath the rental
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jake was really great, communicative and helpful. We loved the loft—great location, very clean, great vibe. The cafe below was really neat to check out too. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely spot to stay and the restaurant was good, too!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay at Jake’s Airbnb in Duluth. The apartment was stunning!! the details that made our stay stand out include the modern features with character throughout the space with the fireplace and built ins. Even the smaller details like the glasses & mugs were so pretty!! Plenty of space for 6 people and we appreciate that the place had plenty of mirrors so even with only 1 bathroom we had enough space for getting ready. Beds were comfy, lots of natural light coming through. Great location- we didn’t have a chance to try the deli below but it looked delicious and had a huge line of people waiting to try it! Highly recommend a stay at Jake’s Airbnb if you are planning a trip to Duluth."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Overall a great stay. It’s a 2nd floor walk up over a cafe but to our surprise super quiet. Place was clean and trendy. Beds were super comfortable and linens were really great.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jake’s place was clean and well equipped. We’re bummed we didn’t get to try the restaurant below, but will have to do it next time."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great space for a small group. The unit was very clean and comfortable. Restaurant and activity recommendations were a nice touch.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We loved our stay. Wish it could have been longer. Very nicely decorated and stocked. Jake was very responsive.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay!
We all enjoyed our home away from home this past weekend- and mentioned “how great the place was” many times during our stay. The weather didn’t cooperate with us as we hoped so we couldn’t do a little bit of exploring around the neighbourhood. The only thing I would mention is the stairs up to the Airbnb are a bit steep- so if you have mobility issues perhaps not the best choice for you. But hands down for us the place was superb 😊"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location ! Our stay was very pleasant and had everything we needed for the weekend.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Lovely place and responsive hosts.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, good local recommendations, and the home was very nice"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Jake’s place. The three bedrooms were perfect for the four of us. The atmosphere was Nordic and calming. The kitchen worked out just great for an Easter brunch. It is right on a walking/bike path. The location wasn’t far from UMD or Canal Park and on the way up the North Shore. We would definitely stay here in the future.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great space for us to stay with our babies. The apartment is very nicely decorated and suited our needs well. The only downside for us was the big flight of stairs to get into the apartment but that was only a challenge for us because we had two babies and all of their gear. We stayed during the transition from New London Cafe to whatever restaurant will be moving in and I imagine having a place to eat right downstairs would be very nice.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The New London Loft was a great find and exactly what we were looking for a mid-week getaway. The space is bright + airy and in a relatively quiet part of the city, just down from Glensheen and the other beautiful lakefront mansions. But also only 10 mins from the heart of Duluth and a few blocks off of Lake Superior. It's sparingly, but thoughtfully furnished and outfitted. And the wood-burning fireplace was especially nice during a late March snowstorm. Definitely recommended if you're visiting Duluth and don't need to be in the middle of everything."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Cute, clean and spacious for our family of 5.
A few things which we felt lacked the attention to detail to warrant a 5 star review: No kitchen hand towels at all - just paper towels provided - luckily I had brought a couple because when we wanted to wash dishes we needed them. Note, no dish rack or dishwasher either. Kitchen vent no suction (we tested with a tissue) slight smoke from the oven or hot shower activates the smoke alarm. No top sheets on beds which I found odd for MN. I’ve never seen anything like it and it felt odd. Record player broken. They offered to fix but we declined as it wasn’t a huge deal but would have been nice. They sell local ice cream in the freezer but no ice cream scoop provided. We were only here 2 nights and it was great in many ways with high quality dish ware, coffee provided, ease of access and nice bathroom however it doesn’t seem fully baked because of the issues above."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Thanks
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"A lovely place that felt bigger than what I imagined from the photos! It was just two of us for one night, but I would happily return for a longer stay with friends or family. Check-in/check out was a breeze, and the guide book was full of great recommendations. Location was great for spending time in Duluth or as a landing pad for trips further north. Looking forward to returning for a visit after the new cafe opens below!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute apartment unit - unfortunately the cafe downstairs closed! There were great dining recommendations for us on the table and the location has very easy access to either downtown Duluth or the North Shore.
Curtains on the living room windows would have been nice but otherwise it’s a cute and private space."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful spot, located right on a main thoroughfare (not too loud at all though!) so it was easy to find. Clean and cute, this worked out just perfectly for our needs.
We were only there for a night, but our hosts provided a list of local attractions that all looked incredible too. We’d highly recommend visiting!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Went hiking around lake superior and this was a perfect place for us.
Clean, beautiful and home-y.
10/10.
Do bring your blindfolds if you intend to sleep in as the blinds do not completely block the sunlight. but otherwise totally 10/10 and would gladly visit again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome apartment. Clean and easy check-in. No complaints!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cute and comfy place to stay. We were quite disappointed with having to take cold showers our first morning. I did call the owner and didn’t receive a response for a few hours. However I did get ahold of the property manager which was very responsive and apologized profusely. Jake did get back to me late morning and quickly got a plumber out to fix the problem. I was very grateful for such a quick solution and hot showers the next morning. All around a great location close to everything and very comfortable with all amenities. The beds are all memory form, pretty comfortable for a single night or two. I would most definitely go back!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay for 5 people! Very clean. Nicely decorated and had everything we needed in kitchen. Street parking directly outside of door was convenient. Purchased firewood just down the street to have a lovely evening fire in the fireplace. Steep stairway to get up to the unit might be a challenge for some, but was no problem for us."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Have to agree with other reviews saying the New London Loft was somehow even better in-person than in the pictures. Great historic character with the essentials. Taylor was very kind and responsive--fantastic stay overall!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We all were very comfortable and relaxed, the space was decorated simply and beautiful. The fireplace was warm and cozy as was the whole place.
I would recommend and stay here again.
Thank you"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a really nice stay at the New London Loft. Good location above the New London Cafe and close to restaurants, grocery, and about 10 min drive to Canal Park area. The space is nicely decorated, and beds were comfortable. Good natural light. Took awhile to get hot water in the sink and shower. Music at the cafe below starts up at 7:45am so be aware if you are planning to sleep in (highly recommend the food/coffee at the cafe though). Overall, a very nice space and good value."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,The New London Loft is a gorgeous place to hang your hat; wish we could have stayed longer! The space is meticulously cleaned and comfortable. Being above the New London Cafe is a bonus as breakfast in the morning is a great bonus!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved this space. It was very comfortable and convenient. Would definitely stay here again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was fun to stay above the cafe. This is a great launch point for north shore and Duluth activities.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Having the cafe on the first floor it’s a plus! (Great food)
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed at New London loft and had a perfect time! I highly recommend this place and location for anyone looking for a wonderful Duluth adventure!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was pristine and cozy. Had issue with key pad that was quickly corrected via text. Wonderful place to stay! Would definitively stay again.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"This rental was exactly like the photos! Spotless, beautiful, and spacious. The neighborhood was quiet and we were able to see ships on the lake from the front windows. Also recommend the delicious cafe downstairs - the best breakfast and latte I’ve had in awhile! Jake and his team were accommodating and responded to my questions within hours at max. I’d definitely recommend staying here, and have added this to my list of favorites."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay at the New London Loft! What a beautiful and comfortable gem! Very responsive hosts and gorgeous space. Ample space for 5 of us and the whole place is lovely with well thought out detail, down to the cozy nightstand lamps in each bedroom. Beautiful wood burning fireplace, and wasn’t ready to leave at end of the weekend! Great location, close to so much, wonderful home base for us as we were in town for a weekend of ski racing for our daughter. So nice to retire to at end of the day, and many nice amenities. Would love to stay here again in the future and highly recommend!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic stay! Will be back.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was fantastic! Great location and great hosts. They were super communicative and made sure everything was just right. Great stay!

2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We loved this charming place
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The loft was extraordinary. Beautiful space. Craftsmanship in the home updates, beautiful design choices, exceptionally clean, outstanding bedding, beds, pillows, lighting, and storage. Beautiful signature kitchen table. Beautiful windows. Bright, open, still private. Bathroom very nice size. Love all the hooks! Very nice to grab coffee in the kitchen and then access to very close restaurant. We liked the idea for the host items, all optional. Very responsive host. Thank you for a lovely stay. We enjoyed exploring Duluth a bit! All the best, Marge T."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful space with extremely comfortable accommodations and located right above a cafe with great food and drinks.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Place was as described and very spacious. The place had all necessary amenities and check-in/check-out was easy. Very reasonable check out list and close to shops, restaurants and highway. Also reasonably priced compared to other places for the amount of space."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a find—the building is adorable, the cafe on the first floor is fantastic, and the upstairs apartment is beautiful. We loved our stay and want to come back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Jake was a great host! Extremely responsive and the bnb itself was exactly as pictured - very cute and we loved the decor! We felt right at home for our stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a quick stay here but it was so nice! We cooked a tasty family meal for dinner in the beautiful kitchen, and in the morning got to pop right downstairs for a delicious breakfast! There is a great walking path right across the street and this place is nestled in a quaint part of Duluth with lots of local shops nearby. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,We stayed at Jakes place as a way to get family together at the north shore. Location was perfect for what we had planned.

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"New London Loft was a beautiful and convenient place to stay. The space is beautiful and feels cozy, with the wooden fireplace and comfortable furniture. It was perfect for our group to spend time up the North Shore and in more central Duluth with easy access to the main roads while being quiet. The cafe downstairs is also a lovely place to grab a morning coffee!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay. The space was so clean and comfortable. It was the perfect place to unwind after traveling. The beds were super comfy as well. Wish we had time to stay longer!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect spot— we had three in our group in Duluth for business, so the three bedrooms and spacious living area was really really ideal.
Clean, modern, cozy, and quiet.
Great value for a larger group (three separate beds needed).
Coffee was great too!
Parking and entry easy."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Jake was a great host! This is a great spot about 10min drive from the main downtown area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at the New London Loft - lots of natural sunlight, right on top of the cafe for brunch, and close to all the nature Duluth has to offer.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great stay and looking forward to staying again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of those places that is some how even cuter then the pictures! We were so happy to find such a prefect space last minute to do a little work remote/ fall sight seeing trip mid week.
The location is kind of really prefect, just North of downtown on the quiet end of Superior street, so you're already well on your way to head up the shore exploring or just a few minutes from downtown and Canel park. also just minutes away from beautiful rivers and trails right in Duluth.
The updates to the space are beautiful and well though out. Kitchen is well stocked if you want to cook. Or if you're more interested and getting out and seeing Duluth, Jake has great recommendations on hand for you. The beds are comfortable. The bathroom feels like you're at a spa. Being right above a lovely morning to midday cafe was also such a great perk.
I would love to stay again and will tell all my friends about this little gem."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Great spot! Clean and convenient.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fabulous apartment. Just as gorgeous as the pictures. This apartment was immaculate. This host has thought of everything…including recommendations for local restaurants, breweries and activities. I would definitely stay here again. 10 out of 10."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I would say this was the best place I've stayed in Duluth. It was clean, well appointed, and very tastefully decorated. Most of all for me it didn't smell of chemical air freshener and the linens were washed in unscented detergent. The place smelled great and was extremely clean, open, and spacious."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, cute, loft apartment in a quiet neighborhood just a short 10 minute car trip to downtown Duluth. We loved the decor and the wood burning fireplace added a nice touch on the chilly evenings. We also really enjoyed the record player and wide selection of music that was provided. Overall, a wonderful experience and we would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great view! Great house!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay, and Meredith was a wonderful host."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Meredith's place was the perfect place for our family to spend the weekend in Duluth. The house was clean and cozy. Evenings in the wood-burning sauna complete with dips in Lake Superior on the private beach were a highlight.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Not too far from Duluths main attractions and beautiful home with amazing views. Great host as well.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Could absolutely relax . Would definitely come back . Being right on the water with in steps and the sauna. We had 6 adults and there was a place for everyone to relax and space .
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cool space! Located behind the main mansion with a very easy check in. The space is large and very clean. Host was quick to respond and very accommodating. A quick drive to canal park and the bath was so lovely to relax in! Highly recommend!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay here was very relaxing! My boyfriend and I did a little birthday getaway in Duluth and this was the perfect choice for us. Tracy’s home was a short drive to lots of great restaurants and other things to do. The home was very cute, far away from other homes where it felt super private, clean, and cozy :) the hot tub was the perfect touch to add to a peaceful weekend getaway! I ran into a minor issue, but Tracy was impressively quick to respond and troubleshoot. I highly recommend this as an option for a private, rejuvenating getaway. Thank you Tracy for an unforgettable stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Over all the place was a great stay! Not a far drive from where you need to get to more north or into Duluth. Wish the shower had some shelving or hooks in the shower. We enjoyed the games and the hot tub too!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The hot tub is perfect for cool weather!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was better than the photos! Thoughtfully laid out and carefully maintained.

Thank you for a wonderful stay, we will definitely be back :)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy was a very accommodating host, allowing us to book an additional night at the airbnb kind of last minute. We were so happy we did! Such a cute little spot not too far from plenty of attractions in Duluth, and a short 40 minute drive up the north shore for hiking with beautiful views."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! Easily drivable to city amenities but felt very private at the same time. Cannot recommend this more.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Slept well
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely STUNNING! My boyfriend and I came up here for an anniversary and we could not have asked for a better place to stay. The building was gorgeous and cozy and had everything that you could need. We LOVED using the hot tub, it was perfect for the cold nights. The bed and couch were comfy, and the loft was very cozy, even though it was a squeeze to get into. We felt so relaxed up here, and would 1000% come back!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay - Tracy was extremely responsive, the place had numerous extra amenities, and it was very cute and clean. Great location outside of town but within a quick drive."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this stay! It felt private and secluded, and it only took us about 15 minutes to drive into canal park. The hot tub was a huge bonus as well, especially in the cold winter weather. We would 100% stay again :)"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn’t have had a better stay!! Tracy was so easy to work with. Responsive, respectful, and professional. She is a very considerate host - there was not one thing she didn’t think of for her guests. The place was beautiful, cozy, and perfectly located. I loved my stay!! I am already planning my next trip back here - this may become a regular getaway location for me. Very impressed!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had everything you could need and Tracy was just text away!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It was a great little get away. The in floor heat was awesome for the colder weather, hot tub was great to relax after a long day. There is anything that Tracy didn't think of to make it a nice stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is so cozy and secluded. We loved the hot tub. Kitchen and bathroom well stocked with anything you may have forgotten. Would definitely recommend!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place. Such a relaxing and cool aesthetic. Pretty neat to look at how everything was put together. The heated floors kept the place nice and cozy warm. The view of the trees outside all of the windows made it feel nice and secluded. Hot tub was perfect temperature and one of my favorite parts of the Airbnb. Was 15 mins to Bentleyville lights and also nice and close to so many great falls, parks, beaches, and lookouts! Would definitely recommend! I had an amazing stay"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy and her property were great! Tracy was so responsive. My favorite part of the property was the hot tub, it was so relaxing after a long evening of traveling. Definitely recommend this property!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful and stunning little paradise away from home. Looks like the pictures, very peaceful and was an absolute delight staying here.
Would highly recommend.
Thanks Tracy for being such an amazing host."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tracy’s place was clean and organized and so cozy. The hot tub was clean and felt great during our very cold stay. Great place for a little getaway from the cities.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place and location!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,LOVED!!! What an amazing & peaceful retreat!! Hot tub a big plus!! Clean and just amazing decor. Super kind and helpful host (Tracy). We hope to be back!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an excellent place to stay. There were 4 of us and we all loved the place. I highly recommend staying here. The small things matter and Tracy had everything covered.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful little getaway. Tracy was super responsive and direct with any questions I may have had. A beautiful and unique little spot away from most things - occasionally a car does go down the road but it’s not bad at all. Bathroom is a little bit smaller than I expected but this place over delivered on most other fronts. Had more amenities and little features than I expected. This may have just been us also, but me and my fiancée didn’t sleep well. Either too cold or burning hot, especially with heat in the loft bed. So my sleeping experience wasn’t great but I don’t think that’s any fault of Tracy. Everything else was fantastic though. Loved our little getaway here, so close to a lot of amazing landmarks and state parks too!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect private getaway spot. Hot tub was awesome. Tracy was quick to respond when I asked a question while at our stay. Would highly recommend and will stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, modern space with a great location for spending time along the north shore/Duluth! Would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thoroughly enjoyed my few days at Tracy’s place! She has thought of everything from extra blankets and towels to yoga mats. It’s in a beautiful private setting but not too far from fun. I would stay here again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Private and quiet. House was clean and as pictured in photos. Would stay here again!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved the space. Loft is best for young blood, but worth squeezing into for the location!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay tucked away outside of Duluth. Hot tub and fire pit were a nice bonus to enjoy time outside. Good launching off point for the north shore if that’s what your trip will entail.
Tracy was very responsive when we had a brief moment without power and offered to bring us a generator if we needed. Very responsive host. Wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful setting. Would go back in a heartbeat.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location and a nice stay. We loved the outdoor space. The loft was very difficult to get to though.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this stay was absolutely perfect. The location felt secluded but was still close to everything that you would need. The property was clean and inviting. Tracy was so helpful and responsive. 10/10 stay and I will absolutely be back.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as marketed by Tracy, much said in this simple statement! Hot tub is huge, new outdoor grill is huge, location to Duluth is so convenient, and the place is completely appointed so you need nothing. We do Airbnb often and there's always something missing or a wrong turn, missing information or worse too much information - not in this case.
This is not your typical rental, so be aware to read all the detail to ensure it fits your needs. We chose it because it's not typical - it's funky, cute, creative, basically a 2.5 car garage designed and built not as a garage, but as a 2nd home and it's so well designed that the space is large, open, and comforting as a modern design home.
Hosts are a 6 star out of 5 and this matters! TY, Tracy! Greg and Wei"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"we loved our stay at the SHOME. very clean , private space. My family enjoyed the hot tub . we would definitely stay again!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful experience! It was clean, had all the things that we would have needed and then some— Tracy truly thought of everything, from the comfiest linens and blankets, to comfy beds and dishes, cute coffee cups, the Keurig to the native brand shower products, face masks and makeup remover wipes. The hot tub was amazing as was the fire pit. It was such a cute, secluded but accessible area. Would 10/10 definitely come back here!! You won’t regret staying here!!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I think this was a lovely spot! The space itself is very nice, especially the heated floors. Those would be nice in the cold winter! This weekend, it got a little warm and took awhile to cool down. Other than that, we loved coming back to a hot tub and shows after a long day in downtown Duluth!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful Airbnb!! Very stylish and trendy! Hot tub and fire pit were a fantastic bonus! I would note that the bed on the main floor is pretty uncomfortable, but other than that a fantastic stay!"

The bed was a little firm for our personal preference but comfortable nonetheless. The hot tub was a huge draw and a relaxing addition to our time there. Highly recommend."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect spot for a girls long weekend! There were three of us and we had plenty of space.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tracy went above and beyond to make everything a special stay for my family. I would 120% recommend and will be back again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location! Perfect for a couple visiting for a long weekend. Easy to find, check in, and park. Walking distance to coffee, shops, breweries, food, and more. A quick 5 minute or less drive to canal park."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darling apartment, great location!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A darling, small apartment. It was very clean and has everything you need. The location is great, close to several good restaurants and shops."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect spot to walk and enjoy Lincoln Park. We were able to use one of the available parking spaces which made it much easier for getting in and out. The layout off the unit was well thought out and we felt right at home the second that we walked in. We have already marked this spot down to stay in in future visits to Duluth.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve stayed here twice now and it continues to be our top pick in the Duluth area! Not only do we love the location, but we love the space too - extremely comfortable and clean."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with nice restaurants and breweries! The place was very cozy, private and relaxing for a couples weekend away, would highly recommend for others.😊"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay and everything was exactly as described. Wonderful location with amazing restaurants, shops and extremely walkable.
Easy access to building, units and onsite parking was perfect. Thirteen Main thought of every detail for a perfect weekend stay in Duluth.
Loved the units and shopping at Thirteen Main for holiday gifts too!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great and the place was beautiful. Nice touches with the soaps, plants, record player and fresh ground coffee. Steps away from local coffee shops, yummy food and other shopping. Highly recommend checking out OMC smokehouse! The pork belly lettuce wraps were amazing and their spicy margaritas. Parking was limited, but it wasn’t hard to find a spot near by. We have an EV, and there is a charging station right behind the ice cream shop across the street. Charging is free, you just need to pay $2 per hour for parking! Highly recommend this place!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was so perfect for our getaway! So clean and simple with thoughtful amenities. Everything was as described.
The location is in a great neighborhood with OMC smokehouse two doors down and a great coffee/breakfast/lunch spot next door at the Folk School. Less than a five min drive to Downtown Duluth and the Lake. We will absolutely be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice apartment! Very clean and comfortable. Very quiet and we appreciated the parking spot. Several restaurants nearby. Host was extremely helpful and responsive.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall it was a great stay, such a cute little apartment, with great local restaurant and brewery’s, as well as not far from the canal park if you wanted to explore Duluth more. A little harder to find, if you are not use to the area. Pictures did help, with what the outside of the building looked like. I would recommend if you can check in when it is light out, it is much easier to find!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"At the end of a long day staffing a convention, all I wanted was a hot bath, drinking water, and a comfortable/clean bed with nice pillows; this Airbnb had it all - completely! The next morning, I enjoyed learning a new way of making coffee while relaxing to music played by a record. The access was easy. It was dark when I arrived, so I especially appreciated that there was a light left on in the room - so that I could look it and actually recognize it with a photo that was displayed in the online listing. So cute, so clean, and the perfect location in relation to some wonderful cafes and stores. Thank you to the host!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute place located in the heart of Lincoln Park.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely. Perfect for a couples getaway weekend. Clean, comfy, everything you need with thoughtful touches (coffee and creamer!)."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best location, right in the middle of the Lincoln Park arts district. Super walkable with tons of different places nearby. The unit was just the right size for one or two people. Quiet, super clean, beautifully appointed. The owners care and had clear intentions with the unit. Highly recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay here! The Airbnb is just like the pictures and styled so cute, with great additions like little Minnesota ice cubes and a record player that made it feel like an up north staycation! Great location, near lots of restaurants and bars. Had to Uber to get to Canal Park/ the water, but never spent more than $8 to get there. Free parking was also always available behind the building.
Would 100% return here for our next trip north!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about 13Main!
Off-street parking, keyless entry, beautiful, clean & quiet apartment with everything we needed for a lovely long weekend in Duluth!
The location in Lincoln Park couldn't have been better - steps from restaurants, coffeeshops, breweries and local boutiques.
Nicole & Max were amazing hosts, and 13Main offers the perfect place to stay in a vibrant up & coming part of Duluth with lots to discover, and if you're wanting the more traditional Canal Park tourist part of Duluth, it's only 2 miles away.
We would definitely stay there again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay! Spacious and clean
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was very cute and clean. Reasonably priced. The host was very responsive. Would stay again!

Best cocktails and food in Duluth. There was a live music concert around the corner. It is above an beautiful home decor shop. The host is wonderful. Highly recommend staying here. We loved this place !"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely a wonderful place to stay—we stayed 3 nights with a one year old. So clean and beautifully decorated, comfortable and quiet. Was so nice of the host to drop off gifts every day!!! We received a bouquet of fresh flowers, a record for the turn table, complementary coffee and tea, soy candle and matches. Host was ultra responsive and so quick to answer questions about parking, ect. Will return!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect spot for a weekend getaway! The space was extremely quiet and comfortable, and the location can’t be beat - walkable to all of our favorite shops, restaurants and breweries in Duluth. Although we were initially a bit worried about the parking situation given how busy this part of town can be, we ended up having no trouble finding street parking when needed. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,fantastic space located right in the heart of the Lincoln Park craft district. a ton of fantastic restaurants and shops within a few minutes walk. excellent communication from host and lovely space. looking forward to staying here again in the future.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely stay there again! Loved the little details, made me feel at home and relaxed, and I genuinely enjoyed my time hanging out there.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place to disconnect and relax
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Shari & Dave were friendly and accommodating hosts. This treehouse was a unique & secluded place to enjoy the great outdoors. There was a beautiful fire pit to sit around and it was close to state parks and hiking areas.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The treehouse was an amazing place to stay and the area is beautiful.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay at The ReTreet House was peaceful and cozy! We flexed due to rainy weather , but the fire pit and wood walks would be a fun option! The outhouse is the nicest we have ever used!
Showers at the club were easy and nice too! We had everything we needed for a weekend stay in the woods! Great hosts too!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,absolutely beautiful! perfect for a weekend getaway but wish we would have planned to stay longer.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have come to the ReTreet House twice now in the past 4 months. Both times it has been perfection, cant say enough good things. Very warm and accommodating hosts and the privacy and beauty of this little gem along the north shore is unmatched!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David and Shari are wonderful and communicative hosts, and the ReTreet House was a lovely place to stay! It was clean, warm, and very comfortable. Even the outhouse was cute, and very clean. The ReTreet House is by the North Shore and just a few minutes outside of downtown Two Harbors, so it's a great place to stay while hiking and exploring the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the ReTreet House for my 30th birthday weekend and had an amazing time! It was so cozy and quiet and a great break from the city. Dave and Shari really went above and beyond and had everything we needed and more: a campfire starter kit, a bluetooth speaker that doubled as a flickering candle, and even a heated toilet seat in the outhouse! We also asked where some good hiking spots were and Shari gave us several options with great directions. We ended up hiking on a stretch of the Superior Hiking Trail near Castle Danger and it was beautiful. Also how cool is it that we can say we've stayed in a treehouse?! Would definitely recommend the ReTreet House and hope we can visit again someday!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it was so beautiful and fun!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful spot to relax and be in the trees, yet close to good parks and trails, too. Grateful for the memorable stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dave & Shari were great hosts! Listing is very accurate and check-in instructions were detailed. Dave & Shari even provided local recommendations and a birthday gift for my husband! The tree house was simply stunning. I will say that it was a little closer to the host’s home than expected, but we still felt secluded. Would definitely recommend."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,David and Shari were great hosts. Very responsive and thoughtful! The tree house was in the country side and was a an amazing getaway. Lots of cool wildlife on site. Deer were in the yard as we pulled in and birds and squirrels all around. Perfect location for visiting Duluth as you are in between Duluth and gooseberry and all of the hiking and sites to see up north. 10/10 me and my fiancé loved every bit of the stay
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn’t recommend this location more! This stay was an incredible, memorable, and unique experience. David and Shari go above and beyond just providing a place to stay with everything you could need to spend an adventurous and stress free time in a one of a kind upscaled treehouse🌲🏡 A location that I will remember for a long time and a must for anyone looking for a wonderful experience!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved staying here for the second time!! There is always something to explore in Two Harbors! The ReTreet house is definitely a nature lovers getaway 🤍
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a perfect location, and very private feeling. Just a lovely place to get away to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. It was just as described and David and Shari’s were so hospitable. The out house was also amazing. So grateful for a heated outhouse AND heated toilet seat. Thanks for everything!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place that met our needs well! Wether you’re just needing a place to crash or want to relax & unwind for a while, this place is great.
We admittedly didn’t spend much of our days inside & opted to explore the trails/Duluth. “Outhouse” was comfortable & warm, 1/2 kitchen is more than enough for heating things up or making a simple dinner.
Check it out, I’m sure you’ll love it."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The ReTreet was exactly what my mom & I were looking for in a quaint, secluded, yet updated tree house! Super close to everything on the North Shore!! Very clean- even the outhouse! The hosts have truly thought of everything to make the “treehouse” experience perfect!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a TREET to find this slice of North Shore paradise! Absolutely loved our stay… the Treehouse is so comfy and cozy. David and Shari have really thought of everything you need and they’ve paid attention to small details that make a big difference! (All kitchen supplies provided, firewood and fire starting materials, outhouse accommodations, body wipes for guests, and so much more.) The bed was phenomenal and the outhouse, wow… best I’ve ever seen. The location is close enough to go on day trips to some great spots nearby like Split Rock and Gooseberry (and Shari was really kind to share recommendations when I asked). I loved the peaceful wooded setting and could have sat outside all night by the fire! Would highly recommend and would definitely book again. Thanks, David & Shari!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the ReTreat! We wish we had more time just to sit in the upper level amongst the cedars and birds. Had five deer walk right below us while we were having coffee. A great place to sit and read. Lots of really nice small touches all over. Super comfy bed.
We’ll definitely come back!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay very much. Lovely treehouse, well appointed with amenities and thoughtfully furnished. Super cozy and comfortable!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,I will definitely be staying here again. Was just absolutely perfect!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is really a unique property. We are a family of four and stayed. If felt like really elevated glamping with the outhouse but also comfy beds and a tv. The two spaces are connected by an outside staircase which I hadn’t realized, but was fine. The space was clean with a lot of details that showed thoughtfulness. We really enjoyed our stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place definitely is a treehouse worth staying at! Plenty of nature surrounding the place. Birds were fun to watch. The place offered comforts of home even though there wasn’t any running water but that’s part of being out in the nature. Top notch place to stay We came to see fall colors! So the location was perfect for us! Close to local dining and shopping. Hope you get a chance to enjoy this place yourselves someday 😊
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful spot that was very clean and organized. We loved watching the birds at the bird feeder every morning.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The ReTreet House was the perfect place to spend a few days! This cozy cabin is in a great location, easy to access and close to all the sights further up the shore. David and Shari have anticipated your every need, including a free hot shower nearby! The living room nestled in the trees was a great place to enjoy coffee while watching the birds at the feeder, the bed was heaven after a long day hiking, and the outhouse was pristine. We'll definitely be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay here!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place! Very convenient yet private. The “living room” level has a great porch with a bird feeder. Truly a great find.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying at the Retreet house! It was a peaceful place and we were able to see lots of wildlife from the deck on the second level. David and Shari were wonderful hosts and it was easy to communicate with them. We had everything that we needed and the tree house was very clean. The outhouse was well made and all easy to use. Additionally, it worked really well to shower at the gym.
I highly recommend that you stay in the tree house if you are looking for accommodation near Two harbors or Duluth! We will definitely come back to the Retreet house if we are ever in the area again :)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I came across this listing by complete accident and was fortunate to be able to get 3 dates booked! This was such a great spot.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The ReTreet House was exactly what my wife and I were looking for to celebrate our anniversary. Shari and David were so nice and accommodating.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely love David and Shari's place at the ReTreet!! Such a cozy place to get away and see the North Shore! Very close to the main part of Two Harbors so it's close to pretty much anything you'd want to do. The place itself is very peaceful and they thought of everything you'd need there! I'd highly recommend to anyone and have recommended it to others!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had an exceptional stay.
The woods are peaceful, and deeply relaxing.
Overall, the whole space is extremely well thought through given the limitations of the tree house.
If you want to visit Two Harbors and the North Shore, I highly recommend this spot for a cabin experience."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really loved this unique space! Dave and Shari communicated very well, and everything was as expected when we arrived.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My 3rd time staying here!
After a weekend with a friend, I knew I had to bring my family.
We’ve visited both in April and Aug taking advantage of nearby seasonal attractions (dog-sledding, kayaking).
The list of local restaurants days/times was very helpful, as we brought it along during our sightseeing to coordinate our meals.
I’d almost forgotten how peaceful it is at the Treehouse. A most relaxing retreat 💜"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Picture-perfect weekend. Beautiful property, wonderful hosts. Hope to be back soon!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The ReTreet House is fantastic! If you are looking for a relaxing getaway in the north woods, this is the place. The ReTreet House is extremely clean, very private, and offers amazing views. The lack of running water was not an issue at all. There is a hot and cold water dispenser available in the house, and the outhouse is the cleanest outhouse ever. We utilized the showers at Bodies and Balance, which was easy and just a short drive away. David and Shari are excellent hosts. We ended up getting 15 inches of snow during our stay, and David had the road plowed quickly. Overall, the ReTreet House is great, and we hope to stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend this location for anyone looking for a quiet and peaceful getaway! David & Shari were great hosts and everything was laid out so nicely!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at the ReTreethouse in Two Harbors during our trip to the North Shore to follow the Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon! It was the perfect spot to rest for a couple of nights and warm up and feel at home after hours of -20°F temps on the trail. I wish I could’ve stayed longer to explore more of the property, but the chickadees were a real delight. I also so red squirrels, deer, and heard a great horned owl in the evening. Truly a stunning place for a getaway to the shore!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Relaxing and close to many things on the North Shore. Highly recommend!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly a peaceful getaway. We visited the ReTreet House in January and it was comfortably warm with all the views you could ask for. We were tucked back into the woods, but still 5 mins from town. We loved this hidden little gem so much we already booked it again for our anniversary. David and Shari were absolutely wonderful. This place is a hiker’s paradise and nature lovers dream. In the heart of the North Shore, the ReTreet House is home 🤍"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a tranquil place to stay. We were there during snowfall and it was so peaceful. We stayed warm and cozy, even with the outside bathroom facilities. My 5 year old enjoyed a little bit of sledding while we had a fire. It snowed overnight and they made sure that we were able to get out if we needed to. Great communication! We didn’t need anything during our stay but i have no doubt that they would have helped us."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! We enjoyed our visit in this wonderful place! Would highly recommend!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent base for exploring the north shore! The building is essentially a an elevated two story tree house - the top floor is the kitchenette/sitting area, the first floor is the bedroom, and at the ground level is a well protected wood pile for the fire pit. Filtered water is provided in the kitchenette, a tidy outhouse is a few steps away from the house. Note that there are a lot of stairs. Everything is well constructed, with careful attention to detail. Cozy decor, well-stocked. ReTreet had everything I needed for a much needed getaway."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Retreet house was a gem! Very clean and cozy. The deck was a great place to view wildlife. We would definitely stay here again!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Good spot to explore the North Shore, about midway between Duluth and some of the attractions like Gooseberry Falls."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one of the best air b&bs I’ve ever stayed in for the price what you are getting here is incredible. A secluded house in the woods all to yourself is a great way to spend any weekend and Duluth and splitrock lighthouse are both a short drive away!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Glamping at it's best. Cozy, comfortable, convenient. Shari and David are terrific hosts."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! David and Shari are communicative, they have a clean place, and it was so cool! We loved going ""camping"" but having the comforts of indoors."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique experience. I mean it, twas an adult treehouse adventure with a good number of the extra stuff an adult might want/need in a treehouse."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for glamping
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property and cute little treehouse in the woods! It was the perfect location to explore the north shore!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to find with owners directions, less than 5 mins from Two Harbors. Perfect place to stay if you want to be close to Duluth but also Gooseberry Falls, Split Rock lighthouse and Two Harbors! Very clean and had a nice place to have a fire. The bed room and kitchen area are completely separate levels/rooms but was not an issue for us. Would recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Terrific stay! We were a little nervous about the outhouse but this is the world’s fanciest outhouse — super lovely. We had a terrific time — 5 stars!!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful stay for a weekend getaway

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The ReTreet House is a cozy haven and a great location to explore the North Shore. ☺️
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just the cozy quiet stay we needed! Close to town but tucked away. This spot is extra special. Clean, thoughtfully prepared, and almost a tree house. It was so cool to sit on the upper level with coffee and a book and watch the chickadees and red squirrels hop around. Comfy bed too!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing Airbnb! This was such a unique and memorable stay that really added to our trip. Very clean and great location as well to shops and hiking. The host’s are very helpful and give very clear instructions. Overall such a cool experience that I would recommend!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just perfect. The attention to detail was incredible. The views were unmatched. What a cozy stay.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Simply amazing. We loved watching the birds at the bird feeder, catching a glimpse of Lake Superior from the deck, and cuddling up while the snow fell. The outhouse was clean and warm. It was just a short drive to all the restaurants and hikes we wanted!
I definitely recommend staying at the ReTreet House!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,WHAT A GREAT PLACE!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The retreat house was absolutely wonderful! Total visual seclusion, and the only noises we could hear from the house were the rustling trees and the chickadees. David and Shari had the house completely stocked for whatever we may have needed. With the luxurious ""outhouse"" setup, and bubbler inside, i forgot on multiple occasions that we didn't have running water. Was a fantastic stay, and we would love to return!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful and unique place to stay. You are truly up in the tree tops with the birds. Amazing views!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Paradise in the cutest and most functional treehouse ever! Best of both world between comfort and the outdoor experience. So many touches, from small instructions on how to use a USB lantern to the heated seat in the outhouse (with views of the outside)! If you love birds, you'll love the sweet sounds of the black-capped chickadees outside. Pure heaven."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,David and Shari are great host! The property is beautiful and definitely the place to go unwind and relax.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The ReTreet house is nothing short of magical. Don’t be deterred to visit this beautiful place in the winter, it couldn’t be more enchanting. The view of the snow covered trees and Lake Superior in the distance is truly dreamy. The birdies are just as active at the bird feeder and the sun beams right into the space, making for beautiful mornings.
The living space and the bedroom are separate and you have to walk outside to get to each space, but it’s refreshing to do so. The outhouse is only a few steps away and is heated! It’s very clean and warm.
It’s within an hour of multiple state parks that are glorious (and not crowded) in the winter months.
Shari and David were very responsive and helpful with questions I had.
Couldn’t think of a better place to ring in the new year.
I hope to be back soon."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is an absolute gem. The location, vibe, and the host are all top notch.
Things for potential renters:
- The “outhouse” is the farthest thing from primitive. Don’t let it deter you from booking this place. It’s heated, doesn’t smell, and even when it’s cold out it’s so close you can walk over there in shorts no problem.
- bed is extremely comfortable, and the stay was so peaceful.
-the living area is straight out of a hallmark movie.
- I was working remote for two days, and the WiFi was incredibly fast, no issues with Zoom meetings.
- this was a true escape from life when staying here (even when working remote)
- it snowed a couple inches during our stay, and the owners contacted us letting us know they were going to plow the driveway. They absolutely respected privacy. They we’re incredibly nice and definitely think of the little things to ensure your stay is perfect. I will definitely be staying here again in the near future."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If your looking for a great get away in a quiet and beautiful location, look no further!! The retree treehouse is small, yet spacious. Perfect for a couples get away when you need to relax in peace.
David and Shari were more than accommodating! Listing out popular places to eat, setting out how to use the treehouses many accommodations, and more than willing to help if you needed anything.
Would recommend 10/10 times if asked !!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great weekend! David and Shari put extra time to assure our stay was great from having kindling and starter ready to go for the fire with detailed instructions, to plowing our driveway out immediately following a snowstorm to make sure we could get in and out with ease. The bedding and pillows was also extremely comfortable. I would highly recommend experiencing this property!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Simple, beautiful, named appropriately to reconnect & reset."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful and plenty - a lovely and spotless place in the woods with thoughtful attention to detail. Birds, flying squirrels and a turkey blessed our days and nights with one of the best most well-stocked campsites we're experienced. And, don't let the outhouse arrangement hold you back. It is well lit, warm, clean and only a few steps away. Bed is super comfy, there's plenty of water and you'll find everything you need in this modern but woodsy place. Stairs are sturdy and not too many (but they're still stairs) and well-lit for night time trips to the outhouse and the outdoors. Highly recommend!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for nature lovers. Clean and thoughtfully set up.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic MEA break at David and Shari's unique, thoughtful, relaxing setup. You feel like you're sleeping in the trees but you're also five minutes from all amenities. They've thought of EVERYTHING from fire starting supplies right down to the heated seat in the outhouse. The only thing I didn't realize, and I'm sure this was just an oversight on my part, but the bedroom (1st floor) and living space (2nd floor) aren't connected except via an outside staircase. Not a con at all – I just didn't realize this until we got there. The bird feeder provided the most unexpected entertainment and the views of Lake Superior were the best way to wake up. I very highly recommend this stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would recommend very quiet close to everything and very clean
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,David and Shari have a great space they put together for guests! Everything was very organized and well communicated. We more than enjoyed our secluded stay while exploring up north!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay and are looking forward to returning. David and Shari were great to work with, were flexible, and very prompt in communications. The ""tree house"" is warm .and welcoming is well stocked for your stay. We appreciated David and Shari's hospitality and will keep the memory of sitting by the fire beneath a billion stars. Thanks for making our trip up north a great one!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Best Airbnb experience yet!! Arrived to an exceptionally clean space. Woke up to the smell of pine and birds chirping. So many little details were thought of that made the experience even better. Couldn’t have asked for a better stay!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A really nice place tucked away in the woods yet still convenient.
Lots of attention to detail to give people options and feel comfortable during their stay. From fresh coffee to Bluetooth speaker to individual reading lights available and easy options for starting a fire. Even the outhouse was a a comfy experience.
Great communication as well.
Highly recommend!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, wonderful quiet location!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a peaceful place to stay. Very thoughtful and clean accommodations. The nicest outhouse I've ever been in. 10/10 recommend.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Come here to stay! It is the perfect peaceful setting for escaping a busy city life. My wife and I wanted a private place that was close to the things we wanted to do in Two Harbors, and that’s exactly what we got. David and Shari are extremely easy to communicate with, and assist with anything you need. Thank you!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Its an awesome experience in a place nestled in the woods.. Nice for a family weekend getaway
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great experience in Two Harbors! Our hosts were truly tremendous!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the cutest place. It is close to everything, but feels secluded so you get a true retreat feel. The added amenities that they offer are so appreciated and add a great touch. We would definitely recommend and will book again if we stay in the area."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend away at the treehouse. Something different that we both enjoyed! Quiet, peaceful & simple. You can tell so much thought and time was put into it. Everything we needed and more! 🙂"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Retreet House was everything we hoped for and more! The space was well thought out and David and Shari were very accommodating! The Retreet House truly provided a strong sense of peace, tranquility and beauty. We also can’t say enough about how cozy it was. From the living area to the balcony and fire pit, it met all of our needs. We will be back!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place for a getaway up by the North Shore. Extremely clean and well kept. Thoughtful touches throughout made the stay so relaxing. We really enjoyed our weekend!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I loved our stay at the ReTreet! It was so peaceful and calm. The place felt very secluded. Sheri and David thought of everything you could need and a lot of things to accommodate not having running water. Great location; we'd highly recommend!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such an amazing experience to come here for a few days! We loved the smallness of the house and the balcony, as well as the privacy and location of the house. So much to do around the area and was perfect for us."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David and Shari’s ReTreet House was a great getaway and is tucked way back in the woods for total privacy. The house itself was very clean and whenever we had any questions, David and Shari responded within minutes.
We also enjoyed staying here because it is not too far from our favorite place Split Rock Lighthouse and also very close to many other parks.
There were a bunch of gym bros
in the gym, Balanced Bodies, using most of the facilities where you are able to go work out and take a shower just a few minutes away from the house and we went pretty late around 9:30pm which must be a busy time so just keep that in mind!
Lastly, we really appreciated the fire starting materials that were supplied right next to the fire pit which made things easy!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute and clean. There were helpful notes when we got there (info about the rental, restaurants, etc). Gorgeous setting and private"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Shari and David are wonderful hosts. The living area is well equipped with everything needed for cooking. The campfire area is wonderful. We had a great time at the treehouse.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most modern, well built and solid Airbnb treehouse you’ll ever stay at. Wonderful experience. Shari is very responsive and check in and out was a breeze. Two Harbors has a great family oriented brewery and wonderful state parks and hikes are abundant. Watching amazing climbers on the shoreline cliffs of Palisade Head was a highlight. Simply beautiful property and great hosts. Thanks.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute and cozy space to get away from the city and hang out in the trees. Super close to various hikes and adventures but still tucked away enough to feel as though you are camping in the woods. Check out the flying squirrels at the elevated bird feeder and see out to the lake through the treetops! Thank you, Dave and Shari!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to unwind and the cabin has everything you need. I thought the outhouse was a nice touch. Not something you get to experience everyday. Felt like camping with the comfort of a cabin . I would stay here again .
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful space to get away!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect weekend getaway!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cozy and creative space 30 minutes outside of Duluth and in the sweet little town of Two Harbors! Dave and Shari have created a thoughtful experience in building the Retreet House. I hope to go back someday!

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Retreet was a perfect winter getaway. Very modern and cozy and within minutes of popular destinations such as Split Rock Lighthouse and Gooseberry Falls. David and Sheri were wonderful hosts. I highly recommend and will be booking another visit in the future.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The ReTreet is a true hidden gem of the North Shore and such a great place to unplug and escape. Can’t want to come back!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easily accessible location just a short jaunt from Duluth and at the gateway to the North Shore. We loved the thoughtful touches including wildlife feeders, warm drinks and comfortable bedding. The sunrise views were beautiful and a walk through the fresh fallen snow in cedar forest was breathtaking. Highly recommend!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is super unique and in a beautiful location in Two Harbors. The place has everything you need and even has a few extra touches (Bluetooth speaker, reading light, deodorizing body wipes since there’s no shower) that were cool to have. David and Shari were awesome hosts and gave great recommendations for outdoor activities in the winter."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thoughtful details throughout. Very impressed with the ReTreet house and would highly recommend to others. Great location off hwy 61 just outside of Two Harbors. We had perfectly clear skies and a beautiful view of the stars at night. We loved our stay!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is exactly the space we needed to get away from the hustle and bustle of every day craziness! David and Shari’s place was so cozy and private. We enjoyed the recommendations for places in town to grab a bite to eat (since take out is the new norm) and the accommodations they made for us to use shower facilities (since the gyms are closed).
We were close enough to enjoy Duluth as well as traveled North for some scenery and small hiking.
They were super responsive with any questions we had prior to our arrival and check-in and out was made so easy!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Retreet is very cozy and warm, we loved the Christmas lights outside! The beds is very comfy and hosts are very accommodating."

2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Dave and Shari’s place was incredible. Such a nice getaway from the cities!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Please stay here, this is by far one of the best places I have stayed at. My girlfriend and I went up North looking for relaxation in the woods and this offered that and much more. It was sparkling clean besides some dust on the plates but you can rinse that off. The outhouse was heated, very clean, and there was air freshener and hand sanitizer for guests. The tree house is wonderful, there is a separate first floor sleeping room and the bed is so comfortable, so are the pillows. It is also heated. The upstairs, keep in mind you have to walk outside upstairs to get there, has a table, couch, small kitchen area (toaster oven, microwave, hot and cold water for drinking, soap and sponge for cleaning) and is great. We traveled up when Gov. Walz shut down gyms and David and Shari found us another shower accommodation. This place is a must stay, perfect proximity to further North and Duluth."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, unique, with so many thoughtful touches. It seems like David and Shari have thought of everything. Matches, fire starters, and wood for the campfire. Book lights on the bedside tables. The coziest outhouse you could imagine (even when it’s 30 degrees outside)! A bird feeder strung up and filled just off the balcony where we watched chickadees, blue jays, and some daring red squirrels snack. Great WiFi. Great location just minutes from Two Harbors. One of the most delightful Airbnb’s that we’ve ever stayed at."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a truly magical experience. On the last night it snowed and it was a truly magical experience to look across the trees and see the snow falling. The kitchen was small but perfect for a few day trip. Close to two harbors and a great location between Duluth and the state parks along the North Shore. HIGHLY recommend.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, clean, quiet getaway! Will be going back again."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent spot for North Shore adventures. The ReTreet house is built in beautiful harmony with the surrounding environment, and is exceedingly well thought out. A very good value, and well located for North Shore nature tourism."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So cozy! You really feel like you're living up in the trees. Not to mention a great view of lake superior in the distance. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a cozy, romantic getaway along the north shore. There's no shower but the amazing view and arboreal feel make up for it plenty."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, cozy, and cute! Great place to stay to enjoy the North Shore. Close to town and great state parks, and also a great place to hang out and enjoy nature and have a campfire. I would definitely come back."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean and comfortable. A fabulous spot for a weekend to get away from it all!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Retreet House was a great place to relax in the woods! Definitely would recommend!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a little slice of paradise! Super unique place in the woods is the perfect getaway. Even the outhouse was magical (and heated so it didn’t feel like you were in an outhouse at all!). David and Shari were great at communicating and it was a super easy checkin process. Very private too! Loved it and we will definitely be back!!!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay here and hope to visit again! Everything was perfect, all as described, with lots of nice, personal touches added. It was incredibly peaceful and secluded, warm and cozy rooms, even a heated seat in the outhouse! Great place to stay to see the leaves, but probably a great place year round as there is heating and it's so cozy."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fun place to stay! We really enjoyed the private location, the firepit, and the treehouse!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing find and even better than I expected. It made connecting with nature so easy and was to best place to come to recharge. I would recommend to anyone to stay here.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The ReTreet House is uniquely designed and decorated and is located in the beauty of the Northern woods. It is clean and comfortable with all the amenities you need. All you have to do is relax and enjoy yourself!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a perfect retreat to this lovely space. I know this space wouldn't be perfect for everyone because it doesn't have a flushing toilet or shower or stove and there are stairs, but for us, this was a wonderful very much stepped up ""glamping"" experience. The space was incredibly clean, so comfortable, perfectly magical and just right. I stayed with my 5-year old and we spent some time exploring in the woods. We had multiple campfires with marshmallows and our hosts made it extra easy by providing everything we needed at our own fire pit. There's a wonderful deck with some views of Lake Superior. I especially love that the landowners haven't modified the land too much so there was lots of woods right up to the cabin, but plenty of space to turn the car around and have a safe campfire. We were always excited to get back to the cabin after a day of exploring the north shore. This was the fanciest outhouse we've ever experienced, no odors that wafted over to the cabin. We didn't take advantage of the sauna and shower at the fitness center, but I imagine it would be especially nice in the winter. The heaters worked great, but most nights we opened the big window in the bedroom nice and wide so I could hear the wind in the trees. I would highly recommend this lovely space to anyone who can handle a few stairs."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very amazing getaway in a private, secluded area that was very close to Two Harbors! So many thoughtful touches and also very responsive during our stay. Very very impressed and will definitely be back!!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David & Shari’s place was a perfect spot to start our North Shore adventures! A great summer location. A well thought out space that included a movable fire pit complete with tinder and dry wood. Delicious local coffee, too!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay at the ReTreet House! David and Shari were fantastic hosts. We had our two young kids with us - they loved the space and surrounding nature. Thoughtful amenities, excellent, helpful, and quick communication on any questions we had about the house or area, and an overall wonderful stay. We especially loved seeing the hummingbirds off the deck, the chickens wandering over from the main house to say hello, and we had a fun final night bonfire and s’mores. We hope to come back and visit again in the future!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I loved our stay at the ReTreet House! It was even more adorable in person and had a secluded atmosphere - despite being just a short drive in to town! We loved the personal touch that the hosts left and all their great suggestions on what to do in town. I would highly recommend staying here and will be keeping the ReTreet House in my mind when back in the area!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,David and Shari are great hosts. The house was awesome and clean. They were quick to respond to our questions and eager to offer their help. Would definitely recommend their house to friends.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,It was an amazing place to stay
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The retreet house was my first air bnb, and it was great! Great value for the price! You basically get a private house to yourself for what you pay for a hotel! Very secluded/private. David and Shari gave really easy directions to their air bnb, and I didn’t get lost at all-and I’m a professional at getting myself lost! We definitely enjoyed sitting with the windows open and listening to the birds! The humming birds come up to the deck and eat right next to you! It’s really cool!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My fiancé (now husband) and I were looking for somewhere we could escape for our honeymoon without putting too many people at risk due to COVID-19. We picked this spot because the town is somewhat small, the location is private, and we were able to avoid too much contact.
David and Shari are phenomenal and attentive hosts who tended to any need that popped up in a timely manner. They gave us tips for good hiking trails and extra of our favorite supplies.
The forest surrounding the property is rife with wildlife and occasionally David and Shari’s friendly chickens wandered down the hill. The space and surrounding forest are absolutely beautiful, and gave us the amazing, private escape we’d been longing for."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place exceeded our expectations! Everything was taken care of and the hosts were very quick to respond with any questions we had. We will return someday for certain. Just a note in case it isn’t clear to you, the bedroom space and the living space are two separate spaces - there is not an internal stairway between them and you need to use the outside steps to go between them. It’s not a huge issue, but something to be prepared for if you are traveling with kids that may sleep in another room from the adults."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent, everything was exactly how I expected"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The ReTreet House has been our favorite AirBnb stay yet. It was sparkling clean and had everything we could have needed. This was our first visit to the North Shore, and our favorite part about the trip was staying at such a unique place. David and Shari were gracious hosts and we’d love to come back. It was a treat to stay at The ReTreet House!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cozy and unique place to stay along the north shore of Lake Superior.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"wonderful, cozy, and would go again!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is everything in the description and more. Highly recommend
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect getaway spot! Very cozy and nice, every detail was well thought out. Recommended!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the ReTreet House! The upper loft was so cozy and we loved watching the scurry of activity of all the birds, hummingbirds, and chipmunks right on or off the deck, not to mention the pull-out couch bed was the comfiest of its kind I'd ever slept on. Best of all was that the location allowed for packed-full days of hiking along the north shore."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A serene and tranquil space filled with character! Beautifully decorated and so well cared for! Nature and wildlife abound!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stay here! We loved this cabin experience. It's a good value for the north shore. It's very private and the treehouse setup makes you feel like you are part of nature. The space was spotless and the hosts were quick to help us as needed. There is everything you need here, from coffee setup to lots of cute animals."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you so much David and Shari! The girls and I had such a wonderful time staying in your little sanctuary. We could have stayed there for an endless amount of days. Everything was so thoughtfully laid out-Local Duluth roasting coffee, fire starters already made, and everything was extremely accessible. We will be back and I highly recommend this space!! Thanks again :)
Jason and the girls"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"You will not be disappointed. As we came and stayed at this place during the current COVID situation, it was great to get out of the house and go off and stay in the middle of no where. Truly an awesome experience. The hosts are amazing. Very timely on responses, clean environment, accommodating in many way. It was just so awesome!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The treehouse is picturesque and has everything a person could ask for for a nice getaway. It is beautiful and clean as well as cozy. It was the perfect balance of camping and homey.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent place to get away. Upscale camping, with a super cozy bed."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This is such a lovely spot. Private and cozy. Amazing waking up to the treeline views. Minutes from Lake Superior and it's ouftfitted with all you need! David and Shari were so responsive and accomodating. Highly recommend!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place beautiful view and very cozy and clean.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"LOVED staying here!!! So clean, cute and perfect"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay! The unit was clean, comfortable and had all the amenities needed for a great experience."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect cute place to stay. Spacious.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a lovely stay! Quiet luxury! Will return happily
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay S&S's place. And got to enjoy a wonderful meal at their brewery / tap room upon arrival. My trip was a mix of recreation and work, so this spot was perfect for both. Clean, comfortable, well provisioned kitchen, good location for exploring Duluth and surrounding areas, good nearby hiking, and solid WiFi & workspace. I will certainly stay in this place again when I'm back in Duluth."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little apartment space close to downtown with a great brewery next door with amazing food. Fabulous shower! Very clean.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay in Duluth. Big Space. Close and convenient. We probably be back as will have even more family in town in the future.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Sarah and Seth’s Brewtel. Self check-in with a lockbox and keypad were super easy, great food at the brewery, and the bathroom/shower was amazing. Will definitely stay here again!"
2024-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"For context: I stay at Airbnbs every few months for work and pleasure in the US and abroad and have also hosted with 5 star ratings on Airbnbs. I have stayed in many Airbnbs in MN for writing retreats.
I saw the good reviews so I was excited. For the positive: Lester Park was only a little over a mile away. There is also a good coffeeshop, Amity Coffee, down the way. The brewpub is okay too and convenient. Very local vibe.
I was disappointed by the level of noise and traffic on E Superior Street, which is a few feet from the windows of the Airbnb. There were constantly cars zooming past and the windows overlook the road. This was in February, so I can't imagine busier seasons. I had to wear my headphones the whole time and keep the shades closed or the ""view"" is cars passing by. I really wish this had been clearly advertised in the description, but it just said ""quiet."" It is definitely not quiet.
Given the cleaning fee, I was also surprised by the check out expectations."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place. Simple and immaculate. It feels like a ""well managed"" Airbnb."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had such a great time in the apartments! So cute and clean, and a perfect spot for a little getaway ! Wasn’t too far from Canal park area but wasn’t right in a big city either !"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! For a studio, there was a lot of space and it felt very open. The bed was super comfy and they provided plenty of blankets/quilts. Great shower!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We felt right at home at Sarah and Seth’s. The bed was comfortable, the shower was amazing, and I even liked the shampoo and conditioner provided. Highly recommend."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment worked out great for a last-minute getaway in Duluth. It was clean and stylish, and so easy to get to everything I needed and wanted to do in town. The host provided photos and instructions that made check-in clear and easy. Would definitely recommend for a fun couples’ spot or individual retreat!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, great location. Located very near Lester Park for trail running, hiking, cross country skiing, etc. Also near Gabriel's books, Amazing Alonzo and Chester Creek books, all top-notch bookstores in Duluth, easily competitive with anything you'd find in the Twin Cities. Place was clean, has a great shower and kitchen area. Definitely a quiet neighborhood. I'd book again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Seth and Sarah were excellent hosts and provided a convenient, roomy studio apartment (""brewtel"") for a perfect weekend away in Duluth. Everything was easy to find and use, and it's located in a quiet neighborhood close to everything you want to do in Duluth. The brewery is also fantastic - and literally next door to the brewtel. We just happened to arrive on a super cold weekend and we got there late, so the heater had to work hard warming the place (the cold would have given our home a run for the money!), however, the next day it was great and Sarah gave us an additional heater just in case. She was so responsive and helpful. Truly appreciated. Kind and generous hosts who do all they can to provide a great experience - definitely recommend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super nice hosts and really good food at the brewery right next door. The studio was so nice and the kitchen was amazing as well! Great value for the nightly price I would love to visit again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"we really enjoyed our stay at this lil suite ✨
it was very cozy🤍
the children had some toys to play with & it was so well equipped with everything!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A peaceful getaway from the hustle and bustle on the far Eastern edge of Duluth's main strip complete with attached restaurant and brewery, this studio gem has all the necessities for tucking oneself away. Full kitchen; King bed; large and luxurious walk-in-shower; Smart TV; even a washer and dryer to minimize the packing, Sarah and Seth's place at Lake Superior Brewing offers the works. A respite from the maddening crowd? The crowd itself? Or a little of both? The choices are yours."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Clean, looks like the photos, has everything you need and nice extras. We stayed for five nights while getting work done on our house, and this was a comfortable and convenient spot. We loved the easy access to the brewery - great food and beer! Couldn't hear any noise from the brewery or any neighbors during our stay. Will recommend this place to friends and family who visit!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was lovely to be able to stay at Sarah and Seth’s studio. The studio was comfortable & easy-going, yet luxurious for a special weekend getaway. We especially appreciated the wonderful shower, high quality kitchen touches, local coffee beans, comfy bed/linens, and natural touch with provisions. We also really enjoyed treating ourselves to food & drink at the brewery. We definately recommend staying here and would return given the opportunity!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay and the apartment was super cute and clean!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Sarah and Seth’s place. Check-in was easy and the place was lovely and very clean. The place had everything we needed.
The location was great for us, as we spent most of our time hiking.
The brewery next door was a great place to eat and drink. We happened upon really great live music at the brewery that topped off a wonderful day. We highly recommend this place."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Always a great stay at Sarah and Seth’s. This was my second stay there. Make sure to go grab a beer and a bite at Lake Superior Brewing next door!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Couldn’t have asked for a better experience!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I am so pleased with our decision to stay at the Brewtel. The location was great - just a short drive to many local attractions, but quiet and away from the main drag. The connection to the Brewery - GENIUS. We enjoyed beer, took food and growlers back to stay in for the evening. The place was simple in the best way - it felt clean and relaxing but with warm and homey touches. I feel like the hosts thought of great little extras/amenities that were easily available and just very thoughtful. THE SHOWER. I decided to actually wash my hair because I wanted to stay in longer. I don’t have enough good things to say."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and layout!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,We had a wonderful stay! This is a wonderful unit and great location. Sarah was extremely responsive when we needed to extend our stay. We look forward to staying again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay and convenient location! Located in Lakeside, super accessible to Duluth and Two Harbors. Easy instructions, clean and right on point with the description. Also check out next door for Lake Superior Brewpub for great service and excellent craft beers!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! We could not have had a better experience at the Brewtel! Sarah was extremely responsive to my messages. The studio was absolutely perfect for my husband and I. You must try out the beers at Lake Superior brewing….they were all absolutely fantastic. And the food was superb as well. We would definitely stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Brewtel was perfect for my sister and me. Clean, smartly decorated, well stocked kitchen, comfortable bed and so much more. Communication with Sarah and Seth was great. We are looking forward to our next Duluth trip and will definitely stay at the Brewtel. Thanks Sarah and Seth for a great stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great space, Great Location, Great brewery and restaurant right next door. Everything was very clean and well taken care of. A hidden gem for sure.
Will definitely be returning"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was well stocked with dishes, glasses, cookware. Apartment was very clean and easily accessible. Bed was very comfortable. Nice having the. Brewery right next store."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Brewtel is bright, spacious, clean and modern. Loved the supplies in the kitchen and the extra blankets and towels -- plus the shower is amazing! There is plenty of parking and easy access to the studio. There is a bit of street noise and we could occasionally hear the neighbors next door, but it didn't detract from our stay. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! The room was clean as well as private. We did hear some noise from neighbors and the brewery was closed 😕 But nothing the host could control.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the stay!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, great location, great hosts!
Downfalls that I don’t fault the hosts for- the street is very noisy- the windows don’t do a good job of hiding that noise- I live in a city and the noise was still pretty noticeable. Also, the people renting the next door space were very noisy and past quiet hours- again not the hosts fault, but there could be some more direct communication on the expectations- maybe some signs in the collective space that reminds people to be quiet, and some more sound proofing could help tremendously- even better entrance doors that cut that sound. All in all, I really enjoyed my stay- the space was clean, comfortable and the shower was the star of the whole place- very well done!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10 recommend air bnb and their restaurant.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Brewtel was perfect for a weekend away! The pizza and beer next door made for a great end to our day on the north shore!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Perfect for a quick weekend getaway
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised! Great place, super clean, we loved the layout and decor. The shower is an A+! Perfect location for walks, biking and all Duluth, the North Shore has to offer. The restaurant next door is excellent. We will definitely stay there again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn't have asked for a better location! We enjoyed multiple dinners at the brewery and could even walk to the grocery store on the path behind the building. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen fully stocked, and the shower was lovely. There was a bit of a musty smell and moisture in the air until we could get the mini-split AC running, but the diffuser helped and it eventually improved."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in the studio unit that has plenty of space for 2 people. The unit is open concept, a bit industrial yet cozy, and is connected to an awesome brewery and restaurant. We were right on a bike path that brought us to our ride on Scenic Hwy 61, which is how we originally chose it. The unit was clean, the bed was comfy, and the natural light is nice. The busy road out the window is pretty quiet at night. Some of the consumables were in need of refills, such as essential oils and something else I can't remember. These were not need-to-have items, but would have been nice to use. The couch is soft, so soft that we couldn't use it comfortable. Maybe we're just old. The bed was wonderful. We would stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay at the brewtel. Extremely clean and awesome shower! The kitchen is also very nice and stocked with all kinds of cookware (didn’t need it for my two day stay, but useful nonetheless). It is attached to the Lake Superior brewery which we ate and had a couple drinks at our first night. Location is great if you want access to the lake walk trail (literally right around the corner) and was a good access point to getting north of Duluth on the highway.
My only complaint would be the relatively “thin” walls between the two rentals. Had a guest next door that was being a little obnoxious, but I don’t hold that against the owners.
Excellent stay and highly recommend. Hope I was of some help to future guests!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! The brewery next door was amazing!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah and Seth’s place was a clean, comfortable, and well-appointed stay for my 3-night trip to Duluth as a solo traveler. Well-located and safe; parking was abundant."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,First time staying in and AirB&B so didn’t know what to expect but Sarah and Seth helped make it a very pleasant and peaceful experience. Would Definitely book again
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,cool spot with everything you could need! great spot to get out of town and up to the shore!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay! Beautiful place and so easy to access. Thank you!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Brewtel was great! The hosts were very easy to communicate with, the studio was very clean and comfortable. We loved that the brewery was right next door, where we could grab drinks and food (get the pizza!) We will definitely consider the Brewtel for future stays in Duluth!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous place, amazing beer, and attentive hosts. What more could you ask for?"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Quick drive into town and good proximity to many state parks.
The couch was not a futon as pictured but my 5’10” son said he still slept comfortably on it. Always my biggest complaint about renting an Airbnb is a general lack of blankets. I am happy to report Sarah and Seth supplied ample blankets.
Overall great stay. Would definitely recommend."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice location in a quiet part of town!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice studio apartment. Very clean and had all the amenities we needed. Some street noise at times, but quiet enough for sleeping. Minimal noise from neighboring guests. Convenient location. Hassle free. Would stay here again. Very pleasant stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah and Seth were very helpful - detailed instructions every step of the way from check-in to checkout. Their brewpub next door had amazing food and beer & the studio unit was perfect for a solo traveler, but I'd love to come back with my wife - it was so cozy and cute. Thanks!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at the Brewtel but my first with my wife joining. She loved it as much as I did! The space is functional and spacious and the location—next door to Sarah and Seth’s brewery, with great beer and food—and also convenient to the rest of Duluth (and Amity Coffee and New London Cafe) and the North Shore—can’t be beat. Little touches—great locally roasted coffee beans and the like—complete it."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to land for a day in town on business. The place is clean and comfy. Added bonus that you can go next door to meet the hosts and to enjoy a nice dinner as well as some tasty local beer! Had some trouble with the lock and Sara and Seth helped me right away! Thank you!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Absolutely love the space and location next to the brewery!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very spacious and convenient location. Responsive hosts and very simple check in/out process. I’d recommend this place to anyone staying in Duluth!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down, one of the best places we’ve stayed. Super clean, modern minimalist, extremely comfortable and warm offering a beautiful blend of function and aesthetics. The use of space and design materials were fantastic. This place had everything needed for a couple looking to break out of the hotel scene. Incredibly comfortable bed, plenty of towels. The rain shower experience was beyond great. The Brewery next door is super convenient and not at all disruptive with its energy or sound. Walks in Lester Park were serene, convenient, and broke up the “city” feel. We would 100 times choose this again. Highly recommend!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I got lucky and snagged this studio up for a last-minute two-night trip to Duluth. It looks exactly like the photos, and it was a great place to stay. I enjoyed dinner both nights at the attached brewery (the Brussels were outstanding). I visit Duluth regularly, but this was my first time staying in Lakeside. I actually enjoyed being a bit removed and a quick car ride away from the hustle and bustle of Canal Park and the Craft District. I would totally stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Seth and Sarah did not disappoint with the listing and promised accommodations. Place was immaculate and I value clean lodging. The pictures were exactly what was promised. Received an early check in when asked. Kitchen had more than enough for meal prep even though we didn't cook. Their attached bar/restaurant/brewery was amazing! This place did not disappoint. If you want a cozy/cottage/vintage vibe this is not the place. It's clean/industrial/modern vibe is a nice alterative to what one would often see when searching. It is on a busy street which was shared so be prepared for some traffic noise. Can't fault Seth and Sarah for a few loud motorcycles late at night.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice unit. Comfortable. Seth responded right away when the water heater went out. Resolved. Exactly as advertised.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay! The brewery being right next door was a fun addition to our stay. We highly recommend the pizza!
The inside of the studio is very well put together and clean. You can hear people in the apartment next door, but it didn’t disrupt our stay.
Overall we were pleased with our stay and would recommend this location to anyone wishing to explore Duluth!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for a vacation near the north shore. Close to great restaurants and brews, but still in a quiet area. Would definitely recommend if in the area again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A clean and modern place that is close to trails. Location on the north end of Duluth was great!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had the best experience staying at the Lake Superior Brewing Brewtel! The studio apartment is spacious and has street side facing windows with plenty of natural light coming in.
Wi-Fi signal was strong and solid. The kitchen has all the essentials but I went to the brewpub for dinner and ate leftovers for breakfast! The brewpub serves a delicious burger, pizza, and delicious selection of beers.
It’s less than a 15 minute drive to Canal Park and a quick access to other Duluth attractions. The Lakewalk trail, a paved pedestrian and biking path that stretches 8 miles, was a great path for my morning run. I also enjoyed a scenic bike ride to Canal Park and Brighton Beach thanks to the great folks at e-bike Duluth - not too far from the Brewtel.
It’s a one story and next to Lake Superior Brewing, and faces the street. It is surprisingly quiet. I didn’t hear any sounds from the brewpub and traffic noise was light.
I’m delighted to add the Brewtel to my list of Duluth favorites!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great overall, great location and Sarah communicated well with us. We had some hiccups when we got there but everything got cleared up right away. We had a great time there!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The room is beautiful, well kept, and in a good location. They went above and beyond to provide little extras in the room like a French press and coffee grinder. Very nice. The bed is right by the window, which is right by the road, so if road noise bothers you, you might want to bring earplugs. I did, and slept great!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute place!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,What a unique and beautiful place to stay when in Duluth. Updated and comfortable space with all the necessary amenities. Attached to a great brewpub for easy food and drinks.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! Sara is so responsive, really appreciated that along with their excellent restaurant/brewhouse next door!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cute studio is nestled close to the scenic US-61 highway. It was close to a lot of great restaurants and there were a lot of things to do. The apartment is close to a walking/ biking trail too. The amenities in the apartment were just as described in the listing and the check-in and checkout process was simple.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super neat place that was great for our sons graduation. Highly recommend
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place had everything we needed and it was nice and clean. The lake walk was right in the back yard, so we were able to walk to Lester park and go for a beautiful hike. Super One is walkable if you needed anything from the store. The brewery was closed the days we stayed, so we weren’t able to dine there, but that would be fun next time. The food menu looked really good."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little spot to stay in Duluth! Has all the amenities needed to stay in. Wish we could’ve stayed even longer!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean spot in a good location!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The studio in the Brewtel is very comfortable, quiet, and calming. Having a fantastic restaurant and brewpub next door is a big bonus! The hosts respond within minutes if not seconds to any questions we had. It's nice to have another dining/lodging option at the other end of Duluth. Great place to eat, drink, and stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sarah and Seth’s place was fantastic. Tasteful design and decor (always love live plants), clean, with lots of thoughtful little details. The shower is luxe."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Studio suite has 3 beautiful large windows and lots of light. It is very spacious and is beautifully decorated, vintage pieces and modernism. Super comfortable coach, lots of pillows, spare blankets and King bed, lovely linens.
Every detail has been thought of, well equipped kitchen, tea towels, coffee maker, kettle etc. Bathroom has a huge terrazzo tile shower with a wonderful new rain shower and water wand. One thing to note it is on a busy road so bring ear plugs or a noise device such as a portable speaker."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place, has everything you need!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot for fishing and biking!!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying here! The bed was so comfortable and everything was spotless. Very stylish space! We’ll definitely be back.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah and Seth were very helpful during me and my partners stay! It was our anniversary, so the cute studio was perfect for meals, romantic, shower was amazing, and while I had a few specific requests for our stay, Seth and Sarah we’re able to accommodate for our special occasion! 5 stars all around!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"With the brewery/restaurant literally attached to the studio apartment in the same building, a wonderful dinner and beverage is only a few steps away. But, if you'd like a quiet retreat like we do, this studio is located far enough from downtown Duluth to be considered remote. Near a walking path and Lester Park for periods of leg-stretching exercise, Sarah and Seth's rental is a diamond."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We'll definitely be back! Just as pictured, shower was amazing, so quiet, perfect size, great amenities, great location.
Loved it :-)"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks you guys for the great weekend, definitely a place we will come back too."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great trip, cool vibe and nice spot to escape too"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great spot! We’ve had pizza next door on earlier trips. so when I was looking for a spot to stay for a little overnight get away, I was excited to try the brewtel and I’m so glad I did! A clean, lovely space that is EXACTLY as pictured and described. The only mistake I made was staying on a Sunday night when the restaurant was closed. I’m looking forward to coming back for another cozy stay AND getting some more pizza just a few steps away."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted to get away for a relaxing reset weekend. This studio is so beautiful! The tall windows provide a lot of light, but there are also blackout shades if you want to take an afternoon nap. The kitchen & bathroom has everything you need. They are clean, and the shower is nice and big! It felt great after going to 'The Well' for a guided sauna!
The studio is also close to Lester Park if you like cross country skiing.
Although I didn't need any help, Sarah & Seth sent messages through Airbnb letting me know I could reach out if I needed help with anything.
It was a perfect weekend!
Thank you!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, bright, very user friendly. Sarah was available, helpful, very pleasant to deal with.
Food next door was great as well!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved how clean, modern and spacious the Brewtel was, along with the extremely comfortable bed and luxurious shower. The kitchen was great for cooking a dinner in one night as well. We definitely enjoyed our stay and hope to return. Make sure you check out Lester Park, which is just down the road. Great trail for hiking and exploring another beautiful side of Duluth."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay. Smooth hosting. Would definitely book again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a lovely stay here in Duluth for a night. The space is great - cozy, well-decorated, exactly what you'd expect from the pictures. The shower was a particular standout - the rain head is great, and the wand/hose attachment was great too. I was only in town for a short time, so I didn't get a chance to use the kitchen equipment, but it looked well-appointed and like you could do some solid cooking there.
Bottom line: I'd love to come back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at the Brewtel! Perfect location for our time hanging out in Duluth as well as heading up the shore for some day hikes. Would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time here! Sarah and Seth's place was very clean, and cozy! We can't wait to visit again when the brewery is open!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean and cute, loved the shower. Had everything we needed and the brewery had great food."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Brewtel is wonderful. The photos reflect what’s there: a spacious and friendly space next to (but soundproofed from) a great brewery with really solid food. The space was clean and nicely appointed, with a full kitchen, a comfortable bed, and plenty of parking. It is right on a street that is fairly busy during the day but quieted down pretty well at night. It’s not right in the most bustling part of Duluth, but is near convenience stores, a great yarn shop, and a short drive from everything else. It’s also right on a long paved bike/walk path that I believe goes all the way into the center of town (though I’m not positive of that)."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, definitely recommend staying here!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place felt HEAVENLY for a tired mom coming off chaperoning an 8th grade trip in the North Woods. I just needed a place to crash on my way through town but this place literally was a sanctuary or rest and respite well beyond what I expected. The hosts have thought through everything with this space, with ALL the amenities you could need; laundry soap, high quality soaps and shampoos, and it was pristine. Beyond exhausted and disgusting from camping, this place felt like an absolute gift. Not to mention literally a 30 sec. walk to Lake Superior Brewing and one of the best burgers I've ever had. Can't recommend enough and will for sure be staying here again, whether passing through or while just partaking in the all the goodness that is Duluth."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great little place. There were just two of us and it was a nice size and layout. It was very clean and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay again the next time in Duluth. Lake Superior Brewing has good food too so that's a bonus!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! I would recommend staying here and hope its available next time I'm coming to Duluth.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, cozy and better than any hotel! Love having the brewery right there. Food is unbelievable!! Drink and wine list is superb!
Fantastic place and even better people! I will definitely be back again.
Thank you Sarah and Seth!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The studio unit is exactly as pictured in the promotions. Everything is new and modern with a very well-equipped kitchen. It was so nice to spend three nights in the studio instead of a hotel. The location is great for easily getting around Duluth.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfy, everything you need."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lovely and quiet location on the mainline East of downtown Duluth. Great for both a quiet retreat or a hub for your outdoor activities. Studio had all the amenities for cooking meals, watching a movie (Smart TV), taking a luxurious shower, and even doing laundry (private washer and dryer unit)."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Location is 10 / 10. The space was also very comfortable and well designed. Sarah and Seth are awesome hosts! We will stay again :)
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at the Brewtel for a little weekend get away to Duluth. It was the perfect place to come home to after being out and about in the city. The apartment is incredibly spacious and worked perfectly for two people. We loved being able to park in the LSB lot, especially during the snowy weekend. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for hosting us - we love Duluth, and this location was perfect for us!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space- everything you need and nothing you don’t!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The studio apartment was perfect for our needs. We ended up eating at the brewery twice while we were there and the food was really good.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts!!!! Thank you 😊 highly recommend this place is great 👍
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, responsive host, clean, well equipped kitchen"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Very central and Sara and Seth are great hosts
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The studio apartment was a perfect spot for our weekend away. We did not take advantage of the kitchen and laundry but they are very nice to have just in case. I highly recommend staying here as a place to both enjoy the city as well as travel up the North Shore. We will be back. Oh and having the restaurant and bar a few feet away was an added bonus!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great bang for your buck! Super clean, super convenient, had anything and everything you could need to cook, clean and enjoy a stay in Duluth! 10/10 would recommend"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at the Studio Apartment! Clean, cozy and beautifully decorated! Sarah and Seth have created a delightful space that has everything you might need for your stay in Duluth. Their attention to detail is obvious throughout and yes, make sure to enjoy the luxury terrazzo rain shower!
Don’t miss the opportunity to eat at their brewery! We enjoyed Oysters Rockefeller and a delicious Korean Smash Burger on our 1st night and took a mushroom pizza back to the studio for lunch the next day. We will be back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,A perfect spot to enjoy Duluth and the surrounding area! We loved our stay and had everything we needed at the Airbnb. We would certainly stay again
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place! Convenient to next door restaurant/bar. Responsive with communications.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this place! Surprisingly spacious and cozy, and super clean, with lots of thoughtful touches. The location is also really convenient and I loved being able to pop over to the brewery next door. With it being so close to the road, I was worried about road noise but it was very quiet and peaceful. And, as pretty much everyone else called out in their reviews, the shower is AMAZING. Hosts were very friendly and communicative, and gave plenty of great info and instructions so everything went super smoothly.
I would definitely stay here again the next time I am visiting the area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay, I would highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended stay . The pizza and cold beer next door is very good!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah and Seth’s place was amazing!
Very clean and well decorated. The shower was great! The location was very convenient and they were great hosts. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-09-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was as described, very cute and cozy! Good location as well. Host was very communicative, sending frequent messages and reminders. Unfortunately the wifi and tv did not work the short time we were there. Our only real issue and disappointment is that we felt a lack of comfort and privacy by the hosts stopping by frequently."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful. The pizza next door was so good and it was fun having a brewery right next door!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, roomy, great shower and bed! Liked the heater option in the bathroom."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the high ceilings, the aromatherapy diffuser was a very nice touch, the shower head was amazing, the layout very inviting.
The brewery next door had gluten-free options (being a celiac), took precautions making wild mushroom pizza, great wine list and fun cocktails. The staff Greg and Timmy were super friendly and very engaging.
Enjoyed the walkability of the walking path and biking path right behind the studio."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a hidden gem!!! We stayed in the studio for 2 nights and I wish we could have stayed longer.
You are in the cutest, safest neighborhood, walking distance to 2 beaches, a grocery store, pizza place and coffee shop. You feel like you are truly up on the north shore while being 10 minutes to canal park. Also - We ate at the connected Brewery/restaurant and the food/vibe were so great!! So nice to have the restaurant right next door.
The studio is immaculate, so clean it makes it so easy to relax. Unlike other airbnbs we have stayed in, we loved that this studio was cleaned out and decluttered for us to use - we didn’t feel like we were working around other peoples stuff. The hosts - Sarah and Seth are great, super welcoming, accommodating and responsive.
We can’t wait to stay again, we’d love to rent the house if we can as well!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely space, plenty of open space, large comfortable bed, kitchen and bathroom. As noted in other reviews fantastic shower. Sparkling clean, well equipped kitchens with everything needed for cooking. Easy self check in, parking, and communication. I’ll just note that the brewery is next door but another unit separates this one from the brewery and I heard no noise from it. You also can’t really hear the unit next door from inside. The bed is next to a busy street, though I didn’t have trouble falling or staying asleep, but if you’re a light sleeper you may want to bring ear plugs. Solid internet. Great stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was even nicer than the pictures! Sarah and Seth put so much care into the studio and we had everything we needed for our stay. It was clean, well stocked, the shower is amazing, the kitchen is very well stocked and they even left local coffee for us to drink. The newly opened restaurant was also great- good food and service! We will definitely be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah and Seth’s Airbnb was exactly how it appears.
Thank you!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay in the Studio. Quiet area, great space, wonderful open plan and fantastic food/drinks/staff at the brewery immediately next door. We were up to MTB the Duluth Traverse (Lester Trail head is literally 4 blocks away) and while the trails were great, the best part of any riding quickly became - as you've likely read in other reviews - the shower afterwards! That thing is the bomb. Nice work.
We'll definitely return here and would plan on jumping on the Waterfront trail, located literally a few hundred feet from the door, going to Canal Park. Looked like a fun way to explore. Next time!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very pretty room. We had a great time.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location near the brewery and Lester Park. Beautiful space!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The studio unit looks his like the pictures. Maybe even better
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lots to see on the North Shore. Great launching point and near to the parks and waterfalls.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome location and such a nice place to stay! Very comfortable bed, super clean, and a fully stocked kitchen which made cooking easy! We hope to be back soon."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a nice stay here! A very relaxing AirBnb. Having laundry in the unit was a big plus because we are a family with a 7 mo old baby. It's a lovely space with lots of light and a full kitchen! So nice! The only thing I would recommend are light curtains for the large windows because they look directly out onto the sidewalk. (There are curtains, of course, but they block a decent amount of light when pulled down.) That's a minor thing, though, and we loved staying here. Sarah and Seth even dropped off a freshly baked baguette from their newly fired-up oven!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice, clean studio apartment. Good location near Lester park and the lake walk."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super spacious, great light, best shower, and extremely clean. Can’t wait to try the beer when it opens!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Duluth! The studio is the cutest most modern place. Perfect for a quick stay!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute spacious studio in a quiet setting in Duluth. Old neighborhood charm should attract many to the area and the new brewery opening. The studio is well equipped, comfortable, and an amazing shower!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic place! Love the location great hosts and an incredible shower!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We appreciated the attention to the little things! The poopuri in the bathroom, natural hand soap and dish soap and an electric kettle."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful and spacious space. Attention to details and sustainability. Great location. And those floors…stunning!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful studio apartment! Very clean.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow!! After a ski at Lester Park, the shower in this unit was AWESOME!!!! Bed was very comfortable and we loved the variety of pillow firmness so we were both comfy. Kitchen was equipped for everything. The electric water pot and the french press were appreciated by us. The treatment on the cement floor was fabulous. Glad we had slippers. The hanging art work was lovely to look at. Host was very responsive when needed. Complete with games too!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space is so beautiful and comfortable. I really felt like I was home. It had everything I needed. I look forward to coming back.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah was a wonderful host!! She was amazing with communication and very quick to respond. The place itself was just perfect. Location was wonderful. It wasn’t directly downtown so it was peaceful and quiet, but close enough where anything you need was just a short drive away. I just can’t say enough good things about this place. I would/will stay here again!!"
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Fun weekend getaway

Jan & Joy Linn"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Really great spot in Lakeside! I stayed here to try and get a bunch of work done and it was quiet and very comfortable. Would also be convenient for checking out the town and of course the beautiful north shore.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay - p.s. the shower here is amazing!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah's place was amazing! The pictures do not do it justice. It's a lot bigger than it appears. The bed was super comfy and it had everything you would need (towels, silverware, plates, etc.). Also, the shower was amazing! I can't wait to come back this summer when the brewery is open!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The studio apartment is bright, roomy and well furnished. The kitchen looks new and has everything I needed plus a lot more.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay! I forgot how beautiful Park Point is after living in Duluth and on the Point 30 years ago….it was great to be back. Nancy was very attentive and responsive and so amazing to provide this house to Airbnb customers. It is just beautiful… the home, the beach, the view. Everything was terrific, and she has everything you need for your stay. Such a relaxing few days. Thank you Nancy, Minnesota is so lucky to have a gem like Park Point and this house that we can enjoy, I will visit again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time, beautiful place!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Photos do not do it justice - everything beyond our expectations, so beautiful and peaceful. If you see this place has open availability, jump on it!!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Park Point Vista for 6 nights to celebrate our 50th anniversary. We could not have had a more enjoyable, peaceful, wonderful time. It is located far enough out on the point to feel like being out of town and close enough to enjoy all that Duluth has to offer.
The furnishings, both functional and decorative were top rate. Nancy has done a first rate job preparing her home for the most discerning of guests.
Although the weather has not the traditional, sunny and warm, it has awesome to sit on the deck or wake up in the morning to the sound of waves.
We would definitely recommend Park Point Vista to anyone at any time.
Thank you Nancy!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I were seeking a vacation home to simply decompress. This property was absolutely perfect for our needs. I fell asleep to the sounds of the waves lapping on the beach, footsteps away from the home. Don’t worry if you forget to pack something because this beautiful home is thoroughly stocked with amenities."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my bi-annual go-to in Duluth. Quiet, private, beautiful lake Superior beachfront, and amazing home. Kitchen is made for cooking - well stocked. Deck overlooking lake Superior, great while enjoying morning coffee. Can't wait for my next visit."

We loved how open and spacious the space was and felt right at home. For a short trip, we wished we had stayed longer to enjoy being “home” more. Nancy was super quick to respond to questions and even greeted us upon arrival!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Early morning sunrise on Lake Superior!
Well designed home. Cute sitting area outside bedroom was our favorite spot. Views of the lake from every room.
One of the best places we’ve stayed at AirBnB"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! The house was beautiful and the view was amazing! So close to Canal Park with tons to do. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our very first mini trip with our five month old baby girl and knowing she could get temperamental throughout the day, more than anything we needed a home base we'd enjoy spending a majority of our time at. Nancy's place was absolutely perfect! Like everyone has said, the view is just stunning. There was so much space for us to spread out and relax in. I particularly loved the sitting area upstairs for movie nights while our baby girl slept.
Everything is just like Nancy describes, or better. The small details throughout the house are so lovely and welcoming. There's a tote bag with beach towels and a cooler waiting for you right by the front door. There's plenty of toiletries in the bathroom and loads of extra supplies in the pantry. Loads of comfy seating with several blankets. There are SO MANY towels!
Nancy's home is a true escape from the world's stresses. I got home yesterday and I've already recommended her place to at least three friends! Just go!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing for a getaway for 2. The sandy beach right on the lake and the distance to Canal Park makes this gorgeous place well worth the price. Nancy was an incredible host. We cannot wait to come back! Highly recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gorgeous home with a million-dollar view. It is comfortable and well-appointed with many high-end amenities. The location is fantastic. It is just a short drive to restaurants, shops and parks. Or you can just take a few steps out the back door and take a long walk on the sandy beach. Highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with absolutely everything you might need. The view is breathtaking and serene. Check-in was seamless and Nancy responded to any question within minutes. It’s definitely a little slice of heaven! Thanks for the opportunity to recharge!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is amazing! I needed the space to decorate 150 cupcakes for my sister’s wedding and the kitchen was perfect for this task. The kitchen and pantry were fully stocked in case I forgot anything. The bed is extremely comfortable and the views outside of every window are incredible.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the best place to watch the sunrise!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely gorgeous home. So clean and fresh. It had everything we needed for our stay. We enjoyed the deck and walking along the beach. The home is so comfortable. Nancy makes checking into the home so easy.
It’s close to restaurants and shopping. The sunrise is absolutely stunning and the sounds of the waves so soothing. Highly recommend"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous, both the location and the property! Photos do not do this place justice. Perfect spot to get away and relax for a few days. Loved watching the sunrise from the porch or from bed."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spacious house! Love hearing the waves crash on the beach. Would definitely return!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying in Nancy’s truly elegant home was such a huge treat and so comforting. Everything is gorgeous, the kitchen is well stocked and very easy to cook in, so when you truly want to hide away and heal, you can feel at home, or perhaps better than at home."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An immaculate home with an incredible view and access to Park Point Beach. This is the perfect place to watch the sun rise, decompress, and find peace."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, long weekend staying at Nancy’s house! The house is updated and beautiful! The views of Lake Superior are gorgeous. Close to the water so you can hear the splashing of the waves, but otherwise very quiet. The house was super clean and comfortable - and well stocked. We definitely plan to be back! Next time we will plan fewer activities, so we have more time just to relax at the house and enjoy the wonderful accommodations!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was so close to things and the private beach area sealed the deal! Book the place of your dreams!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot recommend this place highly enough. It was immaculately clean, and amazingly well-stocked; we cooked several meals during our stay and easily found every pan and utensil we ever needed. One thing not reflected in the listing is that there is an additional living space upstairs, which was a nice surprise. The finishes and furnishings throughout are high-end beautiful, and combined with the lake setting create a really relaxing and calming atmosphere. We were fortunate enough to have gorgeous weather, and saw spectacular sunrises every day. The view from practically every spot in the home is awesome, in the true sense of the word."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. The best combination of a peaceful place yet close to all the shops and restaurants. If you want to visit Duluth while staying in a prime peaceful location you should consider this property.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beach home is nothing short of amazing. Spacious, lovely, quiet, and a wonderful way to spend a long weekend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such beautiful views we never wanted to leave! Watched the most amazing sunrises over the lake, visible from bed and every plush sofa. Could see sunset views from the sumptuous bath and front door patio. Top of the line finishes and decor throughout. Thank you for sharing this gem with us!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay! The house was clean and comfortable. It was nice being right on the beach and the views are wonderful. The sunrise was especially stunning!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely immaculate stay! First and foremost I should mention that Nancy is the most gracious host. She has taken care of every little detail, so all you have to do is relax. She is a dream to communicate with and was just so helpful. This is a beautiful property! I shared with my host that I grew up in Southern California, have traveled all over the world, everywhere from the Caribbean to the Mediterranean. I cannot think of a more beautiful sunrise or sunset that I have seen anywhere in the world. I found it right here on this property! The views are absolutely breathtaking from inside the home and outside as well.
It is completely serene and a great place for a retreat. Every amenity I could think of was provided. The home was bright, beautiful and beyond comfortable. This is just such a special place and I really hope to go back someday."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nancy is a wonderful host. House is great with awesome views!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice and clean
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home right on the water. Well equipped with anything you may need. Sunrises from the bedroom window were so amazing and my favorite! If you are looking for a relaxing place to stay that’s right on the water than this is it! You definitely won’t be disappointed!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful view inside and from the house! Nancy provided all the things we needed. There were pantry items, cups, plates, and even enough to bake with! I highly recommend Nancy's home for anyone who wants a wonderful stay on Superior. It's worth every penny!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an exceptional property and host experience! The property is truly exceptional - inside and out. The view is amazing from every room of the house, including waking up overlooking Lake Superior. All of the details of the home have been thought of and Nancy made us feel so welcome. I highly recommend for a memorable visit to Duluth."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stunning home!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I cannot say enough about this amazing place! Nancy is a fantastic host and her home is absolutely stunning and so inviting! We will absolutely stay here again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing view from a beautiful house, right on a private beach. The sunrises were beautiful each morning. Short distance from everything in Duluth. Great getaway location. Extremely classy. Can’t wait to come back here."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nancy’s house was a wonderful, quiet haven on the lake side of Park Point. Her kitchen was fully stocked with spices and other cooking items as well as all utensils, dishes, pots and pans. We ate all breakfasts and made a couple of dinners there. Nancy had also thoughtfully provided coffee and some snacks.
The deck and beach are just wonderful; we loved being able to use them and be so close to the water.
Nancy was a great host, introducing herself and being available as needed for any questions.
We would definitely stay there again when we are in Duluth."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Little slice of heaven. Beyond by far our expectations. Loved loved it!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and clean. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend for anyone spending time in Duluth.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at Billie's place. It's a great apartment! Very spacious, clean, and has everything you would need, including a shakers porch and a great outdoor seating area!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnB was perfect for our stay. We liked the spaciousness, off-street parking, value, and location. Thank you again for a lovely stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at Billie's place! Billie immediately made me feel very welcome. The apartment is spacious and very clean. Loved that the old wooden kitchen cabinets were kept amid all the white. Nice touch! Wish the weather had been a bit better so I could have enjoyed both the shaker porch and the nice outdoor seating in the backyard. But, I did enjoy the lovely view of the harbor!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely clean and comfortable, the bed linens and pillows felt like sleeping in a cloud ☁️ would definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very happy with this home. It is located in a very quiet neighborhood. We never even heard the residents downstairs. The view of Lake Superior from the deck is lovely. It felt so clean and fresh, with the light airy color scheme. The big green sofa is such a great place to curl up for long conversations with my dear friend and traveling partner. It was easy to find and its proximity to the Lincoln Park Craft District is a real plus."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would absolutely stay again! Very clean and bright. Quiet neighborhood but a quick walk to the breweries downtown
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hope to stay again next year! Was perfect for our family! Thanks!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"A little rough around the edges and the shower temp seemed to have a mind of its own but overall we had a present stay, I would book again."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Hosts were very responsive and friendly. Beautiful view of the lake and the Northern Lights!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Exactly what we needed and expected. Simple, clean and peaceful. Loved the easy lake access for morning sunrises."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect for my needs. Allow pets and close to the hospital where I was working.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful little spot to get away! I would highly recommend and we would come again for another visit!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Rustic cozy cottage with a beautiful view! Think glamping with a short walk across the road to Lake Superior!
Similar to camping, neighbors conversations could be heard through the shared wall, so if you’re a sensitive sleeper I’d recommend bringing a source for ambient/background noise as you rest."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location on the north shore and very close to Duluth! Great place to stay but it being on the smaller side, I’d say it’s better for 1-2 people."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was immaculately clean and host was quick to respond and helpful. They allowed us to squeeze another kid in the deal too -- we very much appreciated...We needed a break on the north shore and this was wonderful. Very nice property and some fun stuff for little kids too and fire pits...pic Nic tables.... Lots of good walks along the water from the cabin. Cabin is obviously tiny tiny, but it has everything you need if you're spending most your time outdoors. It is connected to other cabin, but guests were friendly and quiet...we were mindful not to be too loud for them either. Only glitch was the futon hinges were in need of repair from previous folks probably forcing it up and down to hard -- but it worked fine. We also had a weak chair that they quickly swapped out for us. It is very conveniently located only 12 minutes or less from Duluth. We will be back for this great clean, economical and perfectly located place to stay on the north shore! Thank you very much!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Nice and cozy stay with the view of Lake Superior right across the street! Short drive south to get a taste of small city life and restaurants with a short drive north for hiking!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location between Duluth and Two Harbors. Easy communication with host. The view of the lake is beautiful! We were at a comfortable temperature in the cottage despite it being below zero outside! The size of the space was good and gave us the small cabin feel we wanted.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay! The cabin was great clean, provided all the amenities we needed, and had easy access to Duluth and the North Shore."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stayed in December and had a very cozy cottage to enjoy the North Shore. My kids enjoyed the play yard, and we all appreciated the friendly staff, nice heated cabins and walking along the scenic route. Good eagle sightings."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Friendly and helpful. Very responsive!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay! Super beautiful and convenient location. The cottage was nice and cozy. Check in and check out instructions were clear. Thank you!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Although our stay was short and our travel plans changed last minute, the accommodations were perfect and the owners worked with us to adjust our check out date. The cabin was warm and inviting and the exactly what we needed for our stay in Duluth. We would definitely stay again if we are in the area."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cottage was clean, comfortable and well supplied. I carve rocks and this location has access to the type of shoreline I look for. And being pet friendly is a bonus."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot! Description was very apt, this is a minimalist cabin. Great place to rest your head at night with breathtaking views.
Pros:
AMAZING location right on Lake Superior. Quick drive to many great spots in and around Duluth. Poarch and grassy area around the cabin for use. Great for dogs.
Cons:
My water wasn't warm long for a shower, but hopefully that will be taken care of for future guests. Bathroom may be awkward for taller renters. If the adjoined cabin is occupied, you will have some noise pollution."
2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"It's hard for me to write a less-than-favorable review, but there were issues I would want to know before staying here. They may not be deal breakers but could easily be improved. First off, there were bugs. I know it's a cottage, so I expect a few, but each evening, a ton of Asiatic Beatles made their way into the place and were flying and crawling around us in the main living area. Second, you must rewash every dish if you plan to use any. I filled a pot that looked clean with water and ended up coated in a lot of dish soap. Silverware had a coating as well, and plates and bowls seemed questionable. Silverware is also just thrown in, so you're grabbing for a fork in a pile with steak knives. (luckily, so dull they barely cut) . There is no cleaning product to wipe down counters during your stay. The bedding and futon had some dusty debris on it. Towels, conversely were clean and there was a good supply. Check-out is 10 am so I would expect a clean unit by 4pm check in."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin was cute and cozy. Prefect for a little family getaway. Beautiful view of the lake and the kids loved all the outdoor space to run around. Cabin had everything we needed. Will definitely stay here again. Great value.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fabulous cottage! It’s so quaint and private. A treasure to find. Will always recommend this location for anyone staying in Duluth! 10/10
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This location was perfect for us. We were able to easily get in and out of Duluth. We also were able to explore the North Shore and be able to come back for a relaxing night at the cottage. It was very easy to work with the hosts. Our travel plans changed, and we needed to check out a day early. We were able to change the reservation without penalties. I do want to mention that this cottage is small. It was fine for us as we are not large people. My husband is tall, though, and his knees had to be in the shower as he sat on the toilet. Also, as others have said, you will not get a long hot shower."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute stay with great view! Lots of things to do in area and hosts were very helpful making a list of things to do!
2023-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,It lacks the standard of quality and cleanliness that is expected by a Spanish in an Airbnb listing.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location is close enough to downtown while still being next to the lake and in the woods, clean place, good communication between host and guest!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"it was very quiet. close enough to Duluth.view of the lake ,could walk down to the shore.a head start on heading up the north shore"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spent a wonderful few days at the cottages. Quaint and cozy! Loved being close enough to Duluth to enjoy a nice supper out, but also within easy driving if so many north shore sights!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very helpful and nice. Always responded to questions asked in timely matter. Allowed early checkin. Very quiet area, but also easy to get to site seeing areas. The cottage could use a little maintenance, but overall good."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Cute and clean plus a beautiful view! We will be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our 3rd airbnb stop over our honeymoon, my wife has aracnophobia . ..and there was not one web in the place . absolutely amazing . The fire pit was great and cozy . We loved our stay . The host recommended a little walk buy the shore and we found some nice spots to pick agates . It was great!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,These cottages were as expected and pictured; good for our overnight stay on our drive through Duluth. Really liked having such good views of Lake Superior!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"hidden gem close to Duluth! We loved our stay at the cabin. Right across the road from the big lake, and very close to Duluth proper. Yet it feels like you are further up the shore. We stay at different Air B+B's every labor day weekend and our stay here was lovely! place was spotless and very quiet. We loved being able to bring our dogs and walk around the property!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute little cabin with bedroom and bathroom on back side, small living room with TV and DVDs, equipped kitchen, and deck with nice view of Lake Superior across the road."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay at North Shore Cottages! Yes, the cabin is small, but it is smartly laid out to make the most of the space. I was very comfortable, and had plenty of room to prep meals — a very important part of any vacation for me. Watching the nearly full moon rise from the ""beach"" (in the rocky, Lake Superior sense of that word) across the road in solitude was a major highlight. And of course, the property is in a fabulous area with tons to do, whether in town in Duluth or further up the shore."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house! Awesome location, clean and really put together space - we really enjoyed the games and activities!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Home was spotlessly clean, comfortable and cozy. Wonderful hosts had excellent communication. Friendly and helpful. Lovely home was updated and well maintained. Nice homey touches and amenities. Highly recommended!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place. Comfy bed. Had everything we needed. Good stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A well-planned space in a quiet neighborhood.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was perfect. The washer and dryer worked well. The kitchen had everything we needed, all very clean and in great condition. The pots and pans looked brand new. The bed was super comfy. I will note that there were some strong fragrances in the house so if you are sensitive to fragrances you might want to ask the hosts to use different laundry detergent and maybe air the house out after cleaning before your stay. They seem pretty accommodating so I'm guessing they would be willing to do this. Also, the floor creaked a bit so if you're planning to do a lot of pacing trying to put a baby to sleep it might not be the best place, though the basement and outside would both be good quieter alternatives. Overall a great place, would recommend and would stay again. The hosts were great and let us check in early."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Laurie's space was beautiful. A great place to stay that matched the pictures exactly.
if you're headed to Duluth, this is a great place to stay for a small group."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for two nights during a work trip. Very cozy and peaceful stay. Safe neighborhood and good location. Everything was clean.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay- very clean- very comfortable.
Very kind."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Laurie’s place is a great option for a short stay. Spacious living room, safe and quiet neighborhood. The guest room is a bit smaller than I thought, but it’s okay. They have table tennis in the basement, and we loved it. Mike and Laurie are great hosts, responsive and easy to communicate with. Great value!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Laurie were so thorough with the check-in process that it made it seamless for my family and I the day we arrived. After 12 hours of flying from Hawaii + 2 hour drive from Minneapolis we just wanted to rest. Their home was our home away from home.
The home was so comfy inside and everything you needed was readily available. A coffee machine, renovated and clean bathroom, a comfortable bed, and close to everything you would need within 10 minutes.
I loved the fact the home had a no shoe rule (you can leave it in the mudroom at the entrance). This is common practice where we live so it was a nice touch!
Mike and Laurie also provided a binder with things to do in Duluth as well as the WiFi information for the home. If you need a nice, cozy, and warm place to stay in Duluth I highly recommend their place.
Mike and Laurie have been welcoming and very thorough since booking."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife & I stay in the Duluth area about once a month, and usually we stay in an AirBnb. The kitchen here was very well equipped! It was quite rainy during out stay, having use of the garage was a nice plus. It was also nice to be close to town, but with it being peaceful and quiet."

The house had everything we needed, including a garage which was a bonus!"

Ate at the table and played cards.

Drinking my coffee on the cute front porch with the geraniums was such a sweet way to start my days…couldn’t do that before because it was Thanksgiving and too cold. We appreciate the special touches like supplying coffee, the number of towels and washcloths, and the washer and dryer. The garage was a huge plus too! The home is in a quiet, seemingly safe neighborhood and is just so comfortable! Will definitely stay again, and would refer friends and family to stay here if they’re in need of a rental in Duluth!"

With family in Superior, East Duluth and Cloquet, this was perfectly located for getting to those places easily. With a full kitchen, we were able to cook a lot of meals, which saved a lot versus eating out everyday.
The floors and doors do creak a bit, but that's to be expected in an older house like this, and didn't bother us at all especially considering we were getting a full house at the cost of a hotel. The hosts always responded quickly to any questions, and were very accommodating.
All in all it was a great stay and I will definitely look to stay here again on my next visit."

Accessible to many of the spots we wanted to visit including a day trip to Split Rock and Gooseberry.

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful time in Duluth and it can be attributed to our home base camp! Nice finishes on kichen, bathroom and living room...good location...communication with Mike and Laurie was so easy and helpful!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this family friendly home away from home! The kitchen had anything we could ever need, there was a variety of board games, and lots of sleeping space.
We hope to be back again when we're in the area!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This Air BnB was great. It was fully furnished and had everything we needed to cook, sleep, and live comfortably. Mike and Laurie are great hosts who kept in great contact with me. It was a wonderful place with wonderful hosts."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this home. The location was perfect and central to everything we enjoy doing in Duluth. The beds are comfortable, we loved being able to park our car in the garage, the kitchen was nice, and the neighborhood was quiet and felt safe."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute house perfect and place to stay in Duluth - very well equipped! Would definitely stay again!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely lovely house, a quiet retreat in the delightful Duluth."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Laurie's house was perfect for our weekend getaway to the North Shore. They included a ton of information about the area, things to do, and places to eat, just a bunch of local recommendations for how to spend our time.
The house was very close to groceries and gas, but you need to drive down the highway a bit to get into town, but that wasn't a problem as the neighborhood was nice and quiet. Just be warned that parking was pretty tight and the roads were very bumpy."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect home for families visiting Duluth. The location is fantastic and greatly appreciated accommodations. Two places to park off the street, clean home with board games and reading material about the area (including a wonderful booklet put together by the hosts!) There is also a ping pong table downstairs. A park with a basketball hoop and playground is within walking distance also. 10/10 would recommend this home and visiting Duluth in general. I strongly recommend booking a train ride with the Duluth Depot ahead of time! We can’t wait to come stay again when there isn’t a weekend full of rain. Thank you to Mike & Laurie for providing a safe and lovely stay for our family on our trip."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent hosts! Lovely house- very clean throughout. It had everything we needed for our three night stay.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home is very cozy and nicely updated. The option to park in a garage overnight was a nice benefit.
Sure beats sitting in a hotel room during evening down time.
The guest booklets highlighting Duluth activities was a great source to have on hand.
Laurie and Mike went to a lot of effort for guests."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay in Duluth! The house was immaculate when we arrived and had everything we could have needed from kitchen things to toiletries in the shower. A lot of thought was put into this home! The neighborhood is very quiet and there are 2 off street parking options which was really nice as well. Mike and Laurie were very quick to respond and even reached out when they realized we had forgotten something at the house. Absolutely would stay here again!
