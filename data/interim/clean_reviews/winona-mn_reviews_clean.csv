2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Within walking distance of the River, Grocery Store, Liquor Store, and Several downtown restaurants. And for me close to my aunt‚Äôs apartment."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. We had one issue with the access code but it was resolved within minutes, very responsive and accommodating."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Unit 21 was well maintained and very comfortable except for the bed which was not! We have stayed in 2 other units and don‚Äôt remember the beds as being so hard. Otherwise we have no complaints.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great central spot in Winona; easy to get everywhere; would love to experience this town and lodging in warmer seasons too!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first Air BnB experience. Check-in, building access, and unit access were all clearly and accurately explained by the host.
The unit was clean, comfortable, and had just about everything we could want.
The Exchange is walkable to area coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and a neat little public open space where are musicians performed each night we were there (for FREE!).
I remember seeing something in the descriptions stating there might be noise from the street or possibly upstairs. We were on the second floor and did not experience any noise issues at all.
Great spot.
Great stay.
Well prepared space.

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place but if you didn‚Äôt come with a dog you really don‚Äôt want to see dog hair in the bathroom. I cleaned it! Crumbs in kitchen table chair. I cleaned no biggie. Did not appreciate the response from owner. This showed me that I should always take pictures because owners think the cleaners never make mistakes or slack. Overall nice building, nice bed. Most important I was able to cook a meal.. Only thing missing was IRON!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful stay!! We loved our time at the Exchange.
My husband and I decided to take a mid-week escape and drive down from the Twin Cities to Winona to hike and visit with friends + family. We've stayed at different hotels and BnB's in Winona over the years, but the Exchange is the best of them all by far.
Finding the Exchange was very easy and smooth, just on 4th street close to downtown near the levee park. Access was simple - the electronic door codes worked first time, every time. Building was quiet and secure, with super beautiful historic details inside.
The unit itself is gorgeous! The windows are huge and let in so much light, especially because it's a corner unit, with great sunsets and views of the bluff. You feel like you're perched above the street in a really peaceful way. Beautiful floor and finishings throughout. Seriously comfortable bed!!!!
We will definitely be staying again. What an asset to Winona! If you can book this building for your stay - do it!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful building and apartment. Very clean and spacious. Comfortable bed and well stocked kitchen, where I made a large breakfast. Will definitely be returning when we visit our daughter at college."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed the beautiful ""Cozy Casita."" It honestly exceeded our expectations. It was not only clean and comfortable, but generously stocked with all that we needed. Because I knew we'd be cooking most of our means, I brought along my good frying pan and my knives, but I need not have. The kitchen was beautifully supplied and the same can be said of the bathrooms and linen closets. Just bring yourselves! Also, I want to note that the house is nicely located by the lake, as advertised. There are biking and walking trails, and there is a place to rent, quite inexpensively, canoes, kayaks and paddleboards. All of this is just steps from the front door."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a charming place in Winona, with the lake only a few steps away! Was convenient to walk/drive to restaurants and more. Hope to stay here again for our next visit!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at several Airbnb's. Mary's place hands down, was one of the nicest we have stayed at.
We love the area. We were up visiting our son at the Univ of Lacrosse. Quick easy ride across the bridge into Minn. Our family is very outdoorsy and the hiking in the drift less region and walkable paths around the lake were magnificent.
I wish we could have stayed longer."

Very clean and thoughtfully decorated, bright and cheery throughout, with a lovely kitchen and full-sized dining table for those who like to cook. Two nice-sized bedrooms, with VERY comfortable beds and lovely linens. Perfect for our family of 3 adults during our recent weekend visit to Winona - we can't wait to stay here again! :-)"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, cozy, extremely clean, quiet place! My college girlfriends and I drove from various states and met in Winona for a weekend to connect. This house could not have been more PERFECT! The space was absolutely perfect. The house is on a quiet street where you can see the lake, enjoy walking, and sit for hours and chat because everything about it is so charming. The beds were SO comfortable. I have stayed in many airbnb's and I can honestly say this has been my favorite! If you're in the area, it's a must stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The Cozy Casita is clean and homey, nestled in a prime Winona neighborhood with views of the bluffs overlooking Lake Winona.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary‚Äôs place is warm and inviting, the spaces and items clean and of good quality and condition.
The space is perfect for 2-3 adults. The only interesting thing to note is the bathroom has two doors, one attached to one of the bedrooms and the other that opens into a small vanity area and then kitchen. This door, however, is quite skinny and while not necessarily an issue, it‚Äôs worth noting in case anyone requires a wider accommodation due to disability or similar reasons.
The beds are comfortable and the rooms cooled by ceiling fan and window a/c unit, which are powerful enough to cool the main shared space off the bedrooms in late August.
The location is wonderful, just steps from Lake Park and Lake Winona, and the neighborhood is safe and quiet, close to grocery stores, restaurants, Target, etc.
We enjoyed our weekend stay and found Mary very attentive and responsive. We would not hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to someone who is traveling to the area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I cannot say enough good things about the host and this house! She goes out of her way to make you feel at home. She thought of so many things to help you feel like you were cared for. I can‚Äôt recommend this place more! And, the location is nylons perfect and peaceful. The view and town is absolutely what I‚Äôd consider to be dreamy."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was the perfect place for my friend and I to stay during our annual get together/teacher preparation.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Unique architecture. Enjoyed the study area while working remotely. Spacious kitchen for cooking fresh food from the nearby coop. Comfortable sitting and sleeping.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cool house. Spacious. Great water pressure in showers. Great acoustics for my Bose surround. We were in Winona to clean out mother in-laws apartment, as a result added to kitchen furnishings. We left some goodies behind for our next visit as we often cook a lot when visiting Winona and we entertain family and friends. Noise was not an issue.

And the fireplace was an excellent amenity on the cold days. Beds are super comfortable, kitchen has everything you would need to prepare meals. And Adam provided clear instructions and helpful hints about parking in Winona during the winter. I will definitely be back."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By a long shot, this is the best Airbnb I've ever stayed in!! This place was everything it is made out to be, and then some. The location is incredible and with the unit being the entire building, it was very private. The coziness and cleanliness made me feel like this is a home I could live in. The coffeehouse next door is the best I've been to in a while, too. I'll be back here, for sure!!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love staying in these older buildings, they have an energy that is hard to explain. The place was super clean and the location was perfect for my job. The house is beautiful inside and out and one of my favorite stays over the last few years."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Adam was a wonderful host. The place was great. Lots of ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor. Would be very happy to stay here again!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful getaway
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful little gem located in downtown Winona. Everything you could need is within walking distance from pubs, restaurants, movie theater, grocery store, and coffee shops. During the day, we ventured to wineries along the Mississippi and in the evening, we enjoyed walking around town. The airbnb was gorgeous! So meticulously designed with great thought and felt like we were at home. I love historical architecture and this property did not disappoint with the exposed brick and beams. The double sided fireplace was a nice touch. Everything was lovely, we really enjoyed our stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love this home-the photos are spot on. It is beautifully decorated and spacious. Adam is a wonderful host - responsive and pleasant. I hope to stay again some time.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is beautiful! It‚Äôs cozy, well designed and very well kept. Winona is a great town and the location is perfect for walking to restaurants, bars and town activities. We‚Äôll definitely be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a lovely space! Everything was great!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would buy this house and live in it if it were available! The house has been beautifully restored and stylishly decorated. The location is perfect and very walkable to everywhere. A COOP store, popular bar, coffeehouse and The Boat House restaurant are all very close by. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms clean and well designed. I hope to have another reason to return to Winona so I can stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sisters and I felt very comfortable at the home. Absolutely beautifully designed and maintained. Looked just like pictured. Adam was so helpful and patient with me, I am new at online dealings and he always responded right away. The home is within short walking distance‚Äôs to many things. Has everything in the home to make your stay enjoyable. We especially loved the patio. We would recommend this home with 5 stars and more."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Adam‚Äôs place on Jackson. The environment was pleasant & relaxing, minimalist, spacious interior with artistic decor and homey comfort. The kitchen was stocked with all we needed & having the stellar Co-op for groceries right across the street made shopping for provisions a treat. Adam sent a list of favorite places to dine which enhanced our stay. The Blue Heron coffee shop next door is a gem. We enjoyed that morning ritual, and walking along the river at Levee Park. The location was great for us as we attended the Boats & Bluegrass music fest 3 miles away‚Äîenjoying luxurious digs over camping! Communication from Adam was the best. He even sent a picture of my shoes I left behind found under the coffee table & promptly shipped them back to me. Top notch service & stellar property! Thank you Adam."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is absolutely amazing! The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. Great location close to everything. Adam was extremely responsive and helpful. He made our girls weekend so easy we all said when we come back to Winona we will definitely use this place again and recommend it to everyone we know
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We‚Äôd give Adam‚Äôs place 10 stars if we could. It is just as beautiful as pictured, well- furnished, comfortable beds and quality linens, completely stocked kitchen, interior and exterior space. The location is perfect for anyone wanting downtown Winona, a block to the Levee Park and flyway Trail, a half block to an excellent co-op, a block to a movie theater, and near to other downtown points of interest. Though Adam mentions the downtown noise and provides brown noise machines for his guest‚Äôs comfort, we were not bothered. It‚Äôs a challenge to make a home both loft like and cozy. Adam achieved this superbly. A gentleman walking up the street asked how we liked it, saying he‚Äôd heard it‚Äôs the best airbnb in Winona. We agree."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Had a great time! Space was very clean which made the 90 year old grandmas happy :) super close to restaurants and the river.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second of Adam's units that we have stayed at in Winona. This is the most beautiful airbnb we have stayed at. It's as described, but the photos can't do it justice. It's spacious and uncluttered. Adam clearly cares about the unit and gives thought to the furniture and decor and to the comfort of his guests. The last time we were here it was the middle of winter and we really didn't explore the town. This time the weather was superb and we really enjoyed exploring the exceptional architecture and the scenic beauty. A great introduction in season is the Winona Tour Boat. The captain shares so much information and history of the area. The Minnesota Marine Art Museum is a must see. We are looking forward to enjoying more of Winona, and we will most definitely be staying at one of Adam's units."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay here. We were comfortable and happy here. Great location. Very clean!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A stunning home, we felt so lucky to be in such a beautifully designed, well appointed, comfortable and cool place. Highly recommend!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing stay at Adam's place! Lots to do in the area within walking distance of the property, but the place itself also has everything you would need for a cozy night in. We especially enjoyed the indoor gas fireplace and the private outdoor patio in the back. Check in and check out were both smooth as can be, and the place was spotless and spacious. We felt right at home and would love to come back :)"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is one of the best places we've ever stayed!! It is spacious, very clean, and beautifully decorated. It was a delight to cook in the well equipped kitchen and relax on the chaise lounge in the living room. The location in downtown Winona made it easy to walk to some great coffee shops and restaurants. Adam is a friendly and responsive host! We would love to stay in this home again soon. Thank you Adam, for your hospitality!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Checked ALL the boxes for our stay! Great space and location. Loved the upstairs and downstairs outdoor patios! Wonderful place to rest and play while we were in Winona for our annual Shakespeare Festival weekend. Will stay againüòÅ
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the house is beautiful. very clean and newly remodeled. everything worked great. very convenient to everything downtown. There is only street parking, which there is plenty of. We had 2 trucks with trailers, and not hard to find a spot within a block. We would definitely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This please is beautiful, and everyone enjoyed and gave great compliments about the place. Adam was very good at communicating and was even able to get us in a little early day of check in! Thank you!!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"My friends and I had a wonderful stay at this home! We loved the beautifully remodeled historic building. Great kitchen space, plenty of areas for seating, relaxing, and privacy when desired. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying in this beautiful space! The pictures don't do it justice - the inside is gorgeous. The building is immaculate with every detail paid special attention. It was incredibly clean, well taken care of, and you can tell the owners took pride in restoring it. The exposed brick was amazing! The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals, which we did often. Every morning was spent having coffee on the back deck, even in the rain since it was partially covered. Noise was never an issue for us. There was just enough to do within walking distance, but we also were able to relax inside on our one rainy day. Walking to the downtown was extremely convenient with almost anything you'd need close by (a co-op grocery, restaurants, movie theater, ice cream, coffee, etc.). Blooming Grounds Coffee Shop was just a few blocks away, & we spent several afternoons there with books & coffee. Thanks, Adam, for sharing your home with us! Can't wait to come back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stay in Winona every year and this is by far the best place we've stayed. It's beautiful and comfortable, and you cannot beat the location. The apartment is spacious and beautifully decorated. It was very comfortable for our family of five. The kitchen had everything we needed. And Adam was super-responsive and friendly. We'll be back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was super cool with a modern industrial flair. Everything was perfect, as usual with Adam's places. We loved it!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had the pleasure of booking this place for our guest, and I must say it was truly an amazing experience. Our guests were able to fully concentrate on their business matters without any disruptions, allowing them to accomplish their tasks efficiently and within their desired timeframe.
One aspect that stood out to me was Adam's exceptional responsiveness. He promptly attended to all our messages, ensuring that our needs were met with utmost efficiency. His attentiveness and professionalism greatly enhanced the overall positive experience.
After witnessing our guests' fantastic stay, I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone in search of a tranquil and private retreat. The combination of the serene environment and excellent service make it an ideal choice for both business and leisure travelers. I can confidently say that I will definitely book this place again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is one of my best rentals ever. Spotless clean and everything we needed. Adam was always very responsive and quick to help when needed.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome - very gorgeous and comfortable, and walkable to all there is in downtown Winona!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A great place to stay away from home felling at home, and a great host, 100% recommended!!!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house with everything you need! Walkable to stores and restaurants with good amount of parking about a block away! Close to river as well- short walk! Would stay here again! 10/10 recommend!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I had a great stay at Adam's place in Winona! We loved the design of the space and the comfort of all the furniture. While we had a short weekend stay, we could easily envision staying at this place for longer, considering how well stocked the kitchen area was with cooking basics. The location was so convenient and is just steps away from great restaurants, coffeehouses, and parks. Would recommend and are likely to stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous property! Especially clean and comfortable! Owner offered many conveniences to enhance the stay. Location convenient to walk to local restaurants and bars and easy access to local outdoor activities such as biking and hiking!
Near a busy road that supports traffic so when windows open it was hard to block out the noise while sleeping! However, that was a minor inconvenience considering all other attributes!
Hope to go back and stay again!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, clean place to stay in the heart of Winona! walkable to basically everything in town and plenty of room for the whole family"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam has a great location in downtown Winona, definitely unique and worth the stay! Very accessible and accommodating, makes sense why he‚Äôs a super host."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This house was absolutely beautiful. We‚Äôll definitely be back & super clean.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Adam's space for our staff during a conference in downtown Winona. To have a space for working, resting, and recharging so close to everything in downtown was fantastic. The space itself is incredibly restored, and the attention to detail in furnishings and finishes was top notch. Will definitely find a reason to book again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is stunning! And you can't beat the location. We loved being able to walk around downtown.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Thanks Adam
A great place to stay in town with walking distance to restaurants and levee park.
Very comfortable! Will definitely book again next visit."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,üòÄ
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adam was responsive and has a beautiful space. Will definitely book again.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely renovation. Photos and description are accurate. The kitchen is fabulous and had everything we needed to prep meals. We expected the bar noise, and there is bar noise until after 1 a.m. We did not expect the industrial noise starting well before 6 a.m. We were hoping for a comfortable mattress but, didn‚Äôt find that to be the case.
This is great spot for a larger group, plenty of room to spread out. Many restaurants and shops in an easy walking distance. If you are not noise sensitive and want to be downtown Winona in a cool building , this place fits the bill."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adam thanks for another great stay. We really appreciate your responsiveness. It‚Äôs an easy walk to all the downtown restaurants with a great coffee shop right next door. Looking forward to returning when we are back in Winona.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The structure, both inside and outside, was absolutely beautiful. Felt like a piece of Winona history. All the amenities of home."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam thanks for a great stay. We really enjoyed the location close to restaurants, coffee shop and grocery store. Very comfortable Airbnb with lots of updates & amenities."
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a wonderful place! we appreciated the full kitchen and amenities and other lovely touches. We walked to shopping and dinner, and enjoyed the bar across the street. There is even a coffeeshop next door! the beds are great too. Honestly my only regret is that the weather wasn't nice enough to sit on the back deck and enjoy a fire. üòÅ Our family really enjoyed our stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The space was great‚Äîwell appointed, clean, and comfortable. Host was very responsive. We would happily stay here again. For others planning to stay here, a couple minor points to mention. First, the bar across the street can get a little loud at night with patrons hanging out on the back patio. Second, while it is a dog friendly unit, you do have to walk your dog a block or two away from the property for potty breaks (host does not allow them to do their business anywhere on the property). This was really only a pain because it was so cold during our stay. Overall, would absolutely recommend, and hope we can make it back in the summer sometime!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second stay with Adam- will definitely stay again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great job renovating. We found ourselves wondering what the history of the building was and what it looked like. Very relaxing and private. The only issue I had was parking. No parking sign in front of the house on both sides of the street, but cars still parked there all day/night long. Turns out (after a $15 parking ticket) the no parking only applies to ONE spot next to the alley. We stayed in the winter and the yellow curb was covered with snow. Thank you Adam!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was exactly what we wanted. I'd describe it as comfortable, cozy, amenities were perfect, clean and easy. Adam was a great host with spot on restaurant suggestions. The location is perfect for walking to supper or a scenic stroll."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very nicely updated and clean. Looks just like the pictures show. We enjoyed the cozy vibes from the fireplace and being walkable to a lot of local spots. It was also so nice to have a full kitchen with pretty much everything we needed for cooking. Only minor things I would say to be aware of is that the sounds from outside can be heard fairly easily inside the house, but the bedroom we stayed in had a white noise machine which was nice and helpful. Also there is not a designated parking space for the house, but Adam was very helpful and descriptive about letting us know where we were able to park. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay here again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Adam‚Äôs place for the weekend to celebrate our daughters birthday (she‚Äôs a student at WSU). My parents joined us for that weekend and our daughter and her boyfriend spent quite a bit of time at the house with us and we all had plenty of room to spread out. The house was incredibly clean (I‚Äôm super picky about cleanliness and it exceeded my expectations), was beautifully decorated, well stocked kitchen and had just about everything you could need for cooking a nice meal as far as dishes, utensils, pots and pans.
We will definitely be back again! Adam did an overall incredible job on not only resorting this beautiful building but also paid great attention to every detail to make your stay as comfortable as possible."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay. Bar across the street got a little noisy at closing time but we were still awake anyway so wasn‚Äôt a big deal.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an incredible stay here. The house was beautifully decorated and clean. Street parking was convenient. The location was great too. Adam was very helpful and responsive. We would love to stay here again!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Adam‚Äôs property was comfortable and clean. Within walking distance to many good restaurants. Adam was very flexible when we needed to add a few nights on to reservation. Will definitely stay here again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my favorite place I've stayed at in Winona! Can't beat the location, how modern and comfortable it is and love the fireplace!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was perfect for my husband and I plus 2 more young families. Plenty of cooking pots and pans. Lots of room for young kids to play. Stayed during winter months so overnight parking on the required side of the street was a bit tricky.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, clean and well taken care of!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is beautifully renovated and comfortable. We loved the location downtown and being close to the river. Adam is a thorough and friendly host. We‚Äôll look forward to being there again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is amazing! Celebrated a big birthday with girlfriends and had the best time. Such a cozy atmosphere and plenty of room for 6. Convenient and easy walk to bars/restaurants. Adam was a great host and very responsive.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great new option for Winona - we had a wonderful time. The location is right near downtown shops and restaurants - you can walk to most anything. We had a great stay and the host was helpful with making recommendations for fun in the area. The place is well equipped and designed to be comfortable. Parking is a little tricky due to the rules in the area, but there will likely be something nearby.
We are already thinking about coming back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic stay highly recommend. Very family friendly. Scott went above and beyond to make trip easy!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Scott‚Äôs place is in a private setting with fabulous views over the Mississippi, just as described. The house was tidy and well furnished with lots of space for the family on rainy days. We will look to stay again if we‚Äôre in the Winona area!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"I can't begin to say how wonderful our stay was. everything was clean, there were a lot of things provided like games, hygiene products, dishes, some food items, and stocked drinks that they most certainly didn't have to provide.
Scott was great at replying to questions and accommodating when it came to us needing a little earlier check in. Would definitely stay again!!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a beautiful home that is equipped to entertain. Inside games, TVs set to use our streaming services. Outside fire pit and deck with a view. Definite noise from traffic on the road and trains along the river, but that is easily overshadowed by the gorgeous home and secluded location."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was our second time staying here, and it was great once again. The house has a great layout for cooking food and hanging out. The kitchen is well stocked with pots/pans/dishes, and has a great layout for cooking and entertaining. The host has clear and easy instructions for the house, which makes it easy to figure things out.
Thanks for the great weekend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Serene. Great views. Easy access to Winona. Was a great location to gather family from various places. There was plenty of space to enjoy each other‚Äôs company, eat and play games."

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great time at Scott's place. It is a beautiful property and location.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved it here and felt right at home! Everything was as described and there were plenty of beds to fit everyone! The place was beautiful and we loved every minute there!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott was very responsive and accommodating. The home is massive! There is even more to the home than shown in the pictures, specifically, 2 beautiful sunrooms on the top floor. The views are amazing and the firepit was a perfect way to spend the evening. I highly recommend this home and the hosts!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great house for a group! This was my second stay at Scott's house and had a great experience both times. The house is clean and check in was easy. Great house with even better views.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great house! Thanks again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is fantastic! Better than the photos, so many thoughtful details. I‚Äôm almost afraid to gush about it as much as I want, in fear of it not being available next time. üòÜ
The views are gorgeous, the sleeping spaces many and varied, the kitchen well-appointed. Linens are abundant, beds are comfortable, and the fancy bathroom feels so luxurious!
Scott was a great communicator, reaching out immediately upon booking to inquire about our needs, and responding quickly both times I had questions.
Our party numberered ten in total, and with all the little nooks in there place we had room for multiple activities as well as space for privacy."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Scott‚Äôs place is spacious and amazing, clean and very family friendly. I would recommend it to any family."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Large home, great space for families. The bedrooms are laid out on the ends of the home creating space between them for optimal privacy. The view of the Mississippi River is spectacular."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a fantastic stay!! We have stayed here in the past and will certainly be back. From outstanding communication and flexible accommodations to a clean and cozy spot to be with family- we were so pleased!
Scott has made it an easy and nice experience to stay at this beautiful home. Even had additional perks from the last time we stayed and upgrades in the home!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was absolutely wonderful from start to finish! The home is absolutely beautiful and well taken care of. It feels so peaceful there and was a huge bonus the Christmas decor was out. Scott was very responsive and accommodating. We are impressed and will definitely be back!
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had our extended family stay here for our daughter‚Äôs college graduation. It was a very nice accommodating space for the entire clan, plenty of room and outstanding views. The chef‚Äôs kitchen was perfect for preparing the family dinner after graduation. Scott was always available and very responsive to our inquiries. If you have a larger group of people and want a very comfortable spot, I highly recommend this house!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our stay! This is a beautiful home with the most stunning views of the Mississippi! I cooked Thanksgiving dinner and although it's always tough to cook in a strange kitchen, things went quite well. I did have to bring some specialty items from home like a zester and lemon juicer, most of the things I needed were here. One thing I wish I had brought was an instant read thermometer. The kitchen has one, but it's pretty small, more for steak than a turkey.
The primary suite was large and gracious. We made use of the living room and family room fireplaces. It was nice to have access to a large garage to put our cars in. The downstairs is very roomy and has 3 bedrooms and an office. I do wish there was one more full bathroom, but it was fine with only 4-6 people staying this trip.
They are dealing with some water issues, but I'm confident things will get taken care of. They worked hard to get it ready for our stay, and I appreciate that. We would definitely stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,We had an outstanding experience! The property and the host exceeded our expectations and provided everything we were looking for.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always Scott was proactive, professional, and top notch in communication, and the property. Have zero hesitation about anything associated with this host or the beautiful house and property. A+."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a view! Also was pleased to find this place was even nicer than expected from the photos. Scott and Kendra are great hosts, responsive, and put some personal touches into making our stay enjoyable. The house was kept very clean and well stocked of all the things we needed. Kitchen is very large and fully usable, we were able to make some excellent meals, including a fancy Coq au Vin. There is plenty of room to spread out and relax. As with any stay had some minor issues, but Scott was very responsive, and nothing that detracted from enjoying our stay.
Love staying in this area! So many great places to go hiking. Just minutes away from Winona, for food and supplies, also some nice coffee shops (Blue Heron and Blooming Grounds are excellent!). Close enough to La Crosse so we can drive to some real nice restaurants (highly recommend Lovechild, and Le Chateau / Le Cave). Another fun fall road trip!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Eleven of us held our Third Annual Active Women's Retreat at Scott's AirBNB. The home was so very comfortable with gorgeous views of the fall colors, the Mississippi River, and the night skies. We were close to multiple state parks and trails for hiking and biking as well as a bit of touristy things to do in the nearby cities and towns. The gathering rooms were large enough to accommodate all of us, but there were also several quiet nooks for alone time to read and relax. There were enough beds for all of us to have our except for two. There was ample space in the kitchen for meal prep and serving with all of the necessary amenities. We highly recommend this home for larger groups and would happily stay here again."

A very special place to stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,There was more to the house than what was described. Very spacious and pleasantly surprised. We enjoyed our stay while we celebrated our daughter‚Äôs wedding.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful home. Beautiful view.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"The view makes this place worth it alone! This house is huge with enough room to sleep a lot of people. They even have a take a beer leave a beer fridge! Awesome, awesome host. We had an issue with the air conditioning on a holiday weekend and he had someone there to look at it in less than an hour!! We were blown away by this place and the host. There is so much space and I said it already but the VIEW!!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location. Amazing host. Very professional and responsive. Thoughtful choice of items to make our stay more pleasant and comfortable. Loved reading from the host's library with an excellent collection of classic books and board games. It is in a quiet part of town and so will need your own transportation. If you are looking for a relaxing place with all necessary amenities, this property will be a great choice."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,House is very large and plenty of room for big groups- has all the amenities you‚Äôll need and the view is amazing. We spent the weekend exploring the area and having bonfires on the patio at night. Scott was great and made sure we had everything we needed. Will definitely be back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Such a beautiful home, when a great view. The location was only a short drive into Winona. Lots of space for everyone to stay, and the host was very responsive."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great home & great host!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for letting us stay Scott! We will definitely be looking for your place again if we are ever in the area. We were blown away by how peaceful the property was. And the views were to die for. Wish we had a longer stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location with a beautiful view of the Mississippi River. Very spacious. It was perfect for our extended family get together. Highly recommended.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We just got back from Scott‚Äôs place and that place was immaculate. There were 11 of us ranging from 8 years old to 78 years old and all of us were comfortable. The house has a million dollar view of the river and looks better than the pictures. We are already talking about returning to Scott‚Äôs place for our next family gathering. Highly recommended!!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful house in the bluffs of Winona! Great views of the Mississippi, super clean, and very accommodating. Great host!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"5-star rental! Our group of 8 had plenty of room, whether it was cooking in the kitchen or sleeping arrangements, the home was spacious and big enough for a large group to enjoy. The view from the deck was beautiful, and the lower patio firepit was perfect for relaxing in the evening. We enjoyed the gaming tables and bar area in the basement, hopefully future visitors will enjoy some of the beverages we left behind. Most time was spent in the kitchen, and the little sunroom off the kitchen was a great coffee spot in the morning. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes, cooking utensils, and misc items that you never seem to remember to bring with but somehow always end up needing. I think our group most enjoyed the stereo/speaker system that goes throughout the house, as it was great to be able to plug in a phone and listen to some tunes while cooking and hanging out. Easy/clear instructions from host made it a great stay.
We enjoyed our stay and I would definitely book again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Scott provided a great environment for my daughter and her bridal group for her wedding. His home is huge, welcoming, spacious...it had everything. It was secluded, peaceful, amazing view of the Mississippi. My daughter and friends absolutely loved it. I was able to show it to other family members and they will look to book on future trips to Winona. Thank you Scott for everything. As good and even better than advertised."

2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a beautiful home. The pictures don't show just how much space there really is. We had a group of 7 people and did not even get to use it all. It's clean, comfortable, has everything you need, and definately lots of privacy, if needed. The views are beautiful of the winter river. The host was very responsive and went above and beyond to ensure the driveway was plowed for our arrival and departure. There are a ton of pamplets on the surrounding areas, which was nice for our group. All of us recommend this home, you can't go wrong!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a beautiful home exactly as described in the listing. We had a great time staying there and there was plenty of space for our entire group. Everything was clean just as you would expect. The host (Scott) was easy to communicate with and was very responsive. The wintertime views of scenery from this house were beautiful, I can only imagine that the spring, summer, and fall views are even better! Hands down would stay here again!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is immaculate! Panoramic views of the river, plenty of space for a large family, great outdoor area, just awesome."
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Place was amazing and very comfortable! We were there for a girls trip to visit Winona State where we met 26th years ago! One night was spent at the house and one out at campus and bars! Very beautiful views, a steep hill to get up but worth it! Scott was very responsive when we had a few things come up he was a great host! Definitely would come back to stay!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great weekend at this gorgeous home celebrating my sister‚Äôs birthday! The space was clean, spacious, and had a beautiful view of the Mississippi. Check in and check out was very easy with a key pad door. Scott was extremely responsive and friendly! My only critique is that the driveway was a bit icy but that‚Äôs par for the course during a Minnesota winter. Highly recommend this Airbnb for a Winona stay!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,A spectacular house with truly amazing views. Scott the host reached out to us immediately attending to any needs we may have. An excellent place to make memories with family and have a great Foosball game or two.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The stay was amazing. We got a bunch of details about the house and check in/check out procedure. We loved the flexible check in time since no one was staying the day before us. Everything in the house was very clean and Scott was very willing to answer any questions.

The internet which we were concerned with worked excellent when our daughter had to be on it for work. Thank you from r sharing it with us!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful spot and property!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a true gathering house. The open lay-out has the kitchen and eating area opening up to a spacious family room; however, there is a separate living room and formal dining room so that your group is not stuck together all the time in one living area. In addition the walk-out ground level has another family room/game room type space with a bar. Kitchen was well supplied. We needed nothing. Beds were comfortable and linens/towels were hotel-grade. And Scott added a few extras which made us feel welcome. As noted in all the reviews - the main feature is the oversized deck giving you a panoramic view of the Mississippi River. When not exploring Winona, we spent all our time on that deck. And by the way. Winona is a great place to spend a few days."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,A great experience
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful view of the Mississippi River and lots of privacy in country. Plenty of space for our group of 13.
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This an amazing house with incredible views of the Mississippi River. Seven of us had more beds than we needed. The house was clean, well stocked and had plenty of room to spread out. Scott, the owner, was extremely prompt in his emails and responses. We will be back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home was a great gathering place for a fantastic wedding experience. The views and space were wonderful.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for our family to gather for the weekend. Several of us drove in from Kansas for a family members high-school graduation. There was plenty of room to cook, eat meals together, and hang out. The best part is the house has an amazing view but is still close to Winona to enjoy the city."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wow - what a beautiful home and view to share with family and friends. The cleanliness of the home is impeccable and it has room for everyone. This is the perfect retreat for your family, a group of friends and a group just wanting to get away from your daily routines and spend some time at the ""house in the tree tops"""
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful views and lots of space. Owner got back very quickly with a few questions we had. Driveway is steep but plenty of parking at the top. Wonderful photo opportunities. We would stay here again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home in a beautiful location! Scott went above and beyond to be sure our visit was all we hoped it would be. Highly recommend!!!
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent location with breathtaking views from every room on the main floor. Plenty of space for multiple families, although there are only 2 showers. Excellent communication with the owners; they had instructions and pointers for everything from check in to the fact that cell service can be spotty. Fully stocked kitchen, patio furniture, firewood, etc. to make the experience great. We had an issue with the A/C but I think it was just bad luck that we were the there the first time of the season the system was needed. Overall a good experience and fun weekend.
It did fall short of a five star experience for a few reasons. It's certainly hard to overlook the fact it was 85 degrees in the house when we arrived and the A/C was not capable of cooling the main floor below 78 until we had a night dip into the low 50s. Not many windows open, and you really don't want them open at night because there are loud trains that come through what seems like once an hour. If you don't like very firm mattresses you'd better bring some sort of pad with you. Definitely bring your own pillow, none are great. There is no range hood so the kitchen will get very smokey if any sort of pan frying is done. The grill was not functional, bring your own.
We paid $600 per night for 2 weekend nights...I think we kind of envisioned this large lavish estate with really impressive amenities. The view is nothing short of spectacular but the house itself is basically like taking an average middle class home and multiplying the space by 3."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home! If you are considering this home, book now. If was perfect for our extended family to celebrate our daughter‚Äôs graduation. It was nice to have ever in one place."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Quite simply, this is a fabulous place to stay. We came with high expectations, and the reality surpassed those high expectations. A beautiful house in a great location with a really nice host -- couldn't ask for anything more."
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wow! Wow! Wow! This is truly one of the best Airbnb places we've stayed in, without question. This is an amazing home with amenities galore that is only bested by the spectacular views. The master bedroom and bath made us feel like we had gained the status of royalty. Loads of space, which was great for our family get together. Scott was great with communicating. If you're in the area and looking for a place to stay, this is definitely one you should consider."

The owners are super easy to work with and very accommodating. If you are considering staying at this house I highly recommend it!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Home description was perfect, but seeing it in person gave it justice. The house, the views, the openness, etc. Scott was a great host available to answer any questions we had. Was also very accommodating with check in so we could spend every possible minute with my son who lives and works locally. The house was stocked of everything, and it made our Thanksgiving holiday that much easier, without having to worry about anything."

2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We endorse this place wholeheartedly--a 5 star rating, plus extra for responsive communication. My cousins, sister-in-law and I celebrated our annual reunion here. It was everything we hoped for. Lots of space, great accommodations, cleanliness, kitchen amenities, etc. The owner is extremely responsive, and even installed grab bars to help one cousin in climbing the stairs from the garage into the house. The surrounding area is beautiful, grocery store and pharmacy close, plus attractions such as the Marine Museum (yes!) and the National Eagle Center. Fall is apple season (try them!)."

2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,This house is perfect for a large family gathering or just some quiet time enjoying the spectacular view of the Mississippi river. Location is perfect. Easily accessible off the highway. Fantastic layout for family gatherings. House is well stocked with all the essentials. Owners left drinks for us upon arrival which was a nice touch!! House was clean. Scott was a fabulous host available at any time. Directions were clear and posted in multiple spots. This is an AA+ house. We cannot wait to come back. Internet was spotty due to location of the house was the only negative but we made it work.
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is extremely roomy and beautiful. The kitchen was especially nice. Unfortunately, the access road is under construction and was very rough. Scott, the host, communicated well with us before, during, and after our stay. While we were there, we visited the Great River Wine Trail and the house was conveniently located for that. There are grocery stores and restaurants located nearby, in Winona. We had an excellent family vacation there!"

Yushi really put a lot of work into it and the space is great. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom is spacious, everything was super clean, and there's a restaurant and bowling alley almost in the same parking lot. It's a bit far from downtown to be walkable but it would only be a five minute drive at most."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great weekend getaway for my husband and me! Immaculate, private and super comfortable, close to downtown and restaurants. Highly recommend!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the nicest AirBnBs I've ever stayed at: beautifully decorated, clean, spacious, with thoughtful touches (like a white noise machine in each bedroom, clean and soft throw blankets around). The location is great, too. Right downtown with a wonderful coffee shop on one side and Japanese restaurant on the other. Finally, Adam was so informative and clearly wanted to make sure I had everything I needed for my stay without being intrusive. Highly recommend."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing as always! Loved the suite! Sushi is always amazing next door! Thanks for everything!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adam'd place was great! My husband and I needed a nice quiet place to get away for a night and it was just what we needed.

This was our 1st Airbnb experience and it's definitely left a good impression.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam's apartment was just what we were looking for to have a weekend getaway in Winona. It has plenty of space, is conveniently located downtown near shops, entertainment, and many places to eat. Adam does a great job of communicating and is very responsive. The apartment was clean, nicely updated, and quiet. This was a fantastic place to spend a couple of nights in town and would be great for longer stays, too."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome As Always
Will be back"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I always look for Adams listings when staying in Winona. They are all so tastefully decorated, spotless and comfortable. This unit in particular had a great view of downtown Winona and you could see Sugarloaf from both bedrooms! I loved the large historic windows in the bedroom and the beautiful bookcases throughout the unit. I felt like I was living in a place you see in magazines! This is a very convenient location if not the best location for food and coffee. The only downside of this place is the amount of stairs but Adam clearly points this out in the listing. If stairs will bother you in anyway, or you plan to buy lots of groceries for the kitchen, this might not be your place. I definitely feel like I stayed in shape while I indulged all week in Winona, so it was a benefit for me! I would stay here again, and I wish I could transport the unit to Seattle so I could live there all the time!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam‚Äôs place is great, just like his other properties. We‚Äôve stayed at one of his places the last four years. It‚Äôs always a wonderful experience."

All the design details were nice and all of the extra blankets laying around made it cozy. The tall windows were beautiful and the book collection was nice. We will stay there again when in town.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I almost don‚Äôt want to write a review because I feel Adam‚Äôs Suites are exceptional and still a little under the radar but they are as nice as any airb&b/Vrbo we‚Äôve stayed for college visits. Also have college kids at Madison WI and Columbia MO.
Coming from Chicago, with certain expectations for our accommodations and having stayed at other places in Winona, nothing comes close‚Ä¶Exceptional amenities, very clean, great location and Adam is super responsive and accommodating. Can‚Äôt say enough positives for his places. No brainer if coming to Winona."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome spot! We came up to Winona to ice climb and enjoyed the super comfy beds and incredible water pressure in the shower. The yoga mats were unexpected but a fantastic touch! The place was spotless and it was useful that there was shampoo/conditioner/soap and some basics stocked in the kitchen.
Also, Adam's detailed instructions were very helpful for understanding the complex parking restrictions.
If we come back to Winona we'll definitely stay again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Would stay there again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really nice apartment! Very clean and we didn‚Äôt hear the neighbors at all. Very nicely outfitted as far as blankets, towels and kitchen tools. Would love to stay again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, very responsive host. Thanks!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed in Adam's units several times over the past few months. It is always a PLEASURE as he has created a ""home away from home "" setting!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I can‚Äôt say enough great things about Adam‚Äôs place! It was pristine and comfortable and walkable to restaurants and the river. Can‚Äôt wait to stay there again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed here before and will stay again. Fantastic job! Thank you!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I have now stayed here three different times while staying in Winona! I absolutely love this place!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a peaceful stay. We enjoyed being right in downtown Winona. There were plenty of free parking spots around the Airbnb and lots of little shops and restaurants. As someone who is a light sleeper I didn't have any issues with the light traffic noise, perhaps in the summer there would be more people out and about being loud on the street late at night but since it was December it was pretty quiet. I appreciated the white noise machine, although we didn't need it.
I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great experience!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam called to be sure we understood the winter parking rules in Winona after I had questions, that was very helpful."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous space!!! Thank you Adam.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great top-floor space in a historic building with huge windows and new interior. Comfortable beds in spacious bedrooms with ample closet space made it easy to settle in for a couple days. Nice bathroom with an excellent shower. Open floor plan joins the kitchen and the living area.Comfortable furniture and giant tv made for a cozy movie night.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love this place!! I have stayed here twice and definitely plan to stay here any future times I visit Winona! A great place to stay!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean place. Very comfortable with all needed amenities. Adam is very helpful if needed.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend staying here while in Winona. I was born in Winona but have lived in NYC for years, and I was truly shocked by how lovely and large this airbnb was!! 10/10 recommend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a great stay! Our unit was very clean and beautifully decorated and we felt right at home. The location was great for walking to restaurants and gift shops. We caught a movie at the theater not even a block away. An excellent property and would definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space was stunning, decorated beautifully, modern, and in a very nice neighborhood. Close to shops an restaurants. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for the awesome stay it was great!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As always a great place to stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay in a great location! Adam is a great host and is always very responsive!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love staying at Adam's place and will definitely be back. We come up to visit my daughter, who is attending Winona State, and we're already looking for an excuse to plan our next trip to stay at one of Adam's rentals. They are absolutely beautiful, have everything you need, and are within walking distance of just about anything (or even a bike ride away). There are lots of things to do nearby, but you may not even want to leave the comfort of these units. This unit is up several staircases - if stairs aren't your thing, I wouldn't recommend it, but it was a nice workout for us (the great thing is, Adam has many other units that are ground level). I wish I could stay here forever."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would highly recommend Adam‚Äôs place. He is a super host with a beautiful place!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Soo much better in person as well!! The giant windows were so much more charming when you saw them in person. Loved how clean it smelt and looked. The floors squeaked they were soo clean! We felt as if everything had been thought of for us. Can‚Äôt wait to book again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a real gem in downtown Winona. The inside is gorgeous and comfortable and it is in walking distance to a great coffee shop, restaurants and bars. Would highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just another five star review for a five star stay! It is even better than the pictures portray. Stayed one night for a college visit, and wished we had more time to enjoy the beautiful space. We can only hope that it will be available the next time we‚Äôre in town. The outdoor stairs are likely tricky for some, but well worth it. My son is hoping for an apartment half as nice after dealing with dorm life :) Pro tip, Muddled Thyme has a great $10 takeout special 9-11pm. Easy walking distance, and an excuse to stay in. What a wonderful rental."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"3rd time staying at one of Adams places and it was fantastic as usual, love the location and the place is clean and well decorated, we‚Äôll be back again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best place! Always enjoy staying at Adam‚Äôs locations!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wife and I were in town to visit our daughter who plays soccer at St Mary‚Äôs. This place is a perfect 10 and we felt at home. Great location for restaurants and bars all within walking distance. We will definitely be staying here again on future visits to Winona. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting the area
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was as described, clean! Nice view, great location. Will stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Winona is changing for the better. Money will do that. Ten years ago downtown was dead, now it's back. In the center of it all is this really nice place. Super clean. Nice amenities. For a college town, quiet at night. (We were there Wednesday and Thursday. Weekends could be different.) The place is NOT handicap accessible: lots of stairs! This is honestly one of the nicest places we've stayed."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, super clean, and will be back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I'd be delighted to stay here again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was just as the photos. Beautifully decorated, luxurious and immaculate. We will be back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and spacious place. Adam was very communicative.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were very pleased with our stay here! Clean, spacious & perfect for a small family at the same price you‚Äôd pay for a hotel room. We will most definitely utilize Adam‚Äôs place in the future!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Greta place!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to spend the night while checking out the great river road.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rey clean and comfortable
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely LOVED this condo in the heart of Winona. The location can not be matched, it was clean, safe and extremely comfortable for the three of us. There are also wonderful coffee houses and restaurants that are all within a very short walking distance from the Airbnb. I have no idea if we will ever need to spend another night in Winona, but if we do, we will absolutely stay here. I cannot recommend this location or space enough, you will not want to leave!!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you. This space couldn't have been more comfortable.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an extremely well appointed apartment with a couple bedrooms (#7). There is a small well-lit office which would be handy if doing some work or have a need to be away from what is going on in the rest of the apartment. Zero complaints. A note, however, that there is not elevator so it makes for a few flights of stairs to access the space. Overall this is a fantastic place and Adam manages it all very well."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a wonderful place in the heart of downtown Winona. The space was very large and very comfortable and extremely clean. The cozy lights on throughout the space at check in made it feel at home from the moment we walked in the door.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a beautiful unit with plenty of space for our family. It is close to WSU campus. It is on an upper level of the building and thus there are lots of stairs to get to the door of the unit. But we had beautiful weather and we enjoyed walking to restaurants for dinner and drinks. Winona has a wonderful downtown for window shopping. We will be back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adam‚Äôs property is a great place to stay! It was impeccably clean and very comfortable. Lots of stairs, but we knew the situation when booking. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adam‚Äôs place is great‚Äîa true penthouse experience. Gorgeous huge windows and high ceilings, tastefully decorated. Oh, and the shower is really great too."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The apartment looks just like the pictures. Up-to-date, tidy, clean and comfortable. It was perfect. Thank you for a lovely stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great penthouse apartment. Massive windows, well decorated, clean, and spacious enough. Location is okay, best part is the Cafe that is less than a minute walk away. Highly recommend staying here. Fancy music in the hall ways."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unit 7 is super fantastic. Thank you, will plan to stay again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is great!!! Is one of the best places I have stayed at and I use Airbnb a fair amount. The place was clean, lots of space, comfortable beds, and linens.
You do have to walk 3 floors with your luggage and the WiFi in the back room is completely unreliable. Also, this host does not provide any extra food/snacks as some other places do."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay in one of Adam‚Äôs units and it was absolutely fantastic! The space is clean and very well decorated. I‚Äôm looking forward to my next stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. My friends from Winona were totally impressed at the apartment. They were already referring friends to stay there on visits. I will be back üòä
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment was exquisite--tastefully furnished, beautifully appointed, stocked with anything a person could need. Adam's properties are always A+ quality. I never stay anywhere else in Winona."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed one night and wished we were staying longer, it was so comfortable"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place. Hidden gem. Close to waterfront, coffe shops, and dining."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful loft apartment was better than a lot of the apartments I've stayed at in large cities like New York and Chicago, and it had a much better price tag than you'll find in the bigger cities. Much easier to get around a place the size of Winona, too with plenty of stuff to see and do. If you like the thought of staying in some big city special apartments you might want to try this place; you'll feel like your spending time in a big city without the larger price tag and a much easier and friendlier city like Winona to navigate around."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. Everything was as described, very clean and tidy and comfortable. The bedrooms are spacious and the host provided excellent and thorough instructions. We didn't have any occasion to contact him because he was so thorough! We loved the location - right downtown and next door to a cafe, close to other good restaurants. It was also quieter than we expected, which we appreciated; apparently, downtown Winona isn't too crazy on weekend evenings, at least in the summer. We never heard any intrusive street noise, even though the place is on a main thoroughfare. Would definitely rent from him again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. Beautiful apartment, the host was very responsive, and location was great and very walkable."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed the downtown location and the amenities provided. Beautiful apartment and extremely comfy!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam‚Äôs condo was beautifully updated. Close to Blooming Grounds, Peters and other downtown amenities."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very spacious apartment, with separate study area in loft. Very large warehouse style windows with view of of downtown Winona, but quiet and peaceful stay. Well-equipped kitchen for longer stays. Near the Nosh Scratch Kitchen, with great meals."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful stay in downtown Winona. Super clean and modern finishes. Would definitely stay again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Very fair price. Short drive to WSU and lots of restaurants and shops nearby.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really loved the space, vibe and location. One of the best BnBs I've stayed in. Recommended!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,BEAUTIFUL space! Great area to stay! Adam was super responsive and helpful!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay.
The space was well decorated, and king bed was very comfortable.
There were more stairs than expected to gain access to the space."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a gem. Great for money and everything you could want in an apartment. Just a few too many steps for this old guy but I made it ...... 4 times!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay and hope to book it for future visits to Winona!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great place to stay in Winona!!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a last minute change to our itinerary and Adam was very proactive in making sure we were satisfied. Enjoyed working with Adam.
One note to consider is the number of steps required to access this unit. Some people may find it to be a challenge."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at Adam‚Äôs place! Very close and walkable to a many restaurants and activities. We would absolutely stay again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Adam's Suite 7. The space was comfortable, clean, and beautiful . One night is all we had, but we wish we could have stayed longer. The high ceilings and large windows in the bedrooms made the suite feel open and airy. In the loft area is an office space that would be ideal for someone traveling for business or a writer. If you plan to use the kitchen for cooking, be aware that the kitchen only has coffee, olive oil, and salt and pepper. Adam was a wonderful host as he responded quickly, gave great recommendations, and was very pleasant. We highly recommend Suite 7 and would love to return."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I traveled to Winona with a college friend for a girls get-away weekend. We were very happy with this unit. Extremely clean, updated beautifully (we loved the bathroom tiles!), and a great location (loved the coffee shop right on the block for my morning latte!). Beds were comfortable and had nice linens, shower was hot with good water pressure!
The unit really is right off a main drag with shops, restaurants and bars. There was a little noise from the bar patio near us in the evenings, but it wasn't super distracting and didn't stop me from falling asleep or anything. It was a manageable trade-off for being able to walk to things so easily when we wanted to.
Adam gave us a great tip on hiking in the area and was super pleasant when we ran into him on the last day of our stay.
I would stay at this property again and recommend it to friends who travel in the area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable stay. Feels like home.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful penthouse apartment in historic downtown Winona. This location is within walking distance of Island City brewing co, No Name bar, Bluff Co CoOp grocery store, and many great restaurants and shops. Don‚Äôt miss out on the fantastic Japanese cuisine restaurant downstairs run by a warm and welcoming Chinese family. (Literally the BEST fried rice I‚Äôve ever eaten!) The apartment was clean and attractive. Host Adam was accommodating and easy to communicate with. Everyone in my stay was able to climb the 60 steps up and down to this 3rd floor loft many times. Advice for future tenants: Before booking this space, consider the mobility of everyone in your party and comfort with many, many stairs. Great stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you for having us, Adam! My wife and I came down to celebrate my birthday and climb Sugar Loaf. Adam‚Äôs place was in perfect walking distance of a lot of great restaurants and things to do. It was the most lovely space I‚Äôve ever stayed in as an Air BnB!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an awesome place! Historic building and all appears to be brand-new inside. Not only two bedrooms but also a beautiful loft office space (or place to do yoga if you are in to that). The host was awesome...I booked very late in the day but he was very accommodating and responsive. He worked hard to get me all set up and I am grateful. Thank you!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean place, highly recommended."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam‚Äôs places are always 5 star. Great location, well appointed, spacious and comfortable .
Our first choice for SE Minnesota accommodation."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was clean, stylish, and really everything we were hoping for."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I decided I could move in permanently and be quite happy :)
The place worked out very well and we wish we had more time there. Nice bedrooms, large closets, lots of kitchen supplies and other features. There was some street noise, which we were warned about and it is a college city downtown, so to be expected. While there is no separate dining table for, we used the island and all worked out well. Thankful for the good wifi -I did get a lot of work done- and the nice tv as well.
PS The Easter Bunny still was able to find us with the directions as well. Good thing they remembered the door code, because I was having a tough time do so."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and comfortable would stay again
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great apartment in downtown Winona. Very comfortable and nicely remodeled place. We loved the large windows in the bedrooms. Restaurants nearby. Will surely return here if we're back in Winona.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice location with free parking, no disturbances, everything was functional and I had no reason for concern. The checking and check out times were very inconvenient but worked for us on this occasion. Wish we had had additional time to let the location's welcoming ambience further sooth our busy souls."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adam was really friendly and accommodating. The apartment was in a perfect location for staying in the downtown side of Winona and we loved the space as well - especially the huge windows in the bedrooms. Bonus white noise machines in each bedroom if you want to listen to some rain while you sleep :) Definitely will stay here again the next time we visit.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What lovely, modern, bright accommodations! Beds are very comfy, shower pressure so nice, and so convenient to be able to do some laundry right in the apartment. Our only problem was that it happened to get cold and rainy overnight, so the many stairs down to the parking lot in the back were icy. I chose to use the stairs that lead to the 3rd St. entrance, so it was okay."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My daughter and I stayed here for a college visit. It was a beautiful unit! It was incredibly clean, tastefully decorated, and felt like home. I would absolutely stay here again! It was wonderful. Thank you, Adam!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Don‚Äôt miss this one!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed on a weekend the University was hosting an athletics event, so this stay was more affordable than any local accommodations‚Ä¶and so so epic! We were able to walk to a variety of restaurants like the Boat House, dessert shop, or 3 local coffee shops with food. We shopped. We cooked in the nice kitchen. And we soaked in this beautiful space with excellent sundown views and the bluffs. We will be returning. The host keeps in touch and everything you see in the description is accurate!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,ABSOLUTELY the best Airbnb we have stayed especially for the cost.. apt was flawless as far as needs and comfort only wish we weren‚Äôt just passing thru.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This placed matched the photos - spotlessly clean, great vibe, excellent 3rd St. location. I loved the book collection. The host is responsive, check-in is breezy & the place is simply perfect. Stay here!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I book with adam every time I visit winona . I will continue to do so. 5 out of 5 everytime
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment is beautifully renovated and has all the finishing touches that make it feel welcoming and comfortable. Great location in downtown, just a short walk to the river, shopping, restaurants and bars/breweries."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and new space with comfy beds and an overall great space. Great communication prior to the stay. Thankfully, the host provided info about parking in the winter during check-in messaging. Truly, the only bump of the stay was having my car parked a block away overnight and not closer to the space due to overnight winter municipal parking lot rules."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing penthouse apartment! Probably the best Airbnb rental we‚Äôve stayed in! Spotlessly clean throughout(hallway entry as well)! Bright and beautifully decorated! Loved the big bedroom windows for daylight and with room darkening drapes for sleeping. Very quiet and private! Great host that sent super easy, well described directions for check in! Beautiful well lit and clean deck entrance! Even had piano music playing in the hallway entry(nice touch)!! Great location and within walking distance to grab a bite or coffee. On the top of my list of favorites!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Steve and nans was fabulous, we stayed there at a rather stressful time and it really did feel like a safe landing! Clean space with yummy breakfast foods such as eggs, bagels, jam and pb üòã great communication and truly lovely people! Would recommend to anyone"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Steve & Nan‚Äôs. The space was perfect for our weekend getaway. The neighborhood is peaceful and has great local restaurants.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"GREAT accommodations! Had everything we needed and MORE! Steve and Nan had stocked the fridge with bagels, eggs, butter, peanut butter f4om the local co-op (YUM!!), cutie oranges, and half and half for our morning coffee...also provided along with an assortment of teas!!! This was a WONDERFUL addition as we could enjoy a relaxed breakfast 'at home.'
Steve and Nan were very kind and welcoming ‚ù§Ô∏è. Beautiful established neighborhood with a lovely hometown feel. Right across from WSU. Would DEFINITELY stay again!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay here! The hosts were super communicative and friendly, and everything from checking in to leaving was easy. The space itself was cute and cozy, and I loved having the electric fireplace on a colder and rainy weekend. It was also well stocked with snacks and coffee which I appreciated! Great spot for one or two people while visiting beautiful Winona."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cosy gem in the city. After travelling so much it was wonderful to have a home in a foreign city. The hosts were super warm and kind and had many recommendations. Would definitely come back.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Spent 8 nights at Treetops Suites while checking out the town my gggg gparents lived in in 1855 as I will be moving there in spring and loved every minute.
My hosts were charming, gracious and had everything needed for breakfast as an early riser before restaurants opened. Loved the coffee, selection of teas, bagels, local peanut butter, and fresh fruit. Within walking distance was Country Bluffs Co-op, and Mid-Town Grocery Store. Other groceries were available at Hy-Vee & Aldi's a short bus ride away.
Restaurants were within walking distance or a short bus ride. Loved the Blue Heron & Anacabi's Little Kitchen
The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of extra blankets if needed. Dinette in kitchen was perfect for laptop use. Efficiency kitchen had a microwave, toaster oven & hot plate.
Loved that the library and bus stop were 1.5 blocks away & the Winona County History Center was 3 blocks away. Also museums & walks along Mississippi River & Lake Winona. Will definitely be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was perfect for both visiting WSU and walking to local restaurants and coffee shops.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nan and Steve were friendly, helpful, communicative and responsive. Their place was convenient to the Winona State University, downtown businesses, the Flyway Trail, and all things Winona. They offered so many little touches (breakfast items, snacks, motion sensor lights, well-stocked supplies, keyless locks,...) that all added up to a great stay with great hosts."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Steve and Nan were so kind and friendly! Their place was cozy and lovely. Definitely recommend and will be coming back.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great quiet spot to rest our heads for the weekend. We didn't spend a lot of time there due to being out and about but the accommodations were just as described! The welcome letter was very detailed, which I appreciated and hosts and manager who we were in contact with were all very helpful and responsive when needed. Would recommend to others. Thank you for a nice stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful hosts and home. Loved it!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed the sweet little apartment. The living room was cosy. The kitchen was vey well appointed for a partial kitchen. They left food for breakfast, eggs and english muffins and fruit, 1/2 and 1/2, etc. so we didn't need to go out in the morning, very helpful. The bathroom is a nice size - window but no fan. Our only minor concern was the bed is more of a futon bed and we are older with arthritic joins and so we need a softer bed and we added padding for us to be completely comfortable.
It was very quiet, even with windows open all night. Easy parking and unloading, it is located on the second floor so has lots of great light, plenty of windows. These folks anticipated most of our needs and their place is convenient and easy. We would come back."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our one week stay at Nan & Steve house in Winona. The host (Nan & Steve) were the best host we have encountered so far. The location was great (next to Winona St Univ) and can walk to lakes in 10 plus minutes and to the downtown in less than 10 minutes. In the room, you got everything you need to enjoy your stay plus a lot of foods/snacks.
If you have a heavy suitcase, be prepared to carry to 2nd floor through steep staircase. Yes, Steve assisted my wife‚Äôs suitcase.
We highly recommend any couple to have a wonderful stay at Nan & Steve house. Enjoy beautiful Winona."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great location to be able to walk to coffee shops, restaurants and other businesses in the downtown area. The area is also bike friendly, and it is a short ride to the beautiful bridge across the Mississippi River, which has a bike/pedestrian path on it. Lake Winona is also a few blocks away. Very convenient to WSU.
The apartment was super clean, and the hosts provided cereal, eggs, English muffins, milk, and bananas for breakfast. As others have mentioned, the stairs are somewhat steep (it‚Äôs an older home with quirky charm) if that‚Äôs an issue for you. There is one small parking spot near the entrance, but street parking was also available.
Check in was a breeze. Deb responded quickly to questions . It rained much of the time I was there, but I was able to enjoy the patio for a little bit. I had a lovely stay!"

Forgot a bag and was called promptly so I could retrieve it, Thanks SO much!! Charlene And Ralph Fregosi"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely, cozy, fully-furnished apartment right in the heart of Winona, MN. Steve, Nan, and Deb, are very thoughtful, friendly, and hospitable hosts.
There is great attention to detail in this apartment with a welcome basket and lots of home-like comforts. Milk, English muffins and eggs were provided by the host, as well as a large variety of teas and coffees. Steve and Nan went above and beyond our host expectations by giving us champagne when they found out that we were newly-weds and donuts from the famous local bakery when they found out that we had never been to Winona before. Very thoughtful. Very kind.
Despite having several large local Universities, Winona seemed like a quiet sleepy town nestled amongst the bluffs on the mighty Mississippi. We were only Winona for a brief weekend getaway, but it was a lovely experience. We would like to come to this part of Minnesota again and would like to stay again at the Treetops suite on 7th street."
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was excellent. Only a few things that were disappointing such as the very small parking space, a very uncomfortable mattress, and a half inch gap in the door leading to the apartment which worried me a little bit about security. The neighborhood seems safe though so it wasn't a big deal. Steve and Nan really do a great job with the minor details, such as breakfast provided and coffee. Would definitely stay here again!"

I had the pleasure of meeting Nan and Deb and found them to be fun and kind people. I had a lovely stay and look forward to coming back again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot begin to express how great this Airbnb is to stay. Perfect for Winona State visits, St Mary‚Äôs, for all the events in town. As I finish my need for an Airbnb after 6 weeks M-F, I will miss seeing Nan, Steve, and Deb. They made the stay fantastic!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"DEFINITELY OUR FIRST OPTION when returning to Winona. The whole experience felt ""welcoming,"" and all aspects of the rental really allowed us to just enjoy our extended stay.
Location was great -- lovely residential neighborhood; rental home is literally steps to WSU campus, and within a few minutes walk to lots of fun spots, including the big park at Lake Winona with bandshell and sports fields and boat house and walking path that's several miles around lake.
House was very clean and well-equipped-- comfy bed, large bathroom, and just cozy.
But best feature is really the hosts -- they put great emphasis on guests' comfortable and enjoyment.
NOTE: steep stairway to the 1 BR unit we rented upstairs -- potential problem for older person or one with impaired mobility."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is gorgeous and matched the photos well. There are three flights of stairs to climb, but we knew that ahead of time as it was in the description of the place. It was a windy, cold, and snowy weekend so the town was rather quiet.
But we had great fun listening to a band at a local bar on Friday night and found a terrific restaurant on Saturday night: both within easy walking distance. I would highly recommend the place."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is a great rental for many reasons. There were plenty of restaurants of various price ranges and styles within in just a few blocks. Everything was clean and in good working order. The building felt very well kept and safe. There is an extensive book collection for the readers. The noise from the neighboring beer garden could be heard in the apartment, but if was not overwhelming and it was over by 8:00. It certainly was not an issue for us. The two minor inconveniences were no dining table or bathroom counter space.Neither of those would stop us from renting this apartment again if we were staying in Winona."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was in Winona overnight to tour Winona State with my daughter. Adam‚Äôs Airbnb was a perfect overnight spot for our time there!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adam was a dream to deal with. He responded to my messages straight away. Apt #6 was amazing! Great location, beautiful, clean. All the amenities for a comfortable extended stay. I was, unfortunately, only there for one night. And it was very quiet; no outside noise on the Sunday night I was there.
For anyone concerned about the steps, there are 32 steps (well lit at night) to the top of the building, 4 steps down when you enter the building, then another 24 steps up to the apartment door for both #6 and #7 (they're across the hall from each other). Between the steps are hallways. The inside steps and hallways are carpeted. I did not find all of the steps hard but I also didn't make multiple trips in and out of the apartment.
I highly recommend booking with Adam!"

My daughter and I had a girls get away. It was wonderful!!
I highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice suites. We stayed in one of the ""penthouse"" suites, and despite the summer heat stayed nice and cool. Very nicely furnished, clean, and well-equipped. Some place to gather outside would have been nice, but there are parks enough by the river."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a terrific time in Winona and this rental was great! Everything was very neat, clean, and exactly as stated in the listing. It's a beautiful apartment in a great location. Easy to walk to everything downtown with lots of shops, restaurants, and coffee places located nearby. This space is considered a penthouse so there are a lot of stairs. It would not be good for someone who has difficulty with stairs. We will definitely be staying here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best spot in town!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a moms weekend getaway! This apartment was so cute, very clean and so close to lots of shops, parks, restaurants! I would definitely stay here again!!"

Plus, this place is walking distance to a variety of restaurants.
Beds were comfortable, the apartment was clean and had everything we needed!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Adam‚Äôs place!

It is right around the corner from a cute coffee shop and walking distance to nearby restaurants‚Ä¶ and a nice paved walking path along/across the Mississippi River. We visited WSU, a 5 minute drive away and also hiked nearby Sugarloaf Bluff.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were back for our 4th stay at one of Adams properties. Loved this newer listing on the top floor. Exactly as described but most importantly- CLEAN and quiet. This unit is spacious and has everything you need to make your stay comfortable and feel just like home. We encountered yet another MN snowfall during our stay and it was so pretty especially at night with the lights leading up to the top units. It‚Äôs close to everything- coop grocery store, bowling alley, movie theater, lots of choices for restaurants. We came to town for a college tour at MSU which is super close. Adam is quick to reply with any questions/locale suggestions. His properties have become our ‚Äúgo to‚Äù while visiting the Winona area. We will certainly be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a super fun place to stay while we were here for the weekend. This suite is right downtown and we loved that this place has historic charm and modern amenities. We loved roominess and the high ceilings.

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,one big thing is this room hardly has a fridge. it was maybe 1/3 of a mini fridge and we couldn't fit any of our left over from dinner in there which sucked and it wasnt even plugged in when we got there so our drinks werent even able to be in there. other then that I would stay with Yushi again just in another room with a mini fridge. the room was very clean and comfortable. a cute little room and thankful there is finally an airbnb in Winona.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a hidden gem in Winona. It is such a unique place. The room is like new, and immaculately clean. It is perfect for one or two people. Yushi was always quick to respond and was very friendly and helpful. She was very proactive in having the snow shoveled and plowed even though I was the only one in the whole place. It was peaceful and quiet. There is a Roku TV with endless channels. There is a ground-level window providing light but there are also blackout curtains so it was extremely dark even in the morning while I was sleeping. There is an individual hotel-like air unit that I was able to control and so the room was very comfortable temperature-wise. There is no kitchen and most of the furniture is of the ""micro-room"" type but for me it was perfect and the value for the price couldn't be beat in Winona. I will stay again."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A fantastic stay!
This was my second different room at this place, and this one was exactify what I was looking for.
It is a snug room for two-- that is super clean and filled with a couple nice little fun surprises (I don't want to spoil anything for you).
The staircase/lobby area is decorated with a lot of cool Winona/Video and is a lot of fun checking out.
The location is perfect and although all 3 of the other room were occupied, it was extremely quiet. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a more unique stay."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My fianc√©e and I love to visit Winona often to walk the downtown area and visit the local shops.
This place was a great find! It‚Äôs unique (an old video store) and really cute! The movie posters hanging on the walls were a great touch, many featuring Winona Ryder.
The alien and futuristic themed decor made it stand out. It was clean, well cared for and cozy.
I definitely recommend spending a night or two!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I liked this place a lot and would return if coming back to the Winona area. This locale is definitely for those who enjoy living in a quirky environment, yet the room is extremely comfortable and inviting."

The neighborhood and street was quiet, and although the train is across the street, we loved hearing it rumbling on the tracks. The house is very close to Winona State campus- we were visiting our daughter who is a student there- and a very short drive to downtown. We especially loved the French press coffee, the board games and the front porch. Thank you Shari, we will definitely stay here again!"

Her location is just driving minutes from the downtown area to find cafes and restaurants!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, clean and quiet.
Only reservation I would extend would be to anyone who has issues with stairs as the steps to the upstairs (where the main and 2nd bedroom were) are very narrow & steep and could be hard for some one with issues going up and down stairs. There is a 3rd bedroom downstairs with a singe bed if your party only has one person who would have trouble.
Would rend this again if I was going to be in the area!!"

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The first floor bedroom mattress leaned toward the floor so it wasnt very comfortable. Other beds were good. The house was so welcoming and love the little surprises! Chocolate and dog treats spelled out hi. Back yard was very nice. Would highly recommend staying here!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A Stone's Throw Bungalow was perfect for our long weekend getaway to Winona. I was attending a painting workshop. My husband and our dog came along to check out Winona. The bungalow met all our needs and much much more. I was a few minutes from the painting venues and my husband explored Winona Lake, downtown, and the university on foot with our dog. The bungalow is peaceful day and night. Everything is as described/pictured. Lots of recent updates/renovations yet also cozy. The backyard is a gem for hanging out and letting a dog stretch their legs. We would stay here again next year!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic place to stay! Much bigger than the pictures made it look, and kind of a tardis effect in it looks small on the outside and huge on the inside! Had a lot of fun playing the board games that were supplied. Upstairs main bedroom was mostly babyproofed already, so very easy to stay with a toddler and new crawler without worry. Wish we could have stayed longer, it was a perfect relaxing getaway."

The fully fenced-in backyard is great for playing and running around. It was easy to feel comfortable and at home, and communicating with Megan was easy and prompt. Even despite an error on my end, Megan was friendly, flexible, and accommodating. You won't be disappointed."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Megan's place is very comfortable and located in a quiet, tree-filled neighborhood one block away from a beautiful park. Her backyard is lovely and inviting and her flowers are really well tended and healthy. My siblings and I had a great time here and Megan was super responsive and helpful!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful historic cottage with a perfect location to the Lake. The patio was lovely and we had breakfast on the porch. Great little gem in Winona!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family stayed for a short family weekend away from home and for me to take part in the local triathlon. Great location for my daughter to play at the park. Easy access to walking trails and to get to downtown by car. Would love to stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Charming house in a charming neighborhood.
Megan was a great host! Thanks!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time at STB. The house was equipped with everything we needed and Megan was super responsive. She also went above and beyond to welcome our dog Jack. 10/10 would recommend.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Stone‚Äôs Throw Bungalow was the perfect lodging for our weekend attending the Midwest Music Fest!! Megan‚Äôs communication was timely, considerate and helpful. Her place was so charming - thoughtfully decorated + well-stocked, impeccably clean, and perfectly-situated for morning jogs with our dog as well as easy walking/biking distance to the music venues. We‚Äôd happily stay here again on our next visit to Winona!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a lovely, quaint, comfortable place to stay. My little family of four plus our dog were in Winona to celebrate my sister‚Äôs doctorate graduation, her baby shower, and my birthday.
Megan‚Äôs bungalow is a gem and suited us perfectly. It was a wonderful home base to come back to after all of our various days of celebration. Sitting back on a comfy couch, with a drink in my hand and unwinding from the day felt just like home.
Our dog, Ivan, loved the yard and the neighboring pups, he made friends with the huskies, and also the next door collie. He even scored a dog cookie from her mama.
The closeness of the lakes was wonderful for dog walking, and our kids (10 and 13) even went off on their own to play at the play structures for a few hours. We were able to walk to campus for the graduation ceremony.
We would definitely stay here again! Only thing we didn‚Äôt love were the ridiculous stairs, but they certainly bring character to the home!
Megan (and Steve) are amazing hosts!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect home for what we needed. We were in town for my brothers graduation and needed a place that could accommodate my family. Megan was very responsive and accommodating. Highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Megan was a perfect host and the house was great. We were thinking of saving some money with a hotel in town, but this house was absolutely worth every dollar. You can‚Äôt beat the location and surrounding area"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful time, Megan provided great local recommendations and her house is in a gorgeous spot with lots of parks and great restaurants near by!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This home was perfect for the relaxing night with friends from out of town. Megan was wonderful! She noted a comment I made about one of my guests having allergies and she had the house cleaned one more time before we arrived. Wonderful hostess!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute house in great location that worked well for our small group! Megan was friendly and easy to communicate with.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great! Megan has pretty clear set rules that are extremely easy to follow. The people in town are super friendly and the town is gorgeous. Tons of things to do and the house is right in town with east access to everything. The house was super clean and welcoming, it had everything we needed and more."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a brief but wonderful stay at Megan‚Äôs home. It was a perfect sot to Seth for the night‚Äîall the coziness and comforts of home. We‚Äôd definitely stay here again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"You can‚Äôt beat the location. Easily situated between the small lake and the WSU campus, it‚Äôs easy to find but far enough away to where you don‚Äôt have to deal with the college crowd. As someone living in the cities, the backyard was huge. Lily (dog) loved staring out the living room window, and there was plenty of room for her. Megan was fantastic‚Ä¶ responsive, flexible, and attentive.
The stairs are treacherous, but not terrible. The kitchen is wide open with plenty of space to cook. It‚Äôs a great place for 1-2 people, IMO.
The only word of caution I‚Äôll say is that there aren‚Äôt many dog-friendly places in Winona so in the winter it would be difficult to have a dog if you‚Äôre the type to bring your dog with you to breweries or coffee shops.
Without a doubt though, I will be coming back to this place whenever I need to go to Winona."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great place to stay close to the university! Nice to be right by the beautiful lake! Comfy beds, nice living spaces, and a great kitchen. Megan is super responsive and has great local recommendations!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place to stay, especially for dog owners! There was a nice backyard for our dog to play in. The host was very kind and provided dog bowls for us to use. We all felt right at home. We also loved the d√©cor in the house. Megan is very responsive and made sure we had a great stay! She is a wonderful host!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely wonderful place to stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay. The location was perfect, near the University, the lake and the restaurants and church downtown. We could get everywhere in just a few minutes. The house is spacious, sunny, lots of rooms with cute decor and places to sit and put things. The upstairs queen bedroom was so pretty and sunny and had a view to the lake and bluffs. We had a great movie and game night in the cozy living room. The TV was really nice and we could log in to our own Streaming services. The driveway was convenient for parking. We made tea and hot chocolate Megan provided and there was filtered water in the fridge. There were lots of nice things available, such as condiments in the kitchen, throw blankets in the living room and toiletries in the bathroom. We felt really comfortable and welcome.
Cons: the house is a historic home and it is sweetly remodeled, but the floors are uneven and the stair to the upstairs is steep, so you have to be very careful going up and down."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Megan was so responsive! The house was very clean and had several amenities. It was a great stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Megan has set up a nice home in a beautiful neighborhood! You are right next to the lake with a beautiful trail and you‚Äôre not too far from sugarloaf. We had four guests that stayed and we were all comfortable. I will say this is probably not the best space for two couples as there is only one queen sized bed. The bean bag chair does fold into a bed but it‚Äôs tough for two people to fit comfortably. All in all we enjoyed our stay and Megan was very quick to respond when needed!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Megan's rental was easy to find, close to the Winona campus, clean and tastefully decorated. The bedrooms were peaceful and beds were truly comfortable. The sitting area of the TV room was wonderful with two big, comfy couches and several blankets to snuggle up together in. we played games at the table in the kitchen.. This property allowed our family to come together for a night and relax in comfort together."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you with your help getting or item back.
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was my first time staying in an airbnb, and I was very impressed with Megan and her house! Megan is very friendly and she wants you to have a wonderful stay at her home. Megan responds quickly to any questions or concerns that you have, and she is able to accommodate to your needs. The house is perfectly located in a quiet neighborhood by the lake. The inside of the home is very clean, cute with beautiful decor, and it has a cozy feel to it. I would recommend staying at Megan's house if you are looking for an airbnb in Winona!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot. Lots of space! Great finishes:). We would definitely return.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks for another great place to stay! Loved the bird‚Äôs eye view of the city and the secluded, elevated back porch. Enjoyed the sunrise view from the bedroom window. Everything so well chosen. A quiet, restful environment."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A safe open stay right in the middle of Winona. A little noisy, lots of steps, and make sure to keep the fans on full tilt, but these are very minor!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay for visit to Winona! I booked it again for my next trip, while I was still there!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"PHENOMENAL stay! This was my first time staying at one of Adam's properties, but certainly won't be the last! it was pristine from floor to ceilings, it was loaded with amenities from coffee to bubble bath and everything in between! it was beautiful beyond words, but so cozy, I felt right at home. the stairs ARE quite a hike, as stated in the description, so pack accordingly, but it is SO worth it when you get inside this breathtaking space! Adam was beyond helpful and responsive from reservation to checkout and really assured my stay was as comfortable as possible. location could not be better! close to downtown, but in a quiet residential neighborhood. never once had any disturbances or distractions from traffic, neighbors or other typical neighborhood sounds. I would 10/10 recommend to any and everyone!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot say enough about this property or it's phenomenal host! Worth every cent and so much more! the stairs ARE a hike, but beyond worth it if you can manage! the space was immaculate, the furniture was beyond comfortable (the bed and couch alone were enough to make up my mind to come back any and every time I'm looking to get away! the location is PERFECT! Close to everything you could possibly want or need, but still in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood, for maximum relaxation. host was extremely responsive and gave clear and easy to follow instructions on check in, check out, things to check out locally etc. 20/10 would recommend this property and any others he has to offer!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spacious and well appointed attic apartment with a bonus rooftop deck.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the spacious apartment with it's funky high angled ceilings and open floor plan for the kitchen, dinning area and living space. There was a great reading chair in the office with good lighting. a large bedroom. We were warned to expect a hike up stairs to reach the 3rd floor so we dealt with that. If you are reading this, be prepared. the kitchen appliances seemed very new, the bathroom looked like it was recently tiled - spotless. The apartment is on a main street, but it is not noisy, and it is within walking distance of the downtown where we found a great restaurant - The Nosh with a fine dining vibe and eclectic menu of tasty dishes. Highly recommend it. We wondered why there isn't a king size bed in the bedroom since there is so much space there. Oh well, still comfortable. We can recommend this apartment for your visit to Winona - a very pleasant city to visit. State Parks nearby plus a nice winery, Elmaro, just across the border in Wisconsin."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love this place! 5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è Beautifully renovated with all the details to make you feel at home. This is always my first choice when visiting Winona!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adam‚Äôs properties are always very clean and a very nice way to spend time away from home. His properties have made our visits during time our daughter has been in college extremely comfortable.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't imagine a better base for enjoying Winona. You are walking distance to restaurants, a really nice grocery store and a lot of attractions. We devoted the good part of a day to checking out the stained glass at a variety of banks and churches.
We are a lark/night owl couple and this apartment with the office was perfect for us. We also enjoyed the deck. Adam has created a lovely, comfortable and classy home away from home.
Our primary reason for our visit was/is the Minnesota Marine Art Museum, a real local treasure. Now that we have discovered this apartment I expect we will be getting down here more often.
Thanks, Adam."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked for an anniversary weekend. We really enjoyed this place and would recommend it to friends and family. It's tons of space, clean and airy, and lots of interesting ceiling angles. It's also high enough up (3rd floor) that the windows and deck are private."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adam's place is great! Very chic, comfortable arrangements and immaculate views from the rooftop deck. For being on the top floor, the place was also very cool, heat wasn't an issue.
One of the best stays in Winona!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,really enjoyed it and would recommend it to others
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it was a great place to rent! beautiful area with an amazing deck! loved the area and close to all the attractions ‚ù§ thank you for making our stay cozy and being an amazing host!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved this spot! It was clean, spacious and super cozy. The bathroom was gorgeous and clean. All of the natural light was great, too."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome space, loved the private balcony, skylights, and numerous windows. Also loved the hardwood floors, claw foot tub, double sinks (helpful when we‚Äôre both getting ready to go out at the same time).
Location is great, only four or five blocks‚Äô walk to Bloedow‚Äôs for great baked goods. Easy to walk anywhere downtown, and we used the dedicated parking space for our rental car.
Be aware that this is on the top floor, so three flights of stairs might be a concern for someone not able or used to walking stairs regularly. We had no problems with the stairs ourselves. They are well lit and carpeted."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We greatly enjoyed our stay! The entire apartment was spotless and so thoughtfully curated. It was quiet, peaceful, comfortable, and inviting. The bathroom was really cool, especially the skylight and the rain shower was excellent. Adam has truly thought of everything and is an excellent host. The only bummer is that we were just passing through Winona so could only stay one night. We would have loved to stay longer - and during better weather so we could enjoy the cute rooftop deck! Next time we're in Winona, we would definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Adam‚Äôs place. It was just as described and was in walking distance to great restaurants. We would definitely return!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adam's place is a so impressive ! More beautiful and lovely than on the pictures ! Come to see that in real.
It's obvious that the owners took so much time to create a comfy, cozy, well made and well organized place.
You have everything you need, in an incredible renovated old building. By the way, Winona is a very nice city to visit.
I highlih recommend Adam's place !"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another awesome property by Adam! His places are the first we look for when we are in town!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best bang for your buck! You can‚Äôt get these amenities and service at a hotel and certainly not for this price. But more than that Adam‚Äôs places are stellar.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I‚Äôd definitely come back in a heartbeat, one of the best stays I‚Äôve had! Clean, Trendy, Fun and Comfortable!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It felt like staying in a dollhouse for adults. Adam was an excellent host, and gave us great local recommendations. If we are back in the area, we will gladly stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great stay in the Penthouse Apartment. Everything was as described and exactly as I would expect for one of Adam's rentals. I've said it before but it's worth repeating Adam does Airbnb right and I look forward to staying here again when I'm back in Winona.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent space--the pictures do not do it justice; very spacious and comfortable. Adam was quick to respond, and all expectations were met. I would definitely stay there again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing space! Just a beautiful loft like space that felt like a spa. Gorgeous bathroom with clawfoot tub, full kitchen, outdoor deck to watch the sunset. One of the best Air B/B I have stayed at. Wish I could have stayed longer!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved it so much I booked it for another night! (See above review :-) )
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a place I love coming back to - just a gorgeous, airy, bright space that feels both luxurious and cozy. Lots of nooks and places to read a book or work, a beautiful tub in the bathroom, SUPER comfortable bed and then of course the rooftop deck. This is just a really comfortable and special space and I can't recommend it highly enough - whatever your expectations it will probably exceed them. And Adam is just an amazing, responsive and friendly host that I can't say enough good things about. I will definitely be back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place easy to walk anywhere. Beautiful interior
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a great stay! There was so much space and we loved the layout. Watching the sunset from the rooftop balcony was definitely a highlight. Host was very responsive as well.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"""It is always a wonderful and peaceful location to visit. The place has a cozy atmosphere, and you can use it as a space to work, unwind, or read if you have company with you. Additionally, there is a private deck where you can enjoy the pleasant weather. The location is also within walking distance of the river and restaurants. Adam is very organized when providing information regarding the check-in and check-out process. We have visited this place several times and plan to continue doing so."""
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful Stay! A unique apartment that was very fun to stay at!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam does a great job on his properties. He's very responsive and helpful. The unit was super clean and had everything we needed. Felt safe. Relaxing quiet environment. Great tasteful decor

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sometimes you find people that are really meant to be airbnb hosts. They are responsive, kind and create spaces that are a joy to be in. Adam is just that! I am confident staying at any of his rentals would be a treat. He has put so much care into the finishing of the penthouse, the floors,doorknobs, skylights...the bathtub! Enjoyed the balcony views too. Thanks for the stay! 5/5"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"wow. wow. wow. this place is beautiful. I love old buildings that have been well cared for and this goes over and above that. the design of this space is brilliant and charming and absolutely lovely.
I live in this area but needed a place for a few days of solitude. my friends stay in one of Adam's many Airbnbs when they're in town from Texas and so I've been there before and fell in love with it then. My friends love them all but have deemed this one their favorite.
you will have to see it to believe it!
one cool thing that Adam has is piano music going in the hallways and that is so calming and welcoming"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Penthouse was great. It was much roomier than I expected, but was still cozy and the space was so well used. It was clean, the host was responsive, and the kitchen was well equipped (there were even ice cube trays, which I SO appreciate). There are a lot of stairs, but it worked well for us and the views were lovely. I will stay with this host again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful! We wish we could have stayed longer and we‚Äôre definitely go back. It snowed when we were there and the town. Was. Gorgeous.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,exactly as described. Will stay again when in the area
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place! Felt larger than the pictures! Adam thought of everything. places like this are what make airbnb great.

Adam was a great host and extremely responsive! Thank you Adam!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Adam‚Äôs place while visiting family over Christmas. It was a very comfy, spacious, and well-situated spot. We enjoyed all the amenities and the calm atmosphere. Adam was helpful and responsive. We‚Äôd definitely stay there again when in Winona!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was just beautiful at Adams. Winona is a very beautiful place to visit I recommend you stay at Adams and enjoy the Penthouse Retreat that he had put together .
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the 4th different unit of Adams local AirBNB units and I found this one in a completely different location just as comfortable as all of his others. Adam has a great knack for creating a very unique yet special experience.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful apartment, bigger than it looked in the pictures. Great place for a getaway."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adam‚Äôs penthouse loft was so beautiful! I enjoyed the rooftop deck for coffee on a couple brisk November mornings. This is my 2nd of 7 already-booked stays at Adam‚Äôs properties and I have really enjoyed my stays so far! Looking forward to the upcoming visits too!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place, highly recommend"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My first thought as I entered this beautiful space was ‚Äúwhy did I only book one night?!‚Äù. So cozy, so spacious, so peaceful. 10/10. I highly recommend this place and thank Adam for being such a wonderful host."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and rented the space overnight. unfortunately I suffered a knee injury shortly before we arrived so we were unable to stay. Adan was kind enough to refund our money even though it was past check in time on our arrival day. It was a kind and generous gesture on his part and wasn't necessary but he did it anyway. We will definitely go back because we will always support hosts who are so gracious and thoughtful.
Thank you Adam!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Thanks Adam!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have come back each year for many years. The apartment is stylish and spacious, and we love the hiking around Winona."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Adam‚Äôs. It was clean, open and lots of natural light. The claw foot tub was a selling point. We enjoyed the decor and the feel of the lofted space. Check in was easy and there was plenty of things for us to do with in walking distance."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed at many airbnb rentals, but this was for sure at the top! What an amazing space for the price. The totally remodeled unit is done to perfection with many high end details. It is very large and having the deck space was a definite plus! We will definitely return when we're in the area. I think Adam has been watching some great HGTV decorating shows! Or.....he should have his own show!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just an amazing place to stay! Beautiful and spacious! We will definitely be back to stay longer next time! One of the best Airbnb‚Äôs we have stayed! The host thought of everything we would need to make our stay comfortable! Such a wonderful, unique place to stay (we stayed in the loft penthouse on the top floor)!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was an EXCELLENT visit! We had a rough experience in the past with another host (in a different state) and were a little apprehensive about Airbnb. This stay was exactly what we needed! We are definitely going to stay here again!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This penthouse was even better than the pictures. The space was huge, posh, and comfortable. Adam was very responsive and seemed to think of everything in his initial message to us. Everything was great! 5 stars!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this place. It was spacious, unique, and within walking distance of good restaurants, shops, and museums. We would definitely return."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay - well worth the value. Instructions for arrival very clear and Adam quick to communicate. This place has everything you'd need plus additional touches for comfort! If I'm in Winona again I will definitely stay here again. Thanks Adam!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! It is only accessible by stairs, but definitely worth the climb! The space is gorgeous with a good deal of natural light. It felt like we were right at home and we didn‚Äôt even mind that we got stuck inside because of a rainy day. Well be recommended this rental to all of our friends and family who visit the area. We‚Äôll be back again, no doubt!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was better than the pictures. Not that the pictures are bad, it's just better. There was clearly a lot of thought put into the design of the whole apartment. It was very comfortable and enjoyed having a patio on a nice warm late September week.
Adam was easy to get along with and I'm sure he would help me right away if I needed help, but I didn't. I am looking forward to seeing some of his other rentals when I come back to Winona. I highly recommend this place. The third floor thing might be difficult for someone with mobility issues, however, Adam has other places that would be great for people with that issue. This place worked out perfect for me though."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'd give this place 6 stars if I could. The space itself is like walking into the pages of Architectural Digest. Spotless, beautifully decorated. too many unheralded features to name and everything we wanted within easy walking distance. Add Adam's personal communication and recommendations to this and you can't go wrong."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay! The photos don't show how huge it is! Very quiet and restful.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adam's place was perfect for our one night stay. Well thought out design and clean. Lots to do around his place and the places were walkable.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely and cozy place to stay that was within walking distance to a lot of great things in Winona. The space was gorgeous and allowed for some lovely relaxation time with the comfortable bed, couch, spacious bathtub, reading nook, and little rooftop porch.

It was as if I was the first person to ever stay there. Everything was as described. It is in a great location with an easy walk to downtown, campus, a grocery store, and bakery. This is rare in Winona as all the hotels are out by the highway. Staying here gave the ability to experience Winona more like a local. Having gone to college in Winona, this is exactly what I wanted. Checkout was very easy as well. No long list of house chores, just be respectful and clean up after yourself."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect for our stay in Winona! We bother worked from home during our stay and the office was a huge bonus. Only issue we ran into is that we seemed to run out of hot water quickly.

When I arrived super late in the middle of the night, Adam had left lights on so that I did not walk into a dark place. The place was extremely clean and has been well-maintained although it is in an older building. The charm of the building was evident throughout the decor. I would highly recommend the Penthouse to anyone visiting Winona. GREAT place to stay!"

This penthouse place is not only attractively designed, but very comfortable and fully appointed with all we needed and much more. Everything worked well, and we were even able to get an Amazon delivery easily. The soaking tub, movie watching setup, rooftop deck and separate office (yoga/exercise room) were especially welcome perks. It was just what we needed for a restful, restorative stay in the quiet cool town where I went to college. Host Adam was consistently prompt, responsive and positive when we had to make changes to our original plans. We couldn't ask for anything better! We'll keep looking for this host whenever we come back to the area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam's place is beautiful, comfortable,and clean.Adam is very quick at responding to any questions. It's located on a main street, so in the early morning there's traffic. 42 stairs each way, just so you know. any questions."

Adam was extremely helpful, instructions very clear, and the penthouse itself was absolutely incredible. Checked out this morning, and already have recommended this place to 3 people we know. Would love to come back."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adams place was WONDERFUL! So peaceful and spotlessly clean. I am super picky when it comes to clean and this airbnb was way cleaner than a lot of other airbnbs I've stayed at. So easy to get to everything in Winona from this location. A beautiful apartment with a lot of attention to detail. We would definitely stay again if in the area!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great stay- would 100% recommend!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place--surpassed my expectations! It's very large, modern, and well-furnished. Electric heat takes a while to kick in if it's cold. Overall a wonderful stay."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My son called it fancy, and it felt special as a place to get away to. Very nice place to stay!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,It‚Äôs a long way up - but worth it. At the top of the house is this amazing apartment. Spotless and spacious with a well appointed kitchen. Easy walking to university and to market. Adam is an amazingly responsive host. All in all a pleasant place to stay.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As clean ad cozy as my last visit!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a great stay! We came to Winona for a long weekend and felt just at home at Adam's place. The space is beautiful and very clean - with tall ceilings and very nicely done renovations. Access to the roof deck was a great way to start the day sipping coffee looking over the bluffs. This place is also really nicely located near downtown - just a 10 minute walk to get to the river, restaurants, and breweries. We had a private parking spot which was great as well. We would absolutely stay at one of Adam's properties again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We are frequent air bnb users and tend towards higher end properties . Of all the ones we have stayed at, Adam's now tops the list of quality and luxury - even outdoing the one we stayed at in Sonoma valley! Adam's property is full of wide open space with incredible style throughout. A true luxury property (if you don't mind climbing the stairs to access it :-)."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adam provided us with such a comfortable and safe place to rest while on our cross country road trip. He was extremely responsive, helpful, and easy-going."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adam‚Äôs place is what an Airbnb stay is all about - renting from the owner, easy communication, very well-equipped and welcoming space, and a lot of thought to make your stay comfortable. Super comfy bed, good linens, a bath to really soak in (complete with bath salts) and so much space. It‚Äôs in a great location too - walking distance to downtown and Bloedow‚Äôs Bakery (try a maple long John). Just book it - you‚Äôll love it."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing!! Very well-designed, creative space. Wonderful place to spend a get-away."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely gorgeous spot. Central location. Easy to walk to anywhere downtown.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here a couple of weeks ago and came back again. I just love the calm feel that helps me get some work done, but then it's just blocks away from great food, a brewery and the river walk when it's time to have fun. There's often live music downtown which is a bonus. Definitely a great place to work and play."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adam's space is a hidden gem in the region. Prompt communication. Easy check-in.
The neighborhood is quiet enough to unwind, yet its proximity to Winona's historic downtown made it easy for me to take a leisurely 10-minute walk to get sushi.
Spacious doesn't do the suite justice; it felt palatial as a single traveler and would be very comfy for a couple or small group.
The bathroom is a true jewel with its standalone tub and tiled shower. Be mindful of water usage if you take advantage of both: my bath became lukewarm as it filled the tub, but the complimentary bath salts more than made up for it.
If you have trouble with stairs or mobility needs, this space might not be the best. Other than that, I'd say if you need a place to stay anywhere near the coulee region to book Adam's listing as soon as it's available. You won't regret it!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Adam‚Äôs place was so clean and comfortable. We will definitely be back!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of my favorite stays! The unit is gorgeous and so spacious. If you are looking to spend most of your time downtown or near the lakes, this is a great place to stay. Everything is within walking distance!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband described this apartment as ‚Äúthe best apartment I have ever stayed in, with the highest ceilings, multiple reading nooks and dimmable lights to adjust‚Äù. I describe this apartment as one that I wish I could stay in for a month because I think I would write my first novel in its inspiration. Would def stay many more times."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful, stress free space. I only wish I would have brought my yoga mat along too! Very calming decor with a cute little deck. Will definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have nothing but good things to say about Adam‚Äôs place. It was impeccably clean and well kept up. We had a great time spending our 35th wedding anniversary here and would love to come back sometime.

Very nicely decorated, the space worked out fantastic, the quality shower and soaker tub was perfect for my wife, and the location to downtown restaurants and options was very convenient. Adams communication was prompt and very timely. He clearly lives up to the superhost status."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place to stay! Very well laid out, and has everything you could need, loved the little touches. Must take a bath in the luxury tub - bath salts provided. I'm VERY picky about beds, and this one was super comfortable, including the sheets (already ordered some of my own!). The private deck provides a great view. Loved the reading nooks. The penthouse is on the top floor, up 44 steps, but it's not bad especially since there's great, relaxing music playing in the hallway. Nice off-street parking spot. Was a bit warm with only AC in 2 rooms, but I managed. Great place, highly recommend!!!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unbelievable location/space! So clean and bright with the skylights!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have visited AirBNBs all over the world and one of the best if not THE best is right in my hometown in little ol‚Äô Winona. Don‚Äôt pay for an overpriced hotel when you can stay at one of Adam‚Äôs places. Looking forward to staying again soon.

,,,"I checked out due to my inability to climb the stairs, although I was leaving a day early I spent my last night in Winona (Friday-Saturday) at a hotel. After climbing the stairs for 5 days the knee surgery I recently had was aggravated and I had to go back to my doctor."
