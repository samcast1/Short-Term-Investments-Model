2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,it was a great place to stay and if you were going to be there more than overnight it would be better.

It was not quite as bad returning home.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay here, and it was just as perfect as the first. While we are using the house mostly as a place to sleep while in the area for an event, it would be a great place to stay with more time to spend. However, even for our purposes, it is affordable with room to spread out, and in such a quiet and beautiful area. While you are very much off the beaten path, it is very accessible to TTU and all off Cookeville. Perfectly clean and comfortable."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kevin and Sherri accommodated us for one night as we were passing through. We were delighted to pull up to a beautiful home and yard.

Everything we needed - comfortable beds, ample living space, beautiful property, updated kitchen with all the amenities and wi-fi strong enough for our teen daughter to get her T Swift tickets (if you know, YOU KNOW!). Great location-less than 1/2 hr to burgess fall state park & windows overlook (highly recommend both if you can’t get entrance to Cummings Falls or want to get your steps in somewhere less crowded!)

We were able to visit the nearby Burgess Falls and Cumberland Mt. State Parks. Sherri and Kevin know how to run AirBNB’s well. The home is clean, organized and free of clutter with extra cabinet space for our own things. The kitchen is well stocked with exactly what you need to cook almost any meal. In fact, most Airbnb’s do not have sharp knives to peel and chop with; however, the knife set there is extremely sharp and I was able to find the same set to bring home to FL from a nearby store. I plan to come every year! You won’t be disappointed!! The A/C unit died while I was there but was also fixed and replaced during my stay. Fans were brought over so no problem staying cool. Hosts are very responsive!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We felt so at home at The Den. My son & I and our pup so enjoyed our treks at nearby Cummins Falls & would come back to The Den grateful for the clean space & the peaceful setting & the great nights’ sleep.
Kevin & Sherri thought of everything.
This was a very restorative, beautiful getaway.
We would definitely book with Kevin & Sherri again & will maybe bring more of our family since the 3 bedrooms & 2 baths make for a spacious vacation home.
Also have to mention the beds were super-comfortable, not too hard or soft… just perfectly firm & clean!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house was the perfect place to stop after a long drive! Loved everything about it. Clean, spacious, comfortable. We slept well and were ready to hit the road again the next day. Only wished we had been able to stay longer."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved the house! We felt right at home and enjoyed our stay. We’re not used to having to drive thru winding roads and believe me there’re are so many winding roads leading to the place but worth the drive. We saw bunnies, deer, peacocks and several different birds while hanging out on the deck. The beds and couches were comfortables and the kitchen was spacious. The appliances are up to date. Beautiful location and house."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Quick stop here on our way through a cross country move. Very clean which is always of utmost importance to me. Quiet area and a big yard for our pups to sniff around. We had breakfast at a cute place called Soul Craft Coffee that we would recommend.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kevin and Sherri provided a place that felt so comfortable from the moment we walked in. Serenity keeps coming to mind to describe our stay. They provided all the essentials and then some to make ourselves quickly at home. When asked, they were helpful in suggesting local places to eat. I enjoy being able to cook while away and their kitchen was a dream for me. I even enjoyed listening to our favorite music through Alexa in the refrigerator while I made our food. The back porch was a peaceful place to drink coffee in the morning in the shade of a big and beautiful oak tree.
Kevin and Sherri are great hosts and I would not hesitate to stay at their place again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kevin and Sherry’s Place is great, quiet and confortable. If you are looking for a nice place to relax, feel at home and sorrounded by nature this should be your first choice."

Highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home and property! The house is spacious and has everything you could possibly need. On the second night, there was a problem with the AC. The host responded immediately and sent a technician out. It was fixed in a jiffy and worked perfectly after that. We couldn’t have been happier with our stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the second time that we've stayed at this property. Quiet, peaceful location. Clean cute house. We will definitely stay again when in the area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here to visit Cummins Falls over the long weekend and the house was wonderful.
The house was easy to find when we got there late in the evening thanks to the light up address sign, which is something more places really need to look into.
The house was perfect for hanging out with a few friends, and the kitchen had everything I needed to make a few meals, and plenty of towels and soap were provided for the kitchen and bathrooms.
Would love to stay here again anytime I'm in the area!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was a bit out there, as far as drive from the highway, but it was extremely quiet and felt very safe. The beds were very comfortable, and a very workable kitchen! our son loved playing on the back deck and backyard! the deck would have been a beautiful place to relax if we had arrived earlier.
We arrived very late at night and I had no qualms about my family's safety in the dark, and the place was extremely easy to find an enter.
We would definitely stay here again!"

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, comfortable home just minutes from Cummins Falls. it was the perfect place to kick back and relax after a day of hiking. I sat out on the porch and watched bunnies hop across a field in the mornings and listened to a chorus of springtime frogs at night. it was a great stay and I'd love to come back again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice and comfortable home in a peaceful country setting. Was great for our two dogs that were traveling with us. They had a nice area to run around and get some fresh air! Beds are super comfy. This was a stop off for us driving to South Carolina. Served the purpose very well. Beautiful country side.
If you are traveling with dogs, just to note there was a a pit bull looking dog being walked off lead by some neighbors. Just make sure the coast is clear before you take your dogs out. We had no issues as we were inside when they went by."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin and Sherri's place was absolutely BEAUTIFUL. We traveled 9 hours from Michigan and the house was way beyond our expectations. We had one issue with ants (it is spring time so that is to be expected) and the AC. Kevin and Sherri were not able to come check it out themselves however sent Sasha who was absolutely WONDERFUL. She was quick and responsive, sprayed for ants, and was will to get someone out to fix the AC first thing in the morning. However, it worked it's self out and the AC started working. We had a Wonderful week staying here and will DEFIANTLY be returning in the future."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nicely updated ranch style home — VERY clean. Number of beds and baths was ideal for our family of 5 and our little Maltipoo, Dolly. We did have a slight problem with ants coming through back deck door and getting into some items we had on the kitchen counter, but owner was sweet to ask if we wanted compensation for the lost snacks. Hopefully they sprayed / took care of this issue after we left. This house is extremely close to Cummins Falls, so perfect for hikers, yet close enough to Cookeville to be able to go out for dinner. [Crawdaddy’s downtown was awesome!]
I would suggest that owners add another chair in the family room area - not enough seating options for our family to be comfortable. That is the only negative feedback I have. (and I wouldn’t even classify that as negative, honestly)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,exactly as described and very comfortable ! would definitely visit again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, renovated house. Perfect space for hanging out with our kids. A quick drive from Cookeville."

2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay comfy beds :))
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Nice place
2023-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"Our daughter's had little appreciation for the dog hair found in their bed and washcloths... we usually look for no pets specifications. In our opinion, we should not be subjected to sleeping with someone's dog or cat or the after effects. I guess we learned our lesson.
This is not meant to a bad reflection on the house or the hosts. It is a nice house and a nice area. A little ways from the interstate but peaceful surroundings."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is in excellent condition, everything is very clean and new. Location is extremely peaceful, a great place to have some quality time with family. Thank you so much to our excellent hosts!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was our 4th stay at one of Kevin and Sherri's properties. And we will definitely be back! The house was very clean, homie and comfortable. Kevin and Sherri go the extra mile with their property to make sure it has everything and more that one would need. The surrounding area is very beautiful and peaceful. Kevin and Sherri are very responsive and great to work with. We were able to add two days on to our stay when bad weather delayed our return home to Michigan. Thanks for the great stay Kevin and Sherri!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! Very clean!
Thank you!
We will be back!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful and peaceful stay. I would definitely stay again. The home is lovely spacious and quiet. If you don’t like winding roads I would be sure to travel in the day time. Bring food with you before hand because the drive to the store is a little ways. I needed to contact the host once during the stay and they were quick to respond. I can tell they are very sweet people. If you are looking for a nice clean friendly place to stay this is it! Great place!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This iis the second time that we rented from Kevin and Shari. They are both so kind and their properties are beautiful.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great little place about 15 minutes outside of downtown Cookeville. I'm OCD about cleanliness and this place was extremely clean and nicely furnished with a well stocked kitchen. The owners were very quick to respond to any questions. This was an excellent experience. If we are in the Cookeville area again, we would definitely rent this place again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay for our crew!
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Great little air bnb and especially for the price! We had an old group of friends meet up for homecoming at TN Tech and this was the perfect place for it. Highly recommend
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our second stay at this beautiful, rural location. You can read our review from July for more details, but the fact that we happily chose to return to Kevin and Sherri's house says it all. We highly recommend this place!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very spacious and a lovely home!

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved this as a peaceful retreat! We’re local but wanted a little getaway for the girls for fall birthdays! This was perfect. Spacious, clean, great amenities. We thoroughly enjoyed the porch and chiminea. We had no issues and would stay again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is just perfect. We needed somewhere to stay for a couple of nights while in Cookeville for a youth livestock showing event, so we were busy during the days, but the property is beautiful and the house was spotless and lovely. Even though we didn’t really get to use it, it had a great kitchen, and the mattresses were super comfortable (very important!!). While it’s off the beaten path, which made it quiet and peaceful, it’s very convenient to TTU and everything in Cookeville. And Kevin and Sherri were very responsive and willing to help when I reached out because I realized I needed to add a second night that became available - wonderful hosts!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean, cute, good location to visit TTU, Cummings Falls & Burgess Falls. Fantastic value for a fabulous stay for our family of 4 + 2 dogs. Comfortable beds, nice amenities, beautiful setting & space! Would definitely recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Picturesque farmhouse setting. Quiet and clean. My wife and I enjoyed sitting on the back porch with our coffee in the morning, and our kids loved walking down the road to see cows. Host was very considerate and responsive. One morning we burned some sausage and set off a smoke alarm, and she came by to make sure we were OK. Would love to stay again sometime."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a sparkling clean, beautifully remodeled home with peace and privacy, this is the place. We came for the Dailey and Vincent music festival in Gainesboro and the location was perfect. There aren’t enough superlatives to describe Kevin and Sherri’s little piece of serenity, which we highly recommend to other guests."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place to stay. Very welcoming.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was perfect for our stay in Cookeville. We had a wedding nearby at the Saltbox which made it very convenient for us. The house has been completely remodeled and is perfect in every way. We did not utilize the kitchen and outdoor deck or fire pit as we had wedding functions to attend. I am very particular about cleanliness, and this house was spotless, looked brand new with all of the remodeling. It is located in the country in a very nice area. Very quiet. We were very happy that we found it!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here while visiting our son at TTU. It was about ten minutes from the campus and the scenery is beautiful.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place…. Clean, comfortable, cozy, simple, spacious. Everything and all comforts of home at your fingertips. Even the knives in the kitchen were sharp for food prepping! The pictures don’t tell the whole story on this Airbnb. I’m planning to stay here every summer if it can work out for me. I met the hosts one evening as they came by to personally train me on how to use the grill. That’s personal service!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a nice little place out in nature but close to a nice town. It’s not huge, but our family of 5 fit fine. The decor was nice and everything seemed new. Overall, it was a comfortable stay at a good price."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a wonderful house. All the right touches and amenities, without a doubt the best thought-out and equipped Airbnb we have stayed at. Not a lot of fancy add-ons; just homey and comfortable, and located in a lovely country setting. It's a ways off the freeway, but worth the small extra drive time. Would definitely stay here again if we come back through Tennessee."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you Kevin and Sherri, your place was clean and awesome. We enjoyed our stay at your place, I know our dog definitely did!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is a great place to stay in Cookeville. The home was very clean and well equipped. The hosts were very kind and responded quickly. There’s a giant red oak tree that shades the new deck; a great spot to grill or just enjoy watching the wildlife. The location is very quiet, yet only 5 miles from TTU. We had a very relaxing stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect spot to stay on a road trip! The house is super clean and new on the inside. They had nice coffee k cups and even had quality shower soaps in the bathrooms. I let my baby crawl all over the floors because it was so clean!
Pay attention to the hosts note about Google maps taking you on back roads to their house versus going on exit further on highway to make a straight shot to their house! I thought we were going to some sketchy place but when we arrived at the house (at midnight) it was lit up outside and there was a house close by that made me feel very safe. Then in the daylight I was able to see the beautiful land surrounding the air bnb. Tons of room for kids to get their energy out running around. Starbucks, panera, and Publix are right by the highway too so you can pick up your food and go. I will definitely stay here again on my road trips! Very affordable price too."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This adorable house, The Den at NBF, was very comfortable, exceptionally clean, and a perfect location for our travel needs (family wedding in Sevierville, TN). The location is not far off the beaten path and provided us with a quiet, tranquil and peaceful night of rest. We would highly recommend to others and hope to return for a stay someday in the future.
Thank you, Kevin & Sherri!!"

We would definitely recommend and would definitely stay there again ."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We needed a 3 bedroom location for our family of 6 to stay while traveling. I came across this listing and all the reviews were spot on.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the best airbnb we've experinced! I personally like things clean and taken care of and it looked like we were stepping into a brand new airbnb. We loved the back yard, as it was big enough for my 3 kids and 2 dogs to get lots of running in. It was so peaceful on the back deck during my morning coffee as well. Everything was stocked so well so I was able to make meals there which saved us a lot of money. I especially appreciated the comfortable couch and beds since we stayed for 2 whole weeks."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Den provided our family with just what we needed. The house was clean and gave us plenty of room to relax after a long day. The location is extremely peaceful, yet close enough to Cookeville if we needed anything. This was our second time staying at the Den and will certainly be back."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kevin and Sherri were super responsive with any questions I had. The location and space wasn’t just a breath of fresh air. But beautifully built and very spacious. It was just what me and the pup needed. Super clean, and the natural lighting in every room was to die for.
Seeing the sunrise and sunset from this location was absolutely stunning. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the necessities. And having the check out instructions printed out saved me the hassle of double checking my app all the time to make sure everything was done.
Overall I would give this place a 10/10 and recommend staying at this beautiful location. I would have to say I’ll definitely book with them in the future when I’m back out this way."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay. the home was clean and met all our expectations. We look forward to staying there again.
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had the most relaxing and enjoyable vacation ever here. We were able to invite family over for breakfast and dinner just like we were at home. They had satellite tv, a barbecue grill, two full baths, a porch with chairs, washer and dryer, and very comfortable beds. It is close to Cummins Falls as well as other State Parks, and not far from town. We plan to come back every time we're in Cookeville!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you Kevin and Sherri for sharing your beautiful property! It was spacious for our family of 6 (2 parents and 4 kids). They had all the amenities and supplies of home which made our stay very comfortable. It was so nice to be able to cook a meal and do laundry on our vacation! We brought our own but they even had some toiletries available to use. This was one lodging of several on our 2 week vacation and this was one of our favorites.
The smoke alarm and security alarm went off while we were cooking bacon one morning and Sherri was quick to answer her phone and help us out. We would definitely recommend this property."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location location!! This home is in an absolutely breathtaking setting. We love the countryside.
So serene and peaceful. I honestly could just stay there. The homeowners will direct you as to which exit to take that will guide you past all the handy restaurants and a Publix before you land at the rental. Kevin and Sherri were quick to respond to questions and extremely friendly, courteous host. Respectful of privacy but around if you should need anything. Love the layout of the house. Open concept with Living area leading into Dining into Kitchen. Not cluttered. Very workable for renting. Extremely comfy couch with large TV. However my husband's TV screen was the front porch until after dark each night. Sometimes you just need to unplug. Thank you Kevin and Sherri!!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and serene.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely piece of TN to spend a few days relaxing and getting away from whatever hustle and bustle you come from. The property was clean, well decorated, very spacious shower, open living space. The absolute best part of this property is who you share it with- the sheep and donkeys were the highlight of our trip. They bond with you instantly and we couldn’t wait to come back to them to feed them their carrots and apples and sit by the fire pit watching them graze in the evening. You’re about 15 mins from downtown Cookeville which is so charming, as well as half an hour to Burgess Falls, 45 mins to Rock Island, and an hour to Fall Creek Falls.
The most amazing surprise awaited us when we got there- a one week old baby donkey (born mid May 2024) I wish baby donkey had an IG page I would follow him!
Thank you for the wonderful hospitality, your place made our visit to middle TN such a dream 💚"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is beautiful. The owners left carrots and fruit to feed the sheep and donkeys. We sat outside by the fire pit and all the little animals came right up to the fence for treats.
Cottage is very comfortable and has everything you could possibly need. We will definite
Y stay again next time we are In the area."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful home! It was decorated so sweetly with comfortable furniture and bed! The bathroom shower was wonderful! Had all the amenities needed and more.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My friends and I loved staying at the cottage! We were in town for a wedding and this was the perfect little place to stay for a night. I wish I could have stayed longer! Although not necessarily listed as such, we found this place to be fairly accessible—one floor, walk in shower with pull down shower head, and only a few steps to get from driveway to front door. Lou and David were clear in their instructions, and we were thrilled to see that they provided a mattress topper for the pull out couch bed! They provided apples and carrots to feed the animals, and I loved getting to stay in this cute, quiet cottage. Everything was clean and I didn’t have any complaints whatsoever! Only thing is that my map directions took me to a different house, so it took a couple tries to find the right driveway. Once there, we were golden. Thanks, Lou and David for providing a clean, cozy environment to retreat to, and for your clear desire to create a welcoming space that feels like home!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cottage is very well appointed with everything you may need and more. Beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable. The animals were adorable & Lou and David provide snacks for you to feed them 🐑 Would definitely stay here again!

The accommodations were both comfortable and cozy, with a charming fireplace adding to the ambiance. I was initially concerned about the sleeping arrangements with 4 people; but the pullout couch exceeded my expectations. The additional sleeping pad and foam mattress provided by the host ensured a great night's sleep, which is not always the case with pullout couches!
The location on the farm was a highlight of our stay. We loved interacting with the sheep and donkeys, and the owner stopped to tlak about them to us! We appreciated the fruit provided for feeding them.
The owner was incredibly friendly and hospitable, always available for a chat or to provide recommendations. Their warmth and attentiveness made our stay even more enjoyable."

The kitchen is well stocked, the linens and bedding were fresh and clean, the large walk-in shower was great and the bedroom had plenty of outlets for all our rechargeables.

Wonderfully decorated and I fell into the big comfy couch.
Would highly recommend"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was a little closer to the other house on the property than I thought it would be, but it was a non issue. My dogs never had any interactions with the other pets on the property so that was good. Everything being labeled on where to find and having cleaning supplies and such inside was convenient."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I came from out of town to attend a wedding in the area. We had a wonderful time at Pam’s quaint Tiny house. It was just what we were looking for while we were in town.

We would definitely stay again if it’s available during our travels."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We only stopped here for the night on our cross country trip to AZ, but it was a great place to stop over for the night. The flexible check-in was perfect for our needs because we arrived late. Pam was responsive as well!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Pam’s place was perfect for a quick stay on a roadtrip - right off 40 and easy to get to! Had lots of room for my dog to run around outside as well.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying here. The hostess was very responsive in communications. The only thing that wasn’t perfect was the water heater is small. I ran out of hot water fairly quickly and my husband had to wait quite some time to take a shower. Other than that the place was immaculate, very easy to find, private, and was perfect for our needs."

Bathroom was scrubbed to perfection.
Felt safe in this area"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a very nice stay. Very close to I-40 yet a quiet place on a pretty farm that is nice and peaceful. I got lucky and was treated to a super sunset over the valley to the southwest. It's priced inexpensive, but don't be fooled -- the only thing you give up is the shine that comes with a brand new place. The house is clean and spacious; really liked the rock floor in the big shower with good foot grip on the mortar! The wall heater in the bedroom is great but be careful; it gets hot.
Pam is very friendly, communicative, and accomodating - I got lucky and was able to get a slightly earlier check-in which really helped. Very satisfied."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a quick stop along our journey! It was perfect! Everything we needed for a layover. I would definitely stay here again!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first time using AirBnB and Pam set the bar high! Super nice and great hospitality.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pam’s place was very nice and quaint and perfect for what we needed- a cheap place to stay close to Burgess Falls for a morning excursion. Only complaint we really had is the bed is a little soft and squeaky, but not horrible for a night or two."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a fantastic place to stay. The property is really cool with a few barns and friendly animals around. I was greeted by a few cats in the yard who were all very sweet. It’s very peaceful and private, the neighborhood is tucked away off the highway but still within an easy drive to town where you’ll find quite a few restaurants. Pam is great, she sent clear instructions and was very responsive. The home itself was super comfortable. I got a great night of sleep here and would absolutely recommend it to anyone staying in this area."

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Pam’s place was cute, clean and private. If you enjoy animals, there are lots of cats and a couple dogs. There are limited food options close by so plan your meals accordingly. The only feedback I can give would be that the mattress needs to be replaced. We met in the middle of the bed a couple times during the night, not on purpose. Thanks Pam for your hospitality."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Pam's tiny home. She gave clear instructions for checking in, and the home was just as described.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a great time staying in Pam’s tiny home! There were multiple cats that came to visit us on the porch the morning we were there, she rescued and spayed/ neutered them all and it was such a joy to know I was around good people. Pam was so friendly and the tiny home was very clean, spacious, smelled fresh, the land was a sight to see and also the stars at night were so bright and visible from where we were. Cookeville has so much to offer shopping and eating wise as well as many waterfalls and hiking trails around the area. The price was very fair and we left our trip feeling great about the money we still had in our pockets! Lol we would love to stay here again! Thanks again Pam!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam was very nice and we loved the restraint she recommend nearby (Father Toms Pub). The location of this little place was scenic rural but also very close to nice restaurants in Cookeville. We very much enjoyed the scenery, having morning tea in the outside chairs, petting the barn cats and looking out at the pasture. My biggest issue with our stay was the quality of the bed and couch. Both were pretty old and sunken in, which caused a good amount back pain for my spouse and I as we tried to get comfortable. If the mattress and couch were updated and hot water in the shower improved I would give this place full marks. The decor is adorable and if you don’t have chronic pain issues like I do you would love your stay at Pam’s place. I still very much appreciated this little place to get away from the heat of the festival and hope it continues to improve!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We only stayed one night but we would definitely stay longer if we could! Not a big place but laid out very well and plenty of room for us and two small kids. Everything was clean and welcoming. Great bathroom, shower, & bed was super comfy. Pam was very responsive and friendly. My daughter loved petting the many friendly kitties on the property! Would stay again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Pam’s tiny house was a great place to rest for the night after our long drive. We were welcomed by the cats as we drove into the property. The place looked absolutely beautiful in the morning. Pam provided all necessary supplies for us to be up and ready to continue our road-trip. The only thing to note is there is no washer or dryer in the place.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing place! Beautiful view, clean cabin, great shower (which does not go unnoticed two days into a cross country road trip). Made me want to move to Tennessee!"

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We only stayed one night on our way home from a southern vacation, but this was a perfect stop for us! The house was very reasonably priced and comfy! It’s exactly like the pictures/description states!
Pam gave great directions and instructions prior to check in!!
The tiny house is located on their property, but we felt we had plenty of privacy!"

Highly recommend!!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is our second time, as it met our needs so well before. Love everything about this place!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Pam’s place just passing through the area on a trip through Tennessee. It was cute, quiet, and very clean. We also agreed it was the best sleep we had the entire trip as the bed was super comfortable. Like other people mentioned there are some very sweet cats that will greet you which we really enjoyed. I would 100% recommend it to anyone traveling in the area and would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay! Pam’s tiny home is even more wonderful than the pictures. Very clean and well situated. We had a brief stay for my brothers graduation, but it is cozy enough for a much longer trip! Would definitely recommend."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pam's place was perfect for my overnight stay -- clean, comfortable and easy to find. It's a great location -- nearby Cookeville has lots of restaurants and Burgess Falls State Park is only about 8 miles away. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My only complaint is that there was no sugar for my coffee and I had forgot to bring my honey. No big deal, I survived! It is a quaint place and is close to Burgess Falls State Park. Sure, you can pay a little less at a cut rate, generic hotel and hope for the best. But, this place has character and was peaceful/quiet. Filled up my tank with cheap(er) gas in nearby Ditty (yes, it is itty bitty!). Overall, reminded me of home...but away from home. Even saw indigo bunting birds! Would recommend to anyone wanting to explore the waterfalls around the area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was very nice place and would suggest it to anyone to stay here.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an adorable tiny home! Love the touches of vintage and yesteryear decorations. It was comfortable and homey!

It was a delightful place to stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam was a perfect host for our one night stay. It was clean, and even in tiny living it was still plenty of space for me, my husband and our dog. Loved how peaceful it was and enjoyed waking up to birds chirping outside the window! Highly recommend."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The tiny house is a country quaint stay. The yard is large and the house quite a distance from the road, so I was never concerned about my dog being in danger when he was outside. It very convenient to ""city stuff"", but also only a short jaunt to Burgess Falls, Prayer Mountain or Window Cliffs ."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pam's place was clean, quiet and a nice place to stay for a night while we attended our Grandson's college graduation. Pam was very quick to message me back when I had a question about her accommodations before I decided to book her place. Close to restaurants even though you may feel you are out in the country and very pleased with the overall location."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The tiny home was just what we needed for our one night stay! The yard was large enough for our children to run and play, and the outdoor cats were super friendly, to the point of greeting us at check-in and check-out.
It is the best pet friendly location in the area, yet the inside was immaculately clean. I'd recommend this tiny home to anyone."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The tiny house was just that. It was cozy and I loved the little kitchen area. Everything was clean and it was a great little place. Thanks Pam!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pam was helpful and kind! This was a great, budget-friendly spot for a quick stay in Cookeville. It was clean, organized, and I slept great on the mattress! The surrounding area was very quiet and the neighborhood seemed very safe (which I really appreciated). Something to keep in mind is the water in the shower will only stay warm (not hot) for about ten minutes. We would definitely stay again! :)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam was a wonderful host, and it was perfect for a one night stay with our pet on our move to TX."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is such a cute little stay! It is small, but laid out nicely with so it doesn’t feel small at all! It has all your necessities and more! We only stayed one night as we were passing through on a road trip, but brought both of our GSPs with us and all went well! Would highly recommend! Plus the views are wonderful too!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a cute cottage in a quiet farm setting. The fun interior is an artsy creative mix of antiques and modern conveniences.

The kitchen and bathroom were both well stocked and the bed was very comfortable. I felt right at home! I definitely recommend this stay to others.
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice sweet person with the help of her husband. Willing to answer and attend to my needs. But my guest did not enjoy the her stay at all. A decent little house but needs two major repairs in the bathroom.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a great stay at Pam’s place. We were only passing through the area to hike but would definitely come back. It was also a great spot to stay with our dog. The tiny home was so cozy and had everything we needed.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My roommate and I had a great time at Pam's place! It was clean and very cozy. She had plenty of extra sheets, blankets, and towels. Pam herself was so good at responding. She even bought us coffee filters when we suggested that we wanted to use the coffee pot. The land the guesthouse is on is beautiful. The location is convenient because you are 10-15 aways from the downtown area but you are in a quiet residential neighborhood. Would 100% recommend Pam to anyone!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nothing out of place at Pam's listing. a great overnight stay with our pets.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam is probably the friendliest host that I have encountered. She made us feel right at home. Our stay was just an overnight on a longer trip through the area, and this location was all that we needed. Convenient to the interstate and a variety of local restaurants. We had our beagle with us, and she loved the yard (and barking at Pam's dogs and cats). The hot water heater is on the small side, so if there's more than one person, you'll need to be judicious with the length of your showers."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great little spot in the country. Pam is a super host, highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was hands-down one of the best AirBnB stays we've had. Pam’s place was right off of the interstate and easy to find.

Had everything listed in description. Most definitely would stay again. 100% recommend."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Pam’s place! It was cute and cozy, yet spacious for a tiny home. You can tell they have put a lot of time and care into the space. We loved it and would definitely stay again!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little home for a night on our way through Tennessee. Pam was extremely responsive and helpful as we had some fear of weather coming through. Burgess Falls (a suggestion from Pam) was a nice morning hike before hitting the road again as well. Very much appreciate the hospitality!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot, very cozy!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Pam’s place was cozy and a great fit for a one night works today!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our second stay at Pam’s cottage and it did not disappoint! It is stylishly decorated and Pam has added personal touches to make it feel homie.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is my home away from home. Charming, quaint, peaceful."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We greatly enjoyed our stay in this little house! It was exactly as described, and it was just enough space for us (two adults and one child). There are lots of farm cats, so you may get some feline visitors if you sit on the porch—but that was a bonus for us! The string lights around the outside were also a pretty touch and a great way to find the house in the dark."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pam, consider yourself lucky. My wife and I talked about if there was a way we could hook your tiny house up to a hitch and take it with us, but we couldn't figure it out. That's how much we loved your place! Exactly as described, it was squeaky clean and had those special touches that only come from someone such as yourself that has an eye for detail and understands how to make someone feel at home. We stay at AirBNBs all around the country and you've moved into our Top 5. Will we be back? Heck yeah!!! Thanks for being an awesome host."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had plenty of space to park and the place was very clean.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was hands-down one of the best AirBnB stays I’ve had. It was eat-off-the-floors clean, Pam was so friendly and helpful, and it was super comfortable. I would absolutely stay there again!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Arrived after dark and was happy to see that the cottage was lit up very well so we were able to find our spot even in the dark. Place was decorated with cute antiques, pebble floor shower. Every amenity you could need. I loved my cup of hot chocolate in the morning. She even had popcorn available for a late night snack. Bed was comfortable, AC worked great, price was the best!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Listing was exactly as listed. Perfect location around National Parks. We did some hiking in the area. There’s a Dominos less than 10 minutes away for a late lunch after being out all day! Listing was clean and comfortable. Area was quite and relaxing.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very quiet farm surrounded by other farms. Wake up and look out the window to birds and neighboring horses. Easy to access. Great for anyone pulling a trailer. She has a great little turn out paddock if you are traveling with horses (or donkeys in my case). Her daughter did a great job making sure they had water both nights. Also was close enough to 127, yet far enough to not get caught in the hustle and bustle of the garage sales! Reccomend it for sure. Will most likely be back :)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pam has a very cozy, clean, and unique place. It has some beautiful views along with being 13 minutes or less to Burgess Falls. It is also close to town to grab a nice dinner. My husband and I had a wonderful stay! Everything needed to expire Cookeville, TN and surrounding areas."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little place to stay, close to I-40 and about 10 minutes to downtown Cookeville. The pebble floor in the shower was a nice touch and there were two cold waters waiting for us upon arrival."

My only issue was the internet went out on us"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was very nice inside with comfortable beds and pictures were accurate. Unfortunately the traffic noise kept us awake.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient and clean! We love staying here for all our college children activities! We came for graduation this time and had a great experience in the home again. We love the location and the ease of staying. Except for some sirens overnight, it was great and so comfortable. Highly recommend."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the layout of the space and it was in a great location. We found it was loud at night with being right by a busy road so bring earplugs. We were also disappointed at how uncomfortable the beds were despite the design and style of the place looking so great. No one in a party slept well and felt pretty stiff and sore the both mornings. Would have been a 5 out of 5 if the beds were more comfortable. Host was very accommodating to our request for late checkout and even had some small details around the place that showed a thoughtful touch.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a perfect place to come and meet up with our daughter who lives close to Cookeville. Clean and very comfortable. The host are very kind and helpful.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"very cozy and nice space, we felt at home, Stacey & Mallie very friendly responded quickly to our questions! I really recommend it 😍"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect spot for a night in Cookeville: easily walkable to everything around, spacious, and extremely clean. It was even baby-friendly for our one-year old. Had a great time and would recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Stacey and Mallie’s home is beautifully decorated and exceptionally clean. The pictures do not do it justice. They are wonderful hosts with an easy check in and check out process. Although we had a short stay we look forward to visiting again soon. You will not be disappointed.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot say enough good things about Stacey and Mallie’s loft. It’s the third time we’ve stayed and will be back. First, they were so accommodating when we had to unexpectedly change our travel dates. Next, they arranged a late check out (twice!) to help us be able to complete an outing with our family. (Who even does that anymore?).
And this space is immaculate and amazing. Fluffy towels, toiletries, a hairdryer, board games, pristine linens, and coffee—what else can you ask for?
Poet’s Coffee and Seven Senses Restaurant are walkable, and parking is convenient and felt safe.
You won’t be disappointed."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great find in cookeville walking distance to numerous places. Had some traffic noise due to volume on square and street lights made room a little brighter than preferred at night but not a deal breaker for me.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the nicest Air bnb I have ever booked. My husband and I have a 2 year old and were able to have a night alone together in this beautiful space. The home was immaculate and the location was amazingly convenient. We doordashed steak N shake and had a date night like we were kids again. It was wonderful and I would rent again!!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The loft is beautiful and looks just like the photos. The decor is just amazing. It is nestled in downtown Cookeville which made it close to everything. The loft has everything you would need when traveling. I would definitely recommend others to stay and plan to return in the near future.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, a bit noisy at night."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay in a wonderful location!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend this place. It was extremely clean and comfortable. It was great location. We would definitely stay there again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This loft was in a perfect location, with a quaint little coffee shop named Poet’s right around the corner. We arrived early and the hosts were able to accommodate us with an early check-in.
Furnishings were modern and immaculate. Bathroom had a spacious rainfall shower and jacuzzi tub. And plenty of white, sumptuous towels.
Lots to do within walking distance, including the Seven Senses restaurant for a nice meal less than a ten minute walk away. We have family in the area and are thankful we found this little gem for our visits."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was our first visit to Cookeville, Tn. Very awesome place to visit and we thoroughly enjoyed staying here. It was in a very central location close to just about anything!!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were fabulous & so kind. I will come back. Highly recommend this awesome paradise!!!!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect place! The kitchen has everything we needed. The space was bigger than anticipated, and having the pack and play was so nice. The place is a short walk to a coffee shop and my husband even walked to a music store. The WiFi was fast, and I was able to run zoom for meetings with no problem.
The floors were so clean that I had no problem letting our 10 month old crawl around without worry. I should have asked what the length of the stairs was though- moms, it’s a little farther than a standard baby gate, so we had to use other items to block the stairs, but no biggy.
The hosts were responsive and kind. I would 1000% stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft is beautiful! It’s spacious with multiple, comfortable seating areas. We stayed in and cooked in the kitchen for dinner and breakfast - the kitchen had everything we needed. Loved having ceiling fans in all the rooms with remotes! That was a little touch that was appreciated!
It is in a town center and we were there on a Saturday night. There was live music outside until early in the morning and sirens several times throughout the night so sleeping was a little tough. But we knew that would be possible.
The loft is within walking distance to coffee shops and restaurants and very close to stores if you need to run out. This was a perfect place for a halfway meet up point with a friend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very beautiful and comfortable place to stay. Everything was perfect.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home was wonderfully appointed inside. Tons of space and lovely furnishings. Sleep was however challenging due to constant road noise and street lighting. It was a nice stay regardless and I appreciated the quick response to my last minute request to book.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at this property. It's walkable to local coffee shops, restaurants, and a nearby park. We recommend this place when visiting Cookeville."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we have stayed in Stacey and Mallie’s loft. We absolutely love it! It’s roomy and comfortable and gorgeous. Very well appointed. The bed is super comfortable and there is plenty of space for two couples to stay. There was coffee provided in the kitchen that was very well stocked with a full refrigerator, stove, microwave, large island with a sink, and a huge dining room table. There is a separate sitting area with comfy couches. It’s gorgeous! The location is in downtown Cookeville which is a super cute college town of Tennessee Tech. We will definitely stay there again!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our hosts were wonderfully proactive and friendly. They were very responsive in confirming my reservation request and willing to work on the check in time with me.
The place was exactly as shown. It was clean, bright, inviting and comfortable. This is our first time using an Airbnb, and Stacy and Mallie's place certainly impressed my family and I.
It was right in downtown, with plenty of places to walk to, and parking was easy. We will certainly consider this place again when we come into town."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay at this place. We didn’t have to drive all weekend long and had lots to do.
The place was immaculate and spacious. Very aesthetically pleasing.
Downtown was steps away and the historic area was just a short walk, as well.
We ate at Char for dinner one night which was good food for a great price. The next morning we walked to Ralph’s donuts and seeing that it has been around since 1962 we can definitely tell why. We had Poets Coffee which is walking distance.
We even made a stop into the history museum, all by foot. We walked to World Foods and had a great sandwich and salad for lunch. There were lots of cute shops and boutiques to walk to as well.
On Sunday we were able to go hiking at Cummins Falls which was pretty close by.
We would highly recommend staying here if you like being in the heart of town and close to lots to do.
We would definitely stay here again! Thank you for sharing your place."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay when in town. So close to TN Tech (easy, quick drive less than 1 mile), and close enough to walk or a quick drive to great restaurants. Very clean and tastefully decorated. We felt right a home. Thank you for such a wonderful place to stay and for accommodating us last minute!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time here and we love this space. Will be visiting again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place in cookeville. Would stay again if visiting the area. Beautiful decor, clean, and well appointed for anything you may need."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a little misunderstanding on my end and the hosts were more than understanding and reasonable in getting it resolved! Great place and great hosts!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed one day/overnight. Loft was quite spacious and open. Plenty of dining and den space and comfortable seating. Large TV's in both these areas would be great for watching sports. We listened to music and relaxed. Walking distance to restaurants, if you don't mind walking and able to do so. Be mindful will need to climb stairs to get to living space of condo, but the staircase was comfortable and clean just like any expectation of staircase in a house. Plenty of sidewalk to safely walk around town and in the neighborhood. Enjoyed running to Tenn Tech's campus exactly 1 mile away to student union building. Traffic was not busy as classes for Fall 2023 had not yet started back and was a Sunday morning"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful space for wedding day getting ready!! Right across from the United Methodist Church and super close for walking to local restaurants and coffee shops!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We will stay here next visit back!!
Loved location- coffee shop, restaurant, distillery,; parks within block- also 1/2 mile walk to historic train depot and lots of shops and restaurants… parking is easy. Great running 👍
Loft was perfect for the two of us- loved what they did with the space. Didn’t cook but the kitchen had everything you would want or need. Bath and a half works! The main bath was awesome and the half bath great for my husband-👍
Loved what they did and to know these couples have several other properties in the area means there are spots for everyone! Thanks again,
Kitty and Jim"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable, impeccable, and exceedingly comfortable and convenient spot in downtown Cookeville."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love the Airbnb. It was my first experience. It was very close to the wedding we attended. My husband didn’t like the stairs but he loved everything else about it. Our next trip to Cookeville we will be trying to get it again Thanks Stacey and Mallie for a great weekend.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place !!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing space, centrally located, and close to Poet's Coffee!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place makes you feel very much at home!! Very comfortable
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was one of the best places I have ever stayed out. The loft is better than the pictures- it is beautiful, spacious, and clean. It is close to everything"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly as described. The place was easy to find, albeit hidden right before your eyes. The place can easily accommodate 4+ persons and was clean and inviting. The location is also optimal, as numerous local staples and new options are within walking distance or a short 1-2 minute drive.
The only cons were that there can be quite a bit of street noise that gets through (you’re on a busy square though so to be expected) and we hoped there would be at least water or coffee options on arrival and there were not. Other than that, this is a great stay and is competitively priced for the location and overall cleanliness compared to your other local options.
Note that there are about 15 stairs to climb to get to the stay itself. These are unavoidable."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with great hosts❣️
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gorgeous place! Definitely high end all the way through. Gorgeous decor, kitchen and bathrooms and comfy bed and couch. They did not spare any expense with remodeling. The shower controls takes a little figuring out, but great once you get the hang of it. There was laundry soap and extra waters in the bathroom closet which I didn't use (not doing laundry on vacation!), but nice to have. Be aware that because you are above a business in town there is a lot of traffic noise, but it's fun being downtown sometimes. Great location super close to lots of great restaurants. Cookeville is a college town and has a great vibe. Would definitely stay there again!!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute gem if you plan on staying in Cookeville, TN. Walking distance to many restaurants & shops, ample parking. The interior is beautifully decorated and very inviting.
We'll be back!!!

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very beautiful, extremely loud
Such great hosts, beautifully well maintained place, but only reason didn’t give it 5 stars was bc it so incredibly noisy from the road noise. Walkable and has restaurants."

Communication was very good"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The upstairs condo was very spacious, new and clean, and was centrally located to easily walk around downtown Cookeville. Stacey & Millie were attentive, quick to respond and check in was a breeze. Would definitely stay here in the future!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is excellent! The loft was really comfortable. The beds were amazing. Only small downside is the road noise and the work being done in the offices under the loft in the morning but those things would not prevent me from coming back to this spot again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love the place, so large . Well stocked. Definitely will stay again."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic location, super clean, and plenty of space! Great communication and great hosts!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at the Loft! It has everything you need to make your visit to Cookeville special. The beds were super comfortable, it was very clean and Stacey & Mallie have put a lot of thought into all the little details. Be aware that there is a long flight of stairs to reach the loft as it's on the second floor, if your group has mobility concerns. It's also located right downtown, so the traffic was a little noisy at times, but Stacey & Mallie thoughtfully included a white noise machine and there are ceiling fans that help with that issue."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Perfect location and could not have been more comfortable. Will stay again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft is beautiful, comfortable, and conveniently located. We were able to walk around town and enjoy the night life. The loft is across the street from Poets so we recommended getting breakfast there (if you aren’t cooking in the fabulous kitchen)."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We decided last minute to stay in Cookeville. I’m so glad we found Stacey and Mallie’s listing. The place was spotless and so nicely decorated and furnished. My 5 yr old loved the puzzles and games provided! Will stay again when visiting my son at college!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our 3 night stay here. We especially enjoyed coffee (generously provided by the host) on the deck in the mornings watching the birds and chipmunks.
Such a beautiful well appointed little place to take in this beautiful area!
We chased waterfalls during the day and tried out the restaurants of Cookeville in the evenings. Hope to return!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little cottage! Felt very secluded but was only a short drive to Cookeville, many restaurants, and lots of hiking/beautiful waterfalls! Would definitely stay there again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Extremely well thought out and well designed house. Very comfortable. Charming and clean. Would definitely stay there again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is basically a 5-star hotel in the middle of nowhere. I was initially drawn to this Airbnb because it's a tiny house and I like to experience the different design decisions that owners make when they create a small space. But this little place was FABULOUS. Natural light was amazing, and the interior lighting was also strong. The attention to detail is high - beautiful tilework, live edge counters in the kitchen and bath, great use of wood and steel. And then there were all the other thoughtful elements - availability of decaf Keurig pods, a couple of umbrellas that we ended up needing, washer/dryer availability. The value for this place was excellent, I felt at home every moment I was here, and appreciated the outdoor deck for the few times when the sun was out! I believe the owner lives next door, but there is ultimate privacy on this lot. Excellent stay, can't say enough good things."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,David’s place was a little gem! It was quiet but easily accessible. It was wonderful opening the doors and hearing the birds outside!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was perfect for a couple. It was peaceful. And very clean. The location was great for getting to places in Cookeville, Sparta & State Parks. Would recommend staying here. We would stay again."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice location. Felt at home.

David is kind and very responsive. And downtown Cookeville is very close with lots to do. Can’t wait to come back!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our 4th stay at the Mountain Cottage. Just as perfect as the first. So quiet with great views. The only place we stay when we travel to Cookeville. Thanks David.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here! The space was very clean, well stocked and comfortable. If I’m in the area again I would definitely re-book! I recommend staying here for those who are looking for a clean, quiet, well-designed space!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable space! I loved the open concept and the surrounding areas. The wraparound porch was amazing. I should have paid attention to the size of the bed but it was comfortable. I loved the two bathrooms, that made it convenient for us to get ready in the morning."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,David’s cottage is a beautiful home away from home. We enjoyed our stay tremendously and want to come back to visit in the future. David is very responsive in communication. He also keeps his cottage very clean for new arriving guest.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay with a responsive and nice host.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stopped in Cookeville for a few days before continuing across the country. The place was top tier. Every detail counts when you’re sleeping anywhere except your own bed and this place had every detail right. The bed, pillows, towels, showers all made the experience better.
During the stop, We checked out a few overlooks, trails, and falls — all within 20 mins of the place. Which is Super ideal after a long tiring hike. If you’re planning to visit any of these overlook/trail/falls spots, we recommend taking the backroads to them, the winding roads are beautiful and honestly super refreshing to see the land dictate the road rather than the road dictating the land.
The mornings and evenings had the cool mountain mist and breeze so the multiple sliding doors and large windows throughout the place is a huge plus.
We work remote so wifi was necessary and we had no problems during our stay. The only issue we had was the slow responsive Roku TV.
Overall 10/10"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Close to town but far enough away. Very clean. Went on two awesome hikes to Cummins Falls and Burgess Falls. Found good food in town. Recommended David’s place to 3 other couples.

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint. The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is because they listed dry wood under the deck. We did not see any.
Love the 2 bathrooms and the wonderful shower gel and shampoos. We would go again!
Karissa"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was nice and cozy and well represented on the site. The host really pays attention to cleanliness and the small details for their guests. The greatest standout of the trip was how easy it was to communicate with the host and his willingness to help us out on short notice.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love it here, this was our second stay! Perfect for a relaxing getaway. Most of our plans got rained out so we were very thankful to have a comfy spot to wait out the weather. Thank you for creating such a nice little space!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at this little cottage. It was exactly as described and even better in person.

We will definitely return to this Airbnb and Cookeville to enjoy all the outdoor activities.
Thanks again David and Emily ♥️"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved David’s peaceful, modern cabin. Two bathrooms allowed fast departures in the morning.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing! Perfect location close to the cute little town of Cookeville while being out in an area with more land and room to “breathe”. Very clean (and I’m picky about that), lovely decor, exceptionally comfortable night’s sleep, and all the comforts of home. We loved the natural light, deck, and firefly light show at night (beautiful - more than I have EVER seen). David’s local recommendations were very helpful - Father Tom’s Pub was great and if you can do it, definitely go swimming at Cummin’s Falls (need a gorge permit you can buy online). Give yourself a minimum of two hours there start to finish (that’s hiking fast and only a short time at the falls), wear shoes you can get wet, and be mindful of closing times for the gorge/park. Check in/out was smooth and the whole stay was easy and very relaxing. I’m ready to move in, lol! Highly recommend!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay. Saw deer and cooked a great meal with lots of top notch cooking essentials. Double bathrooms were definitely appreciated, beds were super comfy, beautiful decor.

2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a great place to stay, private yet close to town. We had a family of 5 and it really was very comfortable. It was nice that it had two bathrooms as with a larger family extra bathrooms always helps when getting everyone ready. I enjoyed it being close to town (about 8 to 10 mins away) which made it quick and easy when you needed to get dinner or something from the store. Cookeville is a great town with a big variety of restaurants, stores and history. We ended up going to Burgess State Park which was a great hike and featured some beautiful waterfalls. Host was very responsive and we really had no issues. We would stay again if in the area. Thanks"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so cute, clean, and well-stocked! Tons of natural light but blinds and blackout curtains everywhere so you can still sleep in if you want to. Having two bathrooms was really nice and we loved the cozy loft area. The location is great, not too far from Nashville and we were even able to comfortably drive out to the Great Smoky Mountains for a day. Cookeville itself is great, too! Everything you could need is close by but you still get a nice hillside view and getaway vibes at the cottage. 10/10, we can't wait to come back!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cottage is so so good!! We truly had a wonderful time! You can tell that David put alot of time and thought into this cottage design.

The ship's ladder was such a nice addition and so functional. The weather was just perfect during our stay! We will definitely be returning to David's cottage! Thank you for your wonderful hospitality!
Be well,
-Kristin, Eric and family"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! I want one! This modern cottage is gorgeous! As soon as it comes into view, this place is out of the ordinary, sitting quietly on the side of a hill. A nice gravel drive leads to plenty of parking and the low rise ( illuminated at night) wooden steps that lead to the the lovely 3-side deck and front door. Entry was very simple using the code provided. Once inside, you are welcomed by windows GALORE in the high ceiling main room. The left side of the room is a sufficiently equipped kitchen area with full size appliances. There is a 4 person dining table and ample seating on modern furniture. You can immediately see the ship ladder up to the loft with very unique wood and wire railing. There’s a king size bed and workspace up there. WiFi was fast and on the tv we mostly cast the our favorite series from our phone. Pick Up Sticks was our favorite of the gamed provided. The main bedroom is the perfect size with floor to ceiling windows on the corner room. The mattress is soo comfortable, bedding cozy, and nice dense pillows. There are TWO full size bathrooms! One of them had a mounted tv to watch while you soak in the jacuzzi tub. We didn’t want to leave the cottage, but we ended up traveling the 5-10 minutes to downtown Cookeville. We ate dinner at Crawdaddy’s, a local Cajun restaurant. They didn’t take reservations, but the wait wasn’t bad, It was such a wonderful experience! We had crab cakes, fried green tomatoes, catfish bites, lobster, jambalaya, and some refreshing cocktails. We browsed some of the local boutiques and stores. We were smitten with Harper’s Bookstore! It was full of vintage vinyl, magazines, posters and books, and they were so helpful finding an uncommon gift for my son’s 18th birthday bday. We packed a picnic and lunched at the beautiful Dogwood Park, David recommended. We didn’t want to leave on Sunday. They had to run us out. We loved the whole experience and appreciate David and Emily’s hospitality. We will definitely be back!"

The location was perfect for me- far enough out of town to feel the peace and solitude of nature, while still being within a 10-15 minute drive of a surprising number of restaurants, coffee shops, and breweries! Thank you David!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for an enjoyable respite from our busy life. The cottage was an exceptional, cozy retreat “to come home to” after a day of galavanting through the wooded hills of Tennessee. This was our second trip east to see the fall colors and neither your home nor the scenery, disappointed. … a must stay for anyone staying in Cookeville! Peace, John + Karin"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage is stocked with everything! And that's not even the best part - which is the incredible privacy and serenity of this little house situated on acreage just outside of town.

I hadn't slept so well in years! We'll definitely be back."

From the exceptional quality and design of the cottage to the many thoughtful/personal touches (literally the best stocked spice cabinet I’ve ever seen in an air bnb), this place has it all. We had the most perfect weekend away from the noise of the city, and got to relax with the beautiful green views, sounds of nature, incredible wrap around porch, and amazing amenities. Hands down our favorite air bnb to date. So many cooking supplies, the mattresses are to die for, the windows make the cottage feel so spacious and airy, and the grill/fire pit are like cherries on top of a perfect sundae. David and Emily are very kind, professional, and gracious hosts, and created such a perfect getaway space with this listing. We can’t wait to come back again soon!"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a fabulous weekend at this Airbnb as it was perfect for my wife and I and our two girls. We thoroughly enjoyed exploring nearby state parks. Over the New Year’s weekend many Cookeville restaurants were closed but David and Emily’s place was well stocked and great for cooking in. The sunsets in particular were gorgeous from the many windows. We very much hope to come back.

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It looks just like the pictures. The hosts are so responsive and helpful. We spent several weeks there as a “work from vacation” spot. Internet is plentiful and it’s so comfortable and relaxing. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a rental get 5 stars and all glowing reviews like this one, but now I know why. It is perfect! It’s a well-designed cottage and the outside is also amazing. Tons of bluebirds and wrens in the yard if you like birdwatching."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow! Don’t hesitate. It’s as beautiful as it is clean and full of everything you need!

It’s really beautiful!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would buy this place today if David and Emily sold it! What an amazing getaway with every perfect detail accounted for. David and Emily provide everything you’ll need to be comfortable and cozy. Lots of extra towels, softest linens and blankets, great soaps and hair products, a nice coffee station and everything you need for s’mores and a fire. Seriously felt like this home was built yesterday and like no one had ever stayed in it. Amazing appliances and two awesome bathrooms. Looking at the outside you can’t tell how spaciously cozy it will be on the inside. Would love to stay here again!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful spot. Everything was pretty perfect for our stay. They have thought of pretty much everything for a great time. Only bummer was the wood was all wet from the rain, so we couldn't get a fire going, otherwise, I would say flawless. The other reviews are accurate, it's beautiful. Yeah, maybe a bit pricey, but good luck finding anything else this nice anywhere close. You'll enjoy it."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay!! The most beautiful and relaxing Airbnb. The location was great and we appreciated the local tips. The most well stocked Airbnb we have ever stayed in and extremely clean! We can’t wait to stay again! 😊

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a perfect little place for our family to get away. Beautiful, comfortable, and the host had thought of everything we might need."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was the perfect pick for a quiet getaway. There was plenty to do in the area, but the space is so lovely that even staying put is a treat. It was wonderful to have things like spices, and olive oil on hand. They even had bug spray, wood for the fire pit, and other things that made us feel at home and that we didn’t have to worry if we forgot some things. We will definitely be telling our friends about this spot!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great home-- thoughtfully designed, styled, and stocked. My husband and I really appreciated the his and hers bathrooms (a luxury at home we rarely get to experience while traveling), we enjoyed meals on the deck (the weather was perfect!), and the fire pit was the perfect place to watch the Harvest Moon rise on our anniversary. The home is on a main road, but it is not heavily trafficked and the house sits back quite far so you don't see traffic from inside. The backyard and porches also feel private. Beautiful wildflowers separate the listing from its closest neighbor and the space feels remote though it is just 10 minutes from downtown Cookeville. We chose this location for it's proximity to Burgess and Cummins Falls & hope to return to explore more of the natural beauty in this area!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute quaint spot! Perfect little getaway! Can’t say enough good things about it!

There are a lot of waterfalls to visit in the area and then spend a relaxing evening at the cottage.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying here, & it’s sooo quaint! All the windows allow lots of natural light in.

Still our favorite Airbnb :)"

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I had such a great time here. We had some rain when we first arrived, which resulted in a beautiful fog/condensation viewable through the floor to ceiling windows. The Roku TVs and games came in handy for the weather, and when it cleared up we went to see Bee Rock which was recommended by the hosts and was just a quick trip away. It was an easy walk with beautiful views!
The cottage is beautiful and all of the throw blankets and pillows made the space so cozy. We can't wait to visit again."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a true gem! Very clean, modern and stylish cottage within 5 to 10 minutes of the city. You are close enough, but yet far enough away to feel a bit in a relaxed, quiet country setting. Emily and David are fantastic hosts and the cottage has everything you will need and then some! We enjoyed the hiking and local restaurants and boutiques. Can’t wait too book a future stay - We will be back!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at David and Emily’s place! The house had a lot of thoughtful architectural touches and the space was very cozy and clean. We enjoyed drinking coffee and sitting on the back porch in the morning, and sitting by a warm fire and watching the fireflies in the evening. The house is an easy drive to downtown Cookeville and close to several hikes. We would definitely visit again for another weekend getaway, maybe with some friends next time!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place and a very charming cottage! I would suggest to add a path down to the fire pit so people can safely walk to it, especially at night."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great space. Well located for my work travel needs. Easily accommodated myself and my coworker. I’ve stayed here before so this was my second stay at this location. Each time the experience has been great with the space and the host

It was close most restaurants and whatever you needed.
House was just the right size and quiet for the neighborhood.
I would recommend staying here"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed a full week while we were checking out the area for a relocation and the home was exactly what we were looking for. The living room was just as comfy as it looked. We were 2 adults and one 10 year old, there was plenty to do for everyone. I am a coffee drinker so I appreciate the full coffee pot over the pods many are putting in these days. There is one TV in the home which I also really love, and it is a Roku so it’s easy to use. My daughter and I spent most of the time outside as the yard is naturally beautiful and green (we are from Phoenix), or playing games. The home is located on a main road but is set far on the lot which made exploring the town easy and lessened the street noise. If you have a Macron lover in the family I highly recommend The French Cookie downtown."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute place and perfect for our quick trip. Exactly as described and great location.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,My wife and I stayed for seven nights to do some hiking and see waterfalls in the area. Clean and cozy home that is approximately one mile from the historic district with shopping and great local restaurants. We would recommend staying here!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This home is very comfortable and a great place for a stay. I enjoyed the large living area and the furniture was extremely comfortable for resting. I was driving my daughter's car from Texas to Virginia for her return to college and every inch of it was packed with all her belongings. I really needed a place that I felt comfortable leaving her belongings in the car and this place was a great fit. The home has a covered carport that sits right outside the entry and was perfect for what I needed.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the second property we rented from Stacey & Mallie, again it was decorated lovely, very clean, had all we needed, and a great location. The beds were super comfy and in a quiet location. I wish we could have stayed another night."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed for 1 night while in town for a funeral.
Such a cute house with amazing interior design!
The backyard is quaint and peaceful and the living room gets so much light.
My parents stayed nearby at a hotel for double the price and came to pick me up pre-funeral. They joked about why didn’t they book this place it’s so charming!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Private, quiet, clean and very well located for my one night stay need."

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The location was perfection for where we wanted to be in reference to a wedding we were attending. The layout was cute and ideal for anyone with small children, as you can always have an eye on them!
Things we loved:
-fully functioning kitchen
-the host provided books and activities for little ones (we brought our own, but it was a pleasant surprise, as “new” things are always more appealing)
-location
-keyless entry
Things we wished we knew/could change:
-both stairways into the house are quite steep—not a huge dealbreaker, but extra caution was needed when entering/leaving
-better lit driveway—we found ourselves coming in super late on most nights and it was very easy to miss the driveway, as it wasn’t well lit. Simple reflector poles could help identify it!
The hosts were super communicative and leave the house well stocked with supplies if you are staying multiple days. We appreciated their attention to detail will book again if we are staying in the area."

If you need hair/nail needs the folks over at My Fathers Mustache have a great salon I used. Was 10 minutes from the Lanes Bend wedding venue and grocery store 2 min down the road. Water pressure is great, tv with Netflix, the bed envelops you with all the comfort. High five for the loop in the drive way making coming and going very easy. I will definitely be back next time I’m in town see friends. Great communication with hosts I really can’t think of anything I didn’t absolutely love."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You can't go wrong by choosing this cute comfortable space!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an adorable old house with character and charm. while the house is small, it is very comfy. The two bedrooms have a really comfortable beds in them. And the bathroom is small, but it is well stocked with everything you would need. The living room is also very comfy, in fact, it was our favorite room in the house to hang out! The only improvements I could see being made would be the need for patio furniture on the back porch. The backyard is actually very private, and it has a great back porch. however, there is no furniture there as of now. additionally, because the house is older and tends to allow smells to settle when the weather changes, I would highly recommend a few more candles hanging around for visitors to light when they are in for the night. The owners were very communicative, and very helpful with all in any information. The local restaurants are great too!"

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"House was clean except the bathroom floor waw tacky and my husband got a face full of cobwebs in the kitchen.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice place and comfortable. This is located closed to town and for being in town can give the feeling of somewhat secluded as it has trees around the property and no houses directly on top of you.
Sleeping was comfortable as well the living room to relax. Full kitchen and dining room was nice to cook dinners instead of going out.
Plenty of room to park your vehicle and a trailer if you hauling one or bringing motorcycles. Carport was nice for parking the motorcycles.

We usually stay at hotels on the south side of Cookeville, but this property puts us within 5 minutes of most locations when we come to town to visit family. Our little ones, ages 3 and 4, throughly enjoyed having actual space to play with a few toys we brought along for down time during our stay. Having separate rooms helped with a sense of being in a extended ""home"" rather than a cramped hotel room. The various children books were a nice touch as our little ones love love love reading. What's more fun than reading someone else's books?
We definitely looking forward to staying here again in the future as we visit Cookeville at least once a year."

I Requested late checkout for 4 pm, steve told me he need time to clean out as guest is coming, I checked in Airbnb right away way to see if the place is available, it was available and I asked what’s the best time he can give me for late checkout, he never responded to that question. Next day morning I change reservation date and add 2 more days and he approved in less than 5 minutes. Inconsiderate and unresponsive for late checkout request."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful place, a lot bigger than I imagined! Very peaceful and inviting. Would stay here again! ❤️"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Steve’s casita is a great place to stay! It sits behind his house but you won’t notice. Its quite, clean and has beautiful views! Very relaxing!
We would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed at Steve's place because I was moving to Cookeville from out of state. He was a great communicator from the booking process to check out. He gave excellent recommendations for places to go and restaurants. The place was private, quiet and serene. Very updated and clean. It was great for our group because we each had our own room and bathroom. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Oh, it was also very close to town without being in town! The views from the porch were amazing!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay. Spacious for families, two living rooms and patios to relax not be on top of each other. The rooms are large and plenty of room for people to sit comfortably. The beds and linens are very comfortable, again large bedrooms. The rental space sits behind Steve's house but, you wont notice, its quiet and the roiling hills and scenery are extremely nice. Everything was clean everything you need for cooking. The refrigerator was large and also had an ice maker which was great. Would stay here anytime, felt like home and could easily live in a place like this."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A charming home and clean. Communication was smooth and they were able to answer questions in a timely manner. Would request a stay if in the area again.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was so cute and cozy! Would love to come back again one day!
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Stacey and Mallie's communication and flexibility was wonderful! We appreciate letting us in a little early and moving a booking around due to weather.
The house is cute but definitely older. It's remodeled to an extent but honestly could use a little more work and it would be a great little house.
A few issues we had were there was little to no cell phone signal in the home. We did use their WiFi and honestly had to.
The bathroom is very small and practically has no door. It sits a few feet away from the living room so be aware of travelling with someone you're not extremely close to. All activities in bathroom will be heard and likely smelled.
The window in the shower is wood and appears rotting and moldy as well as it didn't lock at all nor did several other windows in the home, which to me is a safety issue.
Street traffic is very loud in the house especially front bedroom. It's a well traveled road and people fly up/down it."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always have a great experience when staying in Cookeville visiting out kids. We’ll be back. Thanks again. Your place makes everything easy
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay! There is so much to do in the area and the house was perfectly centered around everything!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We needed a place to stay the night while we visited a relative who is sick in the hospital and we are so glad we came upon this listing! It’s 15 minutes from the hospital and it’s a very easy trip there. Our 16 month old twins loved the puzzles and toys and we were so thankful to have the extra pack-n-play! You guys have thought of everything. Thank you!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stacey and Mallie’s place was absolutely perfect for our needs. Very cute and cozy, nice TV, beautiful decor and comfy beds. Would absolutely stay here again!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really awesome that they had toys and books for the kids, they loved it!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay for an overnight between days of traveling. We booked two nights on either end of a road trip to break up driving. It was very convenient and easy to find from I 40. Nicely updated, but noticeably older, home. Our first night was with chilly weather, and the heating unit in the bedroom closet was pretty loud and ran often. The big yard and swing out back was great, and we definitely took advantage of it to run off some energy before hitting the road again with our 2 kiddos. It was nice that there were kids books and toys (though geared towards younger little ones) - I was excited to see Cordoroy to read to them as it was one of my favorites when I was little. Our other critique is the shallow shower stall and wide-spraying shower head, which was not ideal for kids, and difficult for us adults even to not get water everywhere. Overall, a charming little house though."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you very much!! This was a great place to stay and y’all were so kind and welcoming. I would recommend it to anyone.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place close enough to restaurants and even to some hikes in some beautiful places. The house is great, super cozy and had everything we needed, would stay again in the future!"

I was impressed!
And you can see these ladies touch by having makeup wash cloths and the phone jack at the edge of the bed!
Classy"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute place, well furnished, kitchen was nice. Had plenty of coffee & ice, which is lacking in some places I've stayed. Will stay again, next time I'm in the area."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute little home, the listing & photos were exactly what were advertise on the webpage.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A comfortable, well-appointed house that is convenient from the road. We especially enjoyed the kitchen, but wish we could have stayed longer to use the fire pit."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four definitely enjoyed our short stay! Our host was very responsive and assisted us with an early check-in. Helpful with a baby! Well furnished and clean. This is a great house for small children. A pack n play and crib are available if needed. There are a lot of toys and activities that our four year old loved! He loved the trucks! He will definitely want to come back. It’s a very peaceful, comfortable house with charm. Definitely recommend!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second stay with these ladies … two of their properties so far .. we felt right at home .. loved the decor and the extra thoughtful extras … it was a home away from home :)
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Hosts were very communicative and welcoming. Home was clean and simple and just what we needed.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place. Very comfortable and cozy. I loved the decor and especially loved the kitchen and dining area. We came to visit the area where my mom and dad grew up and where I spent lots of time as a child. The setting reminded me of my grandparents house and had all the features of a 50's house but with an updated farmhouse feel. I would definitely stay at the house again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We traveled to the area to see waterfalls & enjoy the local parks. The home was very clean & organized. The furniture was comfortable & very clean. There were 2 of us adult women but the hostesses thought of families that might stay as they had a high chair, pack & play, portable crib & toys for several ages. We liked the area as it was nestled in among other homes in a residential area. A convenience store was just down the street. Burgess Falls was only a short drive away!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!! Very thankful we stayed!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four had a wonderful visit! This was a very comfortable, bright, clean home with lots of thoughtful extras for kids.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was perfect for our quick stay. Everything was so carefully thought out down to the extra magazines and coffee creamers.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place itself was perfect. Beautiful, clean and well appointed. Host was friendly, flexible & fast to respond. Cute little cottage close to the falls."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect! I surprised my best friend with an AB&B vs hotel and she was so happy! We both loved it ❤️
Charming, clean, loved the decor yet it reminded us both of going back in time staying at our grandmothers house when we were young. Stacey and Mallie have done an excellent job with this quaint home and I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Great host, great communication and recommendations for dinner. Wonderful experience!! Good job ladies ❤️"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This clean cottage house is centrally located for hiking and getting to town. It has a well-appointed kitchen and comfortable bed. For not being on a main road there was a lot of street traffic, early morning and through the night. It is a rather nice remodel, beautiful wood floors."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was amazing! We stayed for 2 days and it was worth it! Great location super fast to get to restaurants and shopping! My only thing literally which might not be a big deal to most and we definitely made due, was the couch in the living room. It is definitely a sitting couch, super high straight back which made it uncomfortable for watching tv and if you are a couple wanting to cuddle! Literally to me that was the only downside! Everything else was amazing, the house was very cute, clean and just overall welcoming to be in!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cozy, easy experience. Everything was what we needed!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a cute place and we were thrilled to stay here. I only wish we had more than one night there.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I’ve stayed at this listing before along with the other listing they have.. you can not go wrong with any of them!!
Alway feel right at home with all your needs, comfy couch and comfortable beds!
They are quick to answer with any needs or questions you might have as well. I personally look for their listings 1st when I’m coming into town!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a nice time at this house. I was grateful especially for the toys for my 1 year old to play with. It’s next to a busy road, so we had a few loud cars wake us up through the night. Over all, clean, safe, and accommodating!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful place and very comfortable. The Hosts were extremely accommodating. We were so thankful to be able to stay here as it is close to everything. Highly recommend. 🌳

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,we felt right at home in this place! the house was beautiful and the location was great. one of my top favorites bnbs I've ever stayed in. I will definitely return and stay with them again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Stacey and Mallie’s house was perfect for a quiet staycation in the Tennessee mountains. The house is older and is certainly renovated so you might see or experience some quarks that an older house has. However, Stacey and Mallie put a lot of hard work into modernizing the home and you can tell they take pride in their property. The place is perfect for a lazy morning or a quiet night in, or you’re within 10 minutes from some very nice bars and restaurants downtown. The hiking and trails in the area are wonderful as well. I really enjoyed my stay and I highly recommend this property!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve stayed here multiple times, and have wonderful visits every time. Stacey & Mallie’s place is always spotless, warm and inviting, and they are friendly and gracious hosts. We appreciate having such a nice home to return to when we’re in the area, and look forward to our next visit!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a perfect place for our stop over. Very clean and well equipped. The kitchen had everything we needed to make dinner and we went to Poets for coffee and bagel in the morning which was very nice. Thank you for having us!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Communication was great. Answered questions before I even asked. Close to town, yet private. When in the area we would stay there again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved this cozy home. My daughter enjoyed the tree swing & sunroom with kids toys. We look forward to staying here again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was so charming, and just the right size for my friend and I, along with my service dog. The location was great, and we tried out a new place that wasn't listed on their list of restuarants---Toki Poke & Ramen. My friend and I recommend it!
Thank you for the best night's sleep!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful cozy home. We were sorry we were only staying one night!!

Comfortable and cute!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stacey & Mallie’s cozy cottage was a great place. It was clean, comfortable and exactly as described!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We booked the 1950’s charmer and as life works sometimes, there was little hiccup with a skunk that prevented us from being able to stay at that certain listing. Stacey + Mallie let me know early the day of check in and were so amazing. They offered another property of theirs and switched us over with ease! I cannot say enough about how sweet and responsive they were. The listing we stayed at was their Loft in the Square and I fell in love with it as soon as I walked in the door! They are incredible hosts with such cozy furnishings and I will absolutely be looking out for their listings first on any trip I make back to Cookeville. If I could give more than 5 stars I would! Everything about the process was so easy despite things happening being out of our control. They are so wonderful!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really nice, I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful house. Perfect for families.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here at Stacey & Mallie’s place in Cookeville! It was so cosy and comfy. We really appreciated all the extra touches they have for kids. As we’ve been travelling for a few weeks, the toys we brought were starting to get a little stale so it was nice for our 17 month old to have some new things to play with. She loved the little colouring desk & crayons. This house has lovely charm and the area feels very safe. It’s very easy to access and find. We cooked most of our meals at the house and they have pretty much everything you would need, which was so appreciated!
The only small thing was that you can hear everything from the bedrooms and our toddler can be a light sleeper (although we have noticed this in other Airbnb’s in the US so maybe our houses in Europe are just insulated more). It wasn’t a major problem for us and we still loved our time here. Thanks for having us!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy. The Christmas tree was a nice touch. Would definitely stay there again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"cute little house, very cozy! felt like a farm home I grew up in!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a sweet, wonderful home in which to spend a romantic weekend! The home was really well stocked and really cozy and comfortable and super clean. Cookeville is such a cute little town to explore! The owners were super responsive and communicative and even worked with us to get a little later checkout. Will definitely stay here again the next time we're in Cookeville - thank you so much!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is the cutest house with a great location!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We traveled with our 14-month-old and there were several special touches for children, including toys, books and puzzles. The kitchen was well stocked and functional. The home is not far from town. We ordered take-out both nights and ate at the home. Very comfortable and charming stay!"

We loved it!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottages was exactly as described. It was very cute and comfortable. Two of our grandkids came to visit and were excited to play with the toys in the house. The location was excellent and the house had all the amenities we needed for cooking. We will definitely consider renting it again when we visit Cookeville.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We love this cute cottage. We have been three times and it's just perfect. It's right across from the auction, where we go to rescue mama & baby llama & alpacas. It's got a nice big yard, it's thoughtfully decorated, cozy, and we wouldn't stay anywhere else in Cookeville! Highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hubby and I really enjoyed our stay there! Very clean, tidy, cozy & stylish place to stay. This house is most convenient to all restaurants and shopping, with 5-10 minutes to our destinations a big plus! Firm mattresses were a plus for us too. All our needs were met, and hosts were gracious when we did communicate. We'd stay here again in the future."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a wonderful house. I was just passing through alone, but I’d love to bring my family back with me. Such a very cozy house that is very suitable for a family stay. A huge plus is that is just a few minutes off of 40. I highly recommend staying here!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Don't hesitate to book with Stacie and Mallie! The place is clean, quiet, and very private! We enjoyed our stay and will book again when we're back in this area next spring!"

We were able to write a little note to those who will stay in the future! Highly recommend staying here any time you’re in Cookeville
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The house was the perfect size for me and a friend. The desk on the porch was great for working (remotely). TV had most channels (internet TV). They were very responsive to my emails! The house looks like it sits a bit off the road but it actually doesn’t. From time to time (day and night) there is a lot of truck traffic so it can be noisy. Other than that it’s in a great location for a lot of outdoor activities and about an hour from Nashville; and hour and a half from Knoxville.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great! Highly recommend
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was just as described in the listing. The communication with the owners was also great.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved this stay! We were especially grateful for the plethora of young kids toys (and coloring books, and puzzles, and picture books) we found on arrival. What a treat for our 5 yr old and 2.5 year old to discover after a long day on the road! Very comfortable and attractive house in a good, quiet area. Easy access from I-40. Would come again. Thanks!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was fantastic! Going to come back.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love this place! It's simple, clean, well furnished, and exactly as described in the bnb page. Couldn't have asked for a better and more comfortable stay. Thank you Stacey + Mallie!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This home did not disappoint. It was in a perfect location, provided comfort and ease for our visit. The perfect little resting spot."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t have possibly enjoyed our stay more!
GREAT PLACE!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a relaxing stay in this sweet and cozy home. Explored Burgess and Cummins Falls nearby on our way to Fall Creek Falls for a reunion. Clean, comfortable, and close proximity to local attractions!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey & Mallie were great hosts! They communicated all of the information in a clear and timely manner, and their house was so cute."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely stunning home. Super super clean and stocked with the little things like coffee & tea. This little house has been nicely renovated to maintain certain aspects that make this home still feel like a 1950’s home. Such a delightful get-a-way home if you are looking for a place with character. My only regret is not being able to stay longer. Cookeville is such a sweet town and with tons of local eateries and businesses. Stacey & Mallie are amazing hosts with all the answers to the questions we had. I cannot wait to make it back to this location.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a cozy space! Thank you so much for a quaint stay. It was just what we needed.
The queen bed was comfy and the house was clean :)"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great two-night stay to break up a long road trip. Our two kids really enjoyed all the toys, and we appreciated the quiet location, nearby amenities, hiking and well-equipped kitchen."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little house in a nice neighborhood. I loved how close it was to trails or falls. Check in/out was very smooth. Hosts provides multiple numbers to contact them if there are any issues.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location was great for us and our son as a two-night reprieve when traveling home. It’s close to two great hikes — Cummins Falls State Park (a must-see) and beautiful Burgess Falls. The beds were very comfortable, and we loved being able to cook over the campfire one night."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a beautiful stay! We all enjoyed ourselves and would recommend to anyone :)
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were here for a night to visit Cummins Falls. The hosts were prompt in communication and helped with early check in. The house is a fixer upper, and the bathroom is small relatively, but it had everything that we really needed and we were very happy overall. Especially the swing and tree in the backyard is so beautiful. There are even some toys, so definitely a plus for kids. 😊"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stacey and Mallie’s place was the perfect stop for my son and I after our first day of orientation at Tennessee Tech!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is was the perfect place to stay. The house was clean & peaceful the location gives you a bit more privacy with everything just 10-15 min away in town! Communication was also amazing!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Especially for a small family. If you like a peaceful location, highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at this cute little home right off the highway (but still in the country)! It was just as described and pictured, adorable decor and charm. Very family friendly, and has all the extras you forgot to pack. We loved that the AC worked so well, also plenty of hot water, and Netflix and Disney to watch. Cookeville is a fun city to explore and we loved hiking to Waterfalls nearby."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was such a cute place to stay and had all the essentials!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a cute, cozy and very comfortable place. We only came to stay for the night as we were heading back home from Missouri but would definitely love to come back for a longer stay and check out the town!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a nice place.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay. Loved the charm of the place and simple homey feel. The backyard being relatively secluded due to trees in the back and left side was a nice bonus. I would note that because it’s an older build the sound from traffic on the road out front does leak in. But there’s minimal traffic at night. It’s a great area to stay and there are lots of beautiful places to see within minutes if you love the outdoors. We would definitely stay again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stacey and Millie had a last minute issue with the accommodations due to the prior guest, which meant that we were unable to stay in this particular location. But they generously scrambled to provide an alternative housing option (which was quite comfortable) and refunded part of our fee. We really appreciate their efforts and they were wonderful hosts."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cozy little place is Close enough to some city excitement but far enough away to get out and into the outdoors!
Clean convenient and cozy"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved everything about this place!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome, 5 stars across the board.
Everything was very clean, well decorated, comfortable beds.
Prompt response from the host.
Close to town, but also in a country setting.
Would stay again.
Thank you kindly.
Mary from Key West"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is perfect for visiting some of the best waterfalls that middle Tennessee has to offer. The cottage like quaintness was perfect for our celebration of life trip. The beds & living room furniture were very comfortable. The kitchen was stocked with anything we needed including a small charcoal grill for hotdogs. We were thankful for the charcoal & lighter fluid. The fire pit with supplied wood made our drinks by the fire possible for sharing memories. I will look for this rental again in the future when staying in this area.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey & Mallie have the “put the love” into this sweet home. They have all the right utensils, pots & pans, and all the spices you could ever imagine to cook. The house was very neat, well- kept and the lawn is absolutely beautiful! I love the swing in the back. I didn’t use the children’s area, but if you do have kids, there’s plenty there for them to do! They also include a pack-n-play & looked like a Lauren or crib in the closet. Also, a sweet little swing out back for anyone. I was going to use it to take pictures of my daughter for her TTU graduation, but unfortunately it rained the entire weekend! We will definitely be back the first opportunity we have to stay in Cookeville again. Highly recommend!!"

2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The property is very quaint. The whole town is very small so you are not very far from anywhere. Plenty of food options to go around. Lots of towels and sheets available and the kitchen was well stocked. My only caveat is that some areas of the property were not cleaned well. The air vents all had a bit of dust on and around them as well as the windows and ceiling fans. Other than that the property is just as described. Would def. stay here again!

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place is spacious, yet cozy, and has everything you need. It has a nice sized yard, with fire pit, and the tree line and space between houses gives you a decent amount of privacy. We stayed a month. Check-in was a breeze, and Stacey and Mallie were always welcoming, responsive, and helpful. Just outside of Cookeville proper, which has plenty of good grocery, food/drink options, and near I-40, we were able to enjoy the Great Smoky Mountains and Mammoth Cave National Parks, Nashville, Knoxville, and numerous state parks. Stacey and Mallie's place was a comfortable and private base of operations for all we wanted to do in Tennessee. Thanks again, Stacey and Mallie."

The hosts were fantastic at communicating back and forth with both ideas of things to do in the area, as well as resolving an electrical issue that came up during our stay. I messaged them and within 2 hours someone had fixed the issue; well done! This is the perfect location right in the middle of everything if you don't mind a little driving. The Cookeville area itself is also fantastic and I felt right at home. If we travel to Tennessee again, we will definitely be checking if this is available again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Here are a few reasons beyond 'convenient, clean, and comfortable' why you won't regret staying at the 1950s Charmer.
We used it as base camp for visiting the many state parks and waterfall hikes in the region and it worked perfectly. It is centrally located between Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga.
The kitchen was well equipped for eating at home and cooking your own meals, and it is convenient to Cookeville for shopping/dining. The living area is large and comfortable for relaxing after a full day of activity.
This home is well suited for couples or families with small children (imo - there were toys and spaces for children to play).
The hosts were friendly, helpful and responded promptly to any inquiry we had.
No regrets whatsoever about spending a week here."

Toys, swing in backyard and even a pack n play. I had a small mistake in booking and they were still so kind even though I had a huge mistake on my part. We will be back as we love boating and loved Center Hill Lake. Also I will add that it’s in a very good area and everything looked well kept!! Thanks for the stay."

,,,"Upon entering the premises, my wife and I noticed a musty odor throughout the place. We opened up some windows to try and air the place out, but the smell really didn't go away. I noticed there was a significant buildup of dust on the sills behind the blinds. The HVAC filter was visible and was full of dirt and dust. The stove and oven was dirty. The heating elements on the stove were caked with carbon deposits on the surface and underneath with some rust spots. There was cooked food debris sticking on the underside of the oven door and the inside bottom of the oven was pretty raunchy. There was no way we were going to use it to cook and just ate some snacks we brought with us. Another matter of concern, the kitchen window and door (on the carport side), the window portion on the front door and the glass doors going out to the deck did not have blinds, drapes, or any type of window coverings. Anyone coming on the property at night could have peered into the house. We kept the lighting low for this reason. There was no soap in the shower. Just a bottle of head-n-shoulders shampoo and some hand soap on the sink. The coffee pot was not washed and was stained on the bottom and there was no creamer. This place is in serious need of a deep cleaning. I took pictures of these problems. We wanted to get out of there as soon as possible and left before 7:00 a.m. the following morning. I wished we would have stayed at a hotel instead.
F.S."
