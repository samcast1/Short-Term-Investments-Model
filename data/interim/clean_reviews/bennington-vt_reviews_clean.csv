2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’m not sure where to begin with this home. The listing was everything it said and more. Kim is an incredible host and super responsive. The views from the porch are exactly as portrayed and I will absolutely be back again! Thank you so much Kim for an amazing stay!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another fabulous stay here. It was our second time staying here. Kim is a gracious host. The house is so clean and peaceful. My favorite part is sitting on the back porch just taking in the view. Can’t wait to go back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the nicest Airbnb’s I have ever stayed at. Surroundings and views are absolutely gorgeous, the home is meticulously designed with stunning artwork and furnishings.
I will definitely return as it is also in very close proximity to the piano camp I attend in Bennington! Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the third time I’ve stayed at the sugar house. It was just as charming as always. The views in spring are lush and green. We watched sunsets and deer in the field from the porch. Peaceful and calm!!!! We stayed longer this time and were able to go to our usual favorites in Bennington as well as some towns nearby like Manchester and Wilmington. Great stay, and looking forward to the next one."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at this cozy Vermont retreat! The house was perfectly comfortable for us and our three year old, providing a great spot to enjoy the surrounding nature. Kim was an incredibly thoughtful host and very responsive! Our son loved playing in the spacious yard, and we all enjoyed the stunning views. Highly recommend this place for a peaceful and relaxing getaway! We made some great memories of our lifetime."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is a perfect combination of great views, privacy, and comfort. The place is extremely clean and modern. All the windows in the house provide unforgettable views of open field, pond, and mountains. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Kim’s place and looking forward to come back to it when time allows."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have seen the Sugar shack many times before driving through while visiting Bennington, VT. We always wondered about it and its great location and view. When we saw it available on Airbnb the days we were heading up to VT, we had to book it and It didn’t disappoint. From the thoughtful touches to the well appointed living spaces we had a great 2 nights there and will definitely be back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful weekend at the Cozy Cottage. It exceeded our expectations. We arrived after dark. Lights had been left on for us and a fire was going in the gas fireplace to greet us. Every room was well appointed from the kitchen with breakfast items available to the living spaces, bedrooms and baths. We wanted for nothing. In addition, the cottage was spotless. Kim was quick to respond to emails and seemed glad to help. Her husband was gracious to keep the outside steps, sidewalk and driveway clear of snow. He even cleared the snow from our car both days. This was way beyond the call of duty and so appreciated.
The scenery is breathtaking! We even enjoyed some wildlife by the pond.
We had the good fortune to bump into Kim while visiting Bennington and she is absolutely charming. Even though Kim has several Airbnb homes in Bennington it would be difficult to pass up another stay at the Cozy Cottage. We will definitely be back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My week at the sugar house was fantastic. The house was beautifully and tastefully decorated, with warming touches throughout. Kim was a fabulous host, leaving breakfast items in the fridge and also a little special treat. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Kim!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kim’s Sugar House home is absolutely adorable! Tastefully designed and impeccably clean. Kim is very responsive and friendly. Looking forward to returning for another visit. Highly recommend.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay here; the views of the mountains are spectacular and it was one of the cleanest airbnbs we’ve ever stayed at. Kim was a fantastic host and really went above and beyond to make us feel at home, even making sure the fridge was stocked with breakfast items. Everything was really well thought out, from labeled switches to restaurant recommendations to decor. The layout is perfect I think either for a couple or for a family of 4(ish). There are some other houses nearby but the orientation of the house makes it feel rather private (while also emphasizing the views). We’d definitely stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house went beyond what we expected. It mixes comfort and style perfectly, making it an ideal getaway. The inside is beautifully decorated, with careful attention to detail, making every room feel special. The house was very clean, in great shape, and had all the modern comforts we needed for an easy stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family loved staying at the Sugar House in Bennington. In addition to the charming and very comfortable house, Kim was a responsive and friendly host. The house, besides being just as described, suited our needs perfectly. We were there to enjoy a few days of skiing, and the house was the ideal launch pad for getting to Bromley and other great Vermont towns. At the end of each day, we found it the perfect place to come back to when we needed to wind down and chill. We will be back! Highly recommended."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend at this beautiful home. It is sparkling clean, and filled with interesting art and cozy touches. We enjoyed the nearby hiking trails, and the proximity to downtown Bennington. Would definitely recommend!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an awesome time at Kim’s place. The surrounding mountains are breathtaking from the windows/backyard.

We would love to come back again another time!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding place for our honeymoon as we traveled all around Vermont hitting up our favorite spots. It was a great place to call home for 5 days.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place for my wife and I to relax and grab neutral. The kitchen was pefectly equipped. The view was great. Close to town yet quiet.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed here before and would stay here again. This lovely cottage is perfect for our family of 4- immaculate and well stocked with everything we needed. The views are beautiful, location is quiet, and there is a great hiking trail at the end of the block. Easy access to Bennington and Manchester as well."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location is so beautiful and so pristine. We went away for my wife’s birthday, and she couldn’t have been happier with the place! The interior decor is perfect, the bed was so comfortable,and everything was clean and taken care of for us. This place gets my highest recommendation! Kim was a phenomenal host, and she even had some food options waiting for us in the fridge. Definitely a super host and a super location to stay!! Thank you, Kim!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing time staying here this weekend. Kim was an amazing and attentive host. This place truly is special from the views to the historic green down the road. The area is rich with history. The home is well appointed and very clean. The property is perfect with views that will make you sit in the rocking chair with your favorite beverage and just simply relax! We certainly hope to be back to stay again very soon.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This adorable sugar house has been transformed into the coziest getaway! The interior is beautifully decorated, modern and exceptionally appointed and comfortable. The views from inside the home and the back deck rocking chairs cannot be beat. It is surrounded by mountains and the foliage for us was a wow! It is, without a doubt, a destination we will return to over and over! Thank you Kim for sharing your lovely home with us."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is beautiful, spacious, neat and clean. Gorgeous views and comfortable spaces to enjoy them indoors and out. Easy to find, close to town.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was incredibly clean and fresh. The views from the porch deck are beautiful. Bathroom was large and very nice.Hosts are great to work with and provided everything we need. Very inviting. We will definitely be back. Try Guiseppe’s in Hoosick Falls.
Thank You"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s home was beyond what we could’ve imagined. It was a true Vermont oasis - gorgeous, comfortable interior, lots of light, lots of outdoor space, and unbelievable views. Don’t hesitate to book here! We can’t wait to come back."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a lovely cottage with gorgeous views from the porch! Loved gazing at the changing leaves while having our coffee in the morning. Would love to come back in the winter and snowshoe from the front door.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! Everything was very comfortable and as described. Will definitely go back. Relaxing and quiet with a great view.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was easily one of the best-if not the best-we have ever stayed at. The house is located in a beautiful setting close to the downtown area of Bennington in a quiet neighborhood. The house itself was awesome and well appointed. What stood out the most was Kim's responsiveness when our house, as well as a large portion of the town, lost power due to a storm. We were without power and water for almost 24 hours during which Kim was in touch with us regularly to discuss options that included putting us up in a nearby hotel at her expense. We didn't want that to happen and fortunately power was restored in time. This all occurred during our last day there (we stayed a total of 5 days). Just can't say enough about how well we were treated. The surrounding area is awesome and we used this place as our home base while we motorcycled throughout VT, NY and MA. We highly recommend this place and thank Kim so much for her hospitality and her attention to detail. Outstanding experience."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a stunning Airbnb! We couldn't have enjoyed the setting any more, and the interior of the Airbnb was beautiful and extremely clean. The Airbnb felt very private yet was such a short drive into downtown Bennington, as well as Old Bennington. We had the chance to meet Kim during our stay and she was incredibly friendly and welcoming; it really made the trip extra special to put a face to the host. We loved sitting out on the deck, and the layout of the home was perfect. It was such a special trip, and the Airbnb was a big part of that!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very relaxing stay in this beautiful home. We had everything we needed to be comfortable. The views from the deck were incredible. This was the perfect spot for us to explore Bennington and nearby areas. Kim was incredibly kind, generous, and thoughtful and we felt very well cared for. We hope to be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely speechless. Kims place is flawless, perfection. We could not believe how beautiful her home was, the immaculate property, and all of the little details. Kim was so sweet and left us a few goodies for our special wedding day… we could not have felt more at home. We will be returning! 🤍"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim's place is beautiful and very comfortable. Amazing views of the mountains. We enjoyed our stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Kim’s place for 3 nights and loved it! The house was amazing and the views were beautiful. Check in was easy, house was perfectly clean and we had everything we needed. Would definitely stay there again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Kim’s home. Stunning views and beautiful interior. Would highly recommend staying at this home.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay at Kim’s place. The views and the yard are even better than the pictures show. Amazing views of the surrounding mountains, the meadow, and the Bennington Monument. My two year old played in the yard for hours every day and we enjoyed many of the local breweries and restaurants. The house itself was perfectly clean and had a great layout for our family. We hope to come back some time soon. Thank you, Kim!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible! I’ve stayed in a lot of airbnbs and this was up their in my top experiences. The location is stunning. It’s super private while also still being in a neighborhood. Kim and Donnie live just down the lane and we’re helpful and kind when I needed it, but also happy to be hands off if needed. The space itself is so well designed and comfortable. It has everything you need to cook. I would move in here that’s how much I liked this house. The back porch is a dream. Close enough to everything without being directly downtown. Amazing views. Even better than the pictures. I loved staying here and look forward to visiting again and staying longer."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at Kim's place for about a week and thought that her house was one of the best places we have ever stayed in Vermont. The views of the surrounding mountains were beautiful. The house was exceptionally well designed and tastefully decorated. Kim was also a great support providing two bikes for us to ride. What we liked the most was the back porch where we could sit out and enjoy the views. All in all, a great Airbnb stay and highly recommended for anyone visiting Vermont. I would imagine that in the Fall the views will be speactacular. We hope to come again! Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We spent 4 weeks in this absolutely beautiful house surrounded by incredible, unobstructed views of the mountains. The house is small but so well-designed that it felt large. Our hosts were kind and attentive while respecting our privacy. Clean air, hiking trails, and a quick walk to the Bennington Monument or into town. Overall, a fantastic vacation home! We hope to return in the winter for skiing. Thank you Kim and Donnie!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the sugar house. Beautiful home, comfortable stay, and wonderful bathroom/shower. We felt right at home. We will definitely be back! Such a lovely location and a beautiful updated home."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved Kim’s home. We brought our 3 year old and 1 year old and felt like the place was equally equipped for our toddlers as it would be a peaceful getaway for 2. The home is as charming as it is in the photos and the surrounding property is breathtaking. I can’t underscore enough how much we enjoyed our stay at this home.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great experience. Kim was a great host who truly goes the extra mile for her guests and it shows! The place was squeaky clean and had all the right touches to make you feel like your at home and comfortable. And the views surrounding the property are nothing short of spectacular!!! Thank you Kim for an amazing experience.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the an incredible stay at Kim's place with most amazing views with a host that went above and beyond to insure our comfort. This included breakfast food in the refrigerator, a fully equipped kitchen, suggestions for hiking and for restaurants. From the moment we arrived we were captivated by the the view of the surrounding mountains. The property itself was immaculate, very tastefully decorated and very comfortable. Kim was a great host from the moment we arrived to when we departed. She was incredibly attentive ensuring we had everything we needed. It was truly a one-of-a-kind experience."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place was fantastic. Very well appointed, easy check-in, spotless and very convenient. The whole experience was top notch!

The check in and out process was so easy. Kim left suggestions for restaurants and local activities. We can’t wait to come back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sugar House was the perfect location for our visit to Bennington. The view of the Bennington Monument and the mountains is breathtaking. You can easily walk to hiking trails and can be in town in 5 minutes or on the Bennington College campus in 10 minutes. The home is tastefully decorated with all of the comforts of home in a relaxing setting. We were lucky to have warm, spring weather so we enjoyed sitting on the deck and relaxing. Kim is a wonderful host. We will definatley visit again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful little house with exceptional mountain views. We were very cozy and happy with our stay. Will will be back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot in Bennington. The views and surrounding area are stunning, Kim’s place was equally as pleasing. The beds were the most comfortable we have had at an airbnb, really nice linens and plenty of extra blankets. Perfectly decorated and she was kind enough to provide us with eggs, butter and English muffins. I highly recommend staying here, when we are back at Bennington this will be our first choice!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful home. The back porch looks out unto a great field and mountains. With the sunset at this time of year they turned pink!! Everything was clean and comfortable. The kitchen had all modern appliances. Bright living room and dining room with large windows and fantastic views. Will definitely return! Thanks Kim!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and modern home with incredible views of the mountains! Traveled during a snow storm and when we returned to the home, the driveway and walkways had been plowed and shoveled. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I’ve stayed here! It’s a beautiful space and the views are amazing. All of the recommendations for food, walking trails, and sights to see are spot on. My family truly enjoyed the time we spent here."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved this house! Early check in was awesome. Had a great short vacation here for winter break with our son. He loved the geese outside. Then the snow of course. Loved the town of Bennington. House was just perfect. Also loved the breakfast provided and my son loved some cocoa after playing in the snow.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this spot, Kim went above and beyond and her place is beautiful. Her taste is wonderful and the quality of linens and bedding are outstanding."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a weekend disconnect retreat. Amazing views out the numerous windows kept us gazing out at the wonderful Green Mountains!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim was a wonderful host and her house was so cute! Beautiful scenery from the back of the house, was like a winter wonderland!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Loved the setting. Had a wonderfully relaxing time!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at The Sugarhouse! We felt very safe and relaxed in this quiet neighborhood. It is only a 5-10 min drive to restaurants and stores. Pictures in listing are accurate. Lots of seating areas inside and great views off the back deck. I imagine it is gorgeous in the fall! Bedrooms are downstairs, bathroom is upstairs....just something to be aware of for those that get up to use the facilities during the night. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim was very accommodating and friendly. The house was spotless, and there were more than enough amenities. Plenty of spices to cook as well."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"FFABULOUS home! Cozy, clean and comfortable. Kim was super responsive and had some yummy treats as well as items in refrigerator for us! We spent Christmas here and the well appointed kitchen, comfortable rooms and cozy fireplaces made it just perfect. Gorgeous views, peaceful setting yet so close to everything!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim's place was a cozy and charming getaway. It was picture perfect in the snow and had quaint features including two fireplaces on the main floor. The mountain views were beautiful. Kim was incredibly helpful and responsive. Would highly recommend staying here for a retreat in Bennington.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim - Thanks so much! The fact that we even gave hotels/motels a thought is embarrassing knowing this beautiful retreat was available. We didn't spend much time indoors, but when we got back after our daily expeditions the Sugar Shack was extremely comfortable. Check-in couldn't have been easier, the entire home was spotless, all furnishings and amenities were ""up to date"" and very comfortable (I have a tough back to keep comfortable and I was able to stand straight as soon as my feet hit the floor!) and you are very generous with the availability of various kitchen condiments... it was nice to not have to buy every little thing for sandwiches and such.
As for the area, plenty to do with easy access to everything we wanted. We met lots of nice, helpful folks in the area.
We are sure to return to the Sugar Shack - next time with wives. Thanks again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent a wonderful Thanksgiving weekend in this adorable cottage! It is somehow even better than the photos, even the photos are accurate. The sun streams in all the windows, and yet it is very cozy with the convenient gas fireplaces. Kim left us breakfast foods and a nice bottle of wine, which was lovely. The kitchen was extremely well-stocked with everything you might need, plus there was plenty of tea and K-cups. Comfortable beds, nice linens ... a perfect getaway!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view of the mountains is stunning and the home is so cozy. Everything about our stay here was peaceful. Kim is a thoughtful host and was flexible about our check in and check out times, which was so helpful visiting out of state. There is so much to do in town, but our favorite times were spent at the property taking in the surroundings and enjoying the sunsets through all the gorgeous windows or stargazing at night. It is truly a beautiful place to be. Thank you!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sugar House does not disappoint. A beautiful home on a quiet tranquil setting. We enjoyed the back porch during unseasonably warm weather. The forecasted rain and wind gave gorgeous and interesting skies. The porch provided just enough cover to enjoy the light warm rain and breeze. The house is tastefully decorated and well stocked with all you need. The area is host to some great restaurants, The Publyk House, and Village Garage & Brewery were our favorites. We enjoyed shopping at and eating sweet treats and fresh baked bread from the Market Wagon and Apple Barn. The town of Bennington is fun to walk around and explore. Mostly we loved being at the Sugar House watching the deer in the field and hiking around. Kim is a welcoming host who has designed a beautiful vacation home."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot! Beautiful views from the living room and dining room. Kim has put together a lovely cottage. All details were thoughtfully handled from kitchen supplies to an abundance of towels. One note: the 2 bedrooms are a level below the living room & dining room (and bathroom).
Kim was a wonderful host and immediately responsive when I had a quick question."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’re so thankful for such a beautiful place to rest on our anniversary trip! We had never really been to the town before and are so glad to have had such a peaceful and restful retreat. The location is just close enough to town for conveniences sake, but far enough away that we found the quiet space we were hoping for. The house was so clean and comfortable, it was just perfect really. Kim was so kind and welcoming, and made it all so nice that we really didn’t need anything else at all while we were there. We spent the majority of our time on the back porch, as it was unseasonably warm and therefore perfect for reading, relaxing, and stargazing once it got dark enough. We’re looking forward to staying there again for sure!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful stay!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is gorgeous, the property and surrounding view is gorgeous, and the very gracious host is excellent! Highly recommend to others, and have already discussed returning in the future. Thank you!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very relaxing stay at Kim's place. The view across the meadow is pure bucolic Vermont, with Bennington's monument in the background. A nice walking trail leaves right from your door. You're just off the main road but it's peaceful. We enjoyed the gas see-through fireplaces, and borrowed light from the transom windows floods the place with sunshine. Kim is a thoughtful decorator--hope everyone takes time to appreciate her thoughtful touches."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, best Airbnb we ever stayed at!! The view from the home was amazing and the host went out of her way to make this place comfortable, clean, homey, and safe!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Relaxation at its best! This cottage looks exactly like the photos - very comfortable and homey. Kim is a super thoughtful and responsive host. We had everything we could ever need for our time away in this beautiful area of Vermont. The location is ideal for exploring the Bennington area. After a day of sightseeing, hiking and shopping, it was wonderful to come back to this lovely cottage for a glass of wine on the deck and dinner by the fireplace. Looking forward to returning!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute gem. Pictures don’t do justice to the view, and walkable proximity to hiking trails was a plus. The process was smooth and Kim was available for questions."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing! Everything was beyond what was pictured and expected. The views in the morning with coffee was the perfect trip. The level of care and curtesy provided was on another level including the touches of advice of areas to take in, the most comfortable bed and a game to enjoy out on the porch before dusk. I look forward to returning!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here. Waking up every morning to the gorgeous views from the porch was dreamy. It was the perfect place to stay for our family trip to Bennington. We spent hours on the porch enjoying the Vermont weather and the views. The house is well appointed and very clean. Kim was communicative before our arrival and responded very quickly to any questions we had. We would definitely recommend this home to any friend visiting the area.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You can publish the note I just gave you for Kim.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A gorgeous and clean home with stunning views of the mountains. Kim was super responsive and accommodating — and the house has everything you need and more. The fireplaces made for a cozy stay and the rocking chairs made outdoor time and taking in the view so relaxing. A great spot!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Kim’s place was a memorable time for our family. Our crew especially appreciated the beautiful design of the space—the windows, transoms, art, expansive deck overlooking the meadow and mountains, tasteful, modern furnishings and accents—all made a warm, sunny, relaxing space for us to unwind after long days of touring the area. Everything was exceptionally clean and comfortable. It was one of the best AirBnB stays we have enjoyed. Thank you, Kim, for a wonderful time in a town we love!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim’s house is amazing and so peaceful!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and view. Kim is very accommodating. I highly recommend a stay here!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim is a fantastic host, and the property is something special. Great place to check out the stars from the deck at night, and appreciate the fields and views during the day. The house was clean and well maintained, and had everything we needed. And the location was perfect - close to town but offering the privacy of something normally more removed. Highly recommended."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend booking Kim’s home. It’s located in a quiet neighborhood only a few minutes outside of downtown Bennington and on a large property that feels like your own. The house was clean and well maintained and easy to check into when we arrived. We especially loved the large outdoor porch looking out towards the pond, weeping willows, and meadow. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,It’s hard to imagine a better property in Bennington. The location is excellent - close to town - yet it’s very private. Views are amazing.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kim's place is absolutely stunning. Meticulously clean and perfectly set up to maximize the view of Green Mountain. Our family had a wonderful time just hanging out on the wonderful deck and taking in that view. Kim's placement of the deck gives you full privacy and an unobstructed view of the fields and the mountains. Every room in the house is cute and perfectly designed. The kids absolutely enjoyed bath time in the wonderful tub overlooking the gas fireplace. Definitely returning again for that view one day.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rest, rejuvenation and the peacefulness of nature, all within 10 minutes of town.
I've stayed at many rental properties, and every now and again a magical combination of location, host thoughtfulness and stunning surroundings create something wonderfully memorable. This was such a property. Kim was an excellent host, and provided many thoughtful touches. The house decor was lovely. The surrounding property provided the solace of nature--a large field with dancing butterflies, bluebirds, finches and more, as well as beautiful sunsets and weeping willows. Thank you for an amazing stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous inside and outside! Kim is amazing and puts so much thought and love into the property and all the accommodations! So blessed to stay there!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully appointed house with amazing views. Spied a red fox, dozens of blue birds, deer, and many song birds as we relaxed on the deck and in the shade of massive Weeping Willows. A very comfortable vibe with a host that has truly thought of everything to make our stay enjoyable."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This Airbnb home is in the perfect spot. Quiet neighborhood and the views in the backyard are absolutely breathtaking.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Every space in this home is exactly as described in the listing, but the back porch is the true gem. We were lucky enough to experience a summer thunderstorm our first day and it was majestic watching it roll through the valley. The rest of our stay was perfection, topped off with Kim's gift of breakfast waiting for us. Can't say enough good things. Loved every minute of our trip"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully decorated and clean place! The decks and views are great! It's easy to spend time just at the house.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay in Bennington! It was exactly as it looked online, and we had everything we could have needed. We enjoyed gorgeous sunsets, chirping frogs, frolicking rabbits, and the lovely mountain vistas."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house, with everything you could possibly need. Kim is a very attentive host and we enjoyed the house and walks directly off the property. Can't wait to visit again soon."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is a dream! We came into town for the Solid Sound festival- our 6th time and by far, nicest accommodations! We actually ended up spending more time at the house than at the festival because we loved it so much! The Owners taste and attention to detail is evident in every square inch of this home. Everything is absolutely perfect, and the scenery of the mountains and the field is relaxing. We sat on the porch in the morning and in the evening drinking coffee and reading, and enjoying the sounds of nature! Kim spares no expense in her choice of glassware, towels, soap etc. and for a family that travels a lot and uses Airbnb, it was much appreciated! Also the restaurant recommendations, breakfast fixings and snacks were appreciated! THANK YOU!!!!!"

Kim generously made sure that our arrival on my birthday had a bit of extra fanfare and it capped off the night splendidly. She also had her husband come to our aid to show us where the BAT trail started when we lost our way. If you want a relaxing and restorative weekend in blissful surroundings curated by a wonderful couple, look no further. Thank you, Kim & Donny!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an exceptional stay at Kim's place. Everything is provided - EVERYTHING!
Surely home away from home!
Amazing spot with open space in a neighborhood yet you feel private and secluded. Easy to find.
House is as pictured, and clean! Only thing to note - it's not the most sound proof home - room to room, and steps upstairs can be heard downstairs.
We will definitely want to come back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was superb. From the abundant natural light and artist’s own paintings to the great views, cozy fireplaces, and ample bathroom, kitchen, with awesome dishwasher, we had a very relaxing stay."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was the prettiest house I've stayed at thus far. Love the porch and rockers in the back and the pond. Kim was very a responsive host. The property is beautiful and the local stores, restaurants are close to house. Kim suggested some hiking trails but unfortunately we had some rain. Hope to do that next time as we are definitely hoping to return soon. This is a must if you are visiting the town of Bennington, VT."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a long weekend getaway to celebrate our 27th anniversary. Kim has such a beautiful place! Clean, spacious and welcoming. There are beautiful views from every window. A little pond and a huge back porch to enjoy the beautiful Vermont mountains. There is hiking trails mere steps from the front door. A quiet countryside feel. The kitchen is well stocked and very clean. Bathroom is very modern, clean, spacious and has a fireplace! In fact there are two fireplaces to enjoy on a chilly New England night in October. The basement bedrooms are comfy cozy and also very spacious! I can’t say how beautiful this place is just outside Bennington. It’s well worth the drive to Vermont just to enjoy Kim’s beautiful rental home."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our family had a wonderful stay at this unique and charming AirBnB
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and modern tiny house featuring a comfy king bed and gorgeous views.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim's sugar house in Bennington is almost beyond description. Rarely do I find that the real deal is as good as the photos when it comes to Air BNBs, but this house is actually more quaint, more cozy, more beautiful in person. My husband and I came for an anniversary weekend from Maine. Getting to the house was straightforward and the pin-number entry to the home made getting inside painless and without the need to bother the host.
Inside the house is decorated in a contemporary but cozy way, favoring neutrals and a clean palette. The kitchen has every cooking appliance and condiment you would need plus Kim stocks the fridge with some breakfast basics, like bagels, juice, eggs, and butter! The closets and cabinets are stocked with cleaning essentials and extra linens, as well.
We took nice walks on the BAT system, loving the one that ended at the Everett Mansion (former Southern VT college). We saw Robert Frost's headstone, festooned with poetry of his. We grocery shopped at Hannaford and a couple of markets to make our dinners. We did a very short drive (30 min) to the Mass MoCA, which was incredible.
All of our activities were in competition with what we were really drawn to which was sitting on the cozy couch, in front of a soothing fire, admiring the bucolic view of the Green Mountains out the back windows.
We can't recommend the place enough! While we did not need any support from Kim, I am certain she would have rushed forth with solutions should we have had problems!
Stay here!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, modern house with an unbeatable view and easy access to the town of Bennington for restaurants."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful house on the perfect piece of land! Kim (the host) was on top of everything and quickly checked in to show us how to use the heat. She also supplied breakfast which was a nice treat! The place was spotless and so very comfortable with views out every window. I will look no further whenever I head to Bennington VT!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a stunning location looking over a large grassy field across to the Green Mountains. The interior is equally amazing; great design elements and lots of windows. Two big rooms, kitchen (well-supplied with the basic pots/pans etc. for most cooking), and bath upstairs, and two bedrooms downstairs, one master and one with extra room for family etc. As peaceful and tasteful a place as you'll likely find anywhere."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home in a beautiful setting. Very convenient to everything in Bennington. Kim was a gracious and thoughtful host, leaving extra snacks and breakfast items. We would love to return again sometime."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at The Sugar House. The house was clean, spacious, and tastefully decorated in a way that made us instantly feel at home.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our 3-night stay was magical. The Sugar House is both exceptionally comfortable and beautifully appointed, with every detail thought through for guest comfort and enjoyment. The setting is picture perfect, and we loved sitting out on the porch morning, midday and evening. It provided just the tranquil respite we wanted -- a world of its own, yet very close to Old Bennington and downtown Bennington. The Sugar House was a great base for exploring southwestern Vermont and the northwest corner of Massachusetts. The king bed (the only bed we used) was extremely comfortable. Everything was spotless and the kitchen had all the pots, pans, and utensils we needed for our eat-in meals. Kim thoughtfully stocked the fridge with juice, eggs, bagels & butter, with supplies like sugar, spices, oil & vinegar, mustard & ketchup also supplied. Kim is the perfect host -- attentive and completely unobtrusive. This is one of the nicest places I've ever stayed. Brava!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Cozy Modern Sugar House, and hope to return. The rooms are well-appointed and the views spectacular. Communication with Kim was excellent, and the small extras like breakfast were so very welcome. It’s really a wonderful home in a lovely location."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this Air B&B was absolutely incredible! Kim is the most amazing host! The house is beautiful, modern and decorated exceptionally. Everything was so clean and very well maintained. The scenic views are stunning. We spent most the time here on the patio in the rocking chairs taking in all the beauty of Vermont and the 25 acres of land that this home sits on. The pond out back is stunning as well! This is the best Air B&B I’ve ever stayed in. Thank you so much Kim, we will definitely be returning!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great views. great communication. great layout. clean. easy. perfect.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful cottage, view and location. We stayed here for 11 days with our two sons and had a magical time taking in the sunrises and sunsets. Wake up early and enjoy your coffee with the ducks, egrets and geese swimming on the nearby pond or simply taking in the view of Bennington Monument. The downstairs was a great “sleep den” in the summer and had adequate cooling on the hotter days. Hightly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful house overlooking an absolutely gorgeous field. It rained most of our stay, but we loved the house so much we didn't care. Kim was very responsive, and the breakfast food she left was very thoughtful. We would highly recommend staying at Kim's place"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is stunning with the most beautiful views! Highly recommend renting in months where you can sit outside and enjoy the beautiful deck. Easy to find, Kim was the perfect host. Will definitely be back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was fantastic! Each morning, we would sit on the back porch, drinking our coffee and eating breakfast, overlooking the gorgeous landscape. It was beautiful. The house was clean, bright, spacious, and extremely comfortable. Kim left us breakfast foods in the fridge including eggs, juice, and English muffins. I texted Kim asking if she had the lawn game cornhole. She didn't but said she would drop off a few games later in the day. We came back to find a new cornhole waiting for us on the front porch. It was very kind of her to go out of her way to accommodate us. The house is located minutes from everything: great restaurants, hiking trails, museums, and the monument. It was the perfect location for our whole family. Next time we are in town, this is our new go to place."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house, the view, the host are all spectacular! The interior is sophisticated but very comfortable (and super clean!), and the setting is breathtaking. We took a great woods hike that was accessible from the road the house is on, no car needed. Kim is a lovely host and has created a very special place for airbnb guests. Can't wait to return."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It’s hard to put into words how exceptional our experience was at Kim’s place.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, clean home with breathtaking views. Kim was attentive and kind. We had a lovely time!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The moment you drive into the driveway a sense of calm washes over you. It’s peaceful atmosphere is accompanied by the welcoming aesthetics of the home. It’s a very warm cozy environment which allowed us to enjoy our time together with little outside distraction. This is definitely the place to visit if you’re looking for an easy place to unplug from the outside world for a bit. Sitting out on the back porch listening to nature while reading book with my wife was a highlight of the trip. The view with its all around peaceful environment is exactly what we were looking for in this trip. We highly recommend making a reservation.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had the most wonderful stay at the Sugar House! The view was absolutely like no other I have seen in Vermont. Kim was very responsive and so easy to deal with...You will not be disappointed! We will surely be back!
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Kim is a very attentive host who communicates well and is very invested in the satisfaction of her guests. The house is clean and comfortable, well stocked in the kitchen, and has great views, as the pictures indicate. Our only disappointment is that we did not realize that the bedrooms are in the basement. The living areas, which are all upstairs, are spacious and bright however."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!! Kim, the host, is beyond amazing. The setting is spectacular! It was our friends birthday, Kim went above and beyond to make our celebration so special. This is a must stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place is a gem - situated perfectly facing the mountains, with ample space and tasteful decor. We could have spent all weekend just sitting in the rocking chairs, watching the birds. We can’t wait to go back."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our two-night stay was idyllic in every way. We can't give enough stars for Kim or for her accommodations and hospitality.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing AirBnB! Best location I've ever stayed at and would 100% recommend this AirBnb. The views are stunning and the natural surroundings are very tranquil. The main floor of the SugarHouse is even bigger than captured in the pictures and is very stylish and fully functional for enjoying the great views. The bathroom and kitchen are both excellent and modern; the kitchen has all the cookware needed to use, including some basic breakfast foods. The coffee Keurig was much appreciated too. The sunrises are beautiful to watch over the mountains while sitting on the big deck!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great break! Had a relaxing time at this beautiful, well decorated home. Spent restful morning sipping coffee on the back porch and watching birds."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place doesn't disappoint! Very clean, well appointed, nicely decorated, and on a lovely piece of land in a nice neighborhood. We walked to town from the house. Plan on saving time to just hang out at the house and enjoy the setting!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim is everything you need in a host: manages a beautiful property, friendly, considerate, responsive, professional no matter the subject matter."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great view out the front of the house.... Warm welcome and good communication.... Very nice bathroom and furnishings..... comfy bed on lower level ...
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, we had the best time at Kim's place! Right from the beginning, Kim went above and beyond to help us feel at home. She even left me a birthday card with chocolate and a bottle of wine when we arrived, and mailed my partner's jacket back home to us when it was mistakenly left behind! Truly the kindest host. And the place is absolutely stunning. Kim's home truly feels like a dream home--everything was perfect, from the well-stocked kitchen, comfortable living room, stunning porch, and beautiful bedroom. And the balcony was stunning--we had the best time having our meals outside with the view. The place leads right on to a lovely walking path, and it is very close to the charming center of Bennington. There are lots of great hikes and drives around. We had the best time and hope to be back. Thank you, Kim!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was the bee’s knees. The comfortable interior, the back porch, the vast grounds, the babbling brook…these were all positively enchanting. But what really made my stay exceptional was not merely the beauty of the place, but the hospitality and kindness of Kim and her husband. They went above and beyond, making it a truly special stay. Even if they had simply been their friendly selves, while giving me space to just be on my own with privacy (as they did), it would have been wonderful. An exhausted caregiver, I arrived badly in need of a break, and the gorgeous peace and quiet was just what was needed. But their kindness took everything to a whole ‘nother level. I actually left feeling renewed. I give Kim and her husband and this place my highest recommendation. They hit it out of the ballpark."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I never expected to see a B and B as beautiful as 1865 Farmhouse..everything was perfect! I love to decorate but Kim went far and above in combining modern and old style.. this ought to be in house beautiful! So clean and comfy..
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s airbnb - I cannot say enough positive things. The home is beautiful, spotless clean, user-friendly and has every amenity you can think of! The view is even better, you will find yourself always looking outside or taking a walk in the beautiful fields in the yard 😋 and if there is anything you need, Kim is incredibly responsive and kind. 🥰 My significant other & I had such a great time, we extended our stay an extra 2 nights! All in all - 10/10 recommend! We will be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a great time at the property - it was clean and super quiet! The hosts were very helpful and nice as well. Already planning my next stay!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time at one of Kim's properties. We enjoyed our stay at the Blue House. Very cozy and comfortable with unique decor and furniture. We appreciated the breakfast items provided. Easy check in and check out. We hope to return in warmer weather to enjoy the views from the front porch.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place was such a great find! The Blue House was everything we could have imagined and more. It was cozy, private, beautifully decorated, and in a great location to local restaurants and sites. Kim carefully curated this property and did not miss any details. I would highly recommend this location for a quick getaway or long stay any time of year. Well done! We will be surely be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Five star all around !! Wonderful location, private and so comfortable. Tastefully decorated and the perfect setting for a special getaway or any getaway for that matter !!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far this Airbnb has been one of the best experiences for us as a couple. The host of this property really took the time to think about all the essentials needed to make you feel right at home. The environment was clean, comfortable and welcoming. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,The best Airbnb experience we have ever had. We will certainly be back. Kim and Don are wonderful and the property is fantastic. Highly recommended.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at your beautiful farm house. The homes décor, warmth and charm made for a comfortable visit. The home amenities were plentiful and the bedding and bath comfortable and well appointed. We got to enjoy visits from our adult children and grandchildren and it was home away from home. We also enjoyed a wonderful dinner at The 4 Chimney's Inn & Restaurant that is within walking distance, weather permitting. We will definitely be making future reservations at the farm house."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"While the photos did accu literallyrately represent the little ""Blue House,"" it was actually much better than that. This has to be the most beautifully designed and executed Airbnb I've ever stayed in. This was a high-quality experience - on a gorgeous property, close to town and surrounding attractions, access to hiking literally out the front door and, of course, the stunningly well done ""Blue House."" Peaceful and quiet, Kim's place comes highly recommended."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place is AMAZING! The house itself is immaculate, cozy, spacious, and well stocked. And the location is gorgeous- the babbling brook right outside, gorgeous landscape, and close to town! We had the best time at Kim’s and couldn’t recommend it more. :)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All Airbnbs should be this good! Immaculately clean, impeccably decorated. Beautiful views from every window. Gorgeous Vermont walking & hiking at your doorstep. Once you have groceries, you can commune with nature and need never leave this beautiful house (and when you've had your fill of nature, there's a great tv with netflix) Wonderful job Kim!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Kim's beautiful Bennington home was an experience we will cherish forever. Not only was the house impeccably designed and maintained, but its proximity to the hiking trail made our adventures even more convenient. What truly set our stay apart was Kim's thoughtfulness. She went above and beyond to assist me in surprising my husband for his birthday. If you're looking for a host who truly cares about your experience, Kim is the one. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay at Kim’s place was absolutely amazing! The beautifully restored old farmhouse was tastefully decorated with a blend of both the old and the modern. They amply supplied all the essentials and a lot more. The views around the farm were spectacular, and the grounds were kept neat as a golf course. Kim and her husband were very responsive and provided great local suggestions for places to see and eat. You can’t go wrong staying here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Artfully decorated interior, beautiful surroundings, friendly host, fully equipped, near historical Bennington, peaceful and quiet. A perfect 5."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place is a perfectly restored farmhouse decorated superbly. The restoration is recent and all appliances, bathrooms, kitchen and amenities are literally brand new. Did I mention it is superbly decorated :) Literally everything you need in the kitchen is provided. The view towards the mountains is sublime, and best done with your favorite cocktails while seated in the provided Adirondack chairs - so peaceful. We found the hikes accessible off of Kim’s property to be really nice - make sure you get to the Halloween Tree and the Cave is cool, too. Kim is a Bennington native, and provided us with really useful information of the area. We fly our own airplane and found the folks at Bennington’s William Morse airport really accommodating for the three nights we were hangared there. Access to Kim’s place was really easy from the airport. Don’t miss this one! Probably the best overall AirBnB experience we’ve had."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay. Kim & Donny's place is cozy, well appointed and clean. Our mornings were spent on the lovely porch and evenings walking on the beautiful property and neighbourhood. It's close to downtown Bennington yet still private. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Perfect location. It was peaceful and scenic, yet just minutes from the restaurants and shopping. Kim is a great host and made us feel at home. Thanks for the wonderful experience."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, location, town, and host. Highly recommend Kim, her home, and Bennington!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was such a beautiful, peaceful getaway. Great for a weekend or a longer stay for couples and family! We felt right at home and all the thoughtful touches and tasteful design aesthetic throughout added to the convenience and comfort. The place was incredibly clean, wifi TV all worked seamlessly and beds were comfortable. After only one night we felt immensely relaxed and restored. We’ve already booked a return visit and Kim is a superstar host!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kim’s place! She outdid herself as a host and her home exceeded our every expectation! We sipped coffee at the brook just feet away from our front porch and went on energizing hikes in the woods near the home. A few things about the home stood out:
1) the house was beautifully designed, with gorgeous, comfy furniture, rugs and art pieces. You can tell Kim has a background in interior design… we enjoyed every room!
2) the house was impeccably clean and well-stocked with abundant towels, paper goods, fragrant soaps and blankets etc.
3) Kim is a super responsive host! She gave us complete privacy. When we had trouble using the bath tub, she responded within minutes and then went out to Home Depot to buy another piece! She truly is a super host!
Overall, we would only stay at Kim’s place the next time we come to Vermont! It was a truly pleasurable experience!!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are seasoned Airbnbers, so we cant say enough about Kim's place. We were their second guests to have stay this past weekend, but she is a pro at this so everything was amazing to the farmhouse decor, cozy furniture, comfortable beds with beautiful linens...down to the nice touches of leaving us eggs, English muffins, OJ and butter in the fridge upon our arrival. Check in was a breeze and Kim was outside the cottage when we arrived so it was so nice to meet and chat with her. She is very friendly and always available if needed, the perfect host. The cottage is located right behind their house but feels private. We loved the back porch with the lounge chairs...great views and so peaceful . If you want to go out you are literally 5 minutes from downtown Bennington with lots of restaurants, which Kim left a list of her recommendations, and shopping. You need to book this Airbnb, you wont be disappointed. We are already going back in late October, because we truly enjoy our stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place! The house is everything and much much more: a clean and efficient kitchen, comfy beds, luxurious shower, a cool and relaxing farm setting, and so much to do all around. This historic house has been beautifully updated with thoughtful improvements while preserving the charming architectural elements: solid wooden beams, an exposed brick chimney, bright windows, refinished wood floors, and delightful rounded doors.
The house has everything you need for a weekend or an extended stay, and would be great for a couple (or two) or a family with kids. The kitchen is brand new and everything is clean and high-quality. The living room set up works for watching TV or conversation, and the back porch is the perfect place for morning coffee, reading, or napping, with stunning views of the surrounding farms and mountains.
Communication was a breeze, and the owners were helpful and friendly while respecting our privacy. We can't wait to go back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I stayed for a quick cross country ski weekend. Clare sent us updates on snow, gave us a great recommendation for dinner and was always available to answer questions. The apartment was so clean, the kitchen was thoughtfully well-stocked, check-in and out directions were clear and concise! 10 minute walk to town! If we go back in March we would love to stay there again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time in Claire’s apartment. Everything was exactly like in the photos. The apartment is spacious and extremely clean. You can tell Claire put a lot of thought into making the apartment very welcoming. The kitchen has everything you need to cook. The apartment is close to downtown and to the ski resorts. Claire is very responsive and easy to communicate with. Will definitely return.

The provide the best stocked kitchen I have ever get had at an AirBnB (and I’ve stayed in my fair share of them)!! In addition to the well equipped kitchen, there were ample towels, lots of local recommendations, and even some snacks! It snowed during our stay and Meike even cleaned off my car for me! Seriously above and beyond and such nice people! Would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone heading to Vermont!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was enjoyable, and we were well taken care of. The scenery is great, and I especially liked the nature trail on the hospital campus."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner Ryan and I very much enjoyed our stay here. We booked a place in Bennington as it was close to Mt Snow. Even though there wasn’t a ton of snow, we enjoyed the local Equinox hikes, got on the slopes even if for a short period, and enjoyed the local restaurants. There were a ton of eating options around. We felt comfortable and right at home here. Claire was helpful and very accommodating, checking in to make sure we had everything we needed. It truly was a lovely place to stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Claire's place has to be one of the top airbnb lodgings I've stayed in. Conveniently located, clean, VERY well appointed with a great kitchen and a cool aesthetic (to me). Good coffee, snacks, filtered water, easy access. I could go on. If/when I return to Bennington, I'll try to stay here for sure."

Kitchen and living space were perfect for our 2 night stay
Slept well and would definitely like to return
Easy walk into town , albeit most things close early it appears on a sunday ..but got laundry done as washer and drier both new so found them very handy too!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m very happy I stayed at Claire’s. I thought about going to a motel but with the location, price, and amenities, it was worth the stay. Claire was so friendly and made sure through out my stay, that I was conformable. She had a wonderful welcome basket and left a present for me at my departure."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Claire was very helpful, responsive, and kind throughout the entire process from booking to checkout. She had plenty of great recommendations for the area as well. The place is clean, comfortable, and so nice. It was also a very short walk to the Main Street area of town with a number of stores and restaurants. I’d highly recommend staying if you’re in the area.
Thanks, Claire!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying with Claire was a wonderful experience and I hope to do it again. When I say this place is clean, I mean squeaky clean! It was like staying in a small cottage. Claire was more than accommodating, she made me feel like I was home away from home. It was the perfect location for me to explore the surrounding areas and a nice little walkable downtown to enjoy my evening meals at. I honestly felt a little sad as I closed the door to head back home. It was a bittersweet ending to a wonderful stay. 11/10 100% recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was a perfect space for my partner and me to stay at during a friend’s wedding in VT. Very cozy, clean kitchen, and queen bed was super comfy. Local town was walkable (10min) where we got lunch at a local Jamaican spot.
Host was very responsive and helpful whenever we needed guidance of the space or suggestions of places to eat nearby. She even let us stay a little longer after check out when my electric car needed some extra charge at her place to get us to the next charging station. Was super gracious and a joy to stay with ! (:"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at Claire’s AirBnb, and I will certainly be back. She is very responsive, the space is so comfortable and kitchen has everything you could need to make a delicious meal, and it’s a super quick walk to the center of town. Thank you Claire!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely little flat that has been meticulously renovated close to local high street very quiet neighborhood.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved! Just minutes from hikes, historical sites and art centers. Self check in was extremely easy, no issues. The apartment was absolutely lovely! I still can't get the amazing clawfoot chair in the bedroom out of mind! Or the adorable desk with a pristine skeleton key! Gets lots of light if wanted. The bed was extremely comfortable! Not too soft but not at all hard! The couch was incredibly comfortable to my surprise! The host is so kind and thoughtful! Work delays led to a late check in, she very sweetly provided pancakes with syrup, and turned the AC on prior to my arrival. It's very private, I actually didn't bump into anyone during my stay. Well stocked with necessities;pots, pans, towels, wash clothes, even spices! I certainly fell in the love with the flow of the color schemes in the apartment too! There was not a lack of color but not too much that it created an overkill, beautiful flow. The A.C. also worked great! We had 80 degree days and I actually shut it off the last day!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I didn’t actually stay, but throughout the process—and the natural disaster that prevented my stay—the host was in good communication and even offered homemade cookies. Will likely stay next time I have business in Bennington."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Birch House is both serenely situated and beautifully appointed. It was clear that great effort has been applied to make guests feel welcomed. Rachelle was available for questions, but the cabin was so comfortable and well arranged that we had none. We’ll return gladly."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachelle’s home was exactly the getaway I was looking for. It’s in a private and safe area, but also close to so many great restaurants, hikes, and more. The bed was comfortable, and the shower was great. Rachelle left an amazing welcome basket too, and the decor and vibe were awesome! Everything was super easy and I felt right at home. I’d definitely stay again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful space in a very lovely location. Perfect for two. Amenities were as described.
Beautiful new construction, very clean and comfortable.
We enjoyed exploring some of the closer towns, Bennington and Manchester were great stops.
Kevin’s Sports Pub is a walk and we enjoyed a great relaxed meal. Bennington Community Store was also a nice fine.
Nearby was the Robert Frost hike which is easy and enjoyable.
Would highly recommend for folks wanting to get away for a while.
."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really beautiful place tucked away in North Bennington. Rachelle was very thoughtful with her communication and included tasty snacks in the stay. For those who are 6 ft and over, do take care to mind your head as the converted barn has a sloped ceiling! All in all, it was a beautiful stay and I’d happily book again for a weekend getaway."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachelle's place was minimalist and modern. Very CLEAN and comfortable.
The location was rural and quiet. Plenty of space for a couple to spend a few days.
Rachelle was responsive to inquiries, and a great host. She provided information on local establishments, as well as providing some guest provisions which provided a great midnight snack.
If I ever have the need to stay in the area again, I would absolutely stay here.
I would highly recommend it to anyone!!!!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Five stars all around! When I say this place exceeded our expectations, I really mean it. Rachelle is such a thoughtful host and the kindest communicator. You can really feel that she loves hosting and cares for the space meticulously. The space was so incredibly considered—from the thoughtful welcome treats, to the wireless chargers at each night table, to the private outdoor space right by the woods. This place is worth every penny and then some!
The cabin is also located right behind the Robert Frost trail, which is an incredible adventure. It is also very close by far to nearby North Adams and Williamstown, where you can explore art at the Clark or at Mass MoCA. We ate at the Hill Farm nearby, which was a recommendation, and it was probably the best food and service we’ve ever had.
So grateful we were able to get this space for a gorgeous weekend getaway. The privacy, kindness, proximity to nature, and careful details were everything we needed. Truly the best stay we’ve had."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was beautiful and well put together. Rachelle was great in her communication and made the stay seamless and easy. Would highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect little spot in North Bennington! It’s secluded and feels private but still close to town. Inside was a dream - everything was clean, lights were left on for visibility and ambiance when we arrived, and the bed was so comfortable! Everything we needed was available, and Rachelle left extras that made the house cozy - including milk in the fridge, and kcups for coffee (and a few snacks too!) There was a little first aid kit in the bathroom (thankfully we didn’t need it!) and great coffee table books to browse in the living room. We really enjoyed the cabin and the location, just a quick five minute drive to Bennington College campus. Rachelle’s communication was excellent and helpful, and the directions were spot-on. We will definitely be back for future visits!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Looks even cleaner and cozier than the pictures! Rachelle’s place was in pristine condition and felt like home right away.
The inside temperature was easy to control, the lights were all dimmable, and there were even a few snacks and sparkling waters provided by the host!
This was probably one of the best airbnbs I have stayed at in terms of quality, price, and experience.
It was not too far from Mount Snow (~45 min), so if you are looking to go snowboarding for the day, this is a great location.
I am looking forward to coming back to this spot in the future! Highly recommend!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This hidden gem was a beautiful and peaceful place to stay for a weekend away for two. Location is great as it's close to walking/hiking but also within driving distance of museums and small town centers as well.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being from this area it isn't always easy to find nice, peaceful places away from the main parts of town. Birch House was a wonderful little getaway tucked back in near Lake Paran. The modern decor makes it look very stylish while the area it's located still makes it feel cozy. Truly a great place to spend your time away."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Space was perfect and so close to mount snow!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Birch House was the perfect getaway for us! Peaceful, cozy, and filled with so many thouhtful amenities. The cabin was immaculately clean and we were so impressed with how cozy the decor was. Minimal and inviting without feeling stuffy or worn out. The living room is a good size and the couch was very comfortable. There are plenty of games to use and wind down with. The kitchen/dining room is a great size and had everything we needed and then some! The bedroom is on its own floor/loft space with a comfy bed and chargers available on either side of the bed. Bathroom was squeaky clean and had great smelling toiletries! Rachelle was such a gracious host and clearly took the time to make sure we were welcomed and had everything from a curated guide of the area to a sweet handwritten note welcoming us upon our arrival. We loved every moment of our stay and can’t recommend staying here enough!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachelle was a great host! My partner and I rented the space while on a ski trip, we had the best time. The space was immaculately clean and organized, and we had no trouble at all finding what we needed. The house had everything we could've possibly needed, being stocked with snacks, board games, blankets, and house socks! Rachelle's guide book was so so helpful, we used it throughout our entire trip, eating at many of the spots she listed. The host communicated everything we needed to know, and it made for a simple and easy check-in/check-out experience. We would 100% stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Was a quiet artistic and cute place to stay with a great view of the sky 🌌
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachelle is a wonderful host and the place is perfect! Spotless, stylish, and has all the amenities! Would definitely stay again. We did some cross country skiing at Prospect mountain and this was a great location!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my husband came here for my birthday, get to have a getaway in Vermont and be able to snowboard. Rachel’s place was well located and with a reasonable distance from restaurants and sky mountains. Peaceful, nice architecture and design."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the first time of many I've been at the airbnb in the winter and it was just as beautiful in the winter as the other seasons. Highly recommend.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a clean, quiet, and cozy place! It has everything you need and nothing you don’t. Amazing!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved this stay!! The pictures are exactly as showed (real life is even better). It is a really cute spot and had everything we needed. Would definitely stay again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rachelle's place was amazing! Everything about the place was so well thought out and well-designed. We were so impressed with everything. It was the kind of space that made you feel at peace and right at home. Everything you need, and nothing you don’t. Downtown Bennington was close by, and had some good restaurants for both dinner and breakfast. Thank you Rachelle for a wonderful stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Birch House is a beautiful guest cottage with tasteful, easy to live with contemporary decor and several thoughtful amenities to make a guest feel at home. I arrived during a snowstorm and, as a result, needed to cancel my dinner plans so I stopped for a few snacks and found still more refreshments awaiting me when I arrived. Rachelle had the house well-lighted and cozy and she also cleared the snow from the walkway and around my car in the am. I spent two nights at Birch House and plan to return for work assignments. The house is spotlessly clean and well appointed. I especially enjoyed Rachelle's taste in home design and her taste in art, art books, and display. Although it's the dead of winter and I didn't venture down to Lake Paran as a result, the view and opportunity to partake of local culture and nearby museums are all within range and make a visit to North Bennington and the surrounding area a worthwhile stop on any itinerary that takes you near the intersect of VT/NY/MA."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this stay as a writer’s retreat for my husband. He loved it! The owner, Rachelle was very responsive to messages and in response to very gusty weather forecasts, she proactively messaged details, if needed. The stay is beautiful, modern yet cozy and the location was near a couple of really great local spots. Definitely recommend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place clean and minimalistic, Rachel was very friendly, welcoming, and helpful when we had questions. Will absolutely be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"such a cute spot! we had such a relaxing and peaceful stay here. it’s a great spot for a couple to hang out for a few days, in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood but close to everything bennington and the general area has to offer!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"You can’t go wrong with staying at the guest house! Plenty of parking, easy to find and close to the ski resorts. Place was SPOTLESS! always the little things also that make a world of a difference, from small snacks and candy upon arrival to fresh milk in the fridge for coffee, filtered water and plenty of games. We will definitely be back for a longer stay here."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rachelle’s Vermont stay was everything as described. Clean, peaceful and beautiful. Rachelle was a great host, really responsive and attentive to anything we needed.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was just what my girlfriend and I envisioned for our getaway. The place was gorgeous, clean, and had everything you needed to a lovely time in Vermont. The host was super friendly and responsive to us whenever we needed something which made the experience even better. If we ever decided to return to Vermont, we will definitely choose this spot again :DDD"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, modern, perfect."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a lovely place. Extra nice was the milk in the fridge so we could have our coffee and tea in the morning without having to go shopping!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely unreal place to stay. Incredibly modern finish inside which we were not expecting. Everything was spotless/clean and the whole vibe was very cozy. If we are ever in the area again we’d absolutely considered Rachelle’s place again, 10/10!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachelles home exceeded my expectations. The atmosphere was clean and organized. I enjoyed the skylight as well as the adjustable lights throughout the space. The location is great, within walking distance or a short drive to a small downtown as well as a water front park."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! Even better host. Couldn’t ask for more. Would stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at this cozy, modern little house. The atmosphere is incredibly inviting, with a perfect blend of modern amenities and rustic charm. This design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also thoughtfully curated for comfort. Attention to detail is evident throughout the entire space. The host was particularly thoughtful and proactive in providing local recommendations and resources. Overall great experience!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachelle’s place was amazing! The cabin was cozy and absolutely beautiful. There were a ton of local food places and the Robert Frost hiking trail was just a few minutes away. Rachelle was super responsive and the check in/out process was seamless. I even got to meet her briefly while grabbing something from my car and she was lovely. The vaulted ceiling upstairs is a little tricky if you are super tall, but overall I highly recommend this place."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachelle's Birch House is thoughtfully designed, warm, welcoming, comfortable, clean and well-maintained. The bed is high quality and comfortable, linens and towels are excellent and the kitchen is perfectly workable. Rachelle is a prompt and clear communicator. Really and truly, one of the best Airbnb experiences that I have ever had."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a nice stay at Rachelle’s home. Rachelle was easy to communicate with from start to finish. Her home was immaculate. It was the perfect location for visiting our son at Bennington College—he rode his bike to see us. The home was comfortable and had everything we needed. Rachelle provided us with recommendations to restaurants, stores, hiking, etc. It was truly a lovely weekend and we’d stay here again in a heartbeat."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect, cosy, beautifully decorated little house! With a kitchen and bathroom with shower and bath. Beautiful artwork and tastefully decorated. Spacious and light house.
Rachelle was the perfect host!
We had a wonderful stay and were sorry to leave after two nights. We would have loved to stay longer."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our fall weekend getaway in Bennington so hence stayed the night at this cozy cabin. Rachelle’s place is one of the best Airbnb’s we’ve stayed in because of the attention to detail. It’s a great space to unwind and relax especially the loft with its skylight - we were lucky to have the full moon view :)
Charging stations at bedside table, sustainable and environmental friendly bathroom essentials and complimentary coffee and snacks are some things that made a big difference.
We wish we’d stayed longer but maybe next time :)
Thank you Rachelle"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rachelle was very helpful and responsive. The place was beautiful and clean, with a charming design. We really enjoyed our stay and would stop by again anytime!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank You Rachelle for sharing your Birch House with us. It is beautiful and is supplied with everything we needed. I loved seeing the stars through the skylight in the early morning. You were very gracious and helpful when we could not work the remote for the TV. We wish our stay was longer but hope to make our way back sometime in the future.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I mean where do I even start.
My check in got a little late because I was coming all the way from Maryland, and the temperatures had dropped. Rachelle was very kind to keep the lights and heat on. In addition, she had warm socks at the entrance for guests. How kind and considerate.
The place is absolutely magnificent. If you're around the area, you can book this place blindly and you won't regret. It is done so tastefully. No wonder I was not surprised to learn that Rachelle is an interior decorator too. The place was spick-and-span, spotless to say the least. She even had a 2 top chicos and Tate's cookies for me, which were delightful after a long trip.
Rachelle is super responsive and very friendly. Glad I got to chat with her in person at checkout.
If you're around the area, just book this place."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay! Rachelle has thought of everything and Birch House is the coziest spot. Loved sleeping under the skylight and listening to the rain. Walkable to North Bennington’s shops and restaurants, beautiful walks in the neighborhood. Kitchen is perfect for simple meals and morning coffee. Cozy living area for watching movies and hanging out. Excellent communication throughout. The best!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved Rachelle’s place! We wanted a quiet getaway and that’s what we got! We were near shops, restaurants and covered bridges. We enjoyed walking around Lake Paran. Beautiful spot! We will definitely come back again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. The place is so well designed and everything just felt cozy and comfortable. Rachelle was extremely proactive is responding to questions we had.
I would definitely recommend this place!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the perfect spot to just relax. Rachelle is an absolute amazing host, friendly and proactive. She even leaves extra snacks…how sweet is that? The accommodations were unbelievable, squeaky clean and beautiful. You can tell she has put heart and soul into it. A definite 10 out of 10!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place. So peaceful and serene! The kitchen was well equipped, living room was comfortable. Bathroom was sparkling clean. Location was great, walkable to the lake and to the market. Rachelle was responsive to all of our questions. 100% recommended!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rachelle is an incredible host, she is super responsive, and she goes above and beyond in everything she does. Her place is stunning! Her home is by far my favorite place I’ve ever stayed to date, and I will absolutely stay here again if I’m ever in the area again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachelle’s place is clean, comfortable, and stylish.. Her attention to detail from her communication to anticipating the needs of guests is clear and appreciated. We will definitely be coming back! Thanks, Rachelle!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Birch House was incredible! The treats Rachelle had waiting for us in the house when we checked in made us feel so welcome - she is a very thoughtful host. The entire home was immaculate. Staying in this space felt like if your friend owned a spa and invited you to come visit. The decor was minimal, which was very calming, and the soaps provided were phenomenal. That, combined with the fluffy towels and amazing water pressure made the stay feel luxiourious! We were lucky enough to visit when the moon was almost full, which was a treat with the bedroom skylight. Rachelle’s place is close to many good restaurants, and her neighborhood was so quiet. Rachelle was an excellent communicator, friendly and always quick to respond. We were sorry our stay was only for two nights, and look forward to our next opportunity to enjoy this charming space!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a spotless place from which to explore the area. Really appreciated the snacks, coffee and tea options, cream, water. It’s obvious a lot of care and attention were put into every detail. Products are labeled and there are bedside lanterns for moving about at night, for example. The WiFi was strong. None of the window dressings are blackout. Beware the sloping roof in the sleeping area if you are tall."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I spent the night before my wedding at this sweet house. It couldn’t have been more restful and soothing. Rachelle’s attention to detail and her welcoming provisions left nothing to be desired. I wouldn’t hesitate to send friends there or to stay there again. Thank you, Rachelle"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Birch House. We chose it because it was well located for what we wanted to do (an easy 30 minute drive to the Clark Institute, a good base for hiking in Southern Vermont). But it was much more. Beautifully designed, both functionally and aesthetically, it was the perfect place to read, relax, sleep, have a snack, or plan our next excursion into the Green Mountains.
Rachelle was such a good host. We had asked for restaurant recommendations and the two we went to from the list were spot on. She also told us about a walk right in North Bennington that was perfect for the afternoon we didn’t feel like driving very far.
After a long rainy drive, it was a lift to the heart to open the door to the cabin, and I must say a little hard to close it four days later, but we are already planning our next stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place. Nearby lake and restaurants a short drive away. The space was so clean, and loved the decor. Sleep was tough with the skylight, and the sheets could’ve been comfier. Would recommend for a peaceful stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rachelle is an awesome host. We felt safe, comfortable, and very happy with her cool space! Thank you Rachelle!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptional hospitality and exceptional value! Rachelle is a warm, generous host who goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome and comfortable. Every detail is thoughtfully considered: inspired design, cozy blankets, bright & warm lighting, yummy snacks!! Uncluttered, yet everything you need is at hand (luxurious toiletries, fluffy towels, kitchen essentials including fully stocked coffee/tea station). Excellent communication throughout. Walk to town and lake, explore the wooded surroundings, and relax in the cabin. My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and can’t wait to return! Book without hesitation."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Always a pleasure renting this airbnb.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachelle’s place was exactly as described and her guide book was spot on for recommendations for things to do and place to go in the area. Very clean space, well stocked with supplies you might need, nicely decorated and very comfortable. Nice touch with the welcome basket as well, it was very thoughtful. If your going to be in the area I would recommend staying here."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Birch House recently. Rachelle was a terrific host- very responsive, great communication and great recommendations of the area. Many of the spots in her guide book were great- one additional spot that we would add is Niramit in Bennington. It’s a wonderful thai restaurant that just opened with excellent food cooked and served by lovely people.
The Birch House was beautifully designed, very clean, well organized and comfortable. It was very quiet, peaceful and close to great food and access to nature. Thank you Rachelle for all of the thoughtful touches and for sharing your beautiful space with us. We will definitely book again next time we are in the area!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Birch House was great! The space is so cute and SO clean. This was about the most spotless bathroom I’ve ever experienced in an Airbnb. Water got nice and hot and good shower pressure too. I loved the minimalistic decor, really allowed for a calming and relaxing vibe. Rachelle was very responsive with little questions we had about the area. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in this area!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rachelle's place is super clean and airy, with a contemporary and simple design style that is refreshing. Cozy soft throws. The location is on a very quiet road, close to a nice small lake with walking trails. Nice welcoming touches - fresh flowers and snacks. It was perfect for my brief visit. Many thanks!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachelle was great, she was available through messaging, and her response time to any needs was her incredible. Great time, great space, great people. Thanks!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Rachelle's Birch House is a lovely place. The space is airy and open, with a quiet outside sitting area. The bed in the loft upstairs is extremely comfortable -- the skylight lets the air and the birdsongs in. The kitchen has everything we needed to cook (pots, utensils etc. ) Birch House is a short walk to Lake Paran and the village of North Bennington, and a short drive to everything else in the area. Rachelle was very welcoming and easy to reach when we had a question. My partner and I wanted a quiet vacation in a town we wanted to spend time in. We had a great time!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed for one night and had a great experience. Rachelle was very accommodating and communicative. Place was clean and looks just like the pictures. Not that much to do in Bennington, but we had to be at a wedding nearby so it was a perfect place to stay for the night."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Rachelle’s place. It is beautiful, serene and has all of the amenities we needed. Rachelle even included a welcome basket with cookies and seltzer upon arrival, left a container of milk in the fridge for coffee and kept in contact with us as we were traveling through a particularly crazy storm to make sure we were ok. She really goes above & beyond.
It is even more beautiful than in the pictures and check in/out couldn’t have been easier!
The only thing I’ll say is that if you are very tall it might not be the best fit for you as the ceiling by the bed is a tad low. Was not a problem at all for me but if you’re especially tall might be a struggle.
We absolutely loved it and can’t wait to come back, highly recommend!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"After staying, I completely see why she is a super host. The place is super clean and quiet, and I loved the extra touches. I felt safe, not even locking the door. My daughter loved all of the goodies they left. I only wish we could have stayed longer."

Gorgeous home that feels so comfortable and inviting. Rachelle has done an amazing job with the space and clearly has paid attention to details, which, however small are charming in this space. It has everything you could need and was so perfect after long days of hiking. Very private, yet conveniently located."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my girlfriend and I’s first time ever using Airbnb, and honestly we couldn’t have asked for a better experience!!!
Rachelle was super friendly, and gave us a rundown of what they area offered and little tidbits to help us out.
Staying in Vermont for the first time, we wanted something different than traditional hotel room and Rachelle delivered. The guest house felt like our own little private getaway, with all the amenities we could have asked for and even some we wouldn’t have thought of.
We had a fantastic trip, and will certainly stay at the Birch House again if we are in the area.
Thank you Rachelle!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and peaceful location. Not far from good places to eat and places to hike.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect! Very cute and just big enough for the two of us, loved the convenience of the hot plate and the electric kettle so we were able to cook a couple of meals. Also close enough to New York and Manchester, VT to get some sightseeing in!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed over during Memorial Day weekend for one day and enjoyed every second.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed at Rachelle’s place a couple weeks ago (see my other review for details) and we were thrilled to see it available for another trip we needed to make to the area. Just as enjoyable the second time around! Such a comfortable and quiet spot to rest for the night!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely lovely stay! Location was right next to the Robert Frost Trail and the beautiful Lake Paran with plenty of restaurants and stores within driving distance. The Birch House was absolutely pristine and cozy and we will definitely be returning!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful, calm, clean, enchanting place with a skylight, windows, chairs to sit outside, comfortable bed, nice bathroom, and many, many extra touches."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away for a few days. Near many nice places and the beauty of Vermont. Host is on the case and everything was ready for us and couldn't be easier. It is EXACTLY like the pictures!

We only stayed here for one overnight for about 12 hours to sleep, but the personal touches really made us feel at home. Some of these touches were the magnet note on the fridge, sparkling water, snacks, and tote bag. We would love to stay at Rachelle’s place again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and crisp design inside of cabin along with numerous ammenities made it feel like home away from home. Outdoor area at night is relaxing and sweet. Highly recommend it for a single traveler or couple. Will defintely return there again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rachelle’s AirBnB was just what we were looking for.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely stunning location and home! Would love to visit again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely spot! Rachelle has decorated in an engaging modern style, simple and minimal while seeming to have thought of every detail. The pics don’t quite do justice to how clean and beautiful the place it while still being home and relaxing. From the cool games to the snacks and free tote bag, Rachelle is a great host. Though it is a backhouse with a couple of other houses around it feels very private and distinctive. One of the best aspects is the close proximity to a lovely path into the surrounding woods and around the lake just steps away from the door. We saw an eagle catch a fish! Close proximity to town yet with a feeling of peaceful separation, loved this place and would definitely stay here again whenever I’m back in North Bennington."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachelle was great to deal with! Super responsive and helpful with local recommendations. Her place was nice and very clean, would gladly stay there again"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a very enjoyable stay for our anniversary weekend. A nice touch was seeing “happy anniversary” on the fridge from Rachelle making us feel welcome.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachelle was a great host, she was extremely responsive & nice. The Airbnb is about 25 min from Manchester which has a lot of great outlet stores (theory, tumi) & restaurants. Also about 20 min from Williams College which is nice to walk around. Bennington college is a 5 min drive and also a nice campus to walk around or drive through. The stay was extremely quiet & peaceful. The hot plate provided in the kitchen was great for cooking & there is also a microwave. I went in Feb and it was a great stay. Will definitely be back!"

It’s a quiet and peaceful private property located minutes from town center with great restaurants, right on Lake Paran which is gorgeous and has a fantastic scenic trail. The interior design of the cabin is bright and slick almost like a modern gallery, everything is finished with care and love.
Rachelle is an amazing host. We had some confusions with checkin and had to wake her up in the middle of the night. She was super attentive and helped us out instantly. She was traveling herself during our stay but was always available and responded to our messages quickly, also dropped us great tips about the cabin as well as the neighborhood. Be sure to check out her local guidebook in Airbnb, we booked several restaurants she recommended and all of them are fantastic.
Highly highly recommend! Thank you Rachelle!"

Her place is fantastic, we appreciated having a cabin with clean modern finishes and with beautiful design features and decoration.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Georgett's accommodation exemplifies meticulous attention to detail in its clean, well-designed living space. It's equipped with all the essentials one could need, and more. The kitchen is fully stocked with clean utensils, plates, cutlery, cooking pots, and cleaning supplies. We were delighted to find an amazing array of breakfast foods,. The bed was incredibly soft and comfortable, ensuring a restful sleep, and the bathroom was spotless, complete with plenty of towels.
One of the unique highlights was that the property is a horse farm, which added a charming touch to our stay. We had the opportunity to pet the horses and engage with Georgette, who shared insightful information about the horses and her farm.
Typically, due to my stressful job, I manage only about five hours of sleep, but here I enjoyed ten uninterrupted hours in the peaceful, quiet setting. We would return in a heartbeat and highly recommend this wonderful getaway."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Georgette was very responsive and accommodating to our needs. The homemade ham and fresh eggs along with everything we needed for breakfasts was a lovely touch.

I highly recommend staying here for a relaxing stay around Bennington and plan to return.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Georgettes place was the perfect little getaway. There were so many thoughtful touches, and the space was beautiful, comfortable, and inviting. Make sure you say a quick hello to the chickens if weather allows!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were passing through the Bennington area and finding this cottage was such a pleasant surprise! It's been renovated in a smart way, and it's very clean, comfortable, open, and full of light. The deck and grill are great additions, and of course the horses and chickens make for a pastoral environment. Georgette was a great host, and she makes you feel like a true guest, rather than just a paying tenant. And what was more, she does not have a demanding, long list of check-out instructions that add more stress to your travels. We always try to leave places that we rent in good order, but her attitude was much appreciated. It's a gem!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Georgette was great, very responsive, and the cottage was extremely cute and immaculately clean. All provisions we could have needed were there.

A truly amazing experience in a rural setting yet close to shopping conveniences and other great activities. Great options for restaurants and taverns just minutes away too. Georgette and Stan were a pleasure to meet (as we were headed out which made us wish we had stayed longer so we could visit more).
If you’re looking for a country farm escape in a clean and cozy home, look no further! We plan to visit again (hopefully soon)."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved it!!! Perfectly represented on the site. Clean cozy private farm atmosphere. Georgette was so accommodating and friendly and responsive when we reached out or needed something. She allowed us to arrive early due to a bad storm in the area. Welcomed our dog and had a welcome basket for him with all the supplies he needed and left homemade blueberry jam and breakfast foods in the fridge for us to enjoy. My husbands favorite! So nice and really made us feel like they wanted us to just come and enjoy our stay. The perfect getaway and so easy and comfortable. Quiet comfy night sleep. We enjoyed walking the grounds and making dinner and relaxing in the cozy cottage. They had all the things we needed with a homey farm decor. Perfect! Stan was so helpful and let us know if we needed anything don't hesitate to ask. Thank you so much. They gave us some farm fresh eggs to take home too.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spent two nights at the lovely cottage. As a horse lover, it was just as I expected, had horses close by. Cottage was cozy, meticulous, and had all the needed. Georgette made the stay even more special by having fresh eggs, juice, muffins, homemade blueberry jam and coffee/tea on site. Had a chance to chat with Georgette and her husband Stanley who shared a bit about their history in Benningniton. Would highly recommend a stay here. Would skip eating a Publick House, just down the road on 7A. Other than a great salad bar, food was not good and very pricey."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Georgette and her husband Stan were outstanding hosts. The cottage is Vermont perfect - exactly as described, but they underestimated hove wonderful it is. They are super friendly and approachable. We loved the fresh eggs collected from the farm chickens and we enjoyed meeting their beautiful horses. This cottage is easy to find and in a great location, close to everything. We actually never ate out - because it was so charming - a perfect place to unplug phones and computers. We played games, watched movies, had quality time with our senior pup and much more. Just wonderful all around!"

Downtown bennington was minutes away. Definitely recommend!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Georgette’s cottage was amazing. On the outside it doesn’t look like much, but the inside has a living room, full size kitchen, bedroom, and full bathroom.

Everything you needed was there in the place. Great location to everything in Bennington as well."

Immediately the place felt cozy and comfortable. Upon opening the refrigerator we discovered fresh eggs, O.J., half and half, homemade jam, and english muffins. The kitchen was perfectly designed and full of every possible pot, pan, measuring cup, utensil, etc that anyone could possibly need. The dishes seemed new and were beautiful - I loved the coffee mugs that were provided. We could see the horse barn outside our window and when we saw Georgette outside we went out to meet her and enjoyed chatting with her and Stan. We watched the horses and the chickens on the property. We visited some of the local parks and shopping areas and found the entire experience to be perfect. Thank you!"

Georgette is beyond accommodating and had her fridge fully stocked with fresh eggs, homemade jam (which was beyond delicious), English muffins, and OJ. We felt at home as soon as we walked in. It felt even more magical when we had the opportunity to meet Georgette, Stan, their horses, and chickens. It is perfect for two people who love animals and want a quiet Vermont getaway. (:"

This little house on a farm site was perfect for us -- well stocked kitchen and had a surprise in the fridge on arrival! Fresh eggs, butter, jam, English muffins and orange juice.
Location was great -- we explored Bennington but also easily drove up to areas in northern Vermont to hike and see the covered bridges.
Highly recommend this spot!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at Georgette's place! It was so peaceful and beautiful, and we felt right at home.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a warm, extra cozy cottage. We felt right at home as soon as we walked in, which we could only do after the chickens gathered around the front steps let us through. Our excellent host, Georgette, provided everything we needed for cooking, bathing, and sleeping. We travel with our small dog and this had to be one of most dog-friendly places we’ve ever stayed at.
Although the town of Bennington is easily accessed, the house is situated on a beautiful, secluded tract of land with the woods, farm, horses, and ever present chickens to keep ones mind off the rest of the world.
Highly recommended."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Georgette's place is terrific! My husband and I, as well as our pup, loved it. While we were only there for one night, it would be a wonderful place for a longer stay. The location is lovely, Georgette and all of the animals are welcoming, and the space is well-appointed and comfortable. The fresh eggs, English muffins, jam and butter for breakfast were very much appreciated. Thank you, Georgette, for making us feel so welcome."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at Georgette’s farm. The space was private and quaint and right near the horses and chickens which our daughter loved. Georgette was a perfect host with thoughtful touches - we especially appreciated the fresh eggs and jam in the fridge when we arrived. We would absolutely stay here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at the farm. Our baby loved seeing the chickens and horses. We were welcomed with fresh eggs OJ muffins and home made jam in the fridge. We went to Bennington two years ago pre baby and wanted a relaxing trip back. We went back to Madison Brewery for delicious wings truffle fries and beer. The house is close by to town and we loved the experience staying on a farm
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect spot to stay before dropping my child off at Bennington College. Quiet setting, but convenient to town and the college."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Georgette's place is great. Close to Bennington but feels remote. Bigger/nicer than photos suggest -- real Living room. Woke up to seeing her beautiful horses out back. Said we'd be using pull out sofa and it was fully made up for us. Great experience overall.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a phenomenal place to relax for a few days! Their very comfortable guest cottage is easily accessible, has everything one should need and has a view of the chickens and horses. It’s also only minutes away from the town center of Bennington, which was a charming town to spend a few hours. I was very grateful for the pleasant surprise of fresh eggs from the chickens. I will absolutely be returning!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful time at Georgette's cottage! The breakfast was fantastic and everything was so clean.. We will definitely book again if we are traveling through! Wish we could give higher than a 5 star rating!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We, my husband and I, had a very pleasant stay August 22-25, 2023. We also took our 45 lb dog, Hax, with us. There was absolutely no problem taking our dog. Jax loved to visit with the horses and chickens. He was on a leash the whole time of course.
When we first got into the cottage, it looked so well kept, clean, fridge had fresh eggs, homemade blueberry jam, OJ, milk, English muffins butter, etc. it was an unexpected surprise for sure.
As we walked the grounds around us we would run into both Georgette and her husband on occasion. Good conversations were had. Very helpful directing us to the supermarket, restaurants, etc.
Our time flew by. We hope we will be able to get back there next year. The only tip I have for anyone going there is to make sure you’re ok with getting your shoes dirty as when it rains it is muddy in some certain areas so
Maybe take two pairs of shoes with you. It is not muddy in most areas as there is grass.
Sincerely Maria, Peter, Jax Gouveia

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were lucky to get back for a 2 night stay. Georgette had added a few more thoughtful touches and we enjoyed having the extra time to relax and enjoy our stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was wonderful!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were delighted by the cottage and the location, which perfectly suited our needs. There is ample privacy in this easy to reach location, close to all that's happening in Southwestern Vermont and the surrounding area. Amenities offered were more than adequate for our one night stay, and the fresh eggs and homemade jam for breakfast were an unexpected treat. Delicious! It was great to get to meet and chat with Georgette. She gave a nice overview of the property... and provided introductions to the farm's chickens, new chicks and horses. We will definitely return to this gem!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Georgette & Stan's cottage was fabulous! It was pristine clean, comfortable, and she went above and beyond in thinking of ways to make her guests stay wonderful! We saw their beautiful horses, the barn cat, and the super cute baby chickens. It was quite picturesque!
She had dog bowls, dog treats and to our surprise had several kind & generous gifts in the refrigerator. She is the ONLY Airbnb we've ever stayed in that provided more than coffee ... such generosity and kindness with fresh eggs, muffins, homemade blackberry jam (that she needs to sell -- it was amazing!), milk, orange juice, and tea. Very thoughtful....
Highly recommend stay if your near the area..."

There was fresh milk and eggs in the fridge, along with homemade jam and juice! There were dog treats for my doggo and Georgette is so kind and gracious. I was granted a late check out which I SO APPRECIATED. Honestly, I felt right at home and I slept so well. The bed is comfortable, the shower is hot with great pressure - seriously this place is a total find! The place was totally spotless and extremely clean. I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to stay here and I would again the next time I am in the area. It's a great value for money and I just had the best stay. HIGHLY recommend this airbnb for your trip to Bennington. Thank you Georgette - you rock!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,We were going to arrive quite late so I asked for a pic of the outside to be sure we knew where to go. It is quite easy as the cottage is before their property gate and there is a sign for where to park. The decor was very homey and we had very nice welcome gifts in the fridge. The ONLY issue was the number of flies and insects inside. The doors and AC units are not quite sealed thoroughly and with all the lights on there were quite a few in all the rooms when we arrived. Hopefully this is fixed quickly.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place smells brand new!! Like just built. Very clean, and quiet!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay! Georgette is a gracious host and the little farm is idyllic.

Noticed fresh eggs in the fridge, with a few other nice goodies — which was an awesome touch!
The only issue we had was that it was a little buggy, but thats totally to be expected for property the house was on. Few mosquitoes, but mostly moths and beetles, and they didn’t present to be an issue at all while we were there.
She was super responsive and helpful! Could totally see us staying there again."

The house was great very clean and open, the bed was super comfortable and check in was very easy.
Leslie was super friendly, communicative, and very helpful with things going on around Bennington and she has the cutest puppy Artemis.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As a solo traveler making the migration north in the search of snow, I could not have asked for a better place to stay than Leslie's. From the start she was very communicative with any questions I had regarding her place and the inclement weather that was expected over the weekend. Her pricing and house rules were both very fair. Leslie was there to great me upon arrival and helped me get settled in. She was very friendly and it was a pleasure to talk someone after the long drive. She was up first thing the next morning shoveling the driveway so the other houseguest and I could get to the mountains. When I got back, I had a great time conversing with Leslie as I caught up on some work. I left Leslie's not only having a wonderful experience but also feeling like I had gained a friend. I will always keep her place in mind for any future trips to southern Vermont!"

The place is quiet and clean, and the neighborhood is very safe and close to downtown Bennington. The only thing is there is no AC as of right now (there is heating though), and although Vermont tends to stay cold or fresh for the most part, some summer days can get hot if you are renting during that time. Otherwise, it is a great stay. Leslie is very friendly and loves to give info about everything there is to do in Bennington. Highly recommended."

We had some great conversations during my stay, yet she also made it clear from the beginning that if I wanted privacy she would oblige.
The room was spotless and had plenty of space for me and my luggage. The bed was very comfy, as was the bedding. The bathroom was also completely clean, stocked well with soap, body wash, shampoo and conditioner available for guest use. I was able to wash and dry clothes at any time, for which she also offered ample laundry detergent.
The town was quaint, quiet and peaceful. I met both Uber drivers in the area, who I learned are not always available around the clock. To the car-less like me: be advised of this. Everything you’d need is within 2-3 miles though.
Anytime I’m heading back to VT I’ll immediately be looking to stay at Leslie’s again!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Very clean and comfortable. Leslie is fantastic, she was extremely helpful with making my stay a great experience in all aspects and I had a wonderful time visiting with her as well. Would highly recommend. Thanks Leslie!"

2019-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Leslie's place is a very clean friendly stay with a nice split floor plan so you and her have some separation for privacy. She is helpful with tips on local food and things to do. While she is kind of new to hosting she is a veteran air bnb traveler so she is off to a great strt as a host.
2019-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was a great stay, comfortable, convenient and Leslie gave lots of helpful tips and suggestions for my stay!"

I thank you we will come back"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim was a very wonderful host, she was extremely accommodating to our travel schedule, very communicative and her place was amazing. It was very clean, the kitchen had everything we needed to stay in and share a meal together. It was well appointed with extra spices and condiments and she welcomed us with a snack basket and stocked the fridge with breakfast items.
The beds were extremely comfortable, lots of blankets and pillows and we took advantage of using the deep soaker tub.
It was close to Bennington college where we spent most of our time, and we really felt happy and appreciative to have such a comfortable, warm and cozy place to stay at."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot, meticulously clean. The extra touches by Kim made us feel at home."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you for a nice, quiet retreat. It was exactly as described, clean, on a nice street."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at Kim's place. We stayed at her other property in Bennington and found this experience just as positive. Would strongly recommend staying here.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim’s place was beautiful. The pictures don’t do it justice. It was very clean and relaxing. We had a snow storm hit and by the time we woke up everything was cleared and plowed. We did not expect that! We will definitely come back and explore more of Vermont. Bennington is a sweet little town. Can’t wait to see more.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay - home was very comfortable, nicely decorated, clean, well-stocked, with cozy sitting areas.! Kim was a great host...very helpful with getting us settled and responding to questions! We also loved the area - cross-country skiing, hiking, and exploring the restaurants and history of Bennington!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Kim's Bennington home. Kim generously left us bread, eggs, orange juice, and butter before our arrival. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed, and the loft bedroom was wonderfully cozy. We enjoyed exploring downtown Bennington (highly recommend 421 Craft Bar and Kitchen) and had an amazing day cross country skiing at Prospect Mountain. Thank you, Kim!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a pleasure staying at Kim’s house. It was immaculately clean and comfortable for me and my family. The house isn’t large but feels big enough to give everyone privacy. The house has exactly what is needed without superfluous clutter and is well designed. We visited ski areas every day and the the drive was quite manageable. Highly recommended!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s house is the perfect place to stay for your southern Vermont trip. The house was exactly as described in the listing and spotless. Perfect location that is very private and quiet, but still only a 5 minute drive to town and local amenities. The inside of the house is amazing with lots of woodwork, unique designs, and the perfect layout that makes it very spacious. Kim was a great host who was responsive and check in/out were a breeze. Highly recommended and would definitely stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Many thanks to Kim and Don for a wonderful visit! They were very responsive and had everything we needed. The house is beautiful and comfy. Vermont doesn’t have a ton to do, but that’s the point of Vermont😏. However, when we were interested in venturing out, they had a great list of options. It was the peace and relaxation we needed❤️"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mom, my sisters and I had a wonderful time at the house. Great spaces to gather to hang out, make meals and play games. The house was beautiful and very welcoming."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hands down, this is probably the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. If you are looking for a private, peaceful, and convenient location, this is the place to be. The place is in mint condition, immaculate, and all appliances work well. Not far from Old Bennington, restaurants, and grocery store. Highly recommend."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Felt right at home. Kim was very responsive & helpful. We will be back again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"incredible! I have visited more than six houses in Vermont and she is number one. Kim was amazing, I can't put into words how kind and caring she was! Amazing house, comfortable, cozy, clean and organized! I will come back more often without a doubt."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,I’ve stayed here many times. You can’t find a better place to stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely one of the top rentals we’ve stayed at. Very cozy, well-equipped kitchen, peaceful setting, convenient to town and nearby activities."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at Kim's house. The house is exactly as described, maybe better! The location is great for walking, as the roads are lightly traveled. Easy access to Bennington, Manchester, and Williamstown, all of which I visited. The house is comfortable and well-appointed.
Thanks for your hospitality, Kim. Hope to return."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect. Clean, cozy, comfy and stylish. Kim accommodated our request for early check in and even provided us with breakfast. This was one of three places we stayed during our Vermont road trip, and I wish we just stayed here. So peaceful. Best tub as well!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is clear that Kim takes pride in her pristine home both inside and out. The first thing I noticed when entering was how nice it smelled. The decor is beautiful and the furniture is comfortable. We didn’t have the best weather on our trip and ended up spending more time inside than we planned. We were glad to have chosen such a lovely environment to hold up in. Kim pays special attention to all the small details such as quality towels, hangers, a super clean bathroom and everything you can imagine needing in the kitchen. I would definitely book with Kim again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed this past weekend at this property because we were in the Bennington area for my daughter's wedding. From the moment we arrived we were amazed at what a fantastic property this is! Kim and her husband allowed us to adjust our check in time to accommodate us being able to arrive on time for the rehearsal. The yard and interior of the home is absolutely immaculate and she messaged us to let us know there would be juice, bagels and eggs in the refrigerator. We felt so comfortable and right at home the entire stay...and it was obvious that every last detail had been thought of for their guests. Our only regret was not booking a couple of extra days here, we truly would have loved to have spent more time enjoying the space. I would 100% recommend this rental and I will absolutely be making another trip to Vermont to stay here again. While Kim was helpful and responsive when needed, we appreciated the ease of the self check in and the privacy this home gave. Five stars! Book now!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic property in every way! Beautifully furnished with just enough and not too much of everything you might want or need. Fluffy towels, high end linens, nice selection of coffee and breakfast fixings in the fridge. The design fits the region (Berkshires) perfectly. Kim was friendly, helpful and very welcoming. I would bring friends or family here anytime - one of the nicest AirBnb properties I have stayed in!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"An absolutely Perfect Vermont home!!! Situated in a quiet, peaceful location. It was very cozy and inviting. Tastefully decorated ( you can tell the host is an artist). Kim was available and checked in on us after arrival to see if we needed anything. We were greeted with breakfast items which made our mornings relaxed and easy.
I would highly recommend this home and would love to stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,We loved staying at Kim's and she was a fabulous host for us
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this home so much that we returned a second time.
The home is uniquely designed, thoughtfully furnished, and has a lovely mix of eclectic decor to enjoy.
It’s a short drive to town yet offers a peaceful setting and backyard for a relaxing getaway."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful home in a peaceful neighborhood. Very tidy with so many thoughtful touches- we were able to cook for ourselves easily but were close to downtown Bennington if we wanted to go out to eat. Comfortable and cozy! Big windows with a lovely yard but still quiet and private. We happily relaxed there between visiting nearby gems like the Clark Museum and many hiking trails. A lovely place for visiting Vermont in any season.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed a week at Kim’s place and it was fantastic, one of the best Airbnb’s we’ve been in and it was in a perfect location.
The house had so much space, was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The air conditioning worked perfectly which was great since we had some hot days. Kim had left us food in the fridge to make breakfast as well as a tasty beverage. We’ve never stayed in such a well stocked place, there were ample bath towels and tea towels as well as other supplies. We never had to worry about running out of anything. Kim is an exceptional host. During our stay there was a power outage in our area due to a strong thunderstorm. When we had to discard our refrigerated items Kim was so kind and brought us more groceries and even offered to put us up in a motel for the night until the hydro came back on the next day. But even without power we didn’t want to leave this wonderful place!
Thank you for everything Kim!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim's cottage was absolutely charming! It has chic comfortable furnishings, a vaulted ceiling which accentuated the space and lots of sunny windows. It was immaculate, clean and wonderful. She had a Keurig Coffeemaker, a dozen eggs and bread to have a nice breakfast available for us when dining in. It had close proximity to Bennington and Manchester which were lovely. Lots of restaurants, taverns, shopping and daytrip adventures were nearby!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cute, and classically Vermont. Kim’s home was conveniently located to downtown Bennington and our local family we were in town to visit. The house is super comfy with plenty of space for three adults and separate quiet work area. It was super hot while we were here and the air conditioners kept the house cool. We’ll definitely be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s home was beautiful. We went there to attend an event nearby. She was very responsive to any questions and left a list of places to eat and activities. I am a clean freak and her home was perfect, just outside of town and nice and quiet. So many fireflies and fireworks off in the distance, but close enough to see. A perfect place to stay and relax."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay. The place was unique and beautifully designed with a nod to a modern aesthetic. It stood out from other rentals in the area. Perfect for our family of 4. We would happily return again. Thank you Kim!

She checked in with us to see if we needed anything shortly after we had arrived. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the area and Kim’s comfortable home. If we return to the area in the future, we would definitely want to stay at Kim’s house again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You can’t find a better host or place to stay. I’ve stayed here many times and wish Kim and this home could be copied everywhere I go. It’s first rate!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family came to Bennington for a memorial service and Kim's house provided the perfect home away from home. The hosue is beautiful and the backyard space was perfect for our 3-year-old to run around and for us to enjoy the grill and have an evening cookout. Although it's not easily walk-able into town, it's only a short 7 minute drive. Grateful to Kim for her responsiveness and for being an outstanding host overall. I would highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spent two nights here and it was great. The home was beautiful with a huge backyard with a fire pit, and some views of trees and the mountains.

I would have liked to stay longer and spend more time relaxing in this lovely space."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying at this house. I loved having the windows open and hearing the peepers and the birds; the layout of the house is great and it’s very convenient to town but on a really quiet road. The kitchen was great, loved the coffee, everything worked perfectly. Thanks so much for a great stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic cottage: close enough to town but very peaceful, natural setting. We enjoyed everything about our stay here and would love to stay again. The house is a short drive to Bennington College (the reason for our visit). The quality of soaps, hand towels, kitchen supplies, bed linens and furniture is all top notch and makes for a luxurious stay! One of my favorite AirBnBs yet! You can tell Kim put a lot of thought into this cottage. The details and “little things” like having shampoo and having laundry detergent available for use was so nice. The cherry on top was having fresh eggs, bread, butter and orange juice waiting in the fridge after a long day’s drive. We are looking forward to our next visit already!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I just spent 3 nights at this wonderful home. Kim went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed, even providing us with English muffins. eggs and OJ in addition to Kcups and tea. Everything was perfect upon arrival.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kim’s house was perfect for our Vermont getaway, charming and cozy, my daughter said, “Mama I think this is a real cottage!”…she’s a city kid.
The place was tastefully decorated and very clean, with plenary of towels and supplies, which I very much appreciated! The owners even left us some goodies in the refrigerator to welcome us.
We hope to come back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place. Very cozy, clean, and well stocked. It was great for our weekend of skiing, perfectly located between Jiminy Peak and Mount Snow. Kim was great, very responsive. They even left OJ and English muffins in the fridge for us."

Kim was great communicating with us on our trip up to Vermont due to an incoming storm we hit on the way up.
Thanks for such great accommodations and help!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was a lovely location for a Girls Weekend! The house was spotless and well stocked with anything we may have needed. It was a short drive to downtown Bennington and we enjoyed the covered bridges and views of the mountains. Kim left a few breakfast items in the fridge for us along with a list of local restaurants. On her recommendation, we had dinner at nearby Brown's Brewing and it was a wonderful experience. One thing to note about this property, however, is that only one of the three bedrooms is fully enclosed. The other two are open/loft style which means noise carries and they get a ton of natural light...something to note if you are looking for complete privacy or have light sleepers in your group!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic stay at Kim’s place in Bennington. House was very well appointed and extremely clean and comfortable. Actually even nicer than the pictures.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family of 4 adults loved Kim's house. It's incredibly well equipped with supplies and cookware and we so appreciated the welcome gift of muffins and eggs. Living room is very comfortable and the decor was perfect. This north Bennington location is centrally located to so much- there are lakes and beautiful walks within 15 minutes and Bennington center is only about 5 minutes away. Highly recommend Powers Market and the Roasted Bean in N. Bennington. Just an FYI, the 3rd bedroom is a loft space - very spacious (feels like an apt.) and has a second TV, but it is open to the livingroom."

The kitchen is well-stocked and convenient to cook/bake in, which we did for many of our meals during our stay. Although it was just the two of us, there's so many beds for bigger groups. The bed was super comfy, by the way. We also got some breakfast food which was a very nice bonus. Also, Kim's very responsive if you need anything. Check-out was easy (no instructions! but obviously we did our best). Thanks again for letting us stay at this lovely Airbnb!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect place for a getaway. The location is perfect — secluded enough to enjoy the sounds of the neighboring woodland and watch the sun go down from the Adirondack chairs, but still just a short drive to stores and restaurants. The house is in excellent shape and it’s very comfortable. We arrived to find that hosts had set us up with coffee (K-cups), eggs, juice, butter, and English muffins — a really great touch."

Breakfast items were a really nice touch. Home is very cool and nicely located--quiet area but not far from town. We would definitely stay here again.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful house, located out in the country on a scenic and peaceful drive, yet close to everything (especially Bennington College). Check-in was seamless, the house is comfortable and well-appointed, decor is tasteful and the ambiance is lovely.
The home is clean in all of the obvious places, but could use a deeper clean for that “hotel clean” feel in the kitchen and bathroom. Corners and hidden areas haven’t gotten much attention from the cleaning crew (like the family of spiders living in one of the corners of the bathroom). Drain in the bathroom sink is barely draining. No dishwasher or disposal, but the kitchen is well-equipped and easy to cook in.
Our hosts were thoughtful, communications were good, and check-in and check- out was easy. I would definitely recommend staying here, it’s an ideal home away from home."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barbara’s place is AMAZING! This was my second time back with my wife and we really love staying here. My favorite things about this place is the bathroom/shower. Barbara’s place is also in a great location for skiing as you have mountains in just about every direction. Barbara herself is an absolute sweetheart and makes you feel right at home. We will definitely be back next winter!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can not say enough kind words about this AirBnB! Would consider living in it permanently if it was an option. :)
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barbara’s apartment was great. I stayed here with my partner for a ski weekend. The apartment is much bigger than pictured and Barbara is so lovely!

From the amazing waterfall shower (super relaxing) to the inviting living space complete with a book collection sure to keep you entertained for hours! And the outdoor space, wow! Lovely garden and great yard space for a workout (if that’s your thing) And if you sit outside or stroll the yard, you might have some hummingbirds as company!
Barbara made the entire process very smooth and stress-free. She greeted us upon arriving and made sure we had what we needed making us feel right at home.
When in Vermont area again we will definitely look to check back in to Barbara’s getaway!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara is such a wonderful host. She greeted me upon arrival and gave me a thorough tour of the building and art studio. Our stay was well taken care of with amenities, complimentary wine and fruit, heated floors and a beautiful bathroom. We were very comfortable and pleased with the consistent communication and friendliness throughout our stay!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I had a long stay with Barbara as I was house hunting in the surrounding area. I choose her place based on the rural setting, because it looked clean and artsy-modern, and I was intrigued by the possibility of an introduction to the art of printing (the artist in me loves to learn new techniques.) I found so much more that I expected on my stay!
Barbara greeted me when I arrived and introduced me to the apartment that had a cheerful vase of flowers and a bottle of wine waiting. Inside it was warm and modern with radiant heat floors, and supplemental electric radiator heating in the bathroom and bedroom/living room if needed. (I didn’t need them. I was warm and cozy in my Nov-Dec stay.) The apartment was larger the I expected from the photos. That was a great surprise. And it overlooked a beautiful back yard with sunset views. The kitchen was well stocked for cooking yummy meals. And oh the books! I wish I stayed longer just to read my way through Barbara’s eclectic and avant garde collection. Barbara was conscientious, open, generous in spirit, and great with communication.
In addition to the apartment, Barbara offered an introduction to her printing studio and two styles of printing (monotype and solar-etching.) It was my first experience using a printing press. As an artist I so appreciated Barbara’s generosity in sharing her studio, her knowledge and experience of printing, and giving me the opportunity to learn and play with both techniques. It was a great place for a creative retreat."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful warm and cozy apartment
Exactly what we were looking for
Would definitely book again"

2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Although it was a little hard to find using google maps, Barbara did an amazing job at explaining where the Airbnb was located and how to get into the apartment.
The apartment was well decorated and incredibly cozy (even had heated floors in the bedroom!). She was an incredibly good host and provided more amenities than what we thought there would be. The space was perfect for a couple.
Thank you so much! We’d definitely stay there again!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara's studio was awesome! Modern, cozy, and warm. Little personal touches throughout, heated floors, rainwater shower, awesome eclectic vibe, and even a complementary bottle of wine. Thanks so much Barbara!"
2019-12-01,3,Stayed one night,This apartment was not what I expected. It was a basement apartment with unfinished cement walls through much of it and a cement floor. I came in the winter on a cold day. There were heaters in the unit but the walls and floor still radiated cold. If you come in the winter be sure to bring slippers.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our second stay with Barbara - Thank you so much for your warm hospitality and for giving us a second home for the weekend! We love visiting with Barbara, and know other guests will have a wonderful time as well. (Ask Barbara about her art!)"
2019-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great stay.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara's place was really fantastic! Tucked below her lovely old home, the apartment was brand new, modern, clean, but still felt ""earthy"" in a way, nestled into the lonely hill. Though it was cold, the radiant heating kept us cozy as we enjoyed beautiful views out on to the field behind the house. Barbara herself was extremely kind and the place was outfitted with nice touches, like snacks, drinks, and coffee, as well as interesting books and guides to local hikes and walks. I would gladly recommend Barbara's place to anyone looking for a quiet and comfortable retreat in southern Vermont!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was so stylish and comfortable, everything we needed...great bookcase of entertainment...will be back."
2019-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean place to stay. Easy to find and unbelievably gorgeous back yard / view. Nice and secluded. Wish I had brought a go-cart or 4 wheeler for that back yard. (although the host may not have appreciated that...LOL). The place is very meticulously designed / constructed / decorated. As a building restoration guy I could tell the quality of construction and attention to detail was good. The design style was good for me - I like modern. It was a bit cold for my wife's taste though....I was hoping for a nice romantic stay and the decor did not put my wife in a romantic mood. But for the style and quality of decor, it was very, very nice. No TV, which I actually liked. Who needs a boob-tube to just distract you. The Wifi was good when we needed it. Very diverse and interesting selection of books on the bookshelves. I have to say I spent a while just leafing through many of them and reading snippets from many. Lots of classic titles and authors. More diverse than my library for sure. I would recommend this place. Barbara was a great hostess although we never met her. But she was responsive and would have been willing to help if we had needed anything I'm sure."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this place and will stay here again! It’s the perfect size for 2 people and the bathroom is gorgeous. The place is so modern yet you are surrounded by this amazing scenery and very separated from the world. It is the perfect place to relax and get away! Barbara also provided so many special touches, tourist info., and was really on top of texts/communication!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Although we did not meet Barbara in person she was a great host and left thoughtful touches in the apartment. The location is absolutely beautiful and very peaceful. I would definitely come back again.

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although I happened to be therein a weekend when Barbara was unable to be there she was quick to answer any questions that I had. In addition to her hospitality the place is lovely, clean with thoughtful touches and a gorgeous view."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara is so nice and her place is great! Very clean and a great setup. It’s the entire basement that walks out to an amazing view. We woke up and watched the turkeys in the backyard and watched the deer before bed. Barbara was very personable and concerned about our comfort. I had mentioned we were there to do some hiking, so she had set out a book about trails in the area. We would definitely stay here again!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment, great location, great host!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy place to stay in Bennington! Host is super hospitable and the space is quiet and clean. The weather was rainy during our entire stay so we had to spend more time indoors, but it was lovely to relax, especially with a fantastic library collection!"

Barbara took the time to come introduce herself before we left, and checked in with us to make sure we had all we needed. Perfect for our one night stay while passing through. We would definitely stay again!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a pleasant two night stay at Barbara's apartment in a country setting, 2 miles from Main St. Bennington. Self check-in worked perfectly and the space was just the right size for the two of us. There were fresh flowers awaiting us, snacks in the kitchen, a very comfy bed and spacious bathroom. Although we didn't meet Barbara, she was in regular communication with us to make sure all of our needs were being met. The location was quite convenient with easy access to the fun things tourists might find interesting in town - the Bennington Museum which had a wonderful Grandma Moses exhibit, a Revolutionary War monument (the tallest structure in VT), Bennington Potters and of course covered bridges. Totally enjoyed our short stay!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara is a gracious host with a clean, private, comfortable basement apartment below her home. Super-comfy bed, clean sheets and towels, big two-sink bathroom with fun rain shower, and absolutely gorgeous backyard. The entire street is breathtaking and within 5-10 minutes of Main Street, Bennington. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our getaway weekend to the Vermont Shires, starting with a warm greeting from our host!"

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in Barbara's apartment.

Barbara is such a kind-hearted, well-prepared, and all around caring human being. You can tell she puts up the air b&b out of the kindness of her heart. The apartment is fully furnished, including a rain shower head, full stocked bathroom and even a kitchen bigger than the one in my apartment!
This stay far exceeded my expectations.
The next time I go back up to Vermont I will plan my entire trip around Barbara’s schedule. She set my expectations of Air B&B’s as high as humanly possible."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice spot for a quiet evening in the country. It was very close to Mass MOCA and perfect for the evening after visiting the museum and taking in a concert. Lovely views of the fields behind the house. Thanks to Barbara for making check-in a breeze.

The space is so lovely and comfortable, and has everything you could possibly need (including an excellent bookshelf). All of the fixtures are modern and help to make the space perfect: dimmer switches for lights, private entrance overlooking the backyard, nice shower, and a good firm bed. It might be a basement apartment, but it feels like anything but.
The setting is beautiful and Barbara is a very kind person. You can’t go wrong here."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Searching for the perfect Airbnb for a weekend getaway? Your search ends here :)
Barbara’s apartment is spacious, comfortable, and a cozy home away from home. Conveniently located near Mass MoCA, Williamstown (Barbara recommended Pera for dinner – and it was delicious), and Mt Greylock and its neighboring community of artists and makers. Privately situated among a beautiful rolling backyard landscape. Well-stocked with amenities, all the toiletries you could ever need, snacks in the kitchen, and even a bottle of wine to welcome us home.
Barbara was the loveliest host, and we can’t thank her enough for opening up her heart and home to us. Make sure you ask about all the gorgeous prints and artwork around the apartment – Barbara is an incredibly talented printmaker, and you’ll be treated to insightful conversations with an artist who is truly a master of her craft."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You will not be disappointed with Barbara's place! I read a lot of reviews on the stars and they were beautiful. Very spacious space for a long weekend. I highly recommend staying here if you are staying in Bennington.

2018-10-01,4,Stayed about a week,I had to get used to the narrow highways which was new to me. I improved as time went by and I became familiar with the town. We enjoyed our stay and we were able to explore and learn about the history and culture of the surrounding area.

2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara and her place are unmatched in coziness and style. My boyfriend and I visited Bennington for Columbus Day weekend in search of foliage and outdoor fall fun. Barbara’s warm and clean studio was the perfect place to rest our heads after long days hiking and sightseeing. She is thoughtful in her amenities and extra touches, like coffee, extra fluffy pillows, and two bookshelves full of classic reads! And of course, nothing could beat the amazing view from two red chairs steps from our door. If you’re coming to Bennington, you HAVE to stay at Barbara’s!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Barbra's place. It is an amazing house located in a farm, which has a amazingly peaceful view. The house is well designed, and has large space in the bedroom and bathroom. The house is very clean and provided with all the daily necessities and kitchen goods. Barbra kindly offered to meet us and introduce herself but unluckily we were not there when she was available. I bet it would be a great fun to get to know more history and details about this house and Barbra herself. The decoration was not luxury, but it made us feel like a lovely comfortable home. We wish we could stay here for a longer time. This apartment is highly recommended."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and I stayed at Barbara's this weekend, and our stay was amazing! The backyard is just so beautiful and peaceful, and the space itself was very modern and clean.

The bed was so comfy and very relaxing after a couple long days. I would recommend this house to anyone looking to stay in Vermont, I wasnt able to meet Barbara but she did check on us from time to time which was very nice!

2018-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous apartment, but note there are quite loud bugs that chirp and can keep you up at night. Also, if you’re prone to bug bites, bring bug spray as my legs got eaten up by mosquitoes! Otherwise a lovely stay and the bugs were probably due to warm summer weather, but wasn’t expecting it"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful place, a kind and generous hostess.
The area is very pretty and we sat in Adirondack chairs taking in the evening breezes with a small tipple and little snack. It looks out on a bucolic landscape that is green and only disturbed by birds and bees going about their business.
The rooms were complete with a marble clad bathroom and useful kitchen stocked kindly by our hostess with fruit,snacks and coffee. A decent small fridge, two burner hot plates and and a washer and dryer complete the picture. The bed was comfortable and the room quiet. Loved it."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Best airbnb we have ever stayed at!! Incredibly clean, modern and spacious! Has all the amenities you could need and Barbara is extremely kind and helpful!

2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my boyfriend had a lovely stat at Barbara's! We counted more birds than vehicle passing by, and hoe beautiful these bird were :)
I particularly enjoyed our breakfast outside the house. Barbara left us coffee, fresh milk, bananas and granola bars. Each morning we sat outside on two long chairs, and enjoy the hill landscape while sipping coffee.
I would also say I now know what I dream for my house: a huge bathroom like Barbaras' with an open shower!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara's studio was beautiful, comfortable, and clean. Barbara included her own artwork throughout the space, which added warming touches.

2018-05-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Barbara's house is surrounded by beautiful Vermont country scenery within minutes of downtown Bennington, and a few more minutes to Williamstown MA. The studio apartment is tastefully decorated in ""simple and elegant"" style with rolling green hills to view from inside, or just outside on the provided lawn chairs. It is perfect for one person or a couple who only need a night or two in the area and are more interested in enjoying the area restaurants than making full meals in the studio's kitchen. Barbara was friendly and attentive yet respectful of our privacy. Loved her book collection!"

The studio is actually 3 rooms. It is a concrete basement so it can be chilly going from the heated bedroom to the unheated bathroom.
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I were looking for a weekend getaway in the Berkshires, and Barbara’s studio was just the ticket. Her homestead is convenient to quaint towns, like Bennington and Williamstown, as well as some of the regions highlights. We spent a couple days skiing, and her place was an easy drive to Mount Snow.
We couldn’t recommend this place enough. The studio itself is very comfortable and private; it truly feels like you have your own place. With the bedroom/living area, spacious bathroom, and the kitchenette you’ll have everything you need for proper getaway.
Barbara was very responsive, and welcoming, an excellent host. If we find ourselves in the area again, we know where to stay."
2018-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great quiet spot! Comfortable bed. Very clean and convenient . Barbara was responsive and helpful. Kitchenette was helpful and well equipped.
2018-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean and organized studio with a great, welcoming host. Very easy to get to. It was a great quiet place to unwind after the day. My wife and I loved it!"
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place! Waterfall shower, heated floors, very private...what more could you want. Not to mention you are about 5min from town yet feels like you are miles away from it all. Couldn’t have asked for more."
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time at Barbara's place in Bennington. Very close to the down town, and incredible amenities. I feel as if her space was much better than I even expected! Very clean and great taste when it comes to decor and added charm. Plus a fantastic spot to enjoy the first snow of the season."
2017-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very interesting private basement apartment. It has been well renovated to bring out the best of the space. Nice bedroom + living room area with lots of books and lighting options. Small efficient contemporary kitchen area which was kindly stocked with some fruit and granola bars and water. Large almost wet bath shower area with waterfall shower head. Space heaters were provided in addition to forced hot air but they were not needed. The entry looks over a rolling field and small farm shack to the treelike beyond. we only met Barbara briefly the morning after our stay as we came in late but she was friendly and kind. Overall very nice stay.
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara’s apartment is perfect! It’s modern and beautifully decorated, filled with hundreds of interesting books, and has a super cool shower! (You’ll understand when you see it) very nice space for a couple to stay."
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara was wonderful and accommodating, and the space is so beautiful. There were lots of thoughtful touches, like toiletries, and the location is serene."
2017-11-01,4,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay - close to nature and also close to a sweet downtown with nice restaurants and shops.
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara’s place is stunning and clean with a beautiful view any nature lover will enjoy. She was super friendly and made sure we had what we needed. It’s only a ten minute drive to Bennington and to major roads. If I️ am ever in Vermont again, I’d love to come back.
P.S The shower is great."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara's home is lovely! And Barbara was a great host- made check-in easy, was very thoughtful in stocking the studio with some snacks and toiletries and was friendly & helpful! We would definitely stay here again."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here! The apartment is spacious and private, and having a kitchen and coffee maker was wonderful. The view is beautiful and it was very quiet. Being only 2 miles out of town was perfect. Would definitely recommend Barbara's place!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barbara's apartment was an ideal location for our trip to see Vermont's fall color. The bed was super comfortable and bathroom well stocked and extremely clean. The kitchen had all the basics you need to cook a simple meal and was stocked with coffee and a few snacks. Her home was very peaceful and had a great view and is just a short drive into town to shops and restaurants. We certainly would stay here again if we ever get back to the area.
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,An idyllic setting with great views in front and behind the house. The accommodation was excellent and our stay could not have been better.
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little place! We spent a night, and it was the perfect spot. Great quality, especially for the price. Very welcoming host. The surrounding landscape was pretty fantastic."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at Barbara's place. We only visited for a night, but it was just what we needed after the craziness of a wedding and several hours on the road. Comfy bed, cozy, quiet, beautiful location, and all the amenities we could ask for and then some. My wife and I were also surprised that the place was so big. It definitely allows you to spread your feet a bit.
The shower is trendy and unique, but it does make a bit of a mess. I also wish there was more counter space in the bathroom for our toiletries and a full length mirror for getting ready.
Communication with Barbara was fantastic. She was always prompt and friendly both in text and in person. On our way out I believe I nicked part of the drywall, but Barbara was totally understanding. Great host!
We'll definitely stay here again if we're ever in Bennington again. No question."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really nice modern place. Great country setting. Probably the nicest, cleanest place we stayed during our two week trip."
2017-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved Barbara her place. She even left breakfast out for us. The view for stargazing and coffee/breakfast was amazing. We also loved the shower! Thanks Barbara. Highly recommend.
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the pleasure of staying at Barbara’s home this past weekend. She is amazing and the place was awesome! So clean I think we could have actually eaten off the floor! The bed was super comfortable and she had available to us most of what we needed. The area is a little outside of town so if you don’t want the true country experience than maybe it’s not for you. There is no TV but she does offer internet which was great. We absolutely loved it and the wild turkeys outside our front door during our stay were so cool. One of the best traveling experiences we have had and we have been all over the US on our HARLEY! A great big high five from us!
2017-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is very nice-sized private space for two, with a modern-art feel in a pleasant setting, close to Bennington. We were there for 3 days to visit Williamstown and North Adams, which were easy to get to. We met Barbara briefly when we arrived. She was very welcoming, gave us a brief tour of the studio, and directed us to Bennington so we could have some dinner.
The studio has a spacious bedroom with a comfortable couch and a really excellent bed. There's a closet for hanging clothes, but there's no dresser or table for storage.
The bathroom is large with two sinks and lots of space to store toiletries. It includes a beautifully architected open shower (although that does require that you squeegee the floor after using it)
There is a small kitchen with the essentials -- sink, small fridge, microwave & coffee maker. There's also a small cooktop, although we didn't use it. Barbara provided some water, snacks and fruit as well, which we appreciated.
It is a converted basement, which you can feel, although the renovation goes a long way towards ameliorating that. Summer humidity can always be a problem in basement living spaces, but that was well addressed by a large dehumidifier, which we did need to occasionally empty, and which is a bit noisy, through not intrusively so.
Overall it fit our needs well -- it was a peaceful place to come back to at night, and get a good night's sleep."
2017-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place in a beautiful location. The communication with Barbara was excellent. The bed was comfortable. The large bathroom was wonderful. She even provided some snacks in the kitchen. I will definitely be returning.
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay right outside of the main drag. Clean, comfortable and accommodating! Would recommend and stay again ourselves."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful space! Beautiful view!
I can't wait to stay at Barbara's again."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet, cozy, private, relaxing stay. Great Vermont experience!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the view near Barbara's place and found the interior decorating and accommodations beautifully satisfying.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Barbara's place was exactly how pictured. We truly enjoyed our stay. Went to Mass Moca for the day which was an easy commute. Overall 5 out of 5. Would stay there again 100 percent
2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The BEST airbnb experience I have ever had. Barbara made me very comfortable and provided the perfect place for one of the most relaxing weekends ever. Adorable (and very clean!) place with a gorgeous view. Short drive to North Adams (visited MassMoCA and The Cascades). If you are looking for a quiet country getaway, this is the place!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay in Barbara's clean, comfortable, spacious, well appointed apartment. The acerage is beautiful and peaceful, very close to Bennington. Communication with Barbara was easy. We will definitely stay again."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This lovely stay was clean, fresh and cool on a warm summer evening. Barbara's place has many nice touches, from high quality bedding to a pleasing mix of colors to a bookshelf of eclectic reading. A highlight for sure is the view over trees and hills while sipping a morning beverage, or the sunset with a glass of wine."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,It is a great place in a quite senic part of Bennigton for a couple.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Wow! Just fantastic!
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barbara's studio was perfect for a weekend out of the city. She couldn't have been a better host. Will definitely try to stay again.
2017-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a basement apt with outside access, very clean but lacks some ammenities."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara gave us clear instructions prior to our arrival and offered flexible check in/out times, which was a life saver in our case. The studio apartment is a spacious suite for two people with a charming modern design -- complete with fresh flowers. The studio is accessible from an entrance at the back of the house, which gives guests total privacy and adds convenience for those who want to do some late night stargazing. The location is a short driving distance (less than ten minutes) into town which has restaurants/bars and a gas station. Plenty is to be enjoyed without leaving the Airbnb though, especially the sunset view from the backyard."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As the morning sun peeks from behind the clouds you can hear horses nickering in the distance. Two bright yellow Adirondack chairs wait invitingly to share a spectacular view of hills and meadows out behind the beautiful home. Inside, surprises are aplenty; a modern, luxurious shower to sooth muscles tight from a long drive to a comfortable living room with an eclectic library to delight the mind. There is a perfect kitchen with microwave, coffee maker and small cooktop, just right to heat your soup for an evening of stargazing. Barbara is bright and cheerful, making us feel at ease and welcome to her home. We recommend this destination for a cosy getaway for two to rejuvinate your senses and fill your hearts with pure Vermont charm."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, perfect spot for a quiet stay. Modern apt with a gorgeous view of green hills and trees. Barbara was a wonderful host- she was very helpful and flexible yet not at all intrusive. Town is a short drive away, with some cute stores and restaurants. Perfect for a weekend getaway."
2017-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"Barbara's rental was in a great location for my visit to southern VT. She was there to greet me upon arrival and gave me the tour of the studio apartment, which was very sleek, modern and clean. It's not mentioned in the listing, but this is a basement apartment. I would not describe it as ""cozy"" (as other reviews do) but it was a comfortable, quiet place for the night. The radiant floor heat is a bonus and the view is as lovely as the photo suggests."
2017-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara's studio was exactly as advertised. It was very warm and inviting, and Barbara was very welcoming! We ended up arriving about 30 minutes later than expected but she didn't have any issue with that! It was very relaxing, and I would definitely stay again!"
2017-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great space with a great host. You will love the location and the studio. Everything was very clean and comfortable. Very friendly and communicative host. I would definitely come back.
2017-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice studio. Barbara was very nice and welcoming.
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We used Barbara's studio as a base for hiking on Glastenbury Mountain, just 15 minutes away. The apartment was beautiful, clean, spacious and quiet. Barbara was a very welcoming and helpful host. We had a wonderful stay and would happily stay here again."
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara's apartment is clean, cozy, and stylish! My boyfriend and I enjoyed our escape from city life on Barbara's beautiful property. Barbara is so kind and anticipated our every need. We would absolutely recommend this apartment and will definitely be back!"
2017-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Barbara was very friendly and had lots of information to share with us about the area. Her place was clean and felt very cozy. We had a great time. Would definitely recommend!
2017-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Barbara was a great host! The place is a lot bigger and nicer than it looks. Recommend to all!
2017-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara was super-host for graciously welcoming us to her home late in the night. She offered suggestions for a late-night dinner and directions through town. Her home is newly renovated, clean and comfy in a very peaceful location just a few miles outside of Bennington. Barbara was available if we needed anything, yet considerate of not intruding. We had everything we needed and would gladly visit again."
2017-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was planning a snowboard trip in Vermont and needed a place to sleep for one night only. I'm very happy that I found Barbara's place. It's located in a beautiful quite road near Bennington, also not so far from Mountain Snow (where we went in the next day). If you stay with Barbara you will have your own studio (with kitchen and bathroom) at a very fair price, which includes lot of amenities and privacy. Whether you are planning a ski/snowboard trip in Vermont or just a city escape, this is definitely a very great choice for you! Barbara is a wonderful lady who will receive you very well and make you feel like home.
Highly recommended! I'll definitely come back if I plan another trip in that area again."
