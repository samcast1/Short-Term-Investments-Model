The house itself surely was stunning in its time. It had so much space for everyone to spread out and the front porch was enjoyable. Additionally the beds were in good shape and very comfortable.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,the super chief box car was our favorite place to stay out of 3 stops kn our trip. the 20 minute drive to the canyon was great and its not far from a convience store if you need quick stuff. the boxcar has been remodelled in a very tasteful way. we appreciated some of the original componets that they left with the touches of modernism. the fenced front porch area was great to let the dogs out however there is no grass in the fenced area so you will still need to walk them outside the little patio yard. it was quiet and peaceful and had great views to west and sunsets. we would love to come stay again if we are ever that way.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I've managed planning and construction for over 50 years of everything from multi family to research labs and courthouses and seen it all.
This is one of my favorite spots where I wouldn't change a thing."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Chief is a perfect little sojourn away from the busy of life. It’s decorated very cute, extremely clean and has all the amenities you might desire. I have a new fave spot to stopover on my drives to Taos!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I cannot say enough about how awesome this place is! It is so unique! The setting is amazing with the animals and the sunset and the stars! Becky was an amazing host and was so fun to talk to! My kids absolutely loved the newborn colt, feeding the donkeys, and playing with the dogs. My 7yo can’t stop talking about sweet Lucy! We can’t wait to come back! We rented both the Super Chief and the El Capitan and it worked great for our party of 6. 500 STARS FOR A GREAT STAY!! Thank you Becky!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super Chief was AMAZING!! If you are thinking about staying here absolutely do it! Becky is the perfect host who thought of every detail! The amenities were top notch and it had everything we needed! We watched the sun set every night and enjoyed the grill and patio.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Super Chief Boxcar was just perfection! Quiet, clean, and wonderfully decorated. The serenity and scenery of this place go hand and hand. If you’re looking for a quiet little country get away, this is the spot!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was incredible. Felt right at home. Was such a fun and unique place to stay. Becky was fantastic and helpful. The privacy was great. Patio with Adirondack chairs was awesome. Also the fenced in patio was very dog friendly. We could sit out and enjoy the evening without worrying about our dog wandering off. Loved everything about our stay and would definitely return here again. My hubby was doubtful about what I booked but he really loved the Super Chief.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome! Warm and cozy! Becky is an excellent hostess. The box car had beautiful finishes inside and out. Quiet setting.

Very clean home and eco friendly toiletries in case you forgot yours. I have recommended to my family and friends that my at be traveling to Canyon/Amarillo area.
Thank you Becky for sharing your beautiful SCBC."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for 5 nights, 4 days - AWESOME The railcar/cabin is EXACTLY as pictured. On the edge of a ranch expanse--- uninterrupted prairie views to admire. Earth and sky---and the occasional mare and foal if you're lucky. Husband was skeptical about the cabin climate (insulated?, etc....) stayed perfectly cool entire time and when cold- faux fireplace not only warmed it perfectly, but added ambiance. Just chilled in front of an LED fireplace and looked out the beautiful picture window with a hot cup of tea.
Perfectly situated between THE canyon and Canyon or even Amarillo. Breakfast each morning in town-- either at Buff's or Ranch House--- hiked the canyon and spent the evening eating dinner in Amarillo. (Husband's favorite was Big Texan so that was the spot) But the locale of the cabin made everything very driver friendly.
Becky our host was super responsive, but otherwise stayed gone. Perfect.
Clean, beautiful, relaxing-can't recommend enough and hope to return ASAP!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a very nice place to get away for the weekend. It was a nice quiet country setting.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Becky was an amazing host, one of the best we’ve encountered on Airbnb. She was super attentive and made sure every detail was perfect.
The box car, “The Super Chief,” was spotless and so unique! It was a last-minute booking during our Colorado road trip, but we’re already planning to come back!
It’s just a short distance to Palo Duro Canyon, which was a fantastic day trip option during our stay. We loved sitting on the patio, stargazing by the fire pit and heater. Such a cozy and memorable stay!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super is the perfect word to describe the Super Chief! The space is very smartly laid out and appointed, with perfect touches throughout, from the handwritten welcome note to the basket of snacks to the high-end bath products and sumptuous towels. We had a great three day stay while we were exploring Palo Duro Canyon and surrounding areas. The Super Chief was a great spot - we wanted for nothing!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Unique lodging in peaceful location with lots to do nearby. Patio was wonderful to just to sit and relax and watch the horses in surrounding pastures and inside was full of thoughtful amenities. You can see the stars from the skylights in bedroom and living room - what an amazing treat!! Highly recommend!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Must stay. Amazing place. Becky is cool as heck
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is such a magical space! Comfortable, cozy, and cute - and has everything you’d ever need to enjoy your stay. Loved it so much that I’ve already started recommending to friends."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can you ask for a better host, location and place to stay? Becky is an incredible host who is quick to respond when you have a question and will take the time to make the place feel like home. A skip from Amarillo and a stone’s throw away from Palo Duro Canyon, Super Chief is the perfect place to stay while you visit northern Texas. I recommend anyone stay here if they can!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I work out of town each week. This weekend instead of driving home my husband joined me and we rented this cute, amazing, creative, unusual AirBNB for the weekend.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at the Boxcar casita! The interior and decor was so fun and perfect theme for a Texas road trip or vacation! We arrived on a cold and windy night but the inside was super comfy, clean, and warm. We used the pull out sofa and I was so thankful that it was already made up with clean sheets and very comfortable. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful and unique stay! The Super Chief boxcar was beautifully decorated, incredibly comfortable, and provided everything we needed.

The unique experience of sleeping in a converted train car was absolutely charming and exceeded all expectations. The cozy interior was thoughtfully designed and provided all the comforts we needed after a day of hiking. The location couldn't have been better, with quick access to the park, Canyon as well as Amarillo. Our dog had a blast exploring the area with us, and we appreciated the pet-friendly amenities. Our hosts were incredibly accommodating and made sure our stay was perfect. We highly recommend this one-of-a-kind Airbnb to anyone looking for a memorable adventure in Palo Duro Canyon. We can't wait to come back!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you have never stayed in a rail car this is the one to stay in. Very well put together and homey. It is a small space but has a much bigger feel to it. There is a fenced courtyard next to the rail car to use for pets.
The views from the giant picture window are great. I watched some storms roll in one evening. Becky’s place also has a pretty big and clean patio area. Perfect spot to tuck away from the wind."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Gosh we were so blessed to have this place for the night. Stunning sunset and beautiful sunrise. I missed that the check out is at 10am but Becky was very understanding about our late departure. Our dogs were happy and met the big white dog, I was proud of Quill and how she went to introduce herself so kindly! The special touches to make us feel at home worked! We didn't want to leave.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Becky met us with local coffee, and was so friendly from the moment we got there. Super Chief was clean and quaint, very beautifully decorated, and exactly what we pictured from the pictures. My boys loved playing football in the yard, and playing with dog. We loved watching the sunset from the patio. We loved everything about staying here! Becky was so responsive and sweet when I had a question or messaged her. We would 100% stay again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed here with my husband and mini aussie when we came to town to hike in Palo Duro Canyon. The boxcar was so cute and such a unique find and it was perfect for what we needed. We love being able to hangout on the patio and watch the sun rise/set everyday and it was only a 15 min drive to Palo Duro. We chose to bring a griddle to cook on inside but they have a blackstone you could use outside. If you’re not wanting to cook though, there are plenty of restaurants within 10 min. There’s also a Walmart nearby if you’re needing anything big/food, but Becky was so great and provided a little bin of snacks and another in the bathroom with things you might need like sunscreen, bandaids, etc. which was so thoughtful. I highly recommend this to anyone stopping through or wanting somewhere t stay when going hiking!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay great place, will return! 100 Stars!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Becky's Super Chief was a unique stay with a well thought out layout of the box car. We loved the open window in the living area and the sky lights on both ends to view the sky and moon. The bed and furniture was comfy. There so many treats and amenities that it felt like home away from home. the private patio was additionally beautiful and spacious. The land was really beautiful during sunrise and sunset. if you're lucky, the full moon rise and set was equally beautiful. Must stay if you're in Canyon/Amarillo. This box car was such a treat!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Becky was a great host! She was even kind enough to let us extend our check out time on short notice which really helped us maximize our time for our quick trip. The location was perfect for exploring Palo Duro- only a 20 minute drive. We enjoyed being able to bring our two dogs with us and had plenty of space inside the box car and room for them to roam around outside too. We would definitely recommend staying here!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the last spot for our honeymoon. Super cute, very clean. We enjoyed the quiet of the country and the skylights above the bed. She even left Queen on the tv for us and a couple of cupcakes with a sweet note. Thank you for the lovely time, we will keep you in mind for our travels ❤️"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We chose Becky’s place last minute, and it did not disappoint.
It was beautiful, the decor is well thought out, it’s right up our alley. It was also close to Canyon, Amarillo, and Palo Duro Canyon. Becky asked what artist was our favorite (Cory Asbury) and had him playing when we walked in. I loved that! Lucy her dog is a sweet baby if you run into her. We enjoyed the sunset and fire pit at night, and the coffee Becky left us in the morning."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great experience. The place is so beautiful and modern. We had a restful get away with all we need in the Airbnb. We also got to tour around town and go for a hike. Great location!! Becky was always very attentive and communicative.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a fun experience! Even more amazing than the photos. Lots of fun things to do nearby. We had a great time. We plan to come back. Best Airbnb experience we have had so far.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"BETTER than the photos! When we first walked Super Chief felt like a comfortable hug! Rustic, yet high end and classy. The whole experience was awesome…the finishes, the linens, the big fenced patio, the black stone grill, the picture window in the living room framing the pasture and sky perfectly, stargazing through the skylights over the bed….I could go on and on! Becky has literally thought of everything!! This boxcar has set the bar for all other “tiny homes”!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really thought the place was cozy inside and nicely furnished. We enjoyed the tranquility. Very much worth the stay since its super close to Palo Duro state park. Becky is an amazing Host and very quick on response.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Do not hesitate to book Becky’s place - it is so wonderful!!!
We were traveling and did not plan to stop here but the highway closed due to a storm and Becky was so incredibly helpful to get us setup here last minute. Truly nothing more you could ask for in terms of a hostess.
The place is incredible! It is such a perfect use of space - the design is excellent, incredibly clean, and beyond comfortable.
We are also traveling with our dog who could not get enough of the land, the closed in deck, seeing the horses, and the views out the big window . Her sweet farm dog, Lucy, also came by to check on us in the morning.
Even in a crazy storm, Becky’s place was incredibly inviting and comfortable. We will without a doubt stay here again when traveling through the panhandle :)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Do not pass up the chance to stay here. We wish we would have time to stay longer. Becky is the perfect host, the place is peaceful, the amenities are wonderful. The outside is a great as the inside, it snowed while we are there so we enjoyed the cozy inside. Becky recommended the museum in town, well worth the time. Great location to visit the canyon."

Would highly recommend.
Also check in and out was extremely easy and Becky was a proactive communicator."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A must stay if looking for a place in Amarillo or Canyon! The Super Chief Boxcar is full of well-thought out details, top notch finishing touches, and offers great space, both indoors and outdoors.
You will be treated to a unique Sunrise each morning, that will be sure to set the mood for the great day ahead! At evening time, an equally unique Sunset to the West, which you can enjoy from the Adirondack chairs on the porch, or right from the cozy living room!
Your sleep will be blissful as you drift off, Stargazing up through the skylights in the super-comfy bedroom. Or, if you are lucky like we were, bask under the beams of a Full Moon throughout your peaceful slumber.
We pass through Canyon often, and look forward to our next stay in the Super Chief Boxcar! Thank you, Becky, for being a gracious and accommodating host, your property is beautiful!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Becky is an awesome host, very friendly, helpful, and quick to respond. The super chief was the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at.

There is a tv in each bdrm as well as living rm. The beds were super comfortable and we slept amazingly for the 5 nights we stayed.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had the best stay at Theresa's unique place.

The outdoor space was stunning and the beds were very comfortable. Definitely recommend staying here. Everything is 5-10 mins for good food and fun.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful care free time! We have friends who rent as well and they told us that they prefer their clients let them know of any details to help them evaluate the cleaning staff or performance of the appliances. We found a few dirty pans that may have been the result of previous quests not rinsing dishes well enough prior to putting them in the dishwasher or the house cleaners not catching them when they unloaded the dishwasher. The kitchen had ample tools to prepare food, pots, pans, dishes, knives etc… but needs a can opener. There were a few areas of wear that is normal, but didn’t take away from the comfort and fun we had! Great house, we’d love to visit again, thank you for providing a wonderful stay away from home!"

2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I really enjoyed this place. But there were a few things that didn’t mean our expectations. We couldn’t get most of the TV’s to work. (Only the one in the master bedroom worked). The pool had a bunch of floating stuff from their plants that are near the pool. We had scooped them out as we swam.
We also didn’t like that we had to pay $400 extra dollars on top of what we had already paid bc we had day visitors. I can understand if it was refundable, but it wasn’t. We cleaned up and did everything expected of us. Other than that, it was an amazing get away💖 and I recommend your family staying🥰"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with outdoor amenities comfortably built inside that makes you feel you’re outside of Amarillo. Clean looking and big but quaint feeling. Lovely

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house is gorgeous and the pool area is phenomenal. We really enjoyed the space and will absolutely book again if we are in the area.

The decor…another WOW! It was perfect. Staged for arrival all the way down to music playing! I will definitely be back!! 💙💙"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The only issue we had was the extra bedroom we downstairs if the poolroom was to hot to stay in and sleep in due to it’s location in the pool room which had to stay at 80+ degrees. We had a minor issue with a toilet backup in the pool room that eventually leaked down into the extra bedroom. But we notified the host and she was quick to respond and asked us if she needed to send anyone which was great but we took care of the toilet issue so no worries. Other than that the house had an amazing layout and we all had a great time.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,loved everything. user friendly
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fun place to stay! Loved it!
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful air B&B. Highly recommended location when visiting Amarillo.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"An amazing place to stay in Amarillo. We booked last minute as a place to stay and gather with local family for a funeral service, and it was perfect. The beds are very comfortable, there were so many towels, and everything we needed was stocked in the kitchen. The pool was perfect entertainment on a cold January day for my niece and nephew, and we had a family video about our grandmother who had passed up on the projector screen when we shared pictures and told stories after the services. It was really an amazing spot.
The house manual is incredibly detailed, which isn’t easy with multiple tv/projector/sound systems, and we were able to work all of the tvs and speakers. Checkout instructions are clear and easy. Checkin was a ring code setup just for me.
One of the king bedrooms is very warm because it is in the spa deck, but Paige was sure to tell us this before we booked and everything was exactly as described. Would book again 10/10z"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect for a little staycation. Sometimes it’s hard to get away but also just need some time out of our home spending quality time together with nothing to worry about. This home was that for us. Clean, spacious, relaxing, calming, and didn’t even feel like we were near home. The set up was perfect and we appreciated the little details. The mineral spa room made it feel like we were on a tropical vacation and was a total boost for our souls during the winter stuck inside due to the cold."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was absolutely amazing and looks straight out of a magazine. Has 70’s and country vibe with a phenomenal pools. There’s plenty of room and games for entertainment. We spent most of our trip in the back room (hot tub& pool room)where it was warm and set different temperature from the house which made it perfect. I’d definitely be returning next time I’m in town.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Stayed over the Christmas and New Year’s holiday. Perfect for the kids and relaxing for the adults. Looking forward to staying there next year!

The indoor pool and hot tub were really nice to have access to, kids loved it. All the tvs and projector in the pool room was great for watching movies from the hot tub and pool. Beds were super comfortable and linens were nice. Host was super responsive and friendly. Liked it so much, we will be coming back next year. Would recommend to anyone!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cool place
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved the presence of God in this home. When you arrive they have music playing and the house well lit. The home is amazing. The pool was a hit for our family and guests. Only thing I can suggest is a information folder for the speakers and projector. We could get the projector on but could not figure out the audio for it. Other than that it was amazing. One of my favorite things is reading the guest books!! Thank you!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,where we stayed at was absolutely gorgeous and had absolutely everything we needed plus more. the kids had an amazing time with the pool. thank you for hosting us! we will definitely be back!

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,50th celebration bringing family together with plenty of room. We had the best time most memorable event and the place was amazing. Loved every minute we got to spend at this beautiful amazing place. Adorable..............blessed to have found this hidden gem in Amarillo.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was very welcoming and comfortable! The neighborhood is nice, and Paige was great!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely beautiful home centrally located. Exactly as advertised. Very peaceful, fun environment."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we were a group.of ladies from church who needed a little retreat and this was the perfect oasis. We have now found our forever get away place!!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had an amazing time at this PERFECT little slice of heaven. We absolutely loved everything about this house and the hosts. We spent most of the evening in the pool/hot tub area. We had a little trouble getting a movie setup on the projection screen, but Darrin was exceptional at helping us out in a very quick and friendly manner. Enjoyed talking to him. The living room, bathrooms, kitchen, bedrooms, and everything else was perfect and spotless. Without hesitation, we would come back and stay here in a heart beat. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love it. Very comfortable. Very clean. Highly recommended!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a very nice time at this home. The kitchen was well-stocked, and we found some unexpected delights from vintage records to games. The spa area was fantastic. The pool is perfect for relaxing and not too deep for kids to swim in. Watching a movie while floating in the pool has altered our idea of movie night forever. :-) We had a few questions regarding the spa area, and the property managers and owners were very quick to respond and help us. The bedding was very nice. As an FYI, the bed in the owners' suite is firm. The beds in the other two bedrooms are softer. There is a good assortment of comfy pillows. We didn't use the basement bedroom, so I can't speak to that one. Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay in a very lovely home!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"First, this place is simply gorgeous. The owners did not leave out even one detail. It was nice arriving to home and having the music playing throughout. It was so welcoming. The beds and amenities were the best that we had encountered at an AirBnB. They thought of literally everything. My only call out for future guests would be to make sure those in your party know the rules and that you keep the doors closed in the spa. When I told my family that spa needed to stay at a certain temp, they just thought not to touch the thermostat but never thought about doors being left open. Even so, the host and manager were kind. I was freaking out that it changed and they were very kind.
Paige, the manager, was so responsive and actually called us before we got there to check in. The owners responded to our questions and even left a little gift for us. Beautiful home & great hosts. Thank you for making our family weekend special."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Best upscale family friendly home! Boho-Texas decor with a lot of living space and an indoor pool with outdoor feel. We stayed 3 days to tour Palo Duro, Cadillac Ranch, local museums and old town Route 66. The place is convenient to everything and it was an amazing retreat to come home to nightly. The kids really enjoyed the spacious pool and ability to watch TV and movies on the big screen while swimming!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pictures don’t do it justice. This home is absolutely stunning! Beds are very comfortable. There were even air mattresses available for when the kids wanted to camp out and watch movies in the living room together. Kitchen was well stocked. Very clean!
It’s located close to lots of amenities & shopping, too."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you are in Amarillo... this is the only place I'd recommend staying! This property was absolutely lovely, and the hosts were beyond helpful and accommodating. They truly created an experience within their home that made our time feel like we were in a spa resort. We loved our entire stay, and I'd highly recommend this stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,We can’t wait to come back to this home. It was wonderful.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was so nice and peaceful. My aunt and uncle stayed there. She's been sick, so the place was so peaceful and comfortable. I had to talk to Paige several times to ask some questions. She was always so nice and helpful."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We were in Amarillo for my father in law’s memorial. This home offered such a great place to connect with family. Thank you so much!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing house. Perfect relaxing getaway for our Spring Break.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Their place was perfect and amazing for our family! We loved the spa room and felt so welcomed! We would have loved to have been able to stay longer. The only thing we wished to have been better mindful of, was the basement bedroom, which is in the spa room so was too hot for anyone to sleep in. Otherwise, this was such a gem to find! Will definitely stay again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home is beautiful. Slept 2 couples and 4 kids ages 9-17 very well. This is a perfect escape to meet with family and have a peaceful visit while enjoying a beautiful pool with privacy. We would love to visit here again should the chance arise in the future.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is just an amazing house and so thoughtfully put together— a welcome retreat from the hustle of life. The mineral spa is the perfect place to relax after a hike in Palo Duro Canyon, and the beds are super comfortable. Besides hearing an occasional car it’s easy to forget you’re in a city! We were worried about our kids wandering into the pool room when we weren’t looking, but we brought doorknob child locks which worked great to keep them out. Can’t wait to come back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful. We absolutely loved the spa house, and spent most of the time there. There was a day that was too cold to go out and we had a great day playing board games, swimming in the pool, and relaxing in the hot tub. Everyone was sad to be leaving at the end of our stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,I can’t say enough good things about our stay at Paige’s Airbnb. My friends and I all get together once a year for a boys trip and we decided to try our hand in Palo Duro Canyon this time. We had an absolute and we hope to be back soon!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful, one of a kind, home. The host is professional & very hospitable. Our entire experience was top-notch!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was an absolutely lovely home, accentuated by exquisite decor and subtle surprises such as small tags on most cabinets and drawers for easy location of anything and everything one might need. We had a most enjoyable and peaceful time at this property, and greatly look forward to our next return. The kindness and hospitality as delivered by Paige and Jennie made us feel right at home! Thank you!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a very beautiful and peaceful home. It will not disappoint.
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay! Great host!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was so peaceful and amazing! Our family had the most comfortable retreat for Mom's 50th! If I ever had a reason to be in Amarillo, TX again, this is place I'd be at. The pool and hot tub was a great amenity and all of the signage and instructions left for us made it really easy to get around and get along with the entire home. Truly a healing environment from the second you walk in. We catered in Rosa's, had a cake made by The Ruffled Cup, and hired Amazing Hands By Monica Venske to come to the house and give massages to all of us. I just can't say enough how incredibly necessary it is to disconnect and have downtime. This house made it all possible. The showers are so upscale and huge. The kitchen was big with lots of counter space. The smell when you arrive and the oils and diffusers available to keep that spa environment alive. The gifts and fruit basket. The fridge by the pool. All of it contributed to the convenience and comfort. I loved this experience and so did Mom!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family spend the Holiday's at the house and it worked great. The pool and hot tub were a major favorite! The furnishings and supplies totally covered our needs
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely love staying at this indoor oasis with my family!! The pools and projector were amazing!! The house was beautifully decorated, and there were plenty of great restaurants nearby! We had a great stay, and would definitely come back soon!! Loved the personalized touch of the cute gift when we arrived and snacks and fridge full of yummy drinks! These hosts definitely know how to spoil!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is amazing - the spa room was heavenly and being close to Palo Duro Canyon was a nice plus. Highly recommend staying here!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely beautiful place! We had so much fun enjoying the mineral pool and hot tub! The hosts went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. We can not wait to book our next trip to Amarillo!!! ♥️♥️♥️
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend if you’re staying in the area. The indoor pool and area is huge, jacuzzi was perfect after running around all day plus a huge projector screen while we relaxed in the pool/jacuzzi, tons of cozy spots and corners to read a book, catch up on emails, etc. Large kitchen with a unique subzero fridge and multiple eating areas. Lots of towels and general bathroom amenities. Fireplaces, essential oils, awesome coffee maker, all the kitchen utensils you need, comfy beds and pillows, great water pressure, super private and inviting!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The lofts are so cool. This was plenty of space for our group of 4, and enjoyed sitting on the patio watching the stars at night. Had supplies for cooking, and conditioner in the shower. We would stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for the great place to stay. My elderly parents and I loved the location and privacy. Linens were clean. Instructions were clear. Host was polite and accommodating. We did not use the upstairs loft beds, but I did climb up to take a look. If you have a family and don't mind climbing a ladder, this would be great. We came for graduation at SFISD. Perfect for what we needed and close to our family."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I love the simplicity of the cabin. Everything was very clean. A nice place to get away if you want peace and quiet.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay, would recommend it to family/friends"
2024-05-01,4.0,Group trip,The place was clean and looked just like the photos. they are pretty small and I would recommend bringing a camp table to use outside.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jerod’s little cabin was just what we needed for our weekend. Luckily I was with my two teenage boys, so they had no problem climbing up to the lofts! The whole place is clean and newly remodeled; ever felt fresh and new. Kitchen and bathroom had what we needed and beds were comfy with cool, smooth linens. The cabin is right off the highway (20 paces!), but traffic wasn’t too bad and only occasionally did we hear a loud vehicle drive by. Front porch was nice to sit on in the sunshine, but the view is an empty field - I though we’d be closer to the lake. My bad for not studying the map better. Overall we were comfy and enjoyed our stay! Lake Meredith is beautiful - a hidden gem!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for 3 nights while fishing at Lake Meredith. Perfect location for us. Place was very clean, and had plenty of parking for our boat. We will be back for sure!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Definitely worth the stay. Felt right at home. This was my first time doing the airBnb and I would highly recommend it. It was a pleasure to stay here, Jerod and Corina are excellent host. Definitely will be returning, and I love that they offer extended stays."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cool little place. As tiny as it looked from the outside, it was more spacious than we expected. Perfect for my work associate and I. Beds were comfy. Location was remote which I prefer quite a bit. We saw a few great sunsets during our stay. I would recommend this place to any and all."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Stayed in cabin 54. It is comfortable and fit all three of us well. I recommend it if you’re in town.
Just wish the fish were biting at the marina rn."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was spotless and bright. Heater kept us plenty warm. They definitely didn’t cheap out on the beds, super comfortable firm memory foam. They had snacks in the fridge for our arrival.
The parking was a little muddy, not an issue, just something to keep in mind if it’s raining. They had a mop and broom next to the fridge to help keep things clean though. Hot water didn’t last too long, but held just long enough for 3 guys to shower back to back.
Close to Fritch and Borger, also a 5-10 minute drive to the boat ramps. Definitely a worthy place to get out of the cold and rain after being out on the water all day."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was perfect for us. Warm and cozy. Quiet and peaceful. Jerod was great
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Jared was an awesome host! His place was very welcoming and immaculate. Make sure to read his directions on the Air B&B site. iPhone maps may lead you astray.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was fortunate to stay here for the 4th of July weekend with a three other friends of mine. We found finding the home very easy and Jerod had great recommendations for the local area. He was very quick to respond to any questions we had and super friendly. The home itself is wonderful. If you have a small group, this is easily the place to be. You could definitely do a larger group as well. The place was spotless and the AC cranked for those hot Texas summers. We found the furnishings comfortable and it was a great spot for us to relax and unwind at the end of the day. We interacted with both groups of neighbors while there and had a fantastic time. If you want to visit Amarillo, hike in Palo Duro, or enjoy a lake day; this is the place to be. Get out of the city and check this home out, you won't regret it. The only question you'll be asking after your stay is how much would it cost to build this place yourself."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jerod was very quick in replying to me. His cabin was very clean, very nice, and looked just like the pictures. He provided towels, shampoo & conditioner, a bbq pit & chairs, etc. Highly recommend this cabin!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I’ve been staying in Dumas on and off the last few months and this has been by far my favorite Airbnb yet. It actually feels like home. Great kitchen, living room, bedrooms bathrooms. Dishwasher and laundry, the works! With a very peaceful backyard. The one issue that came up was the TV in the main room had a problem with the color. It wasn’t a huge deal as we were there for work, but the hosts made sure to replace it as soon as possible when I mentioned it. I was really appreciative of that. They did replace the tv with a much smaller tv, but every room in the house is set up with Roku tv’s. Really wonderful stay. Looking forward to booking with them again."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kalah’s place was a perfect stay for my family while in town for my grandmother- in Law’s 100th Birthday celebration. It accommodated my husband, twin boys, my sister-in law, and our two dogs wonderfully. The backyard was big for my son’s to have a snowball fight & my dogs to run around in. One thing I look for when renting on AirBNB is a comfy couch. The sectional did not disappoint. The location was 5 min from where we needed to be and loved that it was close to a park if we had an opportunity to play there. We will definitely stay at Kalah’s place again when visiting our Granny!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were traveling and enjoyed our stay. the place was homey and welcoming. Enjoyed the snacks that was provided.

Also the water in the shower is backwards i took a cold shower the first day for no reason found out later that the water is hooked up backwards cold is hot and hot is cold
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect place for our family gathering! The lodge was just big enough for us. It was great that each bedroom had its own private bathroom and the whole house was just cozy and clean and lovely and had everything we needed. The stove in the kitchen was really neat and it was perfect for cooking for our large group. We all enjoyed the pond to go for a swim and fishing and paddle boating. We explored the trails around the property and ate breakfast outside on the back patio overlooking the pond each morning. We had a lovely weekend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for 4 nights and rented the Lodge for our party of 11.
Rebecca was proactive and kind throughout the stay. Even when weather was near, she text us to be sure we knew to get the kiddos inside! She was always around if we had a question or if we needed assistance with something. We also loved her pups!
The Lodge was fantastic- super clean, private space for bedrooms and bathrooms but enough gathering space for us to all hangout together! Kitchen was amazing!! A cooks dream.
Grounds were super nice and well maintained. If I had one improvement request- I would say that the boats and fishing pond needed some upkeep. The deck was a bit under water- but I do know that they had a lot of rain recently- so I understand why.
Overall, we were very happy with our visit and would come back another time for sure!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was so nice. We did get a little lost getting there using the address provided but if you put in the name three falls cove in the maps it found it. There isn’t a washer or dryer because it is usually used as a bed and breakfast but the rooms were very nice and each room had its own bathroom. There are a couple other cabins on the property that other guests were staying at but we didn’t really notice them. I would recommend this place for family gatherings.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was such a beautiful place and perfect in every way! Our family made many special memories here.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Rebecca and her family were awesome and went above and beyond to make our stay memorable!

2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay at the Three Falls Cove. Had a heart warming family reunion. The surrounding was peaceful and picturesque. Took walks around the cove to the falls with many pictures taken. Watched the roadrunners and enjoyed the surrounding porch. The open space in the great room allowed everyone to gather together and reminisce and meet new family members. As well as plenty of seating to gather for meals. We especially appreciate the wheelchair access for our elderly.
Rebecca was available without being intrusive providing information of the surroundings as well as her fellowship. She made us cookies on arrival and feltKaren as if part of our group. I would recommend her beautiful lodge to anyone needing a comfortable place to gather with friends and family.
Thank you Rebecca for allowing us a wonderful place to be with our loved ones.
Karen"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a great time for a quick relaxing weekend away. The house is beautiful and is easy to find. Recommend stopping at Toppled Turtle brewery for a beer and some brick oven pizza! So good!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica’s place was perfect for our stay! From the moment we pulled up , the curb appeal was welcoming. When we entered the home everything was decorated great, comfortable, easy to find items, above and beyond with snacks , a fan, bathroom items, ironing board , and iron! She had thought of everything! Super clean, comfy, and the backyard added a place to hang out and enjoy the weather. The pool table in the garage was a brilliant idea! This home works perfectly for anyone needing a place to stay in Dumas!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica is a great host and great at communicating quickly.
We would recommend her home anytime.
Very convenient location."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host is a lovely person.. responsive & very nice! It appears they put a good deal of thought, consideration, & effort into fixing the place up to be a nice, comfortable stay. It was nicely remodeled, clean, & comfortable. I wasn't sure I'd find an Airbnb available in Dumas, & was pleased to have found one, & for it to have been as stated in the listing. I was, unfortunately, in town from FL for my grandmother's funeral and wanted a better place to stay than a hotel room, & this was much better!
That being said, there are only a few picky little details that could have made this 5-stars across the board. Having done a significant amount of traveling over the years, I'm able to compare it to other places I've stayed at before. Some things are within the host's control, & some are not (just more of an FYI). Don't expect scenery - it's Dumas. A full-length mirror is needed somewhere within the home. Closet & bathroom doors: difficult to open & close. Lg. loose dog roaming the area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nice, clean home, perfect fit for our stay in Dumas!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay! Lots of attention to making it feel like home.

There’s a fire pit in the back where me and my family had s’mores, and the game room had a pool table and TV to get some good music going and play a little pool. Me and the family had a great time here and would definitely stay here again. Jessica was awesome and responsive to any questions or concerns I had, and I’m very appreciative of her allowing me and my family to spend our Christmas trip here. It felt like home. Thank you again, Jessica."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed twice, once on my way to Denver and a week later on the way back. I would definitely select their hideaway any time I need one in the Amarillo area.

I was able to charge my electric car overnight, which was an added bonus and convenience."

I did however did not realize to check my email for the code for the key pad but the host answered my call immediately! (Sorry about that again!)My wife and I were traveling with out 4 month old daughter and a U-haul trailer and needed a space to park where we felt it would be safe too. The barnaminium was in a great private location on the hosts property. And after a long drive seeing those soft fresh cookies was such an amazing touch. My family and I were very comfortable in the space and happy to see the trailer was safe as well. Very private, never saw hosts and felt safe as I saw cameras on the property. I cant say enough so I'll leave it with it was perfect for us and what we needed."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The word that comes to mind is flawless! Michael & Terri have thought of everything for their guest's experience and comfort, and approach hosting with great professionalism. I found the barn ideal for travelling into Amarillo from the West - after a long day's driving, it is easy to find and nice that its before the town. Inside, the barn is totally quiet and peaceful and the perfect place for sleeping soundly. The beers in the fridge and the freshly baked cookies were the icing on the cake, and I enjoyed these while watching the sun set from the porch."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an incredible stay! The sunset view from the kitchen is insane, so make sure you catch it when you come.

Would highly recommend for a couple for a getaway!"

The artwork and decorating were very tasteful and thoughtful.
The kitchen was very well-equipped, and the outdoor area looked lovely but we didn't have time to enjoy it.
We enjoyed looking through the book of photographs with marvellous views that was left on the breakfast bar, Jim Davies is a skilful photographer - We love a sunset! We also met Lillie the Labrador who was fab."

Tall ceiling and sliding doors made it feel very roomy. I highly recommend! Very comfortable stay."

They had all the comforts- different thickness of bed pillows, super soft blankets, dryer sheets, good blow dryer, mugs in the freezer/beer in the fridge, snacks, and a free pic of a local artist’s sunset sky behind a barn. This was my first airbnb where the dishes didn’t have to be rewashed before I ate off from them, as they had a dishwasher. Everything was labeled so you could find it easily. There are charging cords with 4 adapters by both sides of the bed. Definitely worth the money and I would definitely rebook. Thanks for having us!"

We would definitely stay there again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Michael and Terri have a stunning set up and photos do not do the place justice, if we could give more stars we would.
The quality of the fixtures and fittings is on par with any high end hotel and all the little extra touches that they have thought of were so appreciated and made the stay extra special. Joe particularly liked the iced beer glasses and just had to give them a go. If you forget your toothbrush or other toiletry items don’t panic there are spares of these items offered. We are just sad that this was only a one night stay as we were just passing through on our Road trip USA.
We booked very last minute and Michael and Terri accommodated us.
The location is so peaceful and we would definitely stay again if over this way again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow I don’t even know where to begin. Communication was amazing, the room was so clean and I love the little touches that were added to the place. My family and I, had a really rough first couple of days traveling and I promise this stop was the absolute best. I walked in and immediately felt relieved on how clean everything was. I forgot my charger and was so happy to see one by the bed. The cookies were so good my husband wanted some more lol. I’m so thankful I had the opportunity to stay here. It was truly a blessing. Thank you again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was exactly as the pictures showed. They have all the little details one may not think of: all types of chargers, sound machine, aromatic diffuser, treats and local artist decor. Super clean, nice flow and feel. Great treat for a couples getaway, close enough to shopping and food without feeling like city life."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay with amazing hosts!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We needed a place to stop on our way to New Mexico. The pictures caught our eyes and we booked a night. We absolutely loved staying here.

Made finding things easy.
Detailed instructions made finding things easier.
Full kitchen to cook in.
The best part to us was the comfy bed. We were very tired from a long drive and the comfy bed was a welcome site.
We did enjoy our short stay and we won’t be giving our money to Expedia anymore when traveling through Amarillo.
Thank you!!!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend staying here, the hosts have really outdone themselves when it comes to setting up a great AirB&B experience. They’ve set the bar high, we had a great stay- so peaceful, a great little getaway for the night."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful Texas panhandle location perfect for unwinding and enjoying the wildlife and endless sky.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael & Terri’s place is so nice we wish we could keep it as secret as a “Hidden Hideaway” could be.
A wonderful location with all the amenities needed to cook,
grill or just relax. There really isn’t anything we can think of that could make this experience better except staying longer.
Exceptional is the only description fitting this apartment. You will not be disappointed with Micheal & Terri’s hospitality."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely 5 Stars!! This had EVERYTHING you could ask for in an Airbnb- down to the smallest details like a container of toothpicks, homemade cookies waiting for you, comfortable bed, and immaculately clean.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a 5 star plus rating! After a long 600 mile day driving, we were exhausted BUT that was forgotten quickly! The Red Barn is just what we needed! Quaint, clean, homey are just a few words to describe this diamond in the rough!
Thank you Michael for the friendly chat & being so welcoming to us!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I think it’s rare (especially nowadays) that you find a place that is actually better than the pictures and description. Seriously, this place is a gem and the perfect spot for me to relax and regroup after a full day of driving. It is stocked with snacks, clean and comfortable (they have a white noise machine), and the patio is the perfect place to spend the morning (I’m sure the evening is nice too, but I pulled in around 10pm).
About 10 minutes from town it allowed me to keep my bikes attached to my car while making it so picking up food, coffee, etc the next morning was still easy. Love this place!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved staying here! This homey little barn is beautiful inside and out! The view of the sunrise and the deer in the morning was wonderful! Michael and Terri were quick and responsive when I messaged them and the place had everything we needed for our time there!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Highly recommend this stay!! We were driving through Amarillo on a long drive home and the barn was the perfect stay after hours in the car. Plus Michael and Terri were super accommodating when our drive was delayed and were able to move our reservation to the next night.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute spot!! Would definitely come back again! A great start to our time in Texas!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This would have to be the BEST Airbnb we have stayed in to date! Terri and Michael have done a beautiful job with every inch of their barn stay. It was the thoughtful little things that won me, homemade cookies on arrival and lovey fresh flowers. So kind and welcoming. The location was a huge yes, being able to sit out in a rocking chair and watch the wildlife. We also had the best sleep we have had for our whole trip (just over a month travelling) in the super comfortable bed. We felt very at home, thank you."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It’s our second time to stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed it again. The location is quiet and peaceful. We slept so well in this comfortable apartment.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a really nice experience at the barn. It’s a small but well arranged space. The hosts keeps it in good condition and provides thoughtful extras that could prove handy (like Qtips and feminine hygiene products). The bed was comfortable and the shower water was hot. I wish we could’ve had time to use the outdoor space because the sunrise was beautiful and I’m sure sunset is even prettier.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It's like sleeping in an Art Gallery. This home is perfect! The owners have thought of everything. From great snacks, coffee to fresh cookies waiting for us. They even have extra toiletries.
The location is remote enough to see the stars on clear nights. there is a creek bed to have a morning hike.
We are still telling people about how perfect it is!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful barn! The place had everything we needed. The chairs and fire pit outside were great for unwinding after our hike. Area is very peaceful and quiet. Hosts were very thoughtful and their instructions were helpful and clear. Can’t wait to stay here again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for our time in the area. Better than a hotel room - cost less, fully stocked kitchen, good sized bed room, gas grill, and fire pit. Next time that i am close to that area we will for sure stay there."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Booking with Michael and Terri was super easy. They had great communication and were very welcoming. We even had to end our stay early due to a family emergency. They were super helpful in assisting us with canceling the rest of our reservation. We will definitely be booking with them again!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great Airbnb! Close enough to town, but secluded enough to feel like a peaceful getaway. We enjoyed coffee on the patio while watching deer in the canyon. This place has all of the thoughtful extras which made it feel like home. Definitely recommend!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing! Stayed here for one night as we were passing through Texas. Micheal, and Terri, are quick to respond to questions, even before we booked. It’s a quiet place on the outskirts of town. It had everything you need. Forgot a charger, there are multiple. Need a morning coffee, plenty of k cups. Want something to remember the journey, a complimentary beautiful picture of the place at sunset. The place was NO dust on top of the fridge kind of clean. Made it easy to get comfortable and rest before hopping back on the road."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome stay that I would 100% recommend!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I make food videos for a living, Michael knocked on the door right as I’d slapped myself across the face with a giant sausage… yelling at the camera. What a great way to meet Mr Michael… his response - “No parties in their”
I like a person with a good sense of humor, they made me feel right at home. Not to mention, cookies were awaiting me:) Next time I’ll be cooking for them."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael & Terri’s apartment is wonderful, one of the our best Air BnB stays. It is squeaky clean, thoughtfully organized and comfortable.. We enjoyed using the beautiful kitchen, equipped with everything you need to cook meals. There are thoughtful little touches like extra blankets, toiletries, snacks and a guidebook for Amarillo. Our hosts were friendly, helpful and responsive. The location is safe and quiet, a short dive from stores and restaurants. We highly recommend this place!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Terri deserve 10 stars. They have thought of everything. Good people. They put a lot of expertise into making this unit comfortable, clean, well appointed, and just plain wonderful. The labels and signage are very helpful, practically artwork.

If I could, I would give it 10 stars."

The animals there have no fear, there was times when i didn't even realize 6 deers watching me from less than 10ft away. Rabbita occasionally jump out of the bushes to surprise you. The property is so quiet i saw more animals than people. The barn was so nice and cozy. Would stay again"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great price and cozy stay! You feel right at home and end up not wanting to leave. The backyard view is amazing! It is very close to many things to do in Amarillo.
The only thing is I wish I knew that the Airbnb was so close to the owners house. It is connected to it on the same driveway. But don’t let that scare you, it is a amazing place!! The owners keep to themselves you don’t even see them or run into them. I just didn’t want anyone to get caught off guard like we were.
We are already planning our next trip and we are planning to stay there again. It is one of the best Airbnb I have stayed in!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Karen is amazing! The bedding was comfortable and clean. She responded fast and worked to fix problems as soon as possible. It was super cute and cozy. Would definitely recommend and stay again! Bonus points for all the kids books!

Big comfy couch and everything we needed."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Quick and easy access even late at night with kids and a dog. We were happy to have this option for an overnight on our way to Colorado from Houston especially with a truck bed full of stuff.
We chose to stay in the main living area to stay close to our young kids and dog but the area did feel safe and pleasant out in the country. Karen was responsive but also gave us our privacy. The main living area is beautifully decorated and it smelled great when we got there. The stuffed bobcat scared everyone but then gave us a laugh. There was slight road noise but nothing major. We enjoyed the bird songs in the morning and spotted a Western Meadowlark. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely beautiful!!!!!!!! Honestly it felt right at home and it was absolutely cozy and very relaxing. I am so happy I found it and so happy they gave me the opportunity to stay there. I loved it every single minute and I would love to stay there again.

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,we paid for the air bnb and drove to our location for cheaper than getting a hotel. clean and cute place. we noticed the shower head had calcium buildup and is hard for short people to turn on. Otherwise we really enjoyed our stay! I think we forgot about a towel on the floor before we left- sorry about that!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is one of the most uniquely furnished homes we have stayed in. Makes you feel like the early frontier days. Although rustic in nature, very comfortable and quiet at night for a peaceful rest. Animals are a joy from the dog to the goats to the ducks. Fun place to stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We did not know what to expect, but upon arrival, it was pleasant and very quiet. Definitely recommended. Karen was great and answered all our questions promptly."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a charming and peaceful visit in Karen’s rustic cabin. It was the perfect pit stop on our travels!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Quiet little country home perfect for our stay. Signs on the doors were a little confusing but Karen spelled it out for us. Overall great stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We appreciate you making us feel at home! Thank you
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cool little spot just south of Dalhart. Nice rustic touches. The bedrooms are out in the shop area which was odd but it was cool and unique. On our way out we got to love on one of Karen’s pups who was a cool laid back sweet guy. Would stay again!!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Plenty of parking for my large trailer. Place was quiet and private.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Convenient stopover on a road trip from Texas to Colorado. Comparable to a hotel in the area, but much more private. The big benefit for us is that we travel with an open truck bed full of gear, and with this place being on private property it means you’re stuff can stay in the truck without any worries. Feels very secure and even has a carport you can park under right in front of the door. The internet was very impressive for the rural location. Multiple speed tests showed about 70 mbs both down and up! The place is definitely on the rustic side, for sure, but if you need a place in the general area and want an alternative to a hotel, this is worth a look."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Easy to find with just a quick detour off of Hwy 87.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful place. We were only passing through. We booked 5 minutes before showing up. Karen was very responsive even though we were short notice.
We would stay again."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Karen was an incredible host. She gave very clear directions to find the shop and she responded to any question right away. The place was so cool and as-described. It’s right in town and easy to get to Channing or Dalhart. Great stay!

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karen’s place was great! She was very responsive and would let me know whenever they had to come in the shop or do anything around the stay. Very nice stay in a quiet and private area. Karen’s dogs are very friendly and love being petted. The only issue I had was very minor, but the shower was definitely different, I think it’s just personal preference though. Would definitely recommend staying at Karen’s place if in the area!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Just what we needed to break up our trip from Aspen to Fort Worth. Really easy check in and a super cute place! The shop itself is extremely impressive. One of my favorite Airbnb conversions I’ve seen so far. We loved all of the reuse of equipment and the exposed conduit blended with materials of the shop. So cool! The hosts are really nice too. We even purchased a few goats from them to put on our small farm.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The farm house was a peaceful escape during this holiday season while coming to see family. Our host was super responsive and on point with instructions. The farm house was clean and tidy. Would definitely stay again.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cozy country shop home with plenty of space and everything you need to be comfortable. As native Texans, we felt right at home."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Overall, the home was comfortable. Be mindful that this is a metal building so cell service could be an issue if you need to be available for phone calls. Karen's dogs were awesome and will be missed!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very friendly and easy to work with. Extremely timely and responsive.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here while in town for work. Good clean and quiet place to stay. Well stocked with all essentials.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"10/10 would recommend this sweet lil bnb to anyone passing through mother Texas. Karen is so sweet and generous. We were stuck at the local airport with no cab, Uber or Lyft in sight, and Karen kindly offered to transport us to and from the local airport ❤️"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute homey place to stay! Was a great break from hotel rooms while traveling for work.
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Address for this home is completely wrong so make sure to get complete directions it was a little scary trying to find it in the dark . It is a pet friendly place but your pet has to be on a leash while hers roam free so if you have a younger pup in training this is for sure an issue because her dogs will approach yours and in my case it made ours feel more defensive towards the lose ones however her pups are really sweet . Location is ok as long as your not wanting to do anything because there is nothing to do in this area , really forces you to relax....in my case the forced relaxation was much needed . The house is actually a remodeled Garage but is comfortable to chill in for a couple of days but not something i want to run back to or eager to stay again . I feel really strong about places that list houses as pet-friendly actually being pet friendly and this house is not ."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It is always a pleasant experience
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Exactly as described. Beautiful country home with every amenity you could need. Stayed one night with our two pups on the way from Colorado Springs to Ft Worth. Karen’s dogs are the sweetest things alive and our pup enjoyed meeting them while outside. Very good value for a very nice place to help break up a long drive.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very nice place to stay it has its own special touches
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a great stay here on my way from Houston to Denver!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was in a good location and nice and quiet. The stove area could have been a little cleaner. The pictures on the website were what you walked into. We were from this area so we knew what it was going to be like. We will return on our next trip to this part of Texas.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, quiet, great place to stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stop and rest on our long travels to Colorado to visit family. Quiet and comfy. Loved the sound of the rain hitting the tin roof and the farmhouse style sinks. Will definitely be back.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great for a stop on the way to Colorado! Loved the cow decor!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice and comfy place to rest after a long day on the road.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a great stop. Plenty of room if you have kids and dogs. Rustic Ranchy in the heart of Farm land. We will definitely be back in our travels to and from Colorado.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable and cozy stay. Perfect to relax and unwind after a long day of driving. Karen was a great host and made check in very easy!"
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"We only needed a quick one night stay, and for that this place ticked our box. The only caveat was that the beds and shower didn't appear to have been cleaned. We messaged Karen for new bed sheets for both beds and she was very responsive and polite, and quickly rectified the situation. Some dings for cleanliness, but I still recommend since she responded to us so quickly."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute place! Easy check in, great communication. Just wish the wifi reached the bedrooms, but there’s great connection in the living area."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It's a very nice place. The directions in the ad/reservation are correct, the google maps link is only to the area. Make sure you read the directions in the reservation, they make it easy to find (Google, not so much)."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Karen’s place was a great stay on our road trip to Colorado. Suited our needs!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Whenever we stay here it is an excellent experience, a very quiet, comfortable and spacious place"
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,The space was big and open however it was not very clean inside. The stove top had food and grease residue caked on and the fridge had a few dead bugs laying inside. The shower had hair on the floor. Was not impressed. I had this booked over a week in advance. Definitely would not recommend to families with young kids under 10 there’s a lot of danger zones in the main living space that kids can hurt themselves on easily.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect for our night on the road to Colorado from Dallas.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Has everything you need for a work stay.

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Quiet place out in the country with some adorable barnyard friends nearby! Nice I fenced grassy area for pups to use when needed.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Karen's place was perfect to sit back and relax at! It is quite large and very comfortable! If passing through the Dalhart/Hartley area, this is the place to book!
After booking, make sure to pay attention to the directions that are sent to you. Otherwise, Google Maps will take you down a not-so-well-taken-care- of country road and to a grain bin in the middle of someone else's field! :)"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It has always been our first choice to stay. The place is great!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Pet friendly stay!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to pop in after a very long drive
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! We enjoyed a good nights rest after hours on the road. Very unique stay! Not a place or location to stay a week or so, but great pit stop along the way."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It is an excellent place to rest and the owner is very friendly!!

2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"second stay was as good as the first, great cozy environment for a good nights rest. …with added bonus of meeting the dogs and watching the goats!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,It felt like home away from home!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a nice place to stay. It was very clean, cozy, and affordable. The host was easy to communicate with and responding promptly to all emails. Check in and out was very effortless. We will definitely stay again and te on end to others."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great spot. Unique and functional. Very happy with the stay.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,3rd stay and will come back next trip from Ft. Carson to Ft. Sill
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very quiet and peaceful night. Heat worked well. Bed was comfy. Spacious living area and bedroom. Loved to watch the goats play. The dogs and cats are very sweet.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really nice space, comfortable and clean. We also really enjoyed the farm fixtures and sinks in the kitchen. Hosts were really accommodating with an early check in."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great place. A converted barn has all the amenities and is also super cute. Great location for us traveling to ski trip. Comfy beds. Very clean. I took a nice morning walk with my dog on the grounds. Everything perfect and a great value.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely and fun stay. Parking is excellent. Room for a trailer if you are hauling. Rooms are well sized and separated (kids=noise, separation=peace). Facilities are nice."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay with a great host. Its a pretty place with everything you need.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great location if you are traveling in this area. Close to the highway. There is a lot of parking area. Clean and cute place!
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The bedrooms are separate from the main living area. The knob to turn on the shower is about 8 ft. up from the floor. There are no windows in the bedrooms so this could be triggering for some people. When you turn off the lights in the bedrooms, it is the kind of dark that is like a sensory deprivation chamber.
Otherwise, this place was a good halfway stopping point for us, check-in was super easy, and they have very friendly dogs."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Was a great place to stay
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is really cute and clean. It was perfect for what we needed. The dogs on the farm were so sweet and lovable.
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"I should have read the other reviews. This is a decent place to stay. It truly is a guest space built into a working truck shop. The space conversion is actually quite clever. I was surprised to find the bedrooms were actually separated from the living and kitchen space. This could be handy if you had some in your party who wanted to stay up late and others who want to turn in early. It feels awkward at first. The bathroom fixtures are shop primitive but functional. The bathroom counter is diamond plate with some corrosion. The place is well appointed and very comfy. The host communication was only via messaging, but adequate. If passing through the area again, I would stay here."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you to the hosts for letting us stop off- kinda last min-during the snowy cold weather. The Airbnb was clean and ready for us within an hour!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Karen accommodated us last minute on New Year’s eve. Her spot was cozy and fun! Just what we were looking for. Definitely recommend staying at her cozy shop!
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute rustic place
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Super cute rustic barndominium. Well appointed but the shower water pressure was almost a trickle and the temperature was really hot and could not be changed. We had a great nights sleep but parents with small kids beware the bedrooms open into the farm shop and is quite the temptation.
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Eclectic stay in the country.
Pros:
-cool/funky place
-cozy and pleasant main living space with large open kitchen / dining / living area
- very cool island/bar built in the kitchen
- easy to use TV with streaming services
- lots of extra blankets & pillows which we used
- comfortable beds
- excellent location while driving from Louisiana to Colorado
- pretty country scenery, pretty sunrise, friendly dogs, saw a bunch of goats as we were leaving
-pleasant but minimal interaction with host (we didn’t need anything, she offered early check in, which was kind)
- large collection of kids reading books in the living room
- cute Christmas decor
- the toddler loves the stuffed (bobcat?) in the loft area above the bathroom. Kept saying meow meow and laughing every time she saw it
- kids enjoyed using the exercise equipment as a ramp and limbo material (ages almost 4 years and 20 months)
Cons:
- shower was a challenge. It wasn’t very clean - my 4 year old managed to compile a collection of other peoples’ hair in the brief time we were in there. Had to have husband turn the shower on because I couldn’t reach the switch.
- couldn’t figure out how to turn the water on in the bathroom sink til the morning (have to crank it all the way up, more than you think)
- cement floors in the bedrooms
- random fear overnight that we were in the Texas chainsaw massacre and about to get murdered. Didn’t happen (obviously) but I think the set up of the space may trigger this for other fans of horror movies/novels. The main living space is so cool and cozy, but then you walk through a heavy metal door into the workshop with a short hallway before the bedrooms. Bedrooms on opposite sides that were I guess built into separate spaces? The rooms themselves were very comfortable and quiet but just the layout and connection to the shop instead of itself gave me the creeps. I think more formally closing off the rental space from the shop would eliminate that, and I’m sure this wouldn’t bother others
- couldn’t get the bedroom tvs to work. Didn’t contact the host because I didn’t really need it but others may.
Overall probably a great stay as an overnight for a family with older (non-preschool/toddler) kids. We’d probably stay here again if we needed to while passing through. Nothing else in the area that we could find, and it is an extremely clever use of the extra space in their workshop. Just a few issues that just didn’t work well for us and our young kids."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a two bedroom with a reasonably sized living area and kitchen. We are a family of 6 and made it work with couches/sleeping bags.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a great place to stay for our long road trip for Christmas!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute space that is connected to a barn/workshop. Great for road trippers. You have to lock individual bedrooms from shared space so less ideal for super young kids, but cozy! otherwise."
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay. Good location, easy to find and just as the pictures show."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful barn home. Nice and quite
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you’re going to Dalhart or surrounding areas. This is the cabin to stay at. In Hartley. Private. Comfortable. A boujie version of little house on the prairie. We enjoyed our stay.

2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"good dog friendly place to stay. downside is there's not many restaurants nearby opened on Sunday, and the water pressure in the house is low, but otherwise is a good place to stop over"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect stop off for us. Clean, warm and quiet. Got a great nights sleep and saw the goats and ducks in the morning. Friendly and helpful host."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for anyone. I’m living out of a suitcase and Karen accommodated by giving me a generous discount per night. Much cheaper than a hotel and a lot cleaner and homey.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay while traveling on to Colorado!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great as always! Super cozy and comfortable.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay! It was a last minute booking but Karen was very welcoming. She was prompt with communication and the place was clean and ready on time. No delay at check in. My only concern was that I wasn’t able to find the bedrooms. I contacted Karen and she promptly informed me that they beds were off the main living area-through a door; I have two young kids and was afraid of them not being able to open the door to the outer rooms or them being scared, but they were able to navigate. It wasn’t a long stay at all but it was just what we needed after days on the road. Highly recommend and will stay again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place has rustic charm. Nice place to spend the night while on our family road trip.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! It’s got everything you might need!

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely accommodation and farm stay. Host was super easy to work with. We found the house clean and well equipped for our overnight stay. Karen has very friendly dogs and cats who’d greet you as though you are a long lost friend!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Comfy and homey! We stayed the night on our way home on a long road trip and enjoyed the comfortable space and the uniqueness of this place!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Country living with goats and ducks and chickens. Friendly dogs too. Open air and fields. Fun adventure.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"On the way to Colorado, we were looking for a place just past Amarillo. This was perfect. Great, unique space with plenty of room for our trailers."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Karen was an excellent host and the shop home was very eclectic. We enjoyed our stay. The pooches are so friendly.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Adorable country setting, everything you need, wonderful host."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Karen's barn is spacious and cute on the inside and provides a great stopover on the way from Texas to Colorado.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The shop house is a great place to stay in a rural and rustic setting. Everything was great. Strongly recommend as very family friendly.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karen's shophouse was idyllic for XIT Rodeo. The house was easy to find and all of Karen's dogs, ducks, chickens and goats were a pleasure to see and hear while outside. The stars are night were beautiful and we really enjoyed the setting in Hartley. Finding the bedrooms was a little confusing at first, but just follow Karen's directions and you'll figure it out. The internet worked well and the kitchen has all the basics you need for a short stay. The shophouse has a rustic charm and we will definitely stay again when in town for XIT."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The “shop” is actually a workshop inside of a warehouse, so look for that large driveway and not the driveway that leads to the actual house. Had we known we would have saved a little time and a bit of noise trying to back our UHaul trailer out of the driveway while avoiding the ditch on either side. The actual warehouse with the apartment built inside of it is quite nice, just as lovely as pictured, and the driveway there is large enough to pull your giant rig in and completely turn it around to exit without having to back out at all."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for a quick rest between Colorado and Houston. Thanks!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay between Houston and Colorado! So much better than the hotels in Amarillo. And there were baby goats and the friendliest dogs ever. Lovely stay!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay! Felt like a home compared to a hotel. Will stay again! Thank you so much Karen
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent amenities and very considerate host! Rooms and decor immaculate and clean. Would stay again in a heartbeat!
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Karen has a wonderful place, her dogs are super friendly!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This Airbnb was fantastic! Best place to stay anywhere nearby and very affordable. We will definitely be booking this again on our way to/from Colorado. Highly recommend!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is our second time staying here at Karen’s airBnB in Hartley. The BnB was great just like last time, thank you again. We were able to bring our dogs because we were driving through on our move out East and they loved it along her labs loving our girls. Especially the Chocolate lab loving on our Newfoundland he waited by the door for her so cute. Definitely will recommend to any friends or family traveling East that route. Plus she helped us find a tire for our trailer when the town had already shut down for the night and we drove in on a flat. Thank you again the tire made it all the way to our final destination."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at Karen's! Such nice interior decor! Her two dogs are adorable and we enjoyed their company. BEST sleep I've had at an AirBnb! Thanks for hosting us!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are traveling on Highway 287, this is by far the best value, the quietest, and the coolest place to stay between Amarillo and deep into Colorado. We are definitely going to return. We loved the privacy. It’s a cute little farm and only a mile or so off of the highway. We got there late at night because we were on a marathon car trip, and Karen was super communicative and super welcoming. This is definitely a repeat. Very spacious and comfortable, particularly if you like the “shop house” thing, which we do. The kids loved it!"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Must love pets if you’re staying here!Karen and her dogs and kittens are very sweet and they will all greet you when you arrive, go out and leaving! Make sure you drive very carefully and slow. The place inside were clean and organize. Karen response quick and answered all our questions."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very unique farm-themed decor. Beautiful green fields all around. Two comfortable beds in separate rooms, also separate from the living space. Good for parents traveling with kids."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful setup that is truly a gem! One can tell that they took their time to make sure any guests that stay at their property would enjoy the privacy and comfort that is available at the location.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Unique spot, breathtaking sunset. Enjoyed the unique experience. If traveling with little ones - the bedrooms are outside a heavy door that must remain closed and then behind two other heavy doors, separate from living space. There are “smile you’re on camera” signs by the doors (they go into the garage) which was a little awkward at 2 AM going to potty in my jammies! Dogs are well trained and sweet , they do their job protecting the farm well. If you have a dog nervous around other dogs or somebody traveling with you uncomfortable around around dogs … know they’ll be close by when you step out. Appreciated the opportunity to stay here , it was a great memory !"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very welcoming. Owner and pets welcomed us. Loved how pet friendly it is. Very clean and comfortable.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place and very quiet and tranquil. Lots of room to spread out.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Would definitely recommend anyone to stay here! It is very cute, out of the city and if you are looking for a vacation away from the hustle and bustle of every day life this would be the spot. Or if you are just passing through like we were it was perfect, we have never slept so soundly in a new place, we only wish we could of stayed longer. Karen went out of her way accommodating us on about a two hour notice very late at night. We were extremely grateful."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay! Cute and cozy esthetics. As described. Has all the appliances you might need in a home, but currently no plates/cups/utensils and things that most travelers or visitors don't have on hand or pack when planning a trip that includes an Airbnb. However, this is a new one that sounds like hasn't been fully completed, so I'm sure there are some things that are yet to come. Nonetheless, this was a super cute and comfortable pet-friendly cabin on owner's property. We enjoyed spending time with the owner's dogs who are beyond friendly and loving. We also enjoyed watching the goats, chickens, and ducks play - very entertaining bunch! Overall, would definitely recommend this location to anyone either passing through or looking for a few days away from the typical daily grind. Would certainly stay here again if we ever pass back through that way."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a wonderful stay! The house was clean, comfortable and quiet. I would definitely start again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is amazing! It is nicer and has more amenities than even the nicest big-city hotels.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"From the outside it's not very impressive. But once you enter inside it's absolutely beautiful, clean, and way beyond anything I've stayed at for accommodations! I doubt Dalhart has anything that comes close for lodging."

Unique place that felt warm, inviting and comfortable."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An amazing Guesthouse! We visit relatives in Dalhart a few times a year and this was our first time to stay at The 708 Guesthouse. It is so BEAUTIFULLY decorated with every COMFORT you could imagine provided. I loved having the parking right by the front door to make the luggage task easy. The temperature dipped into the 30’s during our visit so it was wonderful having such a close parking space. Alexandra is an incredible hostess!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a remarkable stay. The interiors are so beautiful, spacious and finely detailed that you will want to spend as much time as possible just enjoying being there. Parking is truly easy, just outside the door, and the neighborhood is a quiet respite from the road. Wholeheartedly recommend the welcoming 708, and truly hope to be back. Thank you, Alexandra!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best air bnb’s I’ve found and stayed in! And to be in Dalhart, is most shocking!

I will stay here again and would recommend it to anyone."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a surprise!! Such a lovely spot. The decor was amazing.
Inconspicuous from the outside but so warm and inviting inside. All the extras were a great touch. We had everything we needed. The kitchen was awesome for cooking any meal and overall it was very comfy for a chilly October weekend. If you happen to find yourself in Dalhart this is the place to be!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Who would have thought that there would be such a wonderful place to stay in Dalhart, Texas?! Alexandra is a fantastic host; she is communicative, prompt, friendly, and her instructions were perfect. The guesthouse itself is understated when you drive up but when you go inside…(?)…oh my! It is, tastefully furnished in a modern, western style, the bed is VERY comfortable, and the place is filled with amenities. Need some milk or bottled water? She’s got you covered. Do you and your significant other enjoy wine? The bottles in the well-stocked wine rack (and bar) are complimentary. At the risk of lapsing into hyperbole, I will just say this: I’ve stayed in 30-40 vacation rentals and Alexandra’s place is easily in my top three stays. A 6/5 star rating. I’ll be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is a hidden gem in Dalhart! The home is decorated so amazing and is very cozy. I will definitely be back!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved staying at Alexandra’s. We wish we could have stayed longer. It is so beautifully decorated with high quality furnishings & decor. Alexandra thought of everything and didn’t miss anything. We definitely recommend this place, plan to stay a few days to enjoy the cottage."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing and special place to stay while visiting friends in Dalhart. An actual gem which gave us a private oasis while staying for the weekend. Beyond it just being gorgeous it was full of entertainment (record player! TVs!) a gorgeous kitchen and bar (thanks for the bacon & eggs!) and most comfortable bed. We will 100% be back!!!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Darla’s place was one of our top Airbnb stays. It was beautiful, clean, comfortable and the bathtub was the icing on the cake. We were two (three including our pup) weary travelers and the tub and bed was an amazing way to end a long day! We ate pizza and enjoyed a bottle of wine on the back porch. We were able to park our moving truck with no issues!!Darla is a gem of a host. She was responsive and answered all questions quick. We will definitely stop again if we are in Amarillo area! We were sad not to enjoy the hot tub…but there’s always next time!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at Darla’s place! The pros - the backyard was nice and spacious, the bed was comfortable, it was in a quiet neighborhood, the bathtub was great for soaking after a long day, it’s very close to popular locations (Cadillac ranch, Palo Duro State Park). We had just enough space for the 3 of us (2 adults and a toddler). We will definitely stay again when we are back in the area. No cons!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stopped for a night on a cross country trip. Was favorite spot by far on the trip. Space js very well decorated and cozy.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Bunny Bungalow could not have been any more perfect! My husband treated me to a night away for Mother’s Day. This place had everything you could ever need, was so peaceful and relaxing and had many thoughtful touches. It was the perfect little place to get away."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a wonderful stay for visiting Palo Duro Canyon! This little space was cozy and beautiful!
Every tiny detail was thought out to make this place feel like home, down to the little magnet cover for the microwave to keep the room dark at night for sleeping soundly. Excellent quality bedding was so comfortable, wonderful bath salts were provided for the lovely soaking tub, the air conditioning was awesome, the private back yard with hot tub was so dreamy.
Darla was so friendly & responsive.
She made it so convenient to scoop pup-poops w/a designated bin, a hand held scooper, and bags. She made all the instructions so polite, clear, and accessible.
The nice cookware and seasonings in the kitchen were perfect, there was even a bullet/grinder for making smoothies.
We found a delicious local Indian restaurant nearby (Sai) and Journey Coffee was amazing.
If you’re wondering whether you should book, don’t hesitate! Would LOVE to stay again if in the area. Absolutely 5 star !⭐️"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This Airbnb was put together thoughtfully and tastefully. The layout was perfect. Quality appliances, and fixtures, all the right amenities, and perfect touches throughout. The hot tub in the private backyard was great. It is set up for a very comfortable getaway."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Quite literally one of the nicest homes I have stayed in. The front porch is so nice and the backyard was perfect for our dogs. I unreservedly recommend this home for your stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome and relaxing stay! Been traveling through Amarillo for decades and this was the first night I enjoyed my stay. Much better option than the chains along I-40!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"First of all, I am an extremely picky person as far as decor and cleanliness goes….I cannot recommend this place enough!!!! I loved every single bit of it…all Top Notch Quality materials from bed/bedding to kitchen to bathroom and everything Beautiful!!!!! Loved having the private backyard for my puppy Henry too! Serene and Peaceful!!!!!
I loved her place and would stay there again and again! You will not be disappointed …."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is like a spa!! We couldn’t stop talking about how awesome this airbnb was. We stopped in to break up a road trip and it was the perfect place to recharge. Can’t recommend more highly
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the Bunny Bungalow. A very warm welcome from David and Darla. The jacuzzi was immediately ready for use. The interior is very stylish. I'm in love with the towels! At sunset we even saw the bunnies!
Very complete kitchen and everything so clean! Perfect!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a must stay if you are considering it. Darla has gone above and beyond to ensure that every single need was met during our stay. The space is beautiful, so well decorated/designed. It feels very spacious and comfortable. The kitchen was stocked with everything you could need, as was the bathroom/laundry. It was immaculate when we walked in.
This is one of the best airbnbs I’ve stayed in- and I’ve stayed in many. Must stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice, quaint, and clean."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a PERFECT, cozy, refreshing place to stay as we came to do some mountain biking in the Palo Duro Canyon. Located an easy 20 minutes from The Canyon, this host has thought of everything! The private, covered hot tub was a sure highlight for us to soak our sore and tired muscles after a fun day of biking. The enclosed backyard was perfect to store our prized mountain bikes and would be a great place for a pet as well. If you don't like hot tubbing, there is a large beautiful bathing tub with ""sore muscle salts"" or ""sleepy time salts"" to soak in as you enjoy the bathroom spa-like atmosphere (complete with lovely scented candle and giant private window). The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable, and made for a high quality night of sleep leaving us refreshed and ready for more adventures. The stacked washer and dryer were essential as our adventures in The Canyon left us quite dirty each day. Great TV and electric fireplace with very comfy chairs to rela"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Darla and Dave the hosts
pay attention to the smallest of details including a small little black fabric that covered the clock on the microwave that otherwise would have blared at night!
The bungalow was immaculate!
They even had the Edison lights hanging over the hot tub “on” as if to encourage us to get in! We did that evening and for the first time in our three day journey my husband said, “I finally feel like I’m on vacation!”
Their linens were so comfortable and the bed was soft and cozy.
I’ve stayed at 6 - 7 other AirBnB’s this was a 10 out 10!!
It was just like the pictures showed, it was clean & comfortable!
Upon our return thru Amarillo we plan to return!
It’s a great place to enjoy!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quiet and peaceful!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Bunny Bungalow was the perfect place to relax and unwind! It was incredibly clean and the hosts thought of every detail. We wish we could have stayed longer! The hot tub was amazing and private. We highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Delightful place! Exactly as described and pictures. Could not have asked for a cozier, clean, beautiful place to stay! Host was very friendly, kept us updated on check in process and checked on us on 2nd to see if we needed anything. Definitely recommend the Bunny Bungalow!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home was so pretty. Fell in love with every aspect of it. Everything was very clean and organized. Wouldn’t mind renting an airbnb from Darla again sometime.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend. Fireplace was nice. We were able to use the covered hot tub in the rain. Everything we could have needed was there. Host very responsive.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay at Darla’s bungalow and we absolutely love it! The place is beautiful inside and out. All the amenities are well thought out. The bungalow offers a wonderful respite after a long day of travel.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"By far one of the nicest Airbnb rentals we’ve ever stayed at. Just perfect. Seriously! The attention to detail, the amenities that were provided, the absolute cleanliness of the rental were impressive. The host was easy to communicate with and always responded promptly. The furnishings and decorations were amazing. The bath salts were over the top. We did not want to leave! This place is so amazing it puts a five star resort to shame!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a cute little place to stay! Loved the hot tub and private, fenced backyard, as did our dog! The bathtub was very enjoyable as well."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was so well suited for our canyon hiking trip. Very close to restaurants and places of interest. Darla was an excellent host. Would not hesitate to recommend or stay again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Darla's place was incredibly clean! Monika-Clean has looked at all the Friends. The accommodation is beautiful as soon as you open the door, you feel at home. The decor is so incredibly lovingly designed, I would have preferred to have reordered everything immediately.
Darla herself is incredibly friendly and welcoming and we would keep coming back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Bunny Bungalow was the perfect stay for my husband and I when we were in Amarillo! Darla was very kind and willing to help or address any needs. The bungalow had all the amenities, was super clean, and was private. We will definitely stay again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Darla’s place was so much fun to stay at. It is in a rural setting complete with a rooster crowing! The house is so beautifully decorated and no expense was spared in the decor from the linens to the very upscale bathroom. We enjoyed having a meal in and then sitting by the electric fireplace. We were extremely comfortable there and hated to leave.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Exactly as pictured and described. Spotless! A nice place to stay on the drive up to Colorado.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The accommodations are absolutely spotless which is very important to me. Also the neighborhood is pleasant and very quiet. The hot tub was also very clean and easy to use. The location is quite convenient to many places being only 15 to 20 minutes away from the places I was interested in. The hosts provided coffee and a few snacks we were most grateful for. The space is tastefully decorated in a contemporary style and I loved the waffle towels. There are only two negatives and I must qualify them by saying that these would probably not be if I were a younger person. I found it difficult to navigate the television which is much more sophisticated than my own. Not a big deal but it was frustrating. Second I found the mattress to be too soft for my liking. I am used to a very firm mattress so I had difficulty sleeping. In general this is a very nice place and I would recommend it.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay and convenient to many local restaurants and Palo Duro Canyon. Will rent again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We booked a last minute, one night getaway for our Anniversary to the Bunny Bungalow and we are so happy we did!
The location was easy to find, peaceful & private! The home’s interior is absolutely gorgeous, clean, well-maintained & organized!
We spent the day thrifting and walking the shops on the historic Route 66 in Amarillo, then had a fabulous 5 star dinner in town! Coming back to Darla’s home to have a quiet & relaxing night was the cherry on top to our trip!
We cannot wait to book again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely bungalow just as described in the listing. Check in was a breeze. Darla was very clear and accommodating. Bungalow was about a 20 min drive to Palo Duro Canyon and about 15 min the Amarillo proper. Felt like a great middle ground and was a lovely reprieve following a long day of hiking

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love this place! It has everything you need. I came for a personal getaway and found it so relaxing. You can have a drink on the shaded patio in the evening before soaking in the hot tub. You can drink your coffee in the porch swing with the morning sun. If the weather is too inclement, the giant soaking tub can fit two people. I will be returning."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Darla place was very, beautiful and calming! We had a great stay!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Darla’s place was the perfect little place for a one night stop on our cross country roadtrip. The place itself was so adorable, the bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in, and the area was very cozy. The tub was so beautiful, I wish I would’ve had time to use it. The bed sheets and blankets smelt so good (big bonus points for me)! We got in VERY late at night and Darla assisted us with getting inside as the keypad malfunctioned. This was NOT to her fault AT ALL. The only reason I am mentioning it is because of the fact that she responded immediately after midnight to help us. She was great! Would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Bunny Bungalow was the perfect space! Such a cozy relaxing vibe after a long day on the road!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Darla’s place was spotless and exactly as pictured. It was very cozy - we were very comfortable and would definitely stay again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked the Bunny Bungalow for my mom and her new husband as a post-wedding getaway, and they absolutely loved it. They bragged and raved to our family and friends about how beautiful the home was. The hot tub and big soaker tub were a big hit and made the stay extra special. This was the perfect home for a relaxing retreat space.
I had asked the host, Darla, for an early check-in so we could set up the place to be ready post wedding, and she was so sweet to accommodate this request. She was always quick to respond, extremely helpful, and so kind. This home and its host deserve every 5 star rating!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home in the country! We absolutely loved our stay. The bed is super comfortable and everything in the home is centered around comfort - bath salts, hot tub, fireplace. The host even had flavored syrups in the refrigerator for coffee in the morning. I would highly recommend this property to anyone passing through!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was such a lovely surprise in Amarillo! Cozy, very thoughtfully curated, and amazing attention to detail. The bathroom - equipped with soaking salts and a candle - was the perfect end to a long day of driving."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,such a beautiful and peaceful place. truly enjoyed it over the holidays and so special. it was like we were at home the entire stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a wonderful stay—the Airbnb was filled with everything we needed and more. We had our two dogs with us and the fenced in yard was perfect for letting them out safely. We travel through Amarillo fairly often on our way to New Mexico, and this spot will definitely be on our list of places to stay the next time we come through!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is, without a doubt, the most luxurious AirBnb experience I have ever had. Darla has clearly considered every possible detail in the preparation of this space, from the pristine and fully outfitted kitchenette (pots, pans, cutlery, dishes, cooking utensils, glasses, cocktail ware, spices, and anything else you could imagine needing) to the glorious bathroom (outfitted with both a shower and stunning bathtub, plus quality bath products). The fenced backyard had a grassy area that was perfect for our dog and, although we did not have time to enjoy the hot tub, you can bet we’ll be back for a longer trip to make use of it! There is a covered car port and a charming bench swing out front. The TV is also excellent: large, equipped with Roku, and easy to cast to from your own devices. The jewel of the crown, however, is the bed. The mattress felt like being cradled in a cloud. The pillows were full and fluffy, and the linens were so soft. We slept like rocks. In summary, stay here 💕"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Darla's bungalow was wonderful, roomy, comfortable, and quiet. She was so responsive and helpful. We just loved this spot for traveling and would definitely stay again. They were so amenable to pets!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Grab a bottle of wine and dinner on your way because once you get there, you won’t want to leave! The home is beautiful and the bathroom…. The bathroom is to die for. A spa experience. That tub 😍 They even had bath salts and a candle for the ultimate relaxation experience. Soft towels, nice linens and a comfy bed. The kitchen was nicely stocked and every detail of the house was perfectly curated! Top 3 vacation rental experiences of all time! A bit hard to find on GPS, but the host provided directions ahead of time in case that happened. Highly recommended!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the nicest Airbnb my husband and I have stayed at so far. Darla is a wonderful host, we felt spoiled staying here. The hot tub was perfectly clean and we felt we had plenty of privacy."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The perfect spot for an overnight stay near all of Amarillo yet out of the busyness of town. It was really relaxing and had a spa like bathroom. We really enjoyed the comfortable, clean environment."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved the bunny bungalow! Only stayed for 1 night since we were driving across the country but the hot tub was key. Loved the backyard for our pup to roam around in and the decor of the place is spot on. Wish it was cold enough to take advantage of the fireplace. Chairs and bed were very comfortable. Away from the center of town but very private. Only minor issue was finding the place in the dark. Wish we could’ve stayed longer to relax!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place to stay!!!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Darla’s cottage is perfect in every way - beautifully decorated, immaculately clean and very cozy. We enjoyed having wine by the fireplace after our long drive. The kitchen is well equipped—the microwave is also a convection oven. The bathroom feels like a spa. My husband claims he had the best night sleep at the cottage as compared to other Airbnbs. We hope to stay again as we travel through Texas."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home and aesthetically pleasing! It was perfect for a one night stay during our cross-country road trip. It was clean and cozy; the bed was so comfy. The backyard was a decent size for our pup.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"All I can say is WOW. I’ve logged close to 300 nights on Airbnb and this is one of the nicest Airbnbs I’ve stayed in. We felt right at home in Darla’s guesthouse. All of the fixtures and finishings feel high end, with no detail overlooked, and the backyard is perfect for dogs! This is a great stopover on a cross country roadtrip. I highly recommend the Bunny Bungalow!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our weekend getaway, the cottage was lovely, loved that it was cozy, easy to use the appliances and spacious for the two of us. Mrs. Darla immediately responded to our text messages and very informative. We enjoyed the tub too, it helped us out bathing with all the Epsom salts she provided for our sore muscles after our hikes at Palo Duro Canyon. Loved staying there."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"my wife and I were so impressed with this beautiful little spot. Very comfortable, very cozy."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Bunny Bungalow was quite possibly our favorite abnb we have ever stayed at and we have stayed at some good ones! If you are in the Amarillo area and need a spot for two and possibly a furry friend, do not second guess this. So comfy, clean and so many amenities that make the bungalow a special stay. Thanks Darla for your perfect hospitality! Looking forward to a next time! -Haun"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent place. So well planned. The sleeping and common area is lovely and efficient and the bathroom with a deep tub is such a great touch. Darla communicated quickly, accurately, and was most helpful from start to finish. Would definitely stay again. Thank you."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute spot!! No details were overlooked when designing this place - truly a little oasis! All the little touches from the fabulous towels to the coffee and snacks made it perfect. Stayed here for wedding weekend with the hubby so we didn’t get to enjoy the bungalow for much time. We definitely decided it was the most comfortable bed!! Everything was clean and Darla was super helpful with making sure we had everything we needed! Will definitely be recommending her spots to all of our friends!

If you get the opportunity to stay at the Bunny Bungalow please do. We look forward to our next stay!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful little place that has everything you could ask for or need. Loved all the special touches throughout. If I listed everything that stood out, this review would be too long. The location was close enough to Amarillo, as well as Palo Duro Canyon. The house is beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable. The soaking tub is large and big enough for two (the bath salts are a wonderful add). The private backyard with hot tub and grill makes this particular spot even more inviting. We will definitely check for availability here first the next time we travel through."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this place was so nice and clean. definitely a plus having a hot tub!

Impeccably clean, high end furnishings and luxury amenities. Darla has thought of EVERYTHING, even a cover for the microwave light!
If my sweet puppy was still with us, he would have loved the space too.
The area is quiet and peaceful. My favorite was the beautiful tub and bath salts. The only thing I regret is that I couldn’t stay longer.
Do yourself a favor and be nurtured on your journey."

We’ve never seen such an excellent use of a small space that still felt roomy, modern and comfortable. Darla thought of every possible need we could have in any situation. The amenities were top-notch, the linens were high-end, and the bed was super-comfortable. The bathroom itself was a show piece! Bonus: Weary drivers get to park under a carport! Book now, then have a swing on the front porch and a soak in the bathtub."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place!! Fantastic bath tub and hot tub amenities. Bed and pillows weren’t the most comfortable but we brought our own pillows so that made it better. Overall great experience.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Darla’s place was just what we needed on a cross country road trip. It exceeded all of our expectations. The design was well thought out with lots of attention to detail. The bathroom feels like a personal spa and it’s almost hard to decide if the hot tub or bathtub is better. Luckily, we enjoyed both. Our dog loved the fenced in yard and lush grass. Lots of quiet road to walk and stretch the legs. We even bought some farm fresh eggs from a local neighbor. This spot is by far the best AirBnB we’ve stayed at for a single night stop over (instead of a hotel)."

I have traveled all over the world and stayed in many airbnbs…this Bunny Bungalow is Amarillo is in my top 5 stays of all time!
