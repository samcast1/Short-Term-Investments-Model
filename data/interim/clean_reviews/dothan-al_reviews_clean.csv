Thank you guys for making our stay in Dothan memorable.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again.
Beautifully designed and decorated, awesome backyard - we felt right at home!"
2024-03-01,4,Group trip,"The house is beautiful and has plenty of space. The home is listed as an entire home to yourself but there is an additional rental room that is connected to the house. So we booked Both to ensure we had privacy and more space.
The host was not very responsive besides the automated messages and when we were checking out."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is a perfect landing spot for spending a few days playing golf at Robert Trent Jones. Super clean, spacious and fully equipped for cooking and visiting. Matched the description perfectly!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I enjoyed our stay . The house was clean and had everything we needed. It was very spacious . The location was close to all the stores and restaurants. Would definitely stay here again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank so much for hosting our stay I'm glad we picked this home from the others we saw. We had 3 adults and 2 kids with use so the closed in backyard was awesome for the Littles to play and we enjoyed the ping pong table and corn hole in the back. very spacious and well kept! Westin was very accommodating when I asked for a early check in! Loved the location. Thanks again!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,By far the best experience we have had on airbnb. Beautiful perfect brand new very nice house.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Air BNB stay was amazing. I had one issue where there was a dirty pot and pan in the oven, I let my host know and immediately they offered to send the cleaning crew over within the hour to clean. That was a pleasant surprise that caught me off guard, but I said no it was fine. We arrived a few minutes early and they allowed us to go ahead and check in since it was cold and wet, they allowed us to sleep in a little on check out day. The house is amazing and well taken care of. I would ask for a few more wash cloths for those guests that come with kids, but it‚Äôs nothing to complain over. We felt right at home. One of my guests complained about not having a tv in the bedroom, but I loved that idea because they allows more family and together time. In the evening it‚Äôs a lot of traffic on the Main Street, so you have to make sure that you time your departures, but that is not their fault! I have decided that for every Dothan visit this will be our go to! The Westins are amazing!"

2023-09-01,4,Group trip,"This home was beautiful. It looked just like the photos that was posted. The back yard was so peaceful and the house was very clean. The host did accommodate us with an extra fee to check in early but not check out late. We needed more space so we ended up paying more money for the 4th bedroom which I thought was weird. On the bad side our code did not work for us to check in. I had to contact air bnb to get help. It was hair on our washcloths, upon booking we did not know the fourth bedroom was a different bedroom for someone else to book during our stay. Overall it was a nice stay."

The kitchen had everything that you would need to cook and the bathrooms were stocked nicely. We didn‚Äôt get a chance to enjoy the backyard but it is a good size yard with chairs to relax. Westin was very responsive and communicated with me throughout the stay. I would definitely stay there in the future."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at 2 of Weston‚Äôs properties. Although both were different, they still have equal quality as far as comfortability, cleanliness and privacy.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Westin's Place was clean, quiet and everything in between. A true definition of a home away from home. It was a perfect setup for a traveling family. It's also conveniently located near a CVS for those last minute necessities.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was perfect‚Ä¶ very clean, new and had everything you need!"
2023-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,This is NOT an entire home. There is an attachment to the home that people are staying in. Not an accurate listing and should be changed to a shared dwelling in my opinion.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed it peaceful and relaxing.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Large open concept main area, perfect for gathering friends and family to chat. easy access to main roads and back roads for those who are familiar with the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Westin was very responsive. Home is beautiful for the area. We would stay there again.
While we were there we ran into the house cleaner Robin. She is absolutely wonderful. She was there cleaning the attached studio. She checked in just to ensure everything was going well with our stay. A delightful young lady.
Two minor things: the home needs an iron and ironing board. Also it would have been nice to have known there was an attached studio to the house, because we could hear them speaking through the walls."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the nicest Airbnbs I have stayed at!. Super clean and beautiful house. Highly recommend to anyone in the area.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Nice place
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely LOVED this brand new house! It was perfect for our (me and 3 adult children) med school graduation visit to Dothan. The living area is spacious, comfy, clean & well-decorated. Because our stay was short-lived & very busy, we didn't have a chance to cook in the beautiful kitchen or enjoy the back patio & yard, but the kitchen appeared to be well-equipped and the back yard was fenced and very private. Westin was responsive and accommodating; the perfect host.
The only constructive criticism I can offer Westin is that I would have liked to have known before booking that there is an attached small apartment(?)/owner's suite(?) separated by an interior door. This unit does not appear to have access to the privately fenced back yard.
I would recommend this AirBNB to friends and family, and will gladly stay here again should I find myself in Dothan in the future. Thanks again, Westin!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We came to Dothan to attend the fair. This residence was convenient in distance to the fairgrounds.
One of the highlights of my stay was the host's warm hospitality. They were always available to answer any questions I had and provided helpful recommendations for things to see and do in the area. I truly felt like a valued guest in their home.
Overall, I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a comfortable, convenient, and welcoming place to stay in the city. I cannot wait to return!"

2024-03-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Melissa was very proactive to an issue with uncleanliness in the house. She offered to have her crew come and clean again but I declined because I had already cleaned what was necessary. She made it right by refunding the cleaning fee.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a fantastic place to stay! Located in a quiet place but close to everything. We came for a tennis tournament and were no further than 9 minutes from any of the tennis courts at Westgate, Azalea, and Dothan Country Club."

We had no problems at all. Everything worked well, it was easy to find, and the parking was awesome. The one king and two queen beds were comfortable, and there was even enough room on the oversized couch and love seat in the living room to allow all 6 of us to pile up and enjoy a movie with our graduate after a long, hot, and tiring ceremony. Now that our girl has a job and is going to be living in the area for a while, we feel pretty sure we'll be staying with Melissa again when we go back to visit her.

2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Melissa is prompt and friendly. The neighborhood is nice. The place is ok but cheap. Lipstick on a pig comes to mind.
Full smelly trashcan with flies, only 1 tv. Plugs in kitchen don‚Äôt work, poor bedding to compensate for memory foam mattresses. Me and my wife sweated in a pool of grossness all night. Only wipe-down cleaning and no smell of chemical cleanliness. Used toilet paper roll and paper towel roll.
‚ÄúYou get what yo pay for‚Äù does not apply here. I‚Äôd refuse to believe my $75 cleaning fee was well spent. All around dissatisfied and left grumpy and tired to sleep at a nearby hotel the remainder of our stay. At 46, sleep can make or break a trip and is important and just not worth saving an extra buck.
Lost out on this stay. I didn‚Äôt ask, and owner didn‚Äôt offer credit or partial refund for early checkout. Buyer beware."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a great place to stay for a mini or extended vacation. The house was very clean and had all essentials in stock. Melissa was very quick in responding to questions. The game room was very nice also.

We were here for a week, intown for the Future Masters golf tournament, and it truly felt like a home away from home. Melissa has done an amazing job of making this place feel like a home. It was decorated beautifully, the beds were very comfortable, there was a nice little covered patio that I sat outside and drank my coffee in the morning, etc.... Melissa is an amazing host- she was very quick to respond to any questions I had. I cannot recommend this place enough. You can tell she has put a lot of though into this place and what one would need while there. My boys loved having the pool table and games in the garage!!!

It was really hot and the fish weren't biting as much as I would have liked them to be üòâ, but we still enjoyed ourselves. We will definitely be back and we highly recommend this place for some peace and quiet!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best AirBnB ever! From the beautiful and serene surroundings of the well manicured pond and farmland, to the also beautiful, well decorated, comfortable, and very clean house, this place was just what we were looking for and needed. Close enough to Dothan for us to join in on activities with our local family and in-person work meetings, yet just far enough away to feel remote and secluded to relax all stress away. The light-filled dining area and good WiFi also provided great working conditions for remote meetings. We loved the history of the home and the special touches that made it feel like an old family home‚Ä¶all the character with modern conveniences. Our only regret is that we didn‚Äôt have enough time set aside to just be there and enjoy the place more, rather than being back and forth to other commitments. We certainly hope to go back and spend more time there! Matt was also a great host and very responsive and accommodative. 10 out of 10 would recommend JuJu‚Äôs Pond House!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We came and stayed at Matt‚Äôs place for an event in Dothan. We can‚Äôt wait to return to the city just to stay at this little piece of heaven on earth. This circa 1900s home has been lovingly restored and sits on 100 acres. We enjoyed fishing in the pond and peaceful evenings on the screened patio. We have done considerable travel both domestically and abroad and I would rate this getaway as one of the top places we‚Äôve stayed. Thank you, Matt and family, for sharing your home with us!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I haven‚Äôt been to my hometown of Dothan in 8 years. I wanted to show my daughter the city that has my heart, where I grew up‚Ä¶ this was the perfect place to stay while we were down. The house was beautiful and cozy. We had everything we needed plus the snack basket was a bonus :) The property is beautiful, docks were set up with chairs, tables, rocking chairs. Perfect for watching the sun come up ( if you‚Äôre an early riser like me) and sunset. The beds are very comfortable, the porches ( back and front) are set up so nice. It was the perfect, peaceful getaway we needed. A little piece of heaven on earth, very quiet, but town not too far away. Matt and Jessica were always available the entire stay. Responded to messages immediately, and very helpful and kind. I can‚Äôt say enough great things about this place and can‚Äôt wait to come back. Would be the perfect romantic getaway as well!"

Idyllic is an understatement when describing the setting. Morning mist on the lake, miniature horses, catch and release fishing at the front door, and finding the constellations by the fire at night. These are only a few of the moments and events we had against the backdrop created by our host.
Matt is the quintessential host you could ever hope for. His communication was always cordial and accommodating. We were captivated at every turn while staying on the property. Thank you Matt!"

The cabin is very nice and spacious. The view from the house and porch is incredible. They also have very nice docks and fireplace areas around the lake to enjoy. We felt very safe on the property as well. My daughter and I walked around the lake both mornings and it was so peaceful! We are excited to stay again one day!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is just awesome. You don‚Äôt even have to leave the cabin, the home and property are so gorgeous. There is a trail you can walk around the property and lake. Home is very clean, and comfy. Nice bed linens, stocked kitchen, and TV & Wi-Fi all worked well. We really enjoyed the provided fire wood and fire pit - it was so relaxing by the fire. Thank you for a great weekend, I‚Äôm sure we will be back."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"There aren‚Äôt enough words to describe how much I enjoyed my stay here. The pictures are beautiful, but pictures could never do this place justice. The home was so quaint and inviting. The property was absolutely beautiful. The perfect porches and docks to enjoy coffee in the mornings and sunsets in the evening. There are trails all throughout the property that made for perfect walks. Matt was so responsive, accommodating and a great host. I will definitely be back. Five stars simply aren‚Äôt enough!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Second time staying at JuJu‚Äôs and just as great as the last! We were visiting family over Christmas break and they even had a Christmas tree put up in the house that we used for our daughters‚Äô second Christmas! Very thoughtful and kind hosts.

Juju‚Äôs is awesome and we will look forward to coming back to stay soon!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Juju‚Äôs pond house is a gem! As a new mom, with a 6 month old (his first mini vacation) this was the perfect spot. Serenity is an understatement, if you‚Äôre looking for a perfect getaway, this is it!Thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to stay üòÅ"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Without a doubt the best Airbnb experience we‚Äôve ever had. The property was beautiful and well maintained. The house was decorated wonderfully and, more importantly, everything about it was clean and comfortable. We were able to relax both inside and outside.
We took the trip as a quiet getaway to disconnect and unplug a bit, and it was wonderful for that, but there were still the creature comforts that are great to have.
We cannot wait to visit again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I wish I would have been able to stay longer. It was a great experience and having the pond right by the house really made everything special. I will definitely be back in hopefully next time I‚Äôll be able to see the mini horses!!! Thanks Matt and Jesslyn!!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was everything and much much more. So beautiful upon driving up. Loved how everything was set up both in and outside. Such a pretty big place. Can‚Äôt wait to book again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Whether you are looking to escape reality, destress from the weight of life, find motivation to write your book, or you just need a getaway while visiting family, Juju's is the perfect little retreat! It is tucked away with its own private pond for you/your family to enjoy in peace. You can walk the trails (keep an eye out for arrowheads), fish the pond, sit at numerous spots to take in the beauty and tranquility Juju's has to offer, and much more! Seriously, the toughest decision you will have to make here is choosing which comfortable spot you want to relax at, so stay a few days to experience them all! We will be staying here anytime we are visiting the area! Thank you again for sharing your little slice of heaven with us!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had another great stay at JuJus for our anniversary. It was very clean, peaceful, and relaxing. This is our new favorite spot when we visit family in Dothan. We will be back soon! Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful home and property with us."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don‚Äôt think twice about this place! It‚Äôs beautiful and clean. The renovation on this home was amazing. It has everything you need for a modern, comfortable stay yet they managed to keep so much of the old charm this home has to offer! The views are amazing and it‚Äôs so peaceful and relaxing. The hosts were super sweet and check in was a breeze. Definitely recommend this place!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved in here at Juju‚Äôs!! My husband is already wanting to come back for his birthday in January!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"JuJu's pond was more than what we imagined it to be. The house was so clean, they had snacks and bottles of water the kitchen upon our arrival, fully stocked coffee bar, and extra necessities that you may have forgot to pack (makeup remover, mouthwash, toothbrush, etc ). My son and husband took full advantage of the pond (way larger than I thought it was going be), our first day there my son caught a VERY nice bass. If you're looking for a little getaway outside of the city (but not a far drive) I would suggest staying here."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Matt‚Äôs home is absolutely beautiful. It is so peaceful and relaxing. They have thought of everything that you may need and have it on hand. The mints on the towel, snacks, and coffee were such a great touch. It really felt like home. We loved it so much that we made our next booking while we were there. We can‚Äôt wait to return!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a great, cute place out on a family farm. Very peaceful place to get away! Everything needed is there. Great cool AC, good kitchen with all items needed to cook, and very secure. Loved this place and me and my family will def be back! 10000A+++++******‚Äôs!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pond house was an absolute hit! Even though the pictures were amazing, when arriving at the pond house it was even better! The house was super spacious, it had at least 4 ambiances inside the house, and outdoors it had a fire place and two docks. It has a Publix relatively close, which you can go there and buy whatever needs you may have and after that you don‚Äôt have to leave the house to be honest. The place is definitely a go-to if you‚Äôre planning on chilling out with loved ones."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect, especially if you are looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of life. It‚Äôs such a peaceful place and it is set up so cozy and sweet!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words are truly not enough to describe how wonderful our long weekend at the pond house was. If you‚Äôre looking for somewhere to unplug and relax, this is the spot. Even with some rain, we were able to get outside and enjoy everything the property had to offer. The home has everything you need to feel comfortable (and to cook!). We can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Pond House is the absolute best if you are looking for quiet and beautiful scenery. I felt like I was miles out in the middle of a no where but actually I was just 15 minutes for Downtown Dothan. The house was immaculately cleaned, the grounds were beautifully landscaped and the views of the pond to die for. My grandson and granddaughter sure enjoyed the catch and release fish pond. And watching the turtles come up and down on the water.
So many windows to look out over the scenery was spectacular. A lovely screened in porch to sit and swing. Oh and the sunporch to just sit in the morning and enjoy your coffee!. I would give 10 stars out of a 5 star rating. We plan on coming back! Kitchen was stocked with everything you need to prepare food. Air conditioning worked great as well. The pond house is a gem!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a charming place! A very peaceful and relaxing getaway at Ju Ju's . Kids loved fishing, walking/running, and playing around the property. My husband also enjoyed the fishing and just all the nature of the outdoors. The cabin itself was very clean and fit our family well. I also loved all the windows and places to read and drink my coffee. Matt was also accommodating to our needs. We definitely hope to come back in the future. ."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed at!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,There are no words to accurately describe how nice and quant this house was. We had a family wedding in Dothan and we were just looking for a place to stay and get ready for the 3 days of festivities. The sweet little house became so much more. It‚Äôs a little piece of heaven hidden in the back of a family field with the most beautiful morning coffee view. The huge pond is so pretty and clean and there are so many places on it to relax even on a hot 90 degree day. The house was so clean and decorated so cute. It brought back many childhood memories. The host were so sweet and very prompt on responding to any questions. Even provided an iron on the spot when we forgot one. My 75 year old Dad is already talking about going back just for a few days of get a way.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful space and grounds, really enjoyed our time here."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"THIS IS A MUST STAY!
A GEM of a find!
Beautiful beyond, more spacious than pictures show, everything we needed & more, inside is cuteness overload, the land is beautiful, outdoors is refreshing , spacious, peaceful, serene- was definitely different drive into the place through a field BUT worth it!
I am a REGULAR renter at various places while traveling - THIS may be MY FAVORITE!
Thank you for Sharing JuJu' s Place !!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really can‚Äôt say enough about how great this place is. The house is charming, comfortable and clean. It‚Äôs set in the back of a large pasture with amazing views of the pond which pictures don‚Äôt really do it justice. We‚Äôve stayed at well over a dozen Airbnb‚Äôs and so far this has been our favorite. The hosts went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"PERFECT! PERFECT! PERFECT! JuJu's house was off-set and secluded enough to feel as though I was in my own private sanctuary and yet having Matt and Jesslyn right over the hill assured me enough to feel safe staying there by myself. Jesslyn even checked in with me after a huge storm blew through. I wanted a place to escape from the 'real' world to work on my new adventure of writing children's books. I love nature and having all the places to sit and walk was an extra bonus...so tranquil and serene. Matt was quick to respond with assistance and the house was neat and clean. Several things, inside and out, made me feel connected to JuJu's, so much so that I nearly cried when I left. I'll definitely go back!!!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great relaxing place with great outside places to relax. Beautiful place

My husband and I came as a weekend getaway for our anniversary, but have already been talking about coming back in the summer with our kids."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! If you want to unwind, quiet your mind and enjoy nature, JuJu's Pond is the place to do it. This cottage was warm and inviting from the moment you enter.

They helped us two separate times really late at night and got the fire started for us. A 100% going back to this place. We loved it!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This little pond house escape was just what we needed! Very welcoming from the first view and the coziness surrounds you when you walk through the door. This little gem I decorated thoughtfully and everything is intentional. The care is visible and every comfort addressed. We couldn't have asked for more. Just perfect! We look forward to our next visit.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place , spotless clean and way bigger than looks in pictures. 2 patios overlooking pristine lake , 2 docks , BBQ grill , funny thing , there‚Äôs a short driveway ,then you literally drive thru a well-manicured field , but then you‚Äôre in paradise !"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very peaceful place to stay, the Smith Family has a gem and we're so glad they're allowing others to share it! We spent 9 days here and miss it already!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The most amazing home ever! So serene and beautiful! The pictures do absolutely no justice. My husband enjoyed the sunrise on the pond while fishing. I enjoyed the dock with the complimentary coffee. The host (Matt) was courteous enough to get up at 4 am to open the doors for my husband and I since he locked all the doorsüò´! I can‚Äôt wait to return! The best hidden gem üíé in Dothan!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"JuJu‚Äôs Pond House is the perfect retreat!! The cabin is in the perfect location, secluded and yet still close enough to town for quick travel trips shopping, restaurants, downtown Dothan, and other attractions. The cabin was very clean and tastefully decorated. We really loved the personal touches around the house. The porches were very relaxing and we both enjoyed the porch swings. The property is breathtaking. We enjoyed a couple nice walks through the nature trails and even got to feed the mini horses. They love carrots! At night, we were able to relax at the fire pit and enjoyed the breathtaking view of the the stars. If you are looking for a relaxing getaway, JuJu‚Äôs Pond House is perfection!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for the perfect spot for my solo retreat and so glad I found this GEM! This place is so serene and beautiful! Every detail in the decor and on the property is so well done. It has all that you need for some quality time alone or with family (lots of toys for kids too) Big windows with natural light and views into all the nature around you. So many beautiful trees! Don‚Äôt miss the sunrises over the pond - breathtaking! I love the swings around the property and the swing chair on the porch. There‚Äôs a property map with a walking trail you can do, I believe it‚Äôs 2 miles around or so. They have a fire pit which I may have been the first Airbnb guest to use (I think) ‚Äî it‚Äôs just another one of many little nooks to relax and enjoy. I seriously can‚Äôt wait to head back!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You will be blown away by everything about Juju‚Äôs Pond House. The morning sunrise over the pond is a a marvel to behold. The story of the cabin adds a sweet feeling about the place. Everything is top notch, from the comfortable beds to the personal touches to the screened in indoor/outdoor area with the porch swing. We loved everything about it. Matt and his family did not miss a beat. Definitely one of our all time favorites on this cross country road trip we are on."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a hidden gem! We had a great time. There were sweet little touches all around the cabin that made us feel welcome and right at home. And the lake really does have fish!!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We absolutely loved this special place! We extended our stay right after we walked in the door for the first time and would have loved to have stayed even longer if we could! It was exactly what we needed! Highly recommend!
It was just a short drive to town and we loved having the tranquillity of the countryside to enjoy. It is such a beautiful property, and we took daily walks on the trails around the pond. The property is large and has several outdoor areas to enjoy and it‚Äôs kind of like having a private recreational park.
The interior of the cabin was so nice and cozy, with ample space. The hosts made sure to include everything needed for a great stay along with extra thoughtful touches that came in handy and made our stay more comfortable.
We would definitely love to stay here again if we have the opportunity!"

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Rebecca was a wonderful host, her home was spotless and she was super helpful and communicative throughout.

This space allowed our entire family to gather and watch football, enjoy meals together and just hang out. We highly recommend this host and her properties!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Everything about the property was perfect
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We needed a place to go quickly due to Hurricane on the coast. I booked Rebecca‚Äôs place and she had it ready same day! She was extremely responsive to any questions I had and very helpful! The town home was clean and the perfect size for us! We have two little kids that needed simple rooms free from clutter.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay! The house was beautiful, and the location was perfect for the things we did while in Dothan. Rebecca was very quick to respond when we had questions.
Thanks again!"
2023-07-01,2,Stayed about a week,"I do not want this to happen to anyone else. We attended a tennis tournament in Dothan, and when we arrived at the property, the ascetics of this property were exactly as I expected. However, after removing left over food from the oven, rewashing the dishes, attempting to get the electrical outlets to work, unstopping the guest toilet, after only one use, (which happened over 4 times during the visit), taking out the trash and completely cleaning the property with bleach, removing the bugs from the foyer, and placing the snail from the kitchen, outside, it wasn't bad.
With so many issues, dresser drawers not working correctly, in any room, bathtub stained and unclean, it seems the staff that works for Rebecca has sorely let her down, and this property was not inspected before we arrived, and that is on Rebecca.
Now to the positive, Dothan is clean, beautiful and fun.
I was charged a $200.00 cleaning fee for this property, they should be ashamed, as this was not cleaned properly."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place great area!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Nice spacious home with a good kitchen, laundry and nice bedrooms. It was very nice to have a garage also!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Enjoyed every minute of our stay. Will definitely book again

Everything from sharing tactful insights on which of the 3 nearby grocery stores would best accommodate my needs to following up early the next morning as a measure of courtesy to see if my trip was proceeding as planned are only two of many examples. As you can tell from the other comments, the design and decadence of the house is obvious and glaring. Hands down - probably the best AirBNB experience I've had thus far. Thank you!"

Larry and his wife were very easy to communicate with and proactively assisted with uncharacteristic freezing weather causing a water issue. The house was spacious, spotlessly clean and the beds were comfortable. There was off-street parking in the back just a few steps from the back door that is the entrance. We did notice the street in front seems to be a main thoroughfare for ambulances so if you're a light sleeper, you may want to bring a noise machine or earplugs. Overall, this house is highly recommended!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Jenie was a great host! I rented this place for my parents to stay at because it was within walking distance from me. She was very helpful in the check in process and my parents said they had a great stay!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Didn't realize there wasn't a TV so putting that here in case you don't read everything, either. ha! And maybe I was doing the internet wrong (??) but I couldn't get great signal in the bedroom. I will say, I didn't ask the host for help so that may be my fault. Also be advised you must park on the street.
All that to say-- it was a beautiful place to stay. Larger than I expected but somehow still very cozy. I really did enjoy the stay and I did get enough wifi to work while sitting at the dining room table, which really helped me work less in the first place. haha Also, somehow very quiet + comfy while being in someone's backyard. Would stay again. A great place for a decent price. Thanks!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Jenie‚Äôs place for two nights. The cottage was spacious, clean and private. The bed was very comfortable. I was able to make meals while there.

I hope to stay again next time I am in Dothan"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location!

Only two points to highlight: 1. There is no TV so it is perfect for a relaxing time away. There IS excellent WiFi, so bring a laptop or iPad and you will be fine! 2. Parking is on the street so be prepared to walk about 50 yards with your belongings. There are no stairs or hills, and it's a very easy walk.

Centrally located. Great neighborhood. Charming. A good book and lazy weekend I am back at Jeanie‚Äôs cottage!!!
2020-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was nice, but the pictures are misleading. You will be parking at the road and walking down the driveway beside the owners home. It was difficult for me due to the amount of items I had. I was traveling for two weeks straight, and this was my third stop. The fire pit was not working, and its right next to the owners home. The picture gives you the illusion that it‚Äôs private, but it‚Äôs right next to their house, and the door .
There is not TV in this cottage, and the place was dark. I ended up buying lightbulbs for lights burned out, which was many. This gives me the impression that the owners do not take pride in their place to rent, and feels like the guest comes last.
The kitchen needed more items, one big one was that there were no plastic bowls to put leftovers food in.
I was there for 5 days, and on my arrival, I only had two wash clothes. I ended up buying my own, and I also bought dish towels as well.
The bed was comfortable, and that was a plus. The shower was very tricky, as it was very difficult to find where the knob position was for full hot.
This cottage is located in the back yard of the owners home, so privacy is difficult."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This little cottage was such a blessing to us. Dothan was also a good surprise of things to do and see as well as towns nearby. We were mainly looking for a place close to family where we could have our own little get-away, but it turned out to be a great place to explore as well. The cottage was a delightful stay with all the amenities and cleanliness you would expect in a 5-star condo. The host was very helpful and always responded quickly to any questions we had. They also respected our privacy impeccably, although we love to get to know hosts. We highly recommend Jenie's place."

The host was quick to respond to whatever I needed (which wasn‚Äôt much because it had EVERYTHING) only downfall is no TV but there is WiFi and we had a laptop.

Jenie and Hubert have a beautiful, cozy and comfortable guest house. The large dining table was a perfect workspace for me. The kitchen has everything you need. And the house is in a gorgeous, old Southern neighborhood.
Highly recommended!"

2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our visit at the ""Oak's Nest"". The cottage is really very lovely but the most enticing feature is the peacefulness. It is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy each other's company. The next town over, Eufulah (sp?) has a great tour of historic architecture that was terrific. Ultimately, the peace and quiet and serene beauty of the cottage was what we enjoyed most. We plan to return again. Thank you, Jenie."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were so glad to stay at Claire‚Äòs Cottage! The donkeys were so fun to watch, especially for our little one. We really appreciated that we felt separate from the city while still being so close. The privacy gate added to that feeling of security. Would stay again."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Claire was a good host. I‚Äôve never stayed in an Airbnb that was connected to a host‚Äôs house and didn‚Äôt realize that we would not have any privacy due to that. However, the place was beautiful. We were under tornado warning and there was no safe place."

We only stayed one night on our way through, but we arrived at 3:00 and relaxed, watched a movie, popped dinner in the microwave, went to bed and had a most restful night‚Äôs sleep in the absolutely comfy bed. The morning‚Äôs shower was great with great water pressure and a spotless bathroom. We made coffee in the AM and headed out for our final destination. We will definitely stay here again as the price is a great one and the cottage is wonderful. Claire is so responsive and friendly. Close to shopping and restaurants, although we didn‚Äôt use them."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The most adorable cottage tucked into a private quiet corner. Plus there are Donkeys on the property which our little kiddo loved. We were moving from out of state so we had our animals with us and there is lots of property to walk the dogs. Also we had plenty of space for us to park. We were so comfortable and cozy during our stay and the host was super easy to get a hold of.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,would definitely stay again.

2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The cottage was almost perfect for what I was looking for. I loved the no contact check in and check out. It was extremely private and very quiet. The donkeys were adorable. The price is amazing. Unfortunately, there were issues with the shower. The shower curtain was covered with mold as was the window frame around the transom window in the shower. In the morning, I took a quick 10 minute shower. After about 30 minutes, my son took a shower. It appears in this short time the hot water heater went out. My son had no hot water for his shower, and we continued to be without hot water for the remainder of the morning. I contacted the owners, and the hot water was restored by check out. It definitely put a damper on what would otherwise have been a rather perfect experience. The owners did not offer compensation for the inconvenience making it clear that this had never happened to them before. The insistence that this had never happened before made me feel slightly accused of dishonesty."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Country feel minutes from the city. Loved it
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Claire's was the perfect stop on the way home to Florida

We will definitely be back!"

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,I was only there for one night so I wasn‚Äôt able to take part in the surroundings however the accommodations were good and it worked great for my needs.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,These owners are amazing! They were super flexible and helpful. Their place is so peaceful and safe. Best of all- they have donkeys that you can interact with! The town of Dothan is fun and interesting (it‚Äôs the peanut capital) and Claire‚Äôs is definitely a hidden gem. There were 2 adults and 1 child in our party and we were there for 5 days and we have no complaints (except that our 5 yo now wants a pet donkey ü´£). We arrived in the middle of the night and they were extremely accommodating. It felt like we were staying at the home of an old friend while they were away. I hope that we get to go back very soon!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice spot for a night or two. Plenty of room to walk the pup although.......AL in July doesn't exactly invite spending time outdoors. Claire responded in a friendly way when I had a question. Photos are accurate. I felt like I was visiting my elderly aunt (NOT a bad thing) which indicates the furnishings could use some updating. I certainly had a nice stay, felt safe and had my privacy. I would consider it again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful time staying at Claire's with our two large sized dogs. Would highly recommend and we will love to stay there again next time we are in Dothan. Cheers!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Seclusion but close to the circle is what sold us initially, but after meeting and interacting with the donkeys we will be a 10/10 return again! Can‚Äôt thank Claire and Kingsley enough for their hospitality l!"

2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet and peaceful. A great get-away from big city life. Loved the donkeys and that we could bring our pup. We visited several nearby small towns, local restaurants, coffee shops., and beautiful botanical gardens. A real home away from home."

2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre looking for a quite place that is out of the way while still close to so much, this is the perfect spot! The hosts were friendly and very welcoming! Highly recommend anyone to stay here"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Claire‚Äôs Cottage was exactly as described - it‚Äôs actually larger than it seems in the photos. The entire apartment was clean and comfortable. The bedroom is entirely separate from the main living area where the futon is.
Claire was super responsive to my messages and was thoroughly helpful and kind! It was a treat to be able to look out the window and see the paddock with her miniature donkeys (which you can pet and feed, if you‚Äôd like)."

Instructions were easy to follow and the guidebook on the coffee table was a great way to know what was expected as a guest.
Saw a chipmunk üêø on the way out too üíö"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic place to stay. It‚Äôs roughly a 45 mins drive to Rucker and it‚Äôs in a fenced in property. Amazing spot for my wife and I and our 2 pups. We loved the hospitality and the place was beautiful for what we needed. An entire kitchen was good enough for the basic uses. We had a good sized bed and were comfortable. Would recommend to anyone on a weekend visit. Would absolutely visit again. Highly recommend this place to stay. We were able to speak to one of the homeowners and they‚Äôre extremely kind and out going.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The setting was beautiful - a charming cottage in the woods. The cottage itself had all of the details that you could want. It was very quaint and comfortable. There's a binder in the cottage that gives you all the information you need. A plus was the sweet donkeys in a pasture close to the cottage, and Claire's encouragement (in the binder) to interact with them! This was so much better than a hotel of any kind! Private and quiet, and it seemed very safe, unlike you sometimes can feel at a hotel."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Claire was super responsive and kind. Her instructions were clear. We stayed overnight while traveling a long distance and it was a perfect space as a family of 4. The kids slept like rocks according to my daughter on the futon and my husband and I slept well too. It was plenty spacious. It is a pet friendly location so keep that in mind if you are sensitive to scents. The breathe easy welcome sign and sign welcoming our family was a nice personal touch. Would book again.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Me & my children loved our stay & we wish we would‚Äôve booked for the whole weekend. The place looked exactly like the pictures and was very clean. The hosts was very friendly, understanding, communicated & responded very quickly! The location was the most excellent place. We felt extremely safe tucked off with the Secure gate. It was like living in the peaceful country but right in the city closed to gas stations, grocery store, hospital (which we end up needing), food spots & other places. My children loved the beautiful friendly donkeys. They talked ask about them all night long & just couldn‚Äôt wait until morning time to go see them again. I swear they haven‚Äôt stop telling family & friends all about the donkeys either! We will most definitely book again if available around our visit dates. Thanks for making us feel right at home‚Ä¶"

They even had a few snacks for us and provided coffee. The hot tub worked perfectly. Not knowing how to select bedrooms we decided to throw one round of 3 darts and the highest score got first choice. Ideally the 3rd bedroom daybed isn‚Äôt always going to be suitable for tall adults but we made it work. We hope to come back next year for the Peanut Bowling Tournament.

A dog-friendly home with a fenced yard was a HUGE concern for us and is THE reason we chose this property. For those who have dogs and may be wondering, the backyard is securely fenced and large enough for a dog (or dogs) to run and play.
If you have any questions, just message them. They will get right back to you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you‚Äôre looking for a nice place to stay while in Dothan,Al trust me when I tell you RUNN TO YHE OTHER AT THIS 3 bedroom 2 bathroom Airbnb.

I LOVED IT WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Overall our 1-night stay was great. For the price point and it‚Äôs location a great deal. Only a handful of areas could have been improved upon.
1. One of the toilets was not thoroughly cleaned as expected.
2. All the different bathroom towel types were just stacked in a big pile in each of the bathrooms.
3. Several of the electronic appliances were unplugged and it proved challenging in some cases reattaching to the wall.
4. No hand soap in either bathroom.
5. Would not recommend this home for an elderly person or someone with mobility issues since the steps getting into the home were very difficult for one of the persons in my party.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! Our stay at Lance and Jessica‚Äôs was so great! The home was wonderfully stocked and our hosts were so thoughtful with their details. We rented their getaway home the week before our destination wedding and their clean, organized home could not have been better for what could have been a crazy week. It was so nice to have a good space for games, like ping pong, or sit and relax in front of the huge TV. The beds were very comfortable and it was one of the best-stocked airbnbs we‚Äôve ever stayed at.
Thank you so much guys. Your place was great!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful stay! The house was beautiful. Our family really enjoyed the game room. Great location as well. Secluded yet easy to find and close to everything.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was great. We were with a 6 month old and not having to pack extra items was a big plus!! It was a nice neighborhood. The little extras were so welcoming. Thank you so much for opening your home and being awesome hosts!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Lances place was perfect for the occasion my mother and I love the location. It was very clean and had all of the amenities we needed to make ourselves at home. The trip was a success because we stayed at this location and I recommend anyone who is traveling in Alabama to stay at this location

It‚Äôs furnished very nicely and they had a welcome sign greeting you in the living room and a Thank You card on the dinner table with snacks !!!! That was pretty special to us !!!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful place and a real value -!! Thanks for having us
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Awesome stay! Thanks for sharing your home with us
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay on our way back from Florida. The home was immaculate and nicely decorated with everything we needed. The location was in a very nice neighborhood where we could take our dog for a walk. She also enjoyed the fenced in backyard to run around in! There was nice welcome gift and card and snacks. The beds were very comfortable. We will definitely return if coming that way.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful getaway we loved it!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place was top notch! We received the sweetest personalized experience here. Thoughtful communication. Yummy snacks and a very much appreciated bottle of wine! Very welcoming and clean home. We have lots of memories with Family Game Night too and this home provided just what we needed to have a small family reunion while getting together to welcome a new family addition. We always played Ping Pong when our children were growing up and so of course we had a lot of nostalgic fun with Ping Pong here. The home is in a tranquil area, but also close to everything we needed to enjoy our stay. We wanted to try out the hot tub to rest our aching backs from our travels, but we got too busy visiting and catching up. I am certain it would have been wonderful. The beds were super comfy along with the softest sheets ever! It was definitely a getaway home where we will always remember what a wonderful stay we had. We will definitely book more stays here in the future."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We opened the door to Jessica and Lance's home and immediately felt right at home. There were lots of welcoming touches. We especially enjoyed the hot tub! Comfy furniture and beds.
We are avid thrifters, and found our fill (hard to do) of fabulous thrift stores. Folklore Brewery was a fun, fun place to visit; I highly recommend it! We found plenty of great restaurants. Dothan is such a friendly place; we didn't encounter one single rude person.
We plan to visit at least annually. Jessica and Lance are Super Hosts, indeed!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was as advertised. Nice quiet location which seamed like a safe location. Very clean and spacious.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We travel several times a year and stay in an Airbnb either for our destination, or the stops on the way, for years now. This is a top favorite! Everything as described. Felt like a home away from home. Walking in to a lit Christmas tree, the cutest decor and finishings. The personalized welcome note and sign. The snacks were a hit with my 3 teenagers and the bottle of wine was a hit for hubby and I. Other little extras around the home if you needed them. Games galore, countless tv options and ping pong! We never got to the hot tub, but that‚Äôs a bonus too. Plenty of room for our family of 5. I highly recommend this place."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay in as many weeks. Ideal stopover when traveling from north to Florida and back, especially with dogs!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved everything!
Included the games, welcoming snacks, wine, message on the board, kids toys and suplies. Its the most kids friendly house we had experienced with all the Airbnb we ever had.
Was great to have a hot tub with the could weather.
Thanks for warming welcoming in every detail. Keep on this business :)"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lance & Jessica‚Äôs getaway was awesome! We came back to my hometown to visit for Christmas and this house made me feel right at home! The attention to detail, the amenities and hospitality were much more than 5 stars! We had everything we could have needed for our stay and then some! My husband loved the game room and the backyard was very spacious! The neighborhood is so quiet and charming! I can‚Äôt recommend staying here enough and will definitely be back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emergency trip to Dothan to support a medical emergency. We were incredibly lucky to find Lance‚Äôs home. It met our needs perfectly. Lance was incredibly responsive and went out of his way to support us in a critical time. Mind you‚Ä¶..this is the Holiday season. He and his family went the extra mile.
I hope to return under different circumstances to enjoy his home‚Ä¶.and Dothan."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a perfect little stopover on our way to Florida, with a family of four and two dogs. The place is clean, very well-stocked and cozy. Lots of entertainment and a great fenced-in yard."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house. It was clean & comfy. Hosts left us some snacks and coffee even, which was a sweet touch üëåüèº Great communication from host and they were very accommodating & super quick to respond. Thank you!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was probably the best air bnb I have stayed at yet! Such a cute home and the owners were very nice and responsive! Hope to stay there again in the future!
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,So many great touches like the personal message on the board. Would 100% recommend this to anyone. One of the best airbnbs I‚Äôve ever stayed in.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home and host. Will be back.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica and Lance's place was clean, quiet, and comfortable. My brother and I greatly appreciated the hosts' kind and helpful messages, and we both enjoyed the plentiful snacks, supersized TV, and free streaming services. We didn't have time to fire up the grill or take a (much-needed) soak in the hot tub, but maybe next time! If you're looking for a great home away from home while in Dothan, we highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hands down one of the best airbnbs I‚Äôve stayed in. The hospitality is unmatched! The hosts were amazing, the house was so cozy and felt like home. This place is the place you want to stay. The hosts went above and beyond with the amenities and it is so much better than the advertisement."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If 10 stars or more was possible then this host would earn them.
My family felt right at home from the time we parked our vehicle. Adorable Christmas decor was in the front yard - just made us feel welcome.
The house is beautifully decorated but not over the top. The furniture is super comfy.
The use of a stocked laundry room is a plus. The washer and drier are very nice and easy to use.
Anything you need is available in the kitchen. Having both a Keurig and a coffee pot is a great perk for us - hubby likes ‚Äúbrown water coffee‚Äù, the rest of us love full dark brew. So all of us were happy with our coffee (thank y‚Äôall for thinking of having 2 coffee makers)!
Beds are very comfortable. The bathroom offers many products to choose from for the perfect shower or bath.
My family enjoyed a relaxing fun time here!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was exactly as I envisioned it to be and more! Dothan is a charming city with so many things to see and do
But when we wanted some down time to sit and visit and enjoy a great cup of coffee, it was in our home, away from home. This home is immaculate and just the right size for food, fun and fellowship. All of the board games, card games, and ping pong were so appreciated for one of the all day rain days we had during our visit. We really enjoyed Ray's Restaurant and their cheese grits. Jessica and Lance were perfect hosts, there were so many added touches throughout the home. They really deserve ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê!
I would not hesitate to return for a visit or recommend it to my family and friends."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,we totally loved the place! Ping pong was a Big hit with the kids. Definitely would like to stay there again!! Jessica and Lance were awesome welcoming hosts!!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The beds are comfortable, so many board games, a ping pong table, feels like a home away from home, and the hosts clearly paid attention to detail. It felt kinda like staying at my grandmas house without grandma being there, if you can imagine that. One of the best air BNB stays we‚Äôve had to date, if not the best. Also for families coming, they had toys available and a pack and play. They‚Äôre hospitality is unmatched!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is everything that was advertised. Great place to stay! The hosts thought of everything and were very accessible and helpful. The hot tub was amazingly relaxing. The ping pong table, darts, and the bar were incredible. Pound for pound this place is one of the best deals I have stayed in on Air BnB. You get a lot of bang for your buck! 5 stars for sure!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"There are no words to describe how awesome this short stay was! Jessica and Lance have thought through every detail
Of what makes someone feel at home and special. We came to run a half marathon in Dothan and the entire experience was so wonderful! The bed was comfortable, the hot tub was welcoming and we loved the whole experience!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a cute house! We had 4 adults and 3 young children. Plenty of space for us. The front and backyard are a bonus for kids, lots of space to run and play. Neighborhood is quiet and welcoming. Fully stocked of EVERYTHING you could ask for, and if it‚Äôs not there, just ask and you shall receive! Hosts respond faster than most my friends when I text! Really great for kids with toys inside and out! This was our first experience using Airbnb and if all hosts are as great as they were this is the only way I will vacation!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jessica‚Äôs place was perfect after a long day of traveling! The bed was so comfy, I fell asleep in minutes. I will definitely stay here again the next time I‚Äôm in Dothan."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome experience!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You won‚Äôt find better hosts than Jessica and Lance. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay! The whole house is well organized, stocked, and set up for easy use. It very much feels like a friend is letting you use their house for a bit. The bin of toys was a huge hit with our little one. The hot tub and pool table were great. Jessica thought of everything I forgot and then some. So kind and thoughtful and we‚Äôll definitely be back again."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,A very clean house in a quiet neighborhood. Essentials very well stocked. Would stay here again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is fantastic! Perfect, quiet location but close to everything. The hosts are BEYOND wonderful leaving everything you could possibly need including a welcome basket and toiletries. Kids toys and games are also a great perk! Very easy to communicate with. We will be staying here again in the future."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the best if not the best bnb‚Äôs I have stayed at! Ping pong table and hot tub for the win! Not to forget how well stocked the house was! The little touches really set it off.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful experience. The hot tub and ping pong table were so fun. Lance and Jessica were very responsive to any needs we had. The living room TV is enormous and was fun for watching college football. Will definitely be staying here anytime I'm in Dothan.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was amazing. The host even left some snacks and wine to welcome us. Everything was wonderful. Would definitely stay there again when I come back to visit family.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, literally had every extra you can think of. Super accommodating and quick response time."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,I loved this place so much!! Lance and Jessica made sure my room was SUPER dark when I told them I was a nightshift worker. Perfect house for daytime sleeping!!! The neighborhood was quiet and close to the hospital. Relaxing in the hot tub after work was the best and they have everything a person could need! Thank you for an awesome week ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our stay
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,So pleased with our stay! The house was amazing as were Jessica and Lance. We will definitely be back!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"we loved this house! good location, everything was tidy, hot tub was nice, ping pong was fun, rooms were spacious!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"After a long 16 hour drive, it was awesome to relax in a more than well stocked house! The temp in the house was set perfectly! Made for a nice, well rested night! Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the game room and hot tub‚Ä¶ maybe next time!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Extraordinarily wonderful! Lance and Jess are the best hosts I have ever come across. We travel to TN from FL at least four times a year and was excited to find their home. Location and space is always a necessity for us in our layovers and their gorgeous property fit our needs. So many amenities, if you forget anything, they have it there! Full kitchen, games, books, ample towels, refreshments and snacks, toiletries, washer/dryer, A HOT TUB, a sewing kit?!
This is my new first choice for all future travels, hoping it‚Äôs always available.
If you are like me and read reviews before booking, please take my advice‚Ä¶. You MUST stay here! üòä"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Needed a quiet place to prepare for a medical board exam. I stayed here before, so I knew I could count on a solid place for my beast mode studying. Once again, Jessica and Lance came through in a pinch. Highly recommend for work or play. The place is highly equipped to meet all your needs."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and very clean. Would definitely stay here again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house and hosts were amazing! We really enjoyed our stay and hope to definitely come back!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I must say if I could give this place 6 stars I would. I have stayed in many airbnb in the US and out of the country. This would be in my top two. The pictures don't do it justice. It is very tastefully decorated, flat screens in all rooms and everything you may need or have forgotten from a toothbrush to a sewing kit.
Jessica and Lance were the perfect host and really present an Airbnb as it should be and above.
If you see any bad reviews on this property, just keep scrolling. I can't think of a single complaint. Will always be my first go to when I come to Dothan."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of my best experiences with AirBnb! Great safe area in a family oriented neighborhood, house was very clean and owner went out of her way to leave nice notes, snacks and refreshments! Several indoor games to play, and beds were very comfortable. I would say a very home feeling experience."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,They have everything you need and probably want here and it was nice and homey.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If all airbnb's were like this one, I would never pay for a hotel again. Nowhere could you pay a standard nightly hotel price and get a 3 bedroom house with a dedicated study area and top notch quality and standards. The place was designed with class, sophistication, and fine attention to detail. In addition, both Jessica and Lance get 5 stars for really getting the concept of high quality and hospitality. I have worked at several 5 star hotels in my career, such as the Ritz Carlton, and I would have thought they had top of the line training in going above and beyond and exceeding all expectations. Ritz Carlton trained me that by exceeding all expectations is how to build repeat clientele year after year, and this is exactly why I would look no further than this place each time returning to this area. I reached out to this couple beforehand explaining my needs for a quiet place to stay, and they really got it, and created the magic weekend I needed to complete my task."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing and the hosts Lance and Jessica were awesome‚Ä¶ totally went out of their way to make sure my daughter and I were comfortable and had more than we needed‚Ä¶ even had a care package delivered to the front door‚Ä¶ I highly recommend staying here if your in the area.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica and Lance are amazing hosts! Communication was excellent, and their home was amazing. Such an awesome time to be had there. Highly recommend and look forward to going back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazing and extremely big and clean place to stay in. Overly impressed with the architecture and layout. Well recommended.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay if you‚Äôre in Dothan. Large and very comfortable house. Very clean and had all the required amenities. I would absolutely stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed staying in this home for a weekend tournament. It was close to the fields and lots of restaurants. It was the perfect home base for our family of four!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and will stay again when back in town
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Will definitely be back.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was an awesome place for a family with kids to stay for 7 days. This is better than hotels we stayed at in the area it is close to everything.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean. Better parking than most Airbnb‚Äôs in this area. I paid a little more than I normally do in the area but I don‚Äôt feel like it was justified for the place. I have to add, the shower in the bathroom I used was amazing."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very nice home and possibly the cleanest I have stayed in.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,The go to home when in this area for sure!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is our 2nd time staying here! We always enjoy it and will be returning next year! Excellent host, we love the neighborhood very secure. The home is extremely clean and accommodating for our special needs. Beds are super comfy!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stay in a lot of Airbnb's. This one is pretty flawless. Very comfortable with plenty of space for the family, or in my case, a few guys on a business trip to the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, ultra clean house. Would definitely stay again. Loved every bit of this property."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,The house is beautiful and large great place to stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Elena‚Äôs home is beautiful! It is just like the pictures and has everything you need. Fantastic location too! Lovely home and very responsive host. We hope to be back.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Elena went above and beyond than just providing cozy, comfortable and superb clean house. She accommodated request with extra towels quickly: it was six of us with three massy tennis players. And she also provided a blender that we needed for a smoothie. She did not have to, however it was a kind gesture of her.
We had great time on and off the court in Dothan and inthat safe neighbourhood where Elena‚Äôs house located.
Being from Los Angeles, I can share with you, that Elena is special: GIVING and hospitable.
We will be back to this town.
Btw must try restaurant ‚ÄúLa Favorita‚Äù
Warmly

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Completley blown away by this place. Home was impeccably clean and well organized on top of all the gorgeous updates that have been performed. This was tremendously nicer & more comfortable than any hotel we'd stayed at on our journey from NC to TN, FL and AL. Having the bunk beds near the master bedroom was sheer brilliance as our kids felt at ease being nearby at bedtime with us staying in a new environment. Highly, highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very clean and homey and host was very responsive.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was great and in great shape, it was well worth the cost seeing that my wife is a perfectionist and checks everything out before spending one night, but she had nothing but high remarks for your place, good job. It got me some browny points with the wife."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was beautiful and very comfortable. We will definitely be staying again.

2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Elena was a lovely host !! Oooh I wish I could visit every weekend I absolutely love this house ü•∞
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were so blessed to find this Dothan gem while competing in a tennis tournament recently. Elena has set the bar high with an elegant, renovated house that looked brand new. The wood floors, patterned bathroom tile, incredible showers,soaking tub, and great lighting fixtures were some of the many great features. The layout was fantastic for several of us to all spread out. If that‚Äôs not enough, Elena added even more special touches like a welcome snack basket and fresh flowers. I can‚Äôt say enough about this fantastic property!"
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"I know one can feel uncertain booking a place with little to no reviews, but this risk was worth taking! The house is freshly renovated so I was among the first ones to stay there.
Everything was perfect ‚Äì spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated, and comfortable.
Beds and pillows are high quality and super comfortable. We really liked the rain shower head.
Elena is a great host, welcoming and helpful. She thought of everything a guest might need including bathroom essentials (body wash, shampoo, lotion) and kitchen basics (olive oil, spices, salad dressings, coffee and tea). A welcome snack basket was a nice bonus.
The house has a quiet yet central location. A lot of restaurants are just a few minutes away.
I highly recommend this place and would book again!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this house is top notch and it‚Äôs located in a very nice neighborhood.
The furnishings are top of the line. It is very clean and nicely decorated. The quality of the amenities make it a very relaxing place to stay.
The beds are very comfortable to sleep in. I could tell that everything in the house has been recently updated. Everything is high-end, from the washer and dryer, refrigerator, bathrooms and beds.
The owner was very accommodating and responded quickly to any messages. I give this house a ‚ÄòFive Star‚Äô rating in every category across the board."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The listing is a freshly remodeled home in an established neighborhood. The bedrooms are very large and the home has plenty of space for everything and then some to spare. The neighborhood seemed peaceful, safe, and quiet. The house was stocked with everything needed and furnishings were new and comfortable. I did not meet co-hosts Reginald and Deborah in person but their communication was excellent and they both seem to be genuinely wonderful people. My family had a mishap that was our fault, but they were so very understanding and seemed more concerned about my family having a great stay than anything else. I wish them success and recommend to them to everyone."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The townhouse was spectacular. My children called it a resort, probably due to the very modern features, the splash of timeless elegance in the decor, the beautiful glassed-in back patio, and the serine water feature. There were small yet prominent details that makes Chadwick Place a gem. The mirrors lit up, all the hardware was a black sleek design, beside the beds were small trays with elegant water canisters and cups, in the bedrooms the 6 foot stand alone gold rimmed mirrors and linen bed covers were reminiscent of the Netflix show ‚ÄúBridgeton.‚Äù
The home alone is not what sets apart Chadwick Place. It is Jeff. Jeff was a kind and gracious host. I never saw him, but he was ever attentive via the app. He extended kindness and compassion to us when my child got sick. He was accommodating in unexpected ways. I cannot quite find the words to express my gratitude to Jeff. We were on medical holiday for my child and in our most vulnerable times, this kind soul, met all my family‚Äôs needs."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Expectations were met once again with our wonderful host. I was not disappointed by this home as it was my second time staying. I love the location it‚Äôs very peaceful. The itinerary provided was helpful on our trip with nearby attractions. The home is beautiful and relaxing, I hate I could stay longer."

We spent most of our time at our daughter‚Äôs place but Jeff had approved our daughter and husband to come eat and relax if we decided to do that. Beds were comfortable. Air conditioning worked well. We love the area at the back and removed our shoes there each day. I walked all over the neighborhood and it was beautiful and people were friendly! We will definitely keep this place in mind when we return in the future!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family of 5 came for Thanksgiving and a surprise birthday party for my grandmother. It was spacious enough for all of us. Our teenage son slept on the pull out bed which he said was comfortable. The home was beautiful. Had everything you needed to be comfortable. Beautiful finishes and lovely details in the bathroom. The outdoor space is peaceful and private. If we stayed longer and it was warmer outside, that‚Äôs probably where I would have spent most of my time. Jeff was also easy to communicate with and their house rule instructions were clear and easy to find. Would definitely stay here again if we‚Äôre in the area."

It was clear lots of work and care went into the place. We felt comfortable and right at home.
The neighborhood was nice and quiet, not very walkable but it was near some nice trails.
We'd stay there again and recommend it to others!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful that I found Jeff‚Äôs beautiful and peaceful home. My grandmother was transferred to Dothan from an out of town hospital so I needed a place to stay close to her. I stayed for over a week. I worked remotely from the house during the day with no internet issues and traveled daily back and forth to the hospital. I loved coming back home at the end of the sometimes stressful day. His place is chic, newly updated, and so very comfortable. Looks just like the pictures and the back porch- to die for! I had coffee on the porch every morning with the fan on and even met several of the passing neighbors on walks and they were very kind! Jeff was quick to respond and incredibly accommodating to some special requests based on some last min changes with my grandmothers situation. I would absolutely recommend Jeff‚Äôs home. He was a wonderful host."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful. I was able to extend my stay for longer than expected. Please see previous review.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff was a very communicative Host. The home was very clean and modern, tucked away in a very quiet neighborhood. about 8 minutes away from Dothan downtown area which provided lots to do, and the pricing beats most of the local hotels. 10/10"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice simple accomodations. Will definitely book w/ them again.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,A very cozy and well stocked little carriage house. Our second time staying here.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This rental is absolutely amazing! I was in town for 3 months and the apartment was perfect for both living and working from home. Kitchen had all the necessary utensils and tools along with full size fridge, range, oven, and microwave. The patio was great to sit on and feel like you‚Äôre isolated in the trees. The location is in a nice neighborhood, just a few minutes away from downtown and close to a lot of great restaurants and other services. Be sure to check out West End ‚Äì a wine bar less than a mile away, good for meeting locals and learning more about the area.
Hands down the best thing about renting here is the amazing family that hosts you. Tommy and Sarah were so welcoming and provided all sorts of information and recommendations. They were always quick to reply if I had any questions. They made this stay extra special."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,I loved my stay! The house is very cozy with everything extra I could need/want. The neighborhood was very safe and quiet. Would definitely stay again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I have nothing but good things to say about this wonderfully warm, pretty, and cozy cottage! It feels private although is close to hosts' house, and the neighborhood is very nice. Sarah and Tommy were great hosts and were immediately responsive to any questions I had, despite it being the Christmas holidays when I'm sure they were very busy!
The location is convenient to just about everything. Those who know Dothan know that the ""circle"" (Ross Clark Circle) can be a nightmare when traffic is heavy, which is most of the time. But from the cottage location I found easy routes to everything I needed without having to be on the circle. That's a huge plus in my book!
I highly recommend the Cozy Carriage House!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very comfortable and clean place in a great central location. Check in was simple, communication was great. We would stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tommy and Sarah‚Äôs place was just right for our quick trip through Dothan. Had the amenities that was perfect for a couple - comfy bed, blackout shades, couch and chairs for lounging, smart tv, table for meals and working and a kitchen with all the goodies."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an adorable

I stayed here for a week after driving/moving from the Northwestern US. The carriage house is in a lovely historic neighborhood, full of charm and character, a short drive from everything in Dothan. I would have moved in forever if I could have.
There were quite a few hiccups during my first week in Alabama, but Tommy and Sarah responded with grace and extended a helping hand. Because of them, Alabama immediately felt like home, something I expected to take months or even years.

2018-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I loved my stay at the carriage house. The place is tucked away on a gravel side street, the second floor views make you feel like you're in a little treetop haven. It's so tranquil, you would never know you're just a short drive from Publix, Target, and other big name stores. The neighborhood is great for taking walks and enjoying the unique architecture of the adorable historic homes in the area.
The carriage house itself was surprisingly spacious in the living room, bedroom, and closet. I stayed for extended periods while traveling to Dothan for work and never felt cramped. It had the feel of a tiny home- everything you need, just enough space, big on charm.
My time here was made even better by the hosts, Sarah and Tommy who are incredibly warm and inviting. They were so kind. Questions and minor issues were always addressed promptly and I never had any major issues over the course of my extended stay.
My only complaint is that I can't pick up this little place and take it with me on my next travel assignment. If I'm ever back in Dothan, I hope to stay again!
Thank you Sarah and Tommy"
