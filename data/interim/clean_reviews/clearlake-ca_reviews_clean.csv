2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul’s place was just as described in the listings. It was a great place to hang out with friends for a long weekend in Lake County. Paul was very responsive to messages and helpful when we had an issue with the fire alarm.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot for a night on our travels on the west coast - host very helpful and communicative
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The perfect place to relax. nothing overly special, not modern, but absolutely perfect. comfortable, relaxing, and that view! only wish it was closer to the water, but being so high up the hill gives you really good view."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place with views! Nice and quiet! A little rough to get there but overall a fantastic place!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great view. The place is serene and exactly as shown in the pictures.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic views of the lake in a very nice accomodation. We especially enjoyed having dinner outside on the deck and petting the friendly cat. A note about the area, the roads are rough but mostly drivable except for Mountain View Rd. If your GPS tells you to drive there, go another way unless you have an all wheel drive vehicle."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay overlooking the lake.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice and quiet spot, beautiful view, clean place. Paul was very helpful, will come back"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent two great days here.
To get to the accommodation you have to drive a few bumpy dirt roads. However, this was already communicated by Paul in advance and well shown with pictures where we need to go exactly. So it was no problem. Unfortunately, we didn't arrive until it was already dark. Since the dirt roads are on the mountain and it goes steeply downhill right next to the path, the drive was a little adventurous.
The place is a little out of the way and therefore super quiet and private. The apartment is spacious and therefore offers plenty of space for children to play. There is everything you need. In addition, there is a great terrace around the house with seating and a barbecue.
The absolute highlight of this place is the view of the lake below. Simply fantastic...
Glad to come back and a clear recommendation from me."

Amazing views, comfortable beds, cozy heat sources, good lightning for night time, nice bathroom, great deck and outdoor area. The layout is really well sorted out and furniture and art throughout the cabin flow well. Kitchen is nice and we have made some bomb meals here. Cleanup is easy with the sink right next to oven.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Paul's home was wonderful for our stay. Everything was clean, tidy, and the house felt welcoming. The internet worked perfect! I had a work virtual meeting without any connectivity issues. The road up to the house is bumpy and you do have to make some tight turns, but it's a short road and you'll have no trouble if you take your time. This was a perfect gem and we'd definitely would come back."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was as described beautiful views, private and peaceful. Exactly what we needed to unwind and spend quality time as a family.
My parents especially loved the environment the beautiful view of the clearlake and the setting.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, the view is amazing"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Second time here and it is still my favorite place, this house has a unique view to relax and enjoy the view, everything you need, clean, easy check in
I definitely recommend it"
2023-09-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"First off, Although the listing says 2 bathrooms, This place has only 1 bathroom. That's misleading info. And the shower in this bathroom is so small and weird. Water shower is either too.hot or too cold. We could barely shower my toddler there. Also, anyone above 200lb cannot step in to take a shower. Needs an urgent renovation.
Then comes dirty kitchen, unclean dishes and the biggest concern - safety. The main door has only one lock and anyone with the code can open it from outside. Given how isolated, in the wild the place is, we felt the need for more security.
The snacks that the host had left for us (which we were initially pleased about) were all expired.
Apart from the location, I cannot say anything good about this place . It needs work and i'm going to avoid this airbnb next time I visit clearlake."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing time! Very beautiful view. Paul was super friendly, polite, and responsive. Highly recommend."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved this staying in this home.
The view of the lake and mountains was beautiful and the provided telescope really did it for me. It was clean and comfortable and I will definitely be considering staying again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing. It is up in the hills yet just a few streets down from the lake. Super remote and quiet, with incredible views of the lake. It is big, two bedrooms, lots of space, a nice outdoor deck and small side yard. Kitchen has everything you would need. It is very clean. For the money this place is a steal. It definitely feels like a home and not some sterile hotel room. Highly recommend it."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice 2 br little house as described. Super clean and private. Is isolated down small country winding roads so better to arrive by daylight but manageable at night. Would stay again. Easy 90 minutes to Sacramento airport.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful views and very isolated. Felt very comfortable and welcome. Beds and couches are very comfortable too. The sunrise, sunset and stars are breathtaking and make the stay even more worth it. I saw 6 shooting stars in under 30mins!! Definitely would stay again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place with all the amenities you will ever need. The views from the house is worth the price, and the stars visible at night is definitely worth the price. Would love to come here again in the future!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very peaceful with beautiful views. We didn't want leave the house. The host was friendly and very to quick to respond. This is our favorite Airbnb so far.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We love the place. Peaceful and lovely. My father-in-law commented on his first sight that he would love to stay at the place for a week. That is how lovely this place is. Definitely worth the money.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Paul is a great host with a beautiful home! the view from the home is beautiful enough that we didn't leave the home for a 2 day stay. Paul is also very responsible and helped us feel at home.
His kitchen is well equipped and the rooms are spacious. we would always stay here whenever we travel to Clearlake!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful view over the lake! Perfect for a weekend. Paul was very responsive and helpful. Would recommend driving a SUV since there are some potholes on the road leading to it
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Rough Roads And The Tight Dangerous Sharp Turns. Was The Only Thing That We Disliked.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely view and place to stay! The host thought of everything; coffee table books to read, turning on the ac before we arrived, and snacks in the kitchen."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If there’s a 10 star, I would do it for Paul’s place.
We were ridiculously late for our check in, due to many issues, yet Paul was very understanding and quick to respond. He was very generous and accommodating.
The place itself was breathtaking with the amazing view. Coming in to the house from a very very long day, it was so relaxing. We found it spacious, peaceful, neat, clean, fully stocked (and some more), and cozy.
The outside area is more than what we expected… just amazing and gorgeous.
I highly recommend this place! We will definitely book again for a longer stay. The place and Paul himself were just above and beyond. Thank you for letting us stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing secluded place with all amenities! Once you are there, you don't want to move as it is so peaceful and relaxing. It's better to plan ahead with groceries if you want to have dinner on site."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a Peaceful house on the top of the hills. Dirt road to access is manageable. Location is a bit far from clear lake and water activities ,about 30-40 mts drive. But house is quite and sufficient for a family of 4. Shops are not that easy to get to. So good to load your car with everything you need for your meals. Overall happy with the stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a fantastic time at Paul’s place. The scenery from the place is gorgeous, and the house itself was very clean. Though it is a little tough getting in, it’s worth it for the feeling of privacy the house provides. Can’t recommend enough!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely peaceful place worth every penny and more
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for a couple days and loved it. Fantastic view, super quiet, short drive from lots of hikes, hot springs and other fun stuff. Would come back again"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Paul's house was amazing. The view from inside and out was beautiful. Wish we could have stayed longer and enjoyed the perfect and quiet getaway.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The pictures don't do this place justice - the view is amazing. Definitely worth the stay! Paul was very responsive and instructions to get here were super clear.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with amazing lake view. Very nice terrace and backyard with barbecue, table and chairs. The apartment is large and spacious. Everything necessary is available. The bedrooms are beautiful with large beds. Everything clean and up and running. We stayed 2 days, but would have liked to stay longer. The approach is as Paul writes the last 500 m undetected and uneven uneven. With a Ferrari difficult, normal car is easy."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! While the lake view is the main charm, it is indeed the house that we ended up liking more.
The kitchen is extremely well equipped with anything and everything one would need.
Drove with a Tesla, and there aren’t any EV chargers. The nearest supercharger is 41 miles at Williams. The regular one is at 30 miles at Twin Pine Casino. So, be mindful on that.
Our car has a low clearance but it managed fine on the driveway leading to the home.
All in all, a good comfortable stay"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There is so much to write about how great our stay was at Paul’s place! Everything was stocked, the kitchen was full of everything you would need and more.. the pictures don’t do justice of how great the view is from the living room. Paul’s place is nice and cozy and I can’t wait to visit again !"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,It was very comfortable and quiet. The view was nice. The home was clean and had everything we needed. The road can be challenging if you have a full size vehicle. Anything bigger than a longbed 4 door full size truck probably wont fit. So no motor homes. But overall a nice place
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,cozy spot with lovely views
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Paul was an amazing host , very responsive throughput my stay. The place was so peaceful and cozy. The pics do it no justice."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place has an amazing view and the place is nice. Paul was beyond an amazing host. He was beyond helpful and accommodating during a bad storm that knocked out power. I will definitely come back if I’m able to book.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paul's place is awesome. It has all to have a relaxing and quite time with a wonderful view to the lake. My husband and I loved so much that we are already thinking to go back for the 3er time.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice view. Great Host. Place was clean and cozy. Our only concern was the road leading up was a bit difficult to navigate and the neighborhood at the street level wasn't great. This may just be a feature of Clearlake so no real complaints. The place itself is awesome and we would go back.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our stay here. The view from the house is amazing, very peaceful, and quiet. The house matches the description and was well equipped with basic utensils and cutlery. The home is very clean and has comfortable beds. We really enjoyed this place."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was nice and clean and in a great spot
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul's place is beautiful. The views are incredible. The outdoor patio alone is worth the whole stay. The house is well stocked and furnished (pictures don't give it justice). The main bedroom's bed is huge and extremely comfortable. We stayed during a massive storm and we felt like home!
The area is also worth visiting: hikes up the Konocti, vineyards nearby (Brassfield is the closest and recommended) and hot springs to relax to (especially during a storm!). Clearlake is underrated and a tourist free destination perfect for a getaway"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I almost don't want to write a good review That's how great this place is I just want to keep it all to myself, but I guess I will share it The place looks brand new inside from top to bottom clean unless not talk about the bed it is AMAZING 🤩 I never met Paul but I feel like he gets me. remote control your climate control in both rooms I can keep going but if you're not convinced this is the place for YOU'RE CRAZY 🤣"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I rented this place for a spur of the moment trip with my boyfriend and it ended up being one of my favorite airbnb experiences. The view alone makes it worth staying here, but the amenities also were above and beyond what I expected. The kitchen is stocked completely with boxed and canned meals, spices, teas, and even a frozen pie in the freezer that we took advantage of. It didn't end in the kitchen though, the bathroom came with toothpaste and everything that guests might need during their stay. I felt like the host put a lot of consideration into the details of the home, which made it overall a very comfortable stay. Not to mention that the house looks over a lake that you can see from the living room through floor to ceiling windows. I would highly recommend staying here, and I will most likely be back sometime in the future!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,A beautiful place. Everything you need. Very peaceful and quiet. Definitely would come back.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little get away! Stayed here for a couple of nights. The rain kept us inside but the views and private space made it awesome. House comes stocked with everything you’ll need.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We decided to stay in Clearlake at the last minute. We were on our way back from a stay in Mendocino, and we wanted to break up our journey. Luckily this place was available, and Paul responded very quickly to accept our booking. We didn’t have any expectations because we booked it in a hurry, so when we got there we were very pleasantly surprised. The property has absolutely spectacular views of the lake! I’ve never stayed anywhere that had quite such a sublime view. The home is really nicely kept and has all the amenities, and the uncluttered spaciousness is very appealing. Paul is very responsive and accommodating. We were very impressed with everything about this place, and will return to spend more time in this lovely setting!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for the refund! We look forward to staying in the future.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful clean well maintained home on a hillside overlooking Clearlake - lovely views - especially around sunset.
Very attentive, friendly, responsive host.
Check into the area (Clearlake Oaks) - so you are not surprised by the neighborhood. It has seen better days.
Nothing to do with the host- but the place has been hit hard by poverty / drugs, & blue green algae that make the lake not very appealing - up close. Still lovely from a height."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place really exceeded my expectations. Especially, the view was more spectacular than the description could show. I only hope that I can return to this place in the future."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was great! Road getting in was a bit dicey with the low car we had but the house was great and the views were incredible, would definitely stay again"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is AMAZING. The pictures really do it no justice . It’s Beautiful , elegant , and peaceful. Paul was such a great host . We traveled from a couple hours away, so we had to check in a bit late. Paul made sure to leave the lights on, and the house warm. The view from the house is 11/10. Bird watching from here is amazing. The amount of detail and cleanliness he put into the home is just spectacular. I would 100% recommend this place to anyone looking to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings.
Wish we could’ve stayed longer !"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul is an excellent host and communication was timely. The home is very clean and very comfortable beds. The kitchen has newer pots and pans and has all the cooking utensils you would ever need. The view is amazing and the property is very private and quiet. Very peaceful. We will definitely be back. Excellent Airbnb!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was very easy communicating with Paul. Everything was as described. I esspecially enjoyed the view through the large windows and watched the hummingbirds. The terrace and the garfen with that view were another plus. I will be back. Thank you.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was so amazing! Paul was very responsive and helpful. There were snacks and cold water prepared in the fridge. The sofa was very comfy and the towels were really thick and fluffy. The only thing was that the bathroom didn't have ventilation, but it did not affect our stay :) The drive is a bit tough but was manageable and worth it for the view. Thanks Paul for being such a great host."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place has a spectacular view of the lake and Mount Konocti, is very peaceful and has all the basics you need to spend relaxing time around nature. The beds are very confortable with good quality sheets, cushions and bedspreads."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such lovely spot with beautiful view of the lake from the living room and the back yard! You bet I ate breakfast with the view! Paul has many of the basic essentials to help cook almost any basic meals and ingredients you bring! The AC was great with the heat wave going on! The couch and bed was super comfortable! Very private place. I really appreciate how responsive Paul was when we communicated! Looking forward to staying again in the future!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was good. We really enjoyed peace.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I must have looked at 40 or so potential places to stay on Clearlake, and once I saw the view this one had, I was sold. Besides the view, however, everything else about the place is perfect, as well. Clean, very well equipped kit hen, comfortable beds, this place has it all. Look no further for a great place to stay for your visit at Clearlake."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best places I’ve stayed at through the app. Everything has been thought through: the comprehensive kitchen supplies, extra snacks and seasoning, interesting coffee table books, extra towels. My favorite touches were the framed wall paintings—they add to the charm of the place. And best of all was the fantastic view of the lake."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for the view of the lake and Mount Konocti .!! Good place for chilling and reading.
The host was great at communicating all the details. The kitchen had all essential utensils and the bedrooms were clean and comfy.
Enjoyed our stay.."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing view of Clearlake from kitchen, living room, den and patio. At night, on driveway, on a clear moonless night, you also get a great view of the sky for stargazing (very little light interference). Air conditioning quiet, comfortable, and effective on hot days. Very quiet neighborhood. The house was spotless, and the mattress and pillows were especially comfortable. A great base of operations for activities in Lake County."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Worth the price! Excellent host. Beautiful views.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is located halfway up the hill, next to the mountain and water, and the environment is very beautiful.The interior is tastefully decorated, spacious, tidy and comfortable, with two bedrooms that can accommodate many people.There is a separate yard in front of the house where you can park your car, the backyard can be used for barbecues, and it is very well equipped.The pictures are better than the pictures, would definitely recommend!Great resort!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice house, loved next to the water, pretty easy to find and well worth the peace and quiet. It is a very newish home with all the comforts one would expect from a high-end hotel , definitely will be coming back."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is so beautiful with the perfect location by the lake. We enjoyed being out in the water with our pups and had no difficulties with reaching the host. We would definitely come back!

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The most pet friendly stay! My husband and I stayed here for a fishing trip with our dog. The backyard is amazing. It’s completely fenced in with lake access. Highly highly highly recommend. We’re already talking about booking again.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"*Highly recommend.*
Lovely cabin that feels like a home; great location right on the lake; and responsive host.
The cabin is super comfortable, and is thoughtfully designed with attention to detail: the beds felt luxurious, the towels were fluffy, with board games and beach toys, and the kitchen had everything we needed and then some. We could charge the EV in the driveway. Paulette was extremely responsive and easy to communicate with. Clearlake is peaceful and relaxing. We had both a warm day for the beach, and a cloudy day that was excellent for hiking."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Paulette was an amazing host. The place was beautiful and spotless, she was very responsive and had everything laid out with instructions.
10/10, I can't wait to come back in the future"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Blown away by how beautiful this spot is. Lake was peaceful and quiet, perfect for taking the kayak out. Felt like we had the entire lake to ourselves.
House was fully stocked with anything we could have needed for our stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house was better than expected. Stargazing was the highlight plus the donkeys next door. Ideal for a quite relaxing getaway.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Paulette’s place was one of the best airbnbs we’ve ever stayed at! It felt like a true home away from home. Lots of personal touches. Our dogs had a great time in the lake and in the hiking trails around the house! We can’t wait to come back in the summer!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay at Clearlake. It's such a beautiful house--tastefully decorated and well equipped--and the most peaceful surroundings. It was lovely seeing all the stars and morning kayaking from the private beach. Paulette was a great host and communicator. Highly recommend for a tranquil getaway.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I wouldn't hesitate once to book this place again if we ever decide to visit Clearlake. Paulette's place is absolutely beautiful, pristine, and exactly how it is described in the listing. It has everything you would need for a comfortable stay and more."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We love the lake house and are already thinking about coming back. The kitchen was beautiful and well-equipped. And we loved kayaking on the lake. Our dogs had a blast running around the private fenced in back yard. It was truly a beautiful and restful stay
Thank you!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a great place! We had rain for about 5 hours and loved all of the views from the house. You don't need to go anywhere because the house itself is a destination. Everything is there! Don't try to over plan just book it if you are lucky enough to find an open time. We went in January. Best time to go! The decorations inspire you to be more creative and you think new thoughts.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is so serene and beautiful. If you’re considering, just book you won’t be disappointed. The home has so many thoughtful amenities. It’s clean, open, and the beds are comfy. Neighbors are quiet and the area is beautiful and clean as well. Felt very safe and relaxed in their home. It’s was truly an wonderful experience. If you’re going for wine tasting don’t sleep on Brassfield winery total hidden gem."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a beautiful home! Beautifully and simply decorated with all the amenities. The views of the lake - stunning!!!! Was exactly the break we needed! Paulette was fast to respond and lovely to communicate with. Highly recommend - will be back!!!

The place was well stocked with everything we needed, making our experience truly comfortable. I highly recommend it for a relaxing getaway."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful time, Paulette’s place was well-equipped for our trip we never had to leave the home. Lake views and home were both beautiful and peaceful. It was everything we imagined and we would stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paulette's place is wonderful. Beautiful views, spacious, well equipped and comfortable bed. I also really appreciated the standard 4pm check out time. Made it feel like I almost got a whole extra day! Would definitely stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Paulette’s place was charming and homey. The kitchen was well equipped to make a birthday cake and the master bathroom is absolutely amazing. We brought our pup who enjoyed the property as well and appreciated the extra toys at the house. Would stay here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was amazing. The pictures show exactly what your getting. The bed in the master was unbelievably comfortable. Their private beach was completely fenced in which made watching our dog so much easier. We 100% would recommend straying here and we definitely will be.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The views were wonderful! The place was amazing. Will book again! :)
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"A beautiful location and property! The house is as advertised in the listing! Great place to bring family and friends and pets for a true getaway vacation! Kitchen amenities were perfect!
My only criticism is that the shower pressure in the master bathroom could have been better although there was a handheld one available. My only wish was that there was cable tv available. My only concern was that there were a lot of foxtails that my dogs were exposed to in the backyard. It also rained a little so it was a little muddy.
Overall I really enjoyed my stay and would do it again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Paulette’s place was such a relaxing getaway in the Clearlake area! My family and I wanted to escape the city for the 3 day weekend and found Paulette’s place to be the perfect spot - waking up to breathtaking sunrises by the lake, and eating dinner at the table with a perfect view of the sunset! The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to cook some fabulous meals, and the rooms and restrooms were clean and comfortable. My mother-in-law particularly appreciated the attention to detail in the home. Thanks Paulette for a great stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Gorgeous house in a beautiful location, the decor is perfectly curated. The house is stocked with anything you might even dream of needing (right down to a great whisk or new, packaged toothbrushes for guests who forgot to pack theirs!) and is utterly spotless.
Our dogs swam safely and merrily in the lake while we sat on the marvelous small beach and just enjoyed watching the birds."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place to stay! It was so quiet and relaxing! It was the perfect getaway that my husband and I needed. We never second guessed anything being clean or ok to use! It was overall a great stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is a hidden gem. Great location and very peaceful. Paulette was proactive and responsive, truly a great hostess. There was lots to do both in the house and around the lake."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I took my mom here to celebrate her 65th birthday. It was a beautiful and peaceful escape for us. Due to the heat we stayed indoors almost the entire stay, but that was perfectly fine for us as we enjoyed the amenities inside the house. The house is equipped with everything you could possibly need, especially in the kitchen! The most enjoyable feature of this location is the amazing view of the lake and the natural life surrounding it. We would happily return to this home for another celebration."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our experience at this beautiful house with its very own private beach was nothing short of extraordinary. The secluded location truly stole our hearts, offering a captivating view of the serene lake. The beautiful interiors of the house has a user-friendly kitchen and a lake-view balcony. The highlight, undoubtedly, was the charming private beach area equipped with kayaks and a paddle boat. Our Chihuahuas joined in the fun, gleefully swimming alongside us in the inviting lake waters. The memory of kayaking with our furry companions to the heart of the lake, basking in the breathtaking sunset, remains a truly remarkable experience. Our host's exceptional communication and friendly demeanor added a welcoming touch to our stay. We were overjoyed by the hospitality to our four-legged friends. Having stayed in Airbnb accommodations across destinations, we can confidently assert that this house surpasses all others. We extend our highest recommendation to this exceptional Airbnb."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay. The cabin was so tastefully decorated, and had a beautiful view of Clear lake. The kids loved climbing up and down the loft, and the beds were super comfortable. The fridge stopped working between the time the last guests left and we checked in. Since it was 4th of July, there wasn't a way to get a fridge replacement. I let Paulette know and she had her husband Mike drive 3.5hr to drop off 2 coolers with ice and also fixed the fridge. She even refunded us $ for the groceries. We love AirBnb because it feels like staying at a friend's place instead of a hotel."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a heavenly place! Any vacation home with a bountifully-equipped kitchen (including a potato masher) wins my vote!
This home was absolutely lovely in every way. Treat yourself & go!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A lovely lake-side Airbnb. We loved spending our days sitting out on the patio, taking in the beautiful views of the lake. The house had all the amenities needed - from a grill, to a paddle boat, to a well-equipped kitchen. The beds were comfortable and the cool AC was appreciated on the hotter days. The host was super helpful and responsive throughout our stay. Can't recommend this place enough!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay.....the lake house was very nice and cozy!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home with thoughtful amenities. Comfortable beds and complete kitchen for making meals and enjoying the views and sounds of the lake.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Can't say enough good things about our stay - it was truly marvelous. The location was perfect, the home felt private, and allowed for beautiful lake views from almost every room. Everything was exactly as described, and the house was immaculate. We enjoyed the private beach, and made use of the canoe and paddle boat. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing stay. Loved how dog friendly it was. The beach was mesmerizing and the home was rustic and lovely.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the sweetest time at this home. From the second we entered, we couldn’t stop saying “how pretty is this?! Can we stay forever?!” It was decorated so beautiful and had the most peaceful and relaxing vibe. We really enjoyed sitting by the lake, watching the sunset, sipping coffee on the balcony, kayaking, and more. The next door neighbor had ponies, which was a fun bonus to watch them as we played in the lake. The wildflowers were in perfect bloom, too. It was picturesque. It was the perfect end to our honeymoon road-trip. Thank you so much!!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful peaceful spot on the lake! Great views from dining and bedroom. Thanks Paulette for a lovely stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Paulettes place was amazing. I was looking for something remote to recharge my batteries and be close to nature yet not somewhere completely in the wilderness. Paulettes place provided everything I asked for. Communication was easy. Everything  as advertised. Loved it. Thank you.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We love the place so much, beautiful, peaceful and private, both inside and outside. The kitchen has a great views of Clearlake, perfectly fit for anyone who loves to cook. The place makes us feel like our home (or even better); super clean and well equipped."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Love our stay, peaceful and quiet, can’t wait to come back!!! 😊"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Paulette’s place was wonderful! Her house is even better than the pictures— super spacious with a cozy-feel. My husband and I stayed in the master bedroom which had it’s own bathroom that was stocked with shampoo, lotion, hairdryer, toothbrushes, and even sunscreen. I appreciated that the rooms also had plenty of towels and blankets (i always have a problem with Airbnb places not having enough blankets, but not with Paulette’s place). Since Paulette’s place is a good drive away from the nearest grocery store, my husband and I cooked all our meals and fully utilized her kitchen— which was fully stocked with pots, utensils, kitchenware, spices, oil… all the things you need to cook. Overall, this was one of our best Airbnb stays and we will most definitely be visiting again in the future."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Gorgeous space! My partner and I wanted a getaway to celebrate our anniversary, and Paulette’s home was absolutely perfect. So comfy and homey! The view is so beautiful and you feel as if you have the whole mountain to yourself. The pictures don’t do the home justice.
As a heads up for those who are driving a Tesla, the nearest supercharger is about a 90 min drive away."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is so thoughtfully put together for guests it felt right at home for us. Paulette was very kind and helpful. The Airbnb gives you a full mountain/valley experience from the seclusion, to the landscapes, to the peacefulness, windy cliffside roads and wonderful wineries. It was a great place to recharge and adventure around. Highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the perfect place for a quiet, relaxing lakeside retreat. The view is amazing, and Paulette was very responsive and helpful. Our dog had a great time exploring the yard. The house is about a 15 min drive to downtown Clearlake, which we knew, so we brought a good amount of food and drinks. The kitchen is well equipped for cooking, so that wasn’t an issue. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was beautiful and the views were great! The home had everything we needed and more! I would highly recommend staying here and I definitely plan on coming back!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This rural lake house was so charming and peaceful. My husband and I (and our small dog) had a three-day stay and truly felt relaxed and at ease in this well-decorated home. The house is exactly as pictured and described-- it was clean, bright and airy. Although the roads to get to the house were a bit windy and remote, the privacy and peacefulness were what we were looking for. The house had everything we needed and waking up to drink coffee and look at the lake was perfect. We didn't use the kayaks as it was a bit cold for us but we enjoyed sitting by the lake and watching the birds. Our dog had so much fun exploring the fenced-in yard and visiting with the ponies next door. We have absolutely nothing bad to say about our stay at Paulette's place and hope to stay again when we are in that area of California. If you are looking for a rural stay with beautiful lake views, this is your place!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house is absolutely beautiful with your own private beach. Everything inside was so tastefully decorated and so well stocked. We had a serene, relaxing getaway!"

We had Super super lovely getaway"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay and Paulette was a wonderful host - very responsive and she went the extra mile to make our stay as comfortable as possible. As others have mentioned, the pictures don't do it justice - the location is serene, the backyard is huge and it all made for an extremely relaxing stay! The house had everything we needed. Everyone in our family, including our dog had a wonderful stay!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely gorgeous place! Looks exactly like the photos, and you won’t be disappointed. Paulette was very friendly and responsive as well which helped check in and check out."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I recently stayed at Paulette's place, and I have to say, it was absolutely beautiful. The peaceful surroundings made for a truly relaxing vacation. The house itself was well-equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We very much enjoyed our time there and would definitely stay again in the future. Overall, it was a fantastic experience, and I highly recommend this rental to anyone looking for a beautiful and peaceful getaway."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay in this remote little home! Everything was fully equipped so we had everything we needed. I would definitely stay here again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We spent the Thanksgiving weekend at Paulette's and we couldn't be happier. Dogs were so excited to run up and down the slope to get to the lake and it was really a nice place to relax and wind down. Everything just slowed down. Paulette thought of everything, I mean EVERYTHING. Definitely stock up on your groceries before heading there. Can't beat waking up to the beautiful lake view with a hot cup of coffee. The drive to get there was a little bit more mountain roads than we expected but it was worth it. This was also our older daughter's last Thanksgiving before she heads to college next year. Thank you for such a great memory. Oh also, our dogs ended up making a new friend with her neighbor's big doggy."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pick this one :)
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paulette's house is a prefect place for a quiet weekend, spending in nature. The house is practically on the Clear Lake. It felt so welcoming as soon as we walked in. She has pretty much everything you need in a lived-in house. Her attention to details come through nicely. A special shout out for her flexibility and kindness. We missed out flight and she was so sweet and open to push 1 more day so we could stay the 2 nights per booking. I was so appreciated her for that. Will def stay there again :)"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay at Paulette’s lakefront home! This is a great getaway with both an elevated view of Clearlake from the home and decks and a peaceful large fenced yard that ends at the waterfront with paddle boat and kayak provided. Comfortable furniture outdoors to relax, listen to the lake lapping on the shore, and take in the beautiful views.
Inside, it’s one of the most polished airbnbs we’ve stayed at. It’s true to the listing photos but more spacious than I imagined with roomy master bedroom and additional bedroom and bathroom down the hallway from the open-airy living area as pictured. If you enjoy clean, modern farmhouse design you will especially love this place which fits that vibe to a T.
Everything seemed newly installed and functional and you could tell a lot of care and thought went into making this home a comfortable sanctuary.
And Paulette is super friendly and responsive to boot. Thanks Paulette!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place exceeded my expectations & so much more. One of the best views of Clearlake at the convenience of your patio or a few steps away to a private entrance to the lake. The architecture & home design was also wonderful. Gave the perfect vibe for a lake house. Made you feel at home. If you are seeking a weekend to help you unwind, relax, spend time in nature or indoors, this is the perfect place for you."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The cottage was a wonderful, good value stay for us and our puppy. We appreciated the isolation and fenced lake access (permanent neighbours to the left who have two dogs, ponies and a goose our puppy made friends with) and what looks like another rental immediately on the right.
Paulette is a quick and helpful communicator making the stay seamless.
We got there when it was very hot so the lake had some algae which reduced as the air cooled and so we could swim. Bring your own bottled water to drink and groceries - closest large supermarket Safeway is 18mins away.
I really appreciated a fully stocked kitchen - every type of utensil and tool to make cooking easy and a fully stocked spice, sauce and mini pantry. Plenty of towels, even toiletries and change of sheets if needed.
The view was stunning, no mosquitos, a lovely fireplace which we managed to use on the last night. Would suggest pre- downloading any movies before arrival as Wi-Fi isn’t super fast for that.
We walked our puppy down a few country roads - nice and quiet despite them being for cars. Activity wise - the nearby towns weren’t for tourists and quite run down. The only destination activity for us were wineries - we went to Landtry, Brassfield and Vigilance which were better than their already high reviews.
We spent most of our time at the cottage so the stay was perfect for us!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heaven on earth! Beautiful accommodation, so tasteful inside and out! Super comfy beds, gorgeous views but pick up your groceries en route as it’s remote!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pros:
The pictures do not lie. The house, the decor, the furnishings, the supplies are all super well done! The loft is excellent for kids and the water front access is fantastic. Beds and linens are all quite comfortable. The house has everything that you need. We found everything easily and did not “wish we had brought” anything additional. The sunset views are amazing.
Cons:
It is remote. That being said, it would be an excellent idea to bring all your food/beverage with you. It’s not a quick hop to the store or local restaurant. Critters, bugs, spiders. Nothing alarming and totally what you would expect in a wooded environment. Just come prepared. Lake water is not reliable (algea free) at certain times of the year.
All in all, this is a great spot for a quiet get away.
Use the hosts’ directions and do not rely on your google maps."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! Really nice house with a great view. The house has everything you need, comfortable, very organized and very clean. Quiet, private, easy check-in. Walk down to a private beach where you can fish or kayak. We couldn't swim because the algae was bad during our visit. Paulette was great to communicate with, quick response time and helpful information was provided."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place for summer if you like playing in the lake. The house located in a super quiet and private environment with convenient access to the Clear Lake. My family really love the kayak on the private beach! The entire backyard(connected to the beach) is fenced well so it's safe and fun for our children and dogs. My family had a good weekend here and will definitely come back in another summer.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is a hidden treasure. The view on the deck is insane. The private beach is so cute. I can’t wait to come back to this place again!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place! Perfect location for relaxation and privacy. Amazing view from the patio. Loved the private beach , kayak and paddle boat.
House has everything you possibly need for your stay there.
Paulette was easy to contact and fast to respond. Thank you for letting us stay at your place, we will be back !"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed in mid-May over a weekend.
The place is secluded at the end of a long and windy road.
The house was great, spacious, and super well kept; well thought out high-end furnishings and decor. Comfy beds for back and side sleepers. Well stocked kitchen...YMMV but for us, everything we needed to prepare all our meals during our stay. Useful supplies for grilling and general cooking.
It was 80s to 90s outside; but the temps inside was very comfortable and we never needed to turn on the AC.
Access to the lake was well kept; about 50 steps. Very nice private spot."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,2nd time booking here and it was a perfect getaway!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome/Amazing! Book it!
We loved having easy access to the lake via private beach. The house was PERFECT. Paulette really took care and thought out every detail. We had access to everything we needed and more. Our pup had a great time (there are treats in the pantry for a good boy/girl). This home is perfection for a relaxing getaway. Paulette was also very generous with check out, allowing us ample time, that meant allot to us. We are so grateful for her hospitality."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a flawless stay here! Paulette was very attentive and helpful, and made sure I had the best experience I could have. The house is at a great location next to a lake, with plenty of activities — the hosts provided a kayak, paddle boat, as well as other fun things to do on the water. The interior of the house was designed beautifully and comes together in a way that blends smoothly with the lake and nature nearby. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a peaceful getaway!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I am stunned for words! This place is absolutely AMAZING! Paulette has done a wonderful job communicating during our check in and about our stay. The house was stocked with supplies. The house was so cozy and comfy and the view was breathtaking! We will definitely be back and will recommend this place to friends and family! Thank you Paulette for opening up your home to us and making our stay unforgettable ❤️
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an awesome spot to stay! Paulette is great at communication as well.
Our friends were not able to make it out with us, but we couldn’t be upset due to the amazing views that greeted us at the cabin!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and relaxing, had a great time, would highly recommend."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing home! I can’t say enough good things; the location, entire space and amenities go above and beyond."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful stay! We have never been so pleased with an Airbnb before! Beautiful location and lovely hosts
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful couple days at Paulette's house! It was so nice being right on the water and the home was so cozy. Our dog had a great time too. There are a couple dogs next to the house that seemed nice enough but would bark quite a bit when we were out back, and randomly in the middle of the night as well. But overall I'd highly recommend and would come back!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful cabin! Paulette has done a wonderful job decorating and making it feel very comfortable. You will not be disappointed! Book it:)
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay next to the lake. Great for dogs in the enclosed back yard. Really warm cozy house, very well stocked. Felt like a home away from home."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really one of the nicest places we've stayed at. Super clean and well furnished. A surprisingly great value.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,There are reasons why this place is so highly rated. We stayed for 8 days and had such a wonderful time enjoying serenity and surrounding nature of the house. The decoration of the both interior and exterior was fantastic and they've got almost everything you need in the kitchen. Can't wait to come back in Spring or Summer to enjoy the balcony more!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've only just left, but we'll be dreaming about this one for a while. The house is so cute and cozy and nestled on the lake made for such solitude. Everything was just perfect and we would stay again and again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home exceeded our expectations- so comfortable, relaxing and beautifully designed. The amenities and thoughtful touches throughout made our stay so enjoyable. And the location couldn’t have been better: lake views and easy access to the water. We’ll be back!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful time in a special house! Thank you!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was fantastic. The home is beautiful and comfy, and the area was amazing. Watching the sunset over the lake from the balcony was breathtaking. We can't wait to come back."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here with my husband, mother in law and our dog. We all thought it was possibly the nicest airbnb we’ve stayed at in terms of view, amenities, cleanliness and value. We loved cooking in the kitchen which was well stocked with spices, vinegars and oil, sitting by the fireplace using the dry firewood, playing cards abs board games, and were so impressed by the extra toothpaste and lotion when we forgot to bring ours. Would love to come back in the summer to use the paddle boat and kayak! Communicating with Paulette was a breeze. Thank you so much!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Wifi a lil weak tho
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home with everything you could possibly need for a dreamy escape to wine country. My husband, our small dog, & I thoroughly enjoyed our extended getaway to this charming cabin. We cooked, hiked, water colored, enjoyed sunshine on the beach and on the lake. Our hosts were thoughtful and considerate; they made sure we arrived prepared to maximize our time in their cozy place. Loved getting to know Clearlake and understand the appeal. Highly recommended!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is five star well managed place and you are the best host we have ever encountered . Hope to stay again in future .
Everything is good about this place including flexibility of checkin and checkout timings ."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was beautiful, remote, and relaxing with amazing lake views. We traveled with our 3 month old baby to this location in order to getaway from the city, and as an alternative to Lake Tahoe. The host was super helpful and communicative. The house is situated between Clearlake, CA and Clearlake Oaks, CA and is about a 3 hour drive from SF. We found that Clearlake Oaks was a more pleasant town to get groceries and other essentials that we needed (including fishing bait). My fiancé loved fishing off of the private beach and he caught an almost 20lb catfish - needless to say he was super excited. We loved staying here and would definitely come back in the future!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway location.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There is a reason Paulette is rated a “Superhost!!” This cabin is fabulously appointed and comfortable. We were wanting for nothing, and everything was thoughtfully provided. We didn’t want to leave, and hope to return.
The cabin is perfectly complimentary to the amazing perch and place on this special lake. I particularly enjoyed reading Gene Paleno’s history of Lake County and Clearlake. The more I learn, the more I appreciate what a special place this area is. It’s truly a privilege to have Paulette’s cabin available to enjoy and explore this natural gem. Thank you and wishing our host and all visitors many more beautiful days!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Paulettes home was just the best. By far the best cabin we have stayed at in the Clearlake area. My husband, 8 yr. old son and I stayed for 4 days and 3 nights. We had a blast. Perfect end to the summer. It is a 15-20 min. drive to the stores so make sure you bring everything you need. The first night, my boys caught 3 catfishes right off the beach. Paulette told us ahead of time about the algae. A little bummed that we couldn't swim but enjoyed using the kayak and paddle boat. Super clean, nicely decorated. We can wait to visit again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enchanting place! Great hosts.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place is so cozy, clean and relaxing. We had a wonderful time, enjoyed the breeze and amazing view on the deck and at the beach. Private beach is very nice. Our kids love taking the pedal boat/kayak out fishing. The kitchen is spacious and filled with all needed equipment and more. Paulette, thanks for letting us stay at your house, this place is a gem!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect getaway! We will definitely be back
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paulette’s place is ideal for a relaxing vacation. The house is right on the lake. Views are stunning — particularly watching the sunset from the balcony. The house is very aesthetically decorated, and it has all the amenities needed for a long stay. Overall had a wonderful stay, and would love to come back!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I’m not exaggerating on 5 stars all the way around….this was our second stay here and our family - young and ‘older’ loved this place! The location is the perfect distance from town, the house is immaculate and filled with everything you need and more, it’s totally modern, the backyard was a perfect entertainment spot for everyone - caught lots of fish, played in the water and the sand. We hope to keep the annual trip here going :)."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we love house everything was nice
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully decorated house right on the lake. The private fenced backyard with lake access was perfect for dogs and kids. Everything was well stocked and clean. Paulette was helpful, responsive and friendly. Sunset views from the balcony were amazing. We had so much fun on the paddle boat and enjoyed all of the amenities!
This is perfect for a long weekend get away from the Bay Area! Would definitely stay again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! From the location, secluded, peaceful! You’re really away from any city noise — you just wake up everyday to the singing birds! (very few motor boats or jet skies on the weekend). You get your own private beach area and access to the lake!
The host are A+++ — great communication, easy and flexible check in/out... they did a great job with the decor! such a cute comfortable place, super clean stocked with everything (even if you’ve forgotten something, they got it for you 😃)
We recommend this place 💯 to everyone looking to relax, enjoy the water lake while staying in a very nice place with beautiful sunsets and views from the balconies!! Thank you so much for everything and for sharing your property!!!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a gem. We loved hanging out on the deck with a beautiful, peaceful lookout over the water. The private beach was amazing. Taking the kayak and paddle boat out on the lake was so much fun! Pauline was a responsive and gracious host. Would love to come back again for a rejuvenating retreat! Highly recommend."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"this place is great, especially the water activities you can have in the water. Be careful with the ladder, don’t let kids climb it."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"You will LOVE this place! So peaceful, beautiful, authentic, great beach, air, lake, fishing, fun with kayak & paddle boat. Charming furnishings & art. We would clone this place if we could! Thank you SO MUCH to Mike & Paulette for sharing your gem!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is in such a beautiful part of Clearlake. The private “beach” access was really cool and the entire property was immaculately decorated and well designed. My family felt very much at home as Paulette has put a lot of heart into this beautiful house. Everything was very clean, comfortable, and calming. The master bath had the perfect claw foot soaking tub and the wood accents plus dried lavender made for a very relaxing sanctuary. The kitchen is well stocked with kitchenware and essentials like Saran Wrap, aluminum foil, sandwich bags, etc. we brought all of our food for our 4 day stay and it was so easy to cook/grill as if we were at home. The kids and my husband had a lot of fun with the kayak and paddle boat.
It was a lovely stay and I hope we returned the home back just as clean and tidy as we had found it. Thank you Paulette for making this special place available to my family!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house and beachfront was perfect. Would definitely go back.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely place and Paulette was super responsive and thoughtful. The house was impeccably decorated and the view was just amazing. My daughter loved the kayak and paddle boat - thanks for having those available. The early check in and late checkout allowed us to enjoy the place longer which was very kind :)
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beyond our expectations! Paulette's place was clean, bright, comfortable and she truly thought of everything! Thank you so much! We couldn't have asked for more!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I have stayed at many many AirBnB over the past 8 years, in several different continents; this place definitely ranks in our top 3!
The location is absolutely gorgeous, with the lake and the surrounding mountains. The house oversees it all and offers such a beautiful view during the day.
The house itself is among the best decorated places we've been. From the art on the walls, to the lamps, to the antique furniture, every last detail is super stylish. We felt like we were in a magazine.
The check-in was easy, and the house wasn't difficult to find (if you put in the entire address in google maps --with the house number). Communication with Paulette was quick and efficient.
We usually don't come back to the same place twice, but we might just do that and stay for longer next time (we stayed only for a couple nights). We loved this place <3"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing house with perfect lake view, private beach, sparkly clean, and all the amenities you’d need. Dog friendly, quiet, and spacious. A little tricky finding the place, so we wouldn’t advise an evening arrival. Hosts were quick to reply and super nice!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful Lake House right on the water! Loved the fenced in yard, perfect place to stay with pups!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We absolutely loved our peaceful stay at the lake! The house is very comfortable and fully equipped with everything we needed for a relaxing stay. The views from the balconies are wonderful, the beds are comfortable, and the WiFi met our needs."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great holiday at Paulette’s place! It was very enjoyable to be on the water, even during the winter and some rain. Paulette communicated regularly throughout our trip and had great amenities to offer. We especially loved going on morning boat trips around the lake. Would book again!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely breathtaking and comfy
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place and beautiful well thought house. Highly recommend!! Ladder to the loft is a test of your athletic skills and can reveal hidden fear of heights, but still a lot of fun!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Paulette's place was the perfect getaway from everything that's going on right on. It is a beautiful, secluded lakefront property with lake facing balconies extending from both the living room as well as the master bedroom, with private lake access a quick 5 minute walk down about 20 stairs from the house. Check-in was a breeze with the provided lockbox and the house came equipped with so many nice little touches like board games, puzzles and DVD's but especially in the kitchen which was fully stocked with whatever you might need (pots, pans, spices, oils, full knife set, toaster, coffee maker, charcoal, even gallon jugs of water). As stated in the listing there's no Wi-Fi (the reception is okay though) and the drive can be a bit winding for stretches if you're sensitive to that but I think the secluded aspect is kind of what you're signing up for here? The kayak and paddle boat that are available for use (along with PFD's) are an awesome touch and definitely a highlight of this property! Would most definitely recommend Paulette's place for others and also for myself on a return trip."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. The home is lovely and comfortable and was very clean and the private beach is great. The kitchen was very well stocked. I loved the fact that they are pet-friendly and that the check-in and check-out times are so flexible. The only issue we had is, the next door neighbors have 2 dogs and one of them is quite large (over 100 lbs) - though he is very sweet and friendly, he is also very excitable. We were warned a few days before arriving that the dogs may be in the properties front yard occasionally. We encountered one or both dogs in the yard everyday we were there and on the first night the big dog hopped the fence and was in the backyard, hoping to play with our dog (who is very scared of most dogs). We did not feel safe with our dog in the backyard since we knew the big dog could get in so we drove to a different area to walk her. For most people this shouldn't be an issue because he is very friendly and sweet, but if someone in your party or your dog is afraid of big dogs, please be aware that you may run into him during your stay. We would definitely stay here again, but I'm not sure if we would bring our dog next time."
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"With all the lock downs we just wanted a place to relaxed. This was the perfect spot, even our teen son enjoyed himself with the kayak and paddle boat. Hubby caught a giant catfish. The house is so comfy and we all loved cooking in the kitchen. Beds were comfortable and the tub was a great place to relax. We can't wait to come back!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home and such an amazing space to relax and enjoy a good book. We really enjoyed all recommendations given and appreciated the easy laid back nature of the rental. No crazy house rules, just truly a relaxing lake life stay. The early and late check out made the most of our stay since we really got to spend time there. Our pups and us really enjoyed the home and look forward to coming back."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for an amazing stay. It was a perfect place to get away.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an awesome location to come and get way from the city life. There were plenty of movies/games to keep you entertained, but if you have a book it’s awesome to sit on the deck or down by the water. The kayak and paddle boat were nice options too! Overall an awesome stay and the Paulette was easy to reach!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at the house! We thought the game selection was great, very dog friendly, and we got some great advice prior to traveling which was super helpful. Decks and private beach was perfect to listen to the sounds of the lake. Looking forward to booking another stay in the future!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place for a private time at the lake.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Paulette’s place. The private beach is beautiful and their place is very cute and well stocked! Paulette also sent very clear instructions to check in. Would highly recommend!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paulette's lake house provided a lovely get away from the bay area. The house is cozy with modern- rustic touches and stocked with everything we needed for a fun and relaxing vacation. The paddle boat and kayak were a big hit and our dogs loves playing on the shore. We will definitely be back!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This adorable farmhouse is very stylish, clean and comfortable! There is a large beach access to the lake and our family loved fishing and kayaking right off the beach. We were happy to unplug for the weekend and spend some quality time here. Plenty of movies to choose from at night to watch. The kids loved the loft! Kitchen has all of your needs. Paulette was very kind to give an update on the air quality and to check in with us prior to our stay. Thank you for sharing your lovely home with us."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic property and host was very responsive. Had a wonderful time and hope to come back sometime in the future.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place!!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, amazing is this adorable lake cottage. To all the special touches that make you feel like your at a fine resort. Perfectly stocked with all you need to make your stay enjoyable. Beautiful views and a great little fishing cove. Paulette was truly a super host. Very attentive and with quick response to all my inquires. This was just a great relaxing week and will definitely return. Highly recommend this for a great a great vacation.l"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful place. With scenic views and easy access to the lake and private beach, this was perfect for a relaxing vacation. The cabin is very clean and the interior design and decor, gave a fresh and calming impression. The kitchen was equipped, and we enjoyed making dinner and baking with a lake view. Paulette was very helpful and responsive when having any questions. Thanks for the stay!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"BEST EVER!!! This place is amazing. We had 6 adults and it was the perfect amount of space. I didn't go up to the loft area, but the couple that stayed up there had no complaints. The place is decorated so cute and they have an awesome sound system. But the best part was the private beach access. Paulette was super communicative leading up to the trip."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing location and amenities. Great communication with host. Very clean and comfortable.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place (and especially this home) is gorgeous! The home is super cozy and beautiful. The backyard is also really nice with a true private beach and activities provided by the host (like kayak etc). I typically don’t think about returning to the same Airbnb but I have a feeling we’ll be coming back here. Only wish it had WiFi. All in all, Dream home for sure."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place absolutely exceeded our expectations. The house was sparkling clean and pretty large (at least for only 2 people), the deck off the main room and the master bedroom gave us incredible views, and the private beach was spectacular. We made good use of the two-person kayak and spent most of our stay on our floaties in the lake. The next door neighbors also have a very friendly dog who we enjoyed saying hi to and some miniature horses that we spotted a few times! An absolute gem of a place, if you want to stay in Clearlake for a reasonable price this is 100% the Airbnb to book."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This property is a hidden gem - you won’t find a better location on the lake that has beach access. And the home itself, is so well maintained, clean, beautifully decorated, updated, and has everything you need for your getaway. It’s so hard trying to find a place in a location you haven’t been and we lucked out.
We caught fish, used the paddle boat, listened to the water at night, swam, played games, bbqd, saw wildlife - all from our own private area.
The cell phone reception was great up here, the hot spots worked great, the gps pin pointed us exactly to the address. Going into town was a breeze - the Safeway had what you needed, went out for pizza and burgers at some local spots.
Paulette was so helpful in coordinating this trip for our family and kept us in the loop with local news about the state’s SIP.
We can’t wait to come back!!!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is perfect for a family getaway! The kitchen was equipped with everything which I greatly appreciated. Super spacious.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a charming spot. Was pleasantly surprised by the nice sound of the waves on the lake when the balcony doors are open :)
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful home with such creative, rustic charm & an amazing view! We didn’t leave the property all weekend, can’t wait to come back! Also the neighbors dog is the sweetest and made friends with our
Pup. A great neighborhood!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paulette’s cottage is amazing. The common area is awesome and so are the bedrooms. The view is impressive! Be aware that the drive to get there is pretty sinuous, so not ideal if you have motion sickness... but it is totally worth it."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous cabin with really impeccable rustic decor and touches. We couldn’t have found a better place to enjoy clear lake!
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paulettes place was perfect for my family and pup. Everyone had a great time and really enjoyed the backyard and beach area. The house is stocked with everything you need from games to various cookware. We all had a great time. I Would definitely recommend this place. would love to come back in the Spring/Summer time.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place. Gorgeous views, well stocked kitchen and bathrooms, comfortable beds, great stove for cozy fires, lots of nice outdoor seating areas, and our 13 year old son loved sleeping in the loft. Our dog was so happy in the completely fenced in huge backyard. Looking forward to returning in warmer weather."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Paulette’s place during our Thanksgiving break. It was one of the most equipped places we’ve been to, kitchen had everything we could ask for. House has a nice interior, and an access to a private beach with a canoe and a paddle boat! We had a blast!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The is a clean, cute and well maintained home, great back yard for our dog and we caught lots of fish. Loved it!"

Quiet location, private lake access, clean home, hospitable owner, great local restaurants and wineries. Plenty fun things to do for everyone."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, quiet and peaceful place away from the hustle and bustle. If you like twisty, scenic drives (it was one of my favorite parts) then you're in for a treat!. Paulette was very helpful and responded fast!. Will stay again!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great view, the Lake and house were great!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paulette’s place is clean, comfy, and perfect for some quiet time away by the water.
Would definitely recommend for larger groups, would be great with kids as well. Check the algae water when you book, just to be prepared for rules around lake usage."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful lake house destination! Beautiful property on the inside and the grounds are equally as gorgeous! The house is so cute with thoughtful decor that gives the house a sweet home feel. The cabin is very clean! My family enjoyed everything the house had to offer and it exceeded my expectations! The deck is perfect for all times of day and the private beach makes it so you never need to leave!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is absolutely amazing! We took our three kids on a family trip and everyone had a blast. Very quiet and peacefully location. The private beach made it so convenient to just swim, fish, go on the paddle boat etc whenever we felt like it. And the house has everything you could ask for... we loved playing board games while listening to music from the in-house stereo system. A very relaxing trip...we’d love to come back again!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a quiet, peaceful, relaxing spot, look no more! First time booking with Air Bnb and I’m not disappointed at all. Paulette has everything you can think off right down to a dog kennel. I told my husband repeatedly that he could just leave me there lol. Falling sleep and waking up to the sound of the waves, stargazing and seeing a shooting star for the first time, watching the sunset, paddle boarding, sightings of deer and rabbits was just what our family needed."
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Views are breathtaking both day and night! The private lake access was so nice and the paddle boat that was provided was so much fun to use in the lake. My parents were visiting from NYC and this was a lovely place to get away from it all and to just relax and spend time with them and my husband and our two little dogs. The bedrooms were very comfortable and the kitchen was large and bright and fully equipped. We enjoyed cooking both breakfast and dinners there together in the open concept house and play games in the dining room. The deck overlooking the lake was ideal for coffee in the morning and wine and snacks during sunset! Also the place was very cutely decorates and Paulette was quick to answer any questions or concerns we had! Would stay again.
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great experience will definitely use air B and B again.
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a wonderful time and just loved this place! The fishing was incredible right off the beach. It was so peaceful and we really enjoyed our stay. Thank you for sharing your home❤️
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is a wonderful get away. Amazing home with spectacular views. There is a fully equipped kitchen & comfy beds. You can have your coffee or mimosas while you watch the sun rise or set from the balconies and then take the kayak out for a spin. Also, the night sky here is stunning. I highly recommend a stay."

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We've had a wonderful time at Paulette's place. The location is great, in a quiet spot right on the lake, but not too far from town. We loved hanging around by the water! The house itself was clean, had everything we needed and provided enough space."
2019-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house is so cozy, comfortable and clean. It feels like a beach house and tree house, all in one! We love the clawfoot bathtub, the wood burning stove, and the deck overlooking the water. The home is decorated beautifully and has all of the amenities that you could possibly need. This was our second stay in the home and we will definalty be back again. Thank you very much, Paulette!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a great weekend getaway. The house has an amazing view of the lake. I personally enjoyed having my morning coffee at the deck While listening to the birds. The house has all the things that you need. We will definitely go back during summer. Thanks for hosting us!!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay, beautiful scenery made it an outstanding experience, would definitely stay again"
2019-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 5 had a great time in this beautiful home. Besides the rain and cold we had a great time. Everything we could possibly need was provided. If I were to change one thing, it would be to add curtains or blinds to the big window facing the road. We will be back during the summer."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,An amazing lakefront house that feels secluded without being totally isolated. This is a lovely door to get away from the city.
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house and the view were perfect and a quiet location. Paulette thought of everything that you might need. We are really looking forward to coming back, this is our new getaway place."

2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay at Paulette’s place. The house is beautiful and fully stocked with everything you need. The location is spectacular and access to the lake was incredible. I would highly recommend staying here if you want to get away from the city and relax in a secluded beautiful cabin by the lake. We will for sure be returning!
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I travelled with my 2 daughters and dog and we all had a wonderful, relaxing, beautiful time. My girls loved all the games, binoculars, and lake gear. The kitchen had everything one could think of! A comforting house, perfect for relaxing and quality time!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place has an amazing view! Private lake access by going down several stairs. The house is super clean, with all the things you need. There is a kayak in the garage, so we can use it to explore the lake. The host is very friendly and responses very quickly.
Five stars! Highly recommended!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect weekend getaway by the lake. It doesn’t get any better than this place. It was picturesque. Private beach at the waters edge, big beautiful house, all the amenities you need, a great DVD library, plenty of books and games, kayaks, but the best part is the back deck with the lake view. PERFECTION! We can’t wait to come back. We plan to make this a yearly summer getaway. Thank you for everything!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is very cozy and we felt like at home (thumbs up to the beautiful decorations). There were plenty of things for us to do and the house has one of the best amenities in a rental. I like how the location is isolated from the town and it was very peaceful and safe. I love the games, dvd collection, the patio, and the quick access to the lake! We really enjoyed the water activities there. The place was also very clean and it was a comfortable stay. Paulette is very nice and responsive. I would return in the future!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I with our adult son and three small dogs loved our stay in this beautiful lakeside retreat. The house is very charming and comfortable. Paulette has supplied a nice library of movies and games, as well as a kayak, inner tubes, and a corn hole game, but the view from the balcony is so beautiful and serene, we could have just relaxed there the whole time. The house is expertly decorated too! We were all very happy with our stay and highly recommend it. Be sure to take plenty of food and drinking water because you will not want to leave or drive so far to the nearest store. This is an ideal place for rest and relaxation!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place. Great amenities nice location. Great layout on the house with cute touches. Loved our stay there. Perfect place to bring your dog too. Totally fenced in yard with own private beach.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really great and relaxing stay at Paulette's listing. We really enjoyed the space, the views, and the breeze off of the lake. The two-person kayak was a great touch and allowed us to explore the lake. The home is a bit of a drive from town (~15 minutes) which was perfect for what we were looking for. Very comfortable, well-decorated, and clean. Would definitely return."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay highly recommended.
2018-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is beautiful and we were amazed by all the small appliances and quality of everything!! The views are to die for and we had several sweet deer and rabbits visiting nearby. There was tape!! Lol, I needed tape and in the drawer was packaging tape and scissors. And lots of other stuff!!! Lots of thought put into this home. It made us feel very welcomed. It felt like a home not a blank barren room with a bed. Loved it."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely adored the location and home - its WAY better than any other vacation rental we've stayed at. The home has everything needed and more - we'll definitely be staying again.
Maybe next time they'll add a hot tub .... that's about the only thing that could make the stay better. :)"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paulette has excellent taste. The house was gorgeous. Well appointed, all you could possibly need in the kitchen, bedrooms, bath. The style and thoughtfulness, placement and feel of the place was just perfect! What a perfect escape for my dad and I for his birthday! Thank you Paulette!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paulette's house is beautiful and exceeded my expectations. The home has a great floorpan and is extremely clean, comfortable, well equipped, and stylish. The location was quiet and serene and there was plenty of parking. During the day, we took the paddle boards out on the lake, went fishing from our kayaks and just lounged on the private beach. We cooked dinner together each evening and sat out on the deck overlooking the lake. We had a super fun and relaxing weekend and I definitely hope to make another trip to stay at Paulette's house. Thank you very much, Paulette!"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house! Even nicer than the photos show. Lots of nice touches and overall an excellent place to relax.
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 5 stayed here for 4 nights and it was great. We had such a relaxing, peaceful time. Paulette’s home was very clean and comfortable (especially the master bed!). We were a little nervous about the stairs to the beach because of a couple reviews, but they were not bad at all, even for a 2 year old. We would definitely stay again if we’re ever in the area."
2017-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We found a gem. The owner keeps the place new, nice and clean. The place felt very welcome as we entered the house. Highly recommend for all year round. The Master bedroom, living room and kitchen has awesome lake view. The place also has a private lake entrance. Definitely 5 stars vacation home 👍🏻"
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"though exterior beach-access stairs were many (also irregular and a bit slippery in November, since exposure is north), and though neighbors were a bit nearer than expected, there were many wonderful things about this rental: hosts were very kind and responsive— generously left us a nice bottle of wine—and the house was scrupulously clean, confortable, and well-equipped. views from within it were lovely.. kitchen was superb (we had relatives visit for dinner, plenty of space). there were some good DVDs, too. We had a happy thanksgiving. one tip: en route in to the property, double-check the house-number sign before making your second turn downhill after entering Fire Rd 8— that 2nd turn is a sharp right (when we came, there was no fish sign there, as corroborating marker, and house numbers are easy to confuse— we went all the way downhill and had to turn around in soneone else’s property). All in all, this was a very nice rental (many on Clear Lake are not)."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely adored our stay here. Such a tranquil, beautiful spot! The house was decorated with care, and we appreciated all the details. A terrific kitchen served us well!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful property that has been decorated with care. The property has fantastic views of Clearlake and the surrounding landscape. Our family totally enjoyed our stay.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family loved our stay at Paulette's place. As the other reviews mention, it really is a great location - so quite and peaceful - well worth any drive to get to it! We found the place very clean, well stocked and overall with everything we needed for a quiet weekend away. Paulette was always quick to respond to my questions, which I also appreciated."
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such an ideal location and beautiful house! It absolutely made our girls weekend. Highly recommend this to anyone looking to relax and enjoy the sounds and serenity of the lake.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is incredible! Right on the lake, surrounded by nature, so peaceful and quiet. My friends and I had such a good time. We rented jet skis on the other side of the lake one afternoon, took the kayak out, and very much enjoyed sitting on the back porch and bird watching!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW. This place exceeded expectations. A beautiful house in a beautiful location with everything you'd need to whole up and enjoy yourselves. Our group of 6 loved the place. From the full kitchen with ample settings to the kayak in the garage, we truly felt like we were a guest at a well loved cabin. We would highly recommend this getaway."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paulette's house was just what we were looking for at Clear Lake, perfect size for the two of us but would be great for a group of 4. The house has a perfect placement slightly up the hill which makes for great views of Clear Lake from the deck, but is just steps away from the water with a private beach. The property overall is very quiet and the beach gets quite a bit of sun during the day.
It's fully equipped with all the amenities you could need for a relaxing weekend - air conditioning, full kitchen, charcoal grill, and plenty of water toys such a 2-person canoe. One thing to note: The house is located about 15 minutes from grocery stores or restaurants so just be sure to bring supplies on your way in.
We'll definitely be back!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property, wonderful hosts, 5 stars all around!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home with excellent furnishings and AC. All appliances worked great and some of the items we had forgotten were available to us in the pantry. Lots of board games available for families and groups. The loft area is spacious although the ladder up to it is a little precarious because it's not permanently attached. The back deck overlooks the lake and provides an incredible view. Trees needed to be trimmed to improve the view further. Neighbors are close by on both sides, but it still felt rather secluded. It is lake front property with a small beach that is mostly sand but also had quite a bit of larger rocks. No dock on site, so we had to beach our boat for the duration of our stay.
We brought our 24 foot boat and it was difficult to navigate the boat and trailer down the gravel fire road. It was steep and there were very tight angles to maneuver. The property has ample parking, but it is not large enough to keep the trailer attached to the vehicle. We had to disconnect the trailer and park it adjacent to our vehicle to keep it off the road.
Owner Paulette was extremely responsive to any questions and concerns we had. Overall, this was a great rental for the week."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect place for a weekend getaway! The home is beautiful and secluded with a lovely private beach for relaxing. We really enjoyed taking the kayak out on the lake and relaxing on the deck with an amazing view! Thank you so much for being such great hosts!
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved everything about this place.
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful home and very well appointed. We liked it so much that we are going back in September!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was thoughtfully equipped with all the essentials, including cutlery, coffee, spices, and even shampoo. The host clearly put a lot of effort into ensuring we had everything we needed. Thank you for that. Additionally, the inside was impeccably clean. The surroundings were peaceful, and we were delighted to see some deer roaming around. Thank you for hosting us!
1 thing that can be made better:
- There is kind of a weird skylight in the master bedroom through which tons of light enter starting around 5am. The skylight is different since there is no visibility through it but it amplifies the light coming in. It's exceptionally bright. It messed up our sleep for 2 nights. I informed the host about it and she said they have ordered a cover for it. Hopefully should be fixed in the future."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Checking in at this home was a smooth process and we appreciated the host’s communication! The home is beautiful, very clean, and offers amazing lake views. We would be happy to visit again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beitiful view of lake. A little tight getting to property and for parking, but worked for us as a couple."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancée and I just wanted to get away and this was the perfect place. Beautiful, spacious house with an incredible view. The lake access/boat ramp was literally a minute away. We brought our kayak and paddleboard and had a blast paddling around the island across from the dock. Exactly the relaxing weekend we needed."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was well-stocked, beds were very comfy and we loved the view! Perfect for 4 people, we had a great weekend staying here!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this Airbnb was nothing short of amazing! The house was impeccably clean and tastefully decorated, making us feel right at home. The location was perfect, allowing us to explore the lake easily on foot. Our host was incredibly helpful and responsive, making sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We especially loved the cozy balcony, where we could unwind and enjoy the beautiful lake views. The only downside of this area is that it’s away from the town itself so there’s limited options when it comes to grocery shopping or eating out unless youre willing to drive out of the area. Besides that, this Airbnb exceeded all our expectations! Highly recommend to anyone visiting the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, relaxing and would recommend other to book"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Janelle’s home is absolutely beautiful with the Clearlake views that you just can’t get enough of! We had a nice and peaceful stay in a well stocked home that has everything that you would want when staying in an Airbnb!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly, it was a great stay, only issue is there aren’t many stores nearby but it is such a nice and beautiful place to stay and rent, I was able to enjoy my stay with no interruptions and all amenities needed, I thank the hosts and hope to come again 👍🏼."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House was as described, clean, quiet, peaceful. My son loved fishing off the dock and caught multiple bass and catfish. Plenty of parking, great for boat/trailer parking. Beautiful scenery and sunsets. Will stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I fish at Clear Lake often. They have a dock and ample secured parking. I have not found a better place on the lake.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very Nice place to stay, clean comfortable in very nice location.
Great owner communication very helpful
Definitely recommended!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful vacation! There is an electric private dock that can be lowered easily. You will need to use the key and open the lock box out by the dock. We come to Clearlake for fishing and we did pretty well at this spot. At first when I looked at the listing I thought it was only the second story and then I was like oh its just stating its a two story home. It is in fact a two story home, however, you are only renting the top. It was clean, comfortable, private and beautiful! We would love to come back for another stay in the future. Graciela was a great host and was super quick to respond to any and all questions which made everything that much better! Thank you so much."

I will definitely book this place again next year."

We left rejuvenated and already planning our next getaway at this delightful retreat. Highly recommend!"

The house is set up for a hassle free and relaxing stay! We used each bed available with our group and had a great night sleep!
We are traveling through the state and my youngest left a precious toy bear. We did not realize until we were two hours away. She graciously shipped it back! So, the tears are dried up and our kids keep saying it has been the best stay of the trip!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect place to bring your family or for a men's fishing trip, like we did. The house was spotless, had everything we needed and was a perfect spot to go fishing while relaxing on the deck. When we were not fishing, the house was stocked with lots of games to play. I believe this has become one of our favorite spots to visit and can't wait to revisit. Thank you Elizabeth for sharing your home with us and being an amazing host."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great fun home to stay in! We caught lots of fish and had tons of fun with the games and lovely home. Had fishing poles and everything ready for us to use when we arrived.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,One of the best Airbnbs we've stayed in! My family had tons of fun out on the lake and by the fire pit. We felt right at home. The place is beautiful and cozy. We hope to come back soon!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a girls relaxing weekend at Elizabeths place. The house met all of our needs and much more. Her attention to detail was on point from the tampons in the bathroom to the well stocked kitchen. The serene house on the lagoon made our need to get some R&R a perfect place. We would go outside in the morning to watch the ducks and geese and sit in front of the firepit outside in the evening with a glass of wine! The process to get in was easy and Elizabeth is great at communication and being available to answer any questions. I can't wait to go back in the summer! Highly recommend this place if you're looking to relax and enjoy some time near the water.
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice place to relax, I had an amazing birthday with all my kids. The place was really nice and clean.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great time here! Even with some rainy weather we found things to do nearby including wine tasting only 10 minutes away. Also had lots of fun playing the arcade games. We hope to be back when it’s more sunny and do some fishing right off the dock!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is as described.. very clean and cozy feeling.. my family enjoyed our stay there.. lots of games for the kids to play. Arcade is a plus. Love the view in the back with fireplace. We have no complaints but a great memory to cherish.. fishing was fun but no luck. It’s ok though it was a wonderful experience.. thank you for such fast response.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay. The house was well stocked and clean. Children loved have both video and tons of board games to play. Though it's was cold, we utilized the paddle boat to feed the ducks (kids also loved that activity). We had a problem one evening. I messaged Elizabeth, and she promptly responded and had a solution. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and hope to be back soon."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, great house! Very well maintained, cozy!
The view is simply gorgeous! We used the boat - kids were soooo happy!
Highly recommend!
Elizabeth is one of the best hosts I’ve came across with."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a pleasure to stay at Elizabeth's house. The house was great. Everything was very clean, the place was just renovated. Comfortable mattresses. Kids had such fun with arcade games. Elizabeth is very friendly and promptly responded to my questions."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Elizabeth’s place was exactly what we needed! We had a mixture of sunshine and rain and both were enjoyable… very peaceful sitting on back deck overlooking the water listening to the rain drops and walking around the neighborhood enjoying the sunshine. The home was clean and we were able to cook an early Thanksgiving dinner … we are already looking at our calendars to book again with Elizabeth. We will definitely be back!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Elizabeth’s place. It was so serene and relaxing. She is a great host. Her home was amazing and in a very nice location on the water. We felt like we were at home, we were so comfortable. We will definitely stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was beautiful, clean, and had so many fun activities/games. All of the amenities, such as the fire pit were wonderful. Would definitely love to stay again! Elizabeth was also very nice and helpful, she made sure my group had the best experience at her place."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our first time booking an Airbnb and Elizabeth made it so easy! She is very responsive and makes sure that everything is okay! Our stay was so much fun we caught many catfish and a huge carp over 7 pounds just by fishing off the deck! The house was beyond our expectations! We will definitely be booking with Elizabeth again when we go back to Clearlake!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Elizabeth’s place. If you’re looking for a peaceful getaway with great amenities (barbecue, firepit, outdoor deck, fishing equipment and more) to make it even more special this is the place. She really thought about the little things and the house was so well equipped with everything which made us so comfortable.
The view of the lake and the sounds of the birds in the morning is amazing. We also got to see Otters visit the deck downstairs on some days. The lake does get an algae bloom in the summer which makes it green but that didn’t bother us. The location and surrounding areas are very residential and quiet.
Brassfield Winery is a 10min drive and a must visit if you like wine! There are also some nice restaurants a drive away.
Thank you Elizabeth for a wonderful getaway!! We will definitely come back."

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"To begin with, if you're searching for an exceptional family retreat in Clearlake, look no further! Our family had an incredible experience in this gorgeous home.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a lovely place to stay. The kids enjoyed the kayak and it was awesome!!! They also appreciated the fishing poles. The house was clean, the arcade games were fun. Great place to stay, easy to access and overall excellent house."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy home, its a beautiful place! I didn’t experience any problem at all. The host is very helpful and responsive. I recommend this place!! 5 ⭐️ for everything 😊😊😊"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,She always did quick response and very flexible for us. She is a very nice and thoughtful person I’ve ever had as Airbnb owner-the best owner ever. We really loved and enjoyed the house and the kids loved to feed ducks. I really appreciate what she did for us. With this price of staying was also amazing! Thank you Liz!!! Hopefully we can come back again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved staying here for a couple days to get away from home for a bit. We all enjoyed the deck and scenery. Kids loved playing endless arcade games and Bop it. House was perfect for the weekend getaway. Thank you Liz!

The location was convenient, and I felt safe exploring the neighborhood. I highly recommend Elizabeth's Airbnb to anyone seeking a memorable experience. Thank you, Elizabeth, for an unforgettable stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We always enjoy our stay at Rich & Sharon & Autumn's homes. I always know that the home will be in pristine condition when I arrive.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you, great stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Outstanding location, especially if you are on a boating/fishing vacation. We had a 21 ft and 19 ft bassboats with plenty of dock space located in the keys. The Autumn's contacted us before I could ask if early check in was available and of course it was. Beautiful home with easy parking for 2 trucks and trailers. Property was immaculate and better than advertised. Highly recommended."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Would book this place again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you for having us.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kitchen, floor and bathroom very clean and neat. Neighborhood is quiet. Owner is responsive to questions. We will come back again, thks!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay at this home and it did not disappoint again. We will definitely be back again. the dock is great and you can't beat the location to get out to the Lake. It is also a very clean home.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host (Rich) was very responsive when he was needed.
The price for what we had was more than a great deal.
We will be coming back in the fall!!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"A beautiful house to stay; we enjoyed how peaceful and close to nature it was. Would 100% go back especially during summer!
A couple minor tips if you are considering the place - 1) sound-proofing isn't the best so I'd bring some ear plugs if you are with a larger party. 2) The kitchen has most things you need, but the knives are not the best; would bring a set if you are planning on cooking at home. Otherwise, the place was wonderful!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a nice time. Beautiful and well kept home. Looks better in person, the pictures don’t do it justice."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We liked the place, it was clean and quite.
We didn't like too much the fact that we needed to put the cabinet bed by our selves but the instructions were very clear and we managed to make it with no hassle.
I would gladly recommend the place!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,very nice
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"The place was very relaxing to come home to after long work days. The deck was a perfect hang out area to catch the sunsets and enjoy the sounds of the birds.
We were happy with this accommodation except for not having access to any cleaning supplies or additional laundry pods (we were provided 3 pods). My coworker and I lived here for 10 days and would have loved to have access to the cleaning supplies. We ended up buying our own detergent to wash our clothes, which isn’t that big of a deal, but we had just assumed these would be part of the basic amenities.
We enjoyed going out in the pedal boat one evening and overall thought he place was great. Thanks!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home able to sleep a large group! Gorgeous surroundings and view- you are on the water and the neighborhood is super calming and peaceful. Would definitely return.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved this place. Great location! Great deck! Amazing everything 🤍
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Good clean comfortable home to stay in, close enough to access most amenities in Clearlake. Spacious, true to description, kitchen supplies were adequate, and the deck was gated which adds a sense of security. Very clean, no hint of previous renters with pets. This is a rental that I will visit again. Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay...felt peacful and clean. Very accomodating host
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our visit was amazing. The house was clean and packed with everything we needed. I realized I forgot to bring toothpaste, but there was a little goodie bag by the front door that included it in case we forgot! The binder that's provided has all the information and instructions from check-in/out to how to use the appliances. We really appreciate the suggestions for food and activities in the area. We used the pedal boat the two full days we were there and had a blast. Theres also accommodations for dogs and treats in the cabinet. Our only issue was that upon entering, there were tons of mosquitoes around the front door, and many got into the house since it was a bit warm inside. Once we turned on the A/C, they all started to freeze up, fall to the ground, and we were able to sweep them up then. We would definitely stay here again and plan on making an annual trip!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you for letting us enjoy your great home. We enjoyed our time, and will plan to return soon. Thanks for all of the attention to detail place looked clean."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The space was very nice and clean. There was a little dog bed, toy and dishes for our dog which was an added bonus. There were plenty of games and movies. The kitchen was spacious and we cooked a lot.
I did not know that the water was so green with algae. Wish we could have jumped in off of the dock.
Overall it was nice and spacious"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I grew up in the Oaks in the 80s and 90s, so this stay was very nostalgic for me. The location couldn't be better, as it is near the end of Keys Blvd, right off the main lake. Due to being so close to the main part of the lake, the algae is less present and the travel time to the main lake is within minutes!
The house was perfect for our trip. I actually thought the house looked better in person than in the pictures. No details were spared in this house in terms of comforts. The place is bigger inside than it looked in the pictures, somewhere around 1700 square feet.
There was plenty of driveway space for 2 cars and a boat trailer! I loved being able to back in our boat trailer and keep it off the street. This was a major plus. I would highly recommend this place for families and those that have a boat that need a place that can accommodate. The boat dock was perfect for our small ski boat. We plan to book again next summer!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the second time we have stayed at Rich & Sharon’s listing and both times have been amazing! Beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood, responsive hosts and we love being about to use the boat dock."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was really hoping for something that was a good value, had a nice view, and was clean. Rich & Sharon's Clearlake home hit on all my points, plus it just felt so comfortable and inviting. I would highly recommend staying at this wonderful house that will not let you down."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice location. It is very clean and in a quiet neighborhood. Deck and dock are perfect for lounging outside or mooring a boat. House is clean and comfortable. A/C works very well, which is critical in summer months. Rich is a great host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome hosts and beautiful neighborhood. The dock was perfect to take the kids fishing and they even had a paddle boat available to use.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Always a great stay! Our 3rd year in a row booking one of their houses and we already booked next year! We wouldn’t book it if we didn’t love it!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great hosts, good value, this was our 2nd time staying there."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rich was very responsive. The home was spacious. Dollar general is 3 minutes from the home so we were able to make quick trips for anything we forgot or needed. It would have been nice to have lights in the back deck so we could stay outside and enjoy the night but the private dock was nice to have. We fished off the dock and were able to catch a few fishes. The neighbors were friendly.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time and saw tons of wildlife. The porch was our favorite part.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at Heron’s Nest. The best part is the large back deck. The pictures don’t do it justice. It was so nice to have a large, fenced space right off of the living room to enjoy with our young kids and small dog. We shared many meals outside and I enjoyed sipping my coffee in the mornings and watching for birds and otters. The AC worked very well and we had everything we needed for a long weekend, including a couple of games and puzzles.
I was a bit worried right before coming because I couldn’t find much online about the area but there is an impressive binder of information in the listing. We took the kids to one of the beach parks about 20 minutes north and they enjoyed playing in and at the edge of the water and on the playground. We also visited the Fosters freeze on a warm day for soft serve. Other than that, we really just wanted to be at the house and enjoy the canals with their paddle boat."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As always everything was perfectly prepared for our stay. Love this home.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is a great place to stay
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Super easy check in, very responsive hosts and the house was immaculate. Plenty of parking space, beautiful deck, perfect boat dock. Everything about this place and the host was excellent!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"BEST HOST EVER! These folks strive to make this place a beautiful, comfortable home-away-from-home. I loved every minute of my stay. We had a slight issue with low propane gas, Sharon sent her son and husband immediately who tried everything to correct the issue. Sharon had the gas company come right away and fix the problem. I was given compensation for my inconvenience; greatly appreciated but unexpected. This house is perfect, comfortable, beautiful, the boat dock is perfect and can accommodate multiple watercraft. The kitchen has everything, the towels and linen and dishes are all high quality. This house is spotless, you will love it. There is ever attention to detail with games, books, you name it . The decor is very special. Loved this place and hope I get to stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"we had such a great time here. We had everything we needed, the house was very homey and the views were beautiful. We really enjoyed our stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great experience for our family (including our puppy) visiting Clear Lake for the weekend. Comfy beds, amazing big deck, and private covered dock for our boat. Close to groceries, bait shop, gas, and the Clear Lake Oaks boat ramp…couldn’t ask for more.
Proactive communication from the hosts with instructions, recommendations, and answering any questions we had was much appreciated. Thanks guys!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Friendly, responsive owners. The welcome package is a nice touch. Beautiful back deck!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,thank you
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very peaceful and private stay. The dock was very nice to sit and relax, unfortunately it was raining most of our stay so we had to stay inside most of the time. With that being said, the host had many accommodations like pots and pans to cook with, and even left complementary popcorn for watching movies! 😁 Also, it’s very pet friendly, but make sure your pets are comfortable doing their business on rocks/cement or that you walk often, as there aren’t any patches of grass at the home. Overall, they really made it feel like a home away from home, very beautiful and comfortable!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was wonderful. The kids loved it.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Well-maintained, clean, quiet, and relaxing waterfront home. Hiked at Clearlake State Park and Anderson Marsh State Park during our stay. Visited Lakeport for lunch and the drive back through the north lake area around the lake was very scenic."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed a kitchen up to the task of a full Thanksgiving Dinner and a beautiful view from the deck. A Birder in the family found 98 species over 3 days. Thank you Rich, Sharon and Autumn for sharing your home."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Cute house and very clean. We saw all kinds of lake life while sitting out on the deck. Quiet neighborhood. Would stay here again.

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Had a lovely stay. Rich and Sharon’s place was clean and cozy.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is amazing! The hosts are wonderful and very quick to respond to any immediate requests or assistance. The back deck is huge and has a peaceful view of the outlet from the lake that the house is on. The only note we have (which is personal preference) is that the primary bed is quite firm, so if you have a hard time with that we recommend finding a solution to soften the bed."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The home was clean and comfortable. My family loved our stay! So did our doggy!!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Blue Herons Nest is charming, quaint, and beyond cozy. Our family enjoyed all the house offered and our furry friends felt right at home. Rich & Sharon have included all of the little touches that make Airbnb's special.
Favorite moments of our stay included watching the river otter family roam around the neighboring docks, using the peddle boat, playing games on the incredible deck, and star gazing at night. The lake is low and the algae is high - but there is still so much to enjoy and take in!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay. The house was clean and comfortable and had a peaceful vibe. The deck was huge and was great to be able to sit outside and look out at the water. The owners were nice and responsive to any question. Would recommend and we plan to come back.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful stay and beautiful house. Would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a lake house. 10/10

2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is our second year booking with Rich & Sharon & Autumn. We've already booked for our family fishing trip next year! They have made each of their locations feel so much like home, yet feeling like a fancy getaway!
Clean, Roomy, Great Service and Prime Location! Can't ask for much more!"

2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nicely decorated, clean home. Communication was very good and check in was easy. Labels on drawers, light switches made it very easy. Deck is nice, our granddaughter loved having a place to play.
Pillow comfort is a personal thing, so I was glad we had our own pillows. We enjoyed several wineries and went to the west side of the lake to have lunch and browse."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family had an enjoyable stay during winter break. This little home has everything we need, including our puppy. House is clean and the rear deck view is great. If come at a warmer time, we could have BBQ at the rear deck."

2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was very cute. We loved the heron theme! My family and I had a wonderful time playing games on the dining room table. We didn't use the paddleboat or explore the lake. But we did enjoy a lunch on it deck and watching the waterfowl.

2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We were happy to find this place situated near to where my family lives. The Airbnb served our family well, everything was as described. There was an issue with the master bath drain and we were disappointed in the speed of the internet and not being able to watch movies on Netflix. But all in all, we had a good experience."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean place! Loved the house. My family and I had a great stay! Thank you

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place right on the lake! The house was very clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. The neighborhood is great for a relaxing stay with a lot of side streets to explore with your pup. It is close to town and the deck over the lake is a great place to hang out and enjoy the view. We enjoyed our stay and I would definitely stay here again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"excellent, we loved our stay we could enjoy a relaxing weekend, everything clean well ordered and 100% recommended, I guarantee you will never regret"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house, very clean and had everything we needed! Lots of room and open space to spend time with family and reconnect. Owners were very responsive. Unfortunately the water was to low for us to enjoy the paddle boat, also note that this is not a place where swimming would be advised."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Rich and Sharon's home was a quaint place to stay for our short weekend. As you walk in, you'll notice everything is clean, kitchen cabinets organized with labels, and beds perfectly made for your arrival. The color scheme of the whole house is just calming that you do feel like you're on vacation.
Make use of the informational binder that will give you restaurants, historical places of interest and things to do in the surrounding towns, as well as all the info you need to take care of their home.
The backyard patio not only was a great place to watch the sunrise and sunset but also to birdwatch and barbecue some dinner. We also loved the topographic map of Clear Lake on the wall!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,They were very polite and access to the home was easy and secure. The home was lovely and we enjoyed our stay.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rich, Sharon and Autumns lake house is beautiful and amazing. Pictures dont do it justice. Just what my friends and I needed to disconnect. Great place and definitely recommend."
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nice, clean and comfy home. We love the back patio space."
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Rich & Sharon's place was perfect for our group of friends. Comfortably sleeps 7 people (with the large pull out sofa bed). It was really clean and well stocked with towels, cooking utensils, etc. There are also 2 TVs and a beautiful deck and BBQ grill outside. Would recommend!"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great communication back and forth with the host of any problems occurred. Definitely would book again
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Please check the weather before you book your trip it gets very hot there
Don’t expect to swim the lake not good for swimming"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friends and I loved this place! It’s hard to find homes on Airbnb with lots of kitchen utensils and accessories but this house had it all! The AC saved us from the heat outside. We’ll definitely come here again!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved staying at the Herons Nest. Rich, Sharon, and Autumn were so thoughtful with everything they left in the home for guests and had GREAT communication. It felt so much more personal than other Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. My family and I were impressed with how clean everything was. The place was seriously spotless. Location was perfect, right on the water and we were able to fish off the boat dock. We even caught a few catfish! Also, the wifi was fast enough for me to work one day while I was there and join conference calls on my laptop. This place was perfect for relaxing on the lake."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was clean, there was plenty of accommodations. There was a little paddleboat for the kids to go and play on which was really nice! I felt like home away from home, very relaxing and comfortable."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay at the blue herons nest was Exceptional!
We were overwhelmed this how clean, stocked, large and Beautiful this home was. From the beginning we felt right at home! The check-in was easy and there was no hassle. The home is set up in a beautiful quaint street that backs up to the lovely water where you can sit out on the deck and enjoy the views, nature and from backyard BBQ. We came for our trip to the beautiful clear lake and the infamous fishing. We were so pleased with our entire stay, and already are planning our next stay!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"great property and location , great deck with a view of the water"

2021-06-01,4.0,Group trip,Great place!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our second time staying at Rich/Sharon/Autumn’s place, and it was as nice an experience as we remembered from pre-Covid. Super clean home with all amenities provided, safe for little kids, large deck with gas BBQ and ramp down to boat dock. Prompt communication by phone and text. We look forward to returning next month."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The whole home is a great relaxing atmosphere, great access to the water for kayaking . Our kids enjoyed being so close to the water."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our second time here, Family and I love it!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was perfect for our group of five. We had plenty of space and all the amenities we needed. The house was super clean. The neighborhood is nice and convenient to grocery stores, food, gas and launch ramps for the lake. We also had fun fishing off the dock at the back of the house."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can't go wrong renting this home. Every single thing was provided by Rich and Sharon...down to the most minute detail. The home was exceptionally clean, the beds were the most comfortable beds that we have ever slept on in an Airbnb rental...decor was amazing, street was super quiet and safe...deck was safe and with a gorgeous view. Kitchen was well equipped, very open and super functional. Just an incredibly beautiful location as well as a fantastic home. I would give it 10 stars if the ratings allowed."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home worked out very well for family. The water access was great for the grandkids who loved paddle boarding.
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a great place to stay
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect place to stay, beyond clean. Pet friendly, so our dog was able to be with us. Be sure to bring dog bags to pick up your dogs poop. Beds comfortable, spacious rooms, great kitchen. Labels on everything made finding stuff easy."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is perfect for folks who have fishing boats. The boat can be parked out in the deck allowing guests to go out anytime without having to launch the boat.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home smells fresh. Very nice patio/balcony. Enjoyed every minutes of our stay.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Blue Heron's Nest really meets the hype in terms of location and overall amenities. Our kids loved the deck and the peddle boat, and it was great to just get away from the city for a few days of hiking and boating. The space was well cleaned and there were many small touches to make the stay comfortable (I found the novelty Clearlake Monopoly game to be a nice touch of local flavor!).
We had an unexpected water shutoff during our stay which was somewhat frustrating, but Rich and Sharon were very accommodating to help make our stay more comfortable in spite of the difficult circumstances. They were very responsive and available for communication and in helping us through the situation. It seems like it was a one-off line repair affecting the entire street, and not anything to do with the house itself; so I wouldn't anticipate a repeat situation."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay and were happy to bring along our dog. Our family was able to relax and spend quality time together. We appreciated all the lovely touches around the house, from the mints on the nightstand and selection of board games, to the informative binder with lots of information on the area. My husband is an amateur birder and identified 30 different birds, just from the house. The neighborhood was quiet and we enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere of the deck. We will definitely be back."
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"I stayed here with my family of 5 and it was perfect for us. We had previously stayed at their other house right next door a few months back, but chose to switch this time for the bigger patio deck in the back. With the nice weather out we spent most of our time out back and were still able to get in a considerable amount of hours of fishing done since there’s a dock right out back to have your boat. The owners are super helpful and quick to respond as well. And they stocked plenty of extra supplies for us (towels, soap, kitchen necessities, etc.) We had another great time staying here thanks to them. We’ll definitely be booking again!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was clean and inviting! They had thought of everything. In the kitchen all we had to bring was the food, everything else was provided! We are already planning our next trip next year!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the convenience of the private boat dock.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location and beautiful views from the deck. The house was very clean the hosts were responsive and accommodating to requests. Had a great stay.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for 2-3 people. Lots of kitchen amenities and a nice deck.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Much like a model home, Blue Herron was everything we had expected and did not disappoint. The deck was gorgeous and waking up to the water is fantastic. We are so grateful we were able to bring our dog with us. Thanks again!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value and great location, would love to book it again soon! Thanks!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a amazing experience for our family. Very cozy comfortable and clean! If your having doubts on visiting, dont!! You will not regret it. Such a beautiful home and they put so much care into your stay! The deck on the water leaves a picture perfect memory."
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is so cute, the deck is so spacious and it’s decorated so well. I highly recommend it for five people or less. The location is great and there’s plenty of parking. Would definitely stay here again."
2021-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place, nice and clean! Probably the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at in general. Kitchen stocked with all supplies needed, each room was clean and there was more than enough linens for our group. Would stay here again"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a very relaxing getaway, not too far from the Bay Area. The deck was so peaceful, and the house was very clean. We would definitely return."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Rich and Sharon's place felt like ""home away from home"". The house was in a nice neighborhood. Very quiet and relaxing. Neighbors were nice. The deck was awesome. It was nice to sit out there and enjoy the waterfront. Wished we caught some fish. It was the best 3 days spent away from what was going on in the world. My son loved the tub. Fully equipped kitchen. Clean. Down the road was a market. 15 min drive to town. We will definitely add this place on our list for when we return back to Clearlake."
2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a wonderful time staying here! Great communication and beautiful views!!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute home, comfortably appointed and perfectly located on the lake in the Keys. We would love to come back and enjoy this location in the summer months, but it was still a great spot to visit in the middle of winter."
2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Very comfortable and beautiful home. Perfect for a family vacation!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great waterfront vacation home in Clearlake, pretty new and super clean. It has everything you need and more than you expected. We bring our dog with us and there are dog toys and bed prepared in the house. Big waterfront deck with a lot of chairs as well as a bbq grill. A 4-person paddle boat you can use to enjoy the water and lake. And host responses our messages very quick as well. We really like our new-year vacation here and we are considering to come back some time later. Highly recommended!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time and enjoyed our stay. The house was beautiful and clean. We would love to come back soon!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had such a wonderful weekend here! It was so nice to be able to bring our dog as well. Everything was super clean, the deck was awesome, and the views were gorgeous. Lots of thoughtful touches in the home as well. We would come back again!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home was just as listed and everything met or exceeded our expectations. The view from the back of the house was spectacular with the water and rolling hills and vineyards in the distance. The neighborhood this time of year was really quiet as it seems many in the area may be vacation homes but it was nice to have the lake seemingly all to ourselves. It was a wonderful alternative to celebrating with extended family this holiday.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay at their home! Really enjoyed sitting on the porch overlooking the lake during the morning and being able to hide from the sun in the canopy in the afternoons. I was in contact with Rich during our stay and he responded in a timely matter and was helpful with anything I asked. Would definitely stay here again!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed the stay very much. Great location and plenty of amenities. Everything was so clean. It was a nice break for my family!
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place we are again in may if everything works out
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the second time we’ve stayed here in the last few months, and we will be back again soon. The house was clean and comfortable and Rich and Sharon were great hosts. Highly recommend this home!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay and had a relaxing break. The outdoor deck with the canopy and swing was awesome and we enjoyed eating and spending time there. The home was very clean and had the basic amenities needed and yes it looked better than the pictures. Loved the master tub. Would have loved to enjoy the water more If the algae wasn't as prevalent.
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place and great staycation! Work Away from home with online kids school. Host was amazing! giving us personalized grooming kits and it was super clean!
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Hosts were awesome! Great communication. We planned our trips for months and communication with the hosts was fantastic. They helped answer any questions and made accommodations for us although we ended up not needing them. Would give them an A+.
Property is very nice and clean with a great floor plan and amenities. House was stocked with those little circle hotel hand soaps along with a shampoo, conditioner, and body wash soap dispenser. This was super thoughtful for their guests. For those fishermen, the deck is large and the dock has room for more than 1 boat. House is also located in the first subset of canals so it is protected from the wind and also fast access to the main lake when heading out.
Overall, experience was great and would definitely recommend this property to any fishermen and family looking for a vacation."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A bastion of peace in the midst of evacuation chaos, as the hosts welcomed our entire family, including cats and dogs, into their home when we were forced to evacuate from Calistoga ."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cozy and comfortable place! On the water with a sturdy/accessible dock with a lovely view of the Keys! Would definitely recommend this little slice of paradise!
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Very Relaxing place to stay.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wife, daughter and I stayed here for a week. We loved the place!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pictures didn't do it justice at all! This is such a cozy, clean and stylish house, with all amenities you would need for a relaxing trip. Rich was super accommodating as well. We arrived at the location where outside temperature was 110+, upon entering the house where AC has been running it felt almost like paradise. There is a very nice touch in the house decorations, a lot of adorable things like the welcoming bag, bubble bath balls, swing chair on the deck for star watching, just love them. Will definitely come back!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Big deck clean dock nice kitchen clean in and out with all you will need for a great getaway
I recommend it to everyone!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at the Blue Herons nest! Rich was great at communicating and immediately responded to any questions
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Better than the pictures! The kitchen and deck were top notch.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Felt very comfortable in the house !
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was perfect! Our family enjoyed their super clean home and large deck area (also, yay for being dog friendly!) The paddleboat was amazing for us to explore the keys and even the main lake! My brother fished all day and caught fish from the paddleboat and dock! There was a lot of space for all of us to hangout and chill! Easy and quick communication with the hosts and easy check-in/check-out process. Would highly recommend this place for anybody looking to get away -- especially with their furbabies!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The blue heron’s nest is exactly as described.
The place was clean & check in was a breeze. Sharon & Rich were super responsive from the start. This was my outing during the pandemic & I was concerned about the cleaning - Sharon our the doubts to rest by explaining her cleaning protocol & the place was clean when we arrived.
It is right on the lake with an attached private dock. The algae bloom was in full swing - so we couldn’t swim from the dock. The algae smell was noticeable but we got used to it within the first few mins & was not dealbreaker.
The house itself is well appointed & has the basic needs met. Overall, a pleasant & enjoyable stay!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute, clean, light and bright. Owners were a joy to work with and would recommend"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home with some really thoughtful touches. House was extremely well stocked with everything we needed, and the porch and dock were perfect. Rich and Sharon were great communicators and made sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing place on the water."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We rented this house with another family and it was the perfect size for us. The house was clean, the location was perfect, and Rich and Sharon were very accommodating hosts. The large deck in the back overlooking the water was amazing. I highly recommend."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house is exactly as advertised - impeccably clean and comfortable. Our 11 year-old boys loved the dock and paddle boat. Check-in was quick and easy. Highly recommend!!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful spot right on the water, complete with dock and paddleboat as advertised. House is super clean and well-maintained, functional, and has all the amenities you'd need. Nice touches included some toothbrush kits in case you forgot, some snacks (microwave popcorn), and local area information. Plenty to do in the area besides just the lake, this is an ideal spot for a quick weekend getaway or something longer."
2020-07-01,4.0,Group trip,The inside was awesome. They thought of everything. All the way down to the q-tips. But the lake puts off quite a bad smell and you don’t want to swim in it at all. Very unfortunate
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"House is as advertised, small and clean, right on a channel off the main lake, and one of the best kept on the block. The owner Rich is very nice guy and an excellent communicator. Check in/out super convenient. WiFi was better than expected, 4 kids had no issues using iPads, phones at the same time and even streaming on apple TV, kitchen has most of the basic amenities. The large deck outside was very enjoyable and kids can fish for little blue gill off the dock which was fun. Having a paddle boat is a plus, but check that Rich has fixed the handle before using, my son went out and got stuck because of broken handle/rudder, a very nice neighbor towed him back to our dock. I asked owner in advance about swimming off the dock and was told that in July it should be fine and algae doesn't bloom happen until later in the summer, however when we arrived the water was like pea soup with algae that was so thick, and smelly, nobody would want to swim in it (we were there July 8 - 13). Also the dock next door looks to be abandoned and is covered with dozens of ducks and their feces, this likely adds to the muck in the water. That was our only disappointment because it was 97-100 degree highs every day and nowhere to swim. Also we got invaded by rice flies which were so abundant I have never seen anything like it. Thousands of them literally. Again this is not the owners fault but it did affect our stay, we thought they were mosquitos at first so a little heads up about them would have been good. Otherwise, I highly recommend this house and for the price, it was an excellent value! Thanks Rich & Sharon!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Group trip,this place will be what you were hoping for. If you can't relax and enjoy at this place you might to consider some self reflection!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed two nights here for a getaway from the Bay Area. Very clean house right on the water. Very quiet and peaceful. The house was well-equipped and the beds were comfy. We appreciated the guidebook with local tips. (We enjoyed the Redbud hiking trail and loved Six Sigma Winery.)
We also appreciated that the hosts were flexible with check-in time.
Thanks to the hosts for a lovely stay!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was really calm and quiet. The description was quite accurate and the communication was prompt. The space was comfortable for our family and we enjoyed the stay overall!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a lovely and comfortable stay at Rich and Sharon's place! The home was immaculately clean, and the instructions on how to enter were super clear, which made for an easy arrival. We were so happy to have found such a spacious, clean and comfortable place that also allowed us to bring our two dogs with us! The rooms and beds were so comfortable, and the view from the back of the house was amazing and relaxing! The place is on the water, and you also get beautiful views of the mountains. Rich and Sharon left some small touches like a nice note, a small bag with a notebook, popcorn, spare toothbrushes in case we forgot ours (which we did), and complimentary wine tasting passes at the local Brassfield Winery, which made us feel very welcome. There is not too much to do in clearlake oaks (we went mainly to relax and be surrounded by natural beauty) but Brassfield Winery is worth a visit for the views and the delicious wines grown, produced and bottled on site. We had a great weekend and would love to come back to stay if we are ever in town again!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Rick and Sharon's home is just as pictured. Very clean and comfortable! Communication was simple. Will definitely be back whenever we're going to be in the area!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were able to accommodate our last minute booking. They were very communicative, and we appreciated the informative house booklet on site for everything. The house was clean, fully stocked with all needed essentials and had some small extras about to make the stay more pleasant. Location was great - quiet, right on the water and close to some local grocery and restaurant options. Our family definitely recommends this rental!!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our group of gals couldn't be happier with the house. It is in a beautiful location and true to it's name, we saw a blue heron (no kidding!) swoop by the back deck and over the water the first morning we were there. The home's color pallet and homage to the blue heron provides a light and calming space to be in. We plan to go back again next year."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The photos and reviews do not do this space justice. The decorations are meticulously thought out, there are clear directions for how everything works, and the location is perfect. If you are looking for an amazing place to stay on the lake with your family, this is it!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quick response and good communication. Great place!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,These guys are great and there is a thoughtful gift bag when you arrive.
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,The house is very cute and clean. Rich is a friendly and responsive host. I would have loved to meet him in person but our group came for a community event and we were in and out of the house. I highly recommend this place and will probably return for a longer stay in the future!
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Place was very clean, great location, had a wonderful time! Would go again!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely great place to stay.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful!!!! Thank you!
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house is sparkling clean and charmingly decorated, with a kitchen any cook would love. The beds are very comfortable. We'd wake up and have our coffee on the back deck over the water and watch the birds flying from tree to tree. The neighborhood feels very safe and is very quiet. We appreciate all the special touches and definitely highly recommend this place, which we would be happy to return to."
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home and great location.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"That's an amazing place to stay. Everything was perfect, clean and organized. Very quiet and cozy. We had a really good time over there. For sure we'll come back. And the price is great."
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Heron house was a perfect place for our small party of 7. The house was clean and there were little helpful and funny little notes placed all over the house to help us enjoy our stay. Very easy and close access to Clear Lake via the canal. We used the paddle boats, floated down the canal with our own floaties and grilled yummy food. We perched on the spacious deck for most of our stay and it was lovely. With friendly neighbors and good vibes I'd stay at this adorable place again and again! Thank you Rich and Sharon for providing a sweet and easy place to hangout and have fun with dear friends."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Awesome location- Perfect for a fishing getaway.
Rich is cool and accommodating. Highly recommended..!"

How wonderful to find this gem of place, on the hill overlooking Clear Lake. Really the perfect Airbnb! Clean, Quiet, simply decorated , Very comfortable bed, Excellent kitchen. Coffee, tea. Easy to prepare our meals. The best water pressure for an outstanding shower!! Even a washer and dryer were available. Excellent Wifi, we had to get some work done during our stay. We loved the bird feeder on the deck. They were very active and fun top watch! We enjoyed a very nice dinner at The Country Kitchen and an excellent sandwich and smoothy at Buddy's Coffee! (both in Clear Lake Oaks) Thank you Janelle and congratulation welcoming your newborn during our stay at your ""Cozy Cottage"""
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"She was very responsive. There was a problem with the heat, which she dealt with right away (bad batteries in the remote, replaced). Accommodating (she let us come a couple hours early since no one was there before us), and allowed us to charge our car there. And the view/place was spectacular! I'd give it 5 stars for the hospitality of the host, and 5 start for the place and the view. Would definitely come again!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is lovely and the lake view is beautiful. We got to catch the sunset on our first night there, wanted to star gaze and wake up to a sunny lake morning but the winter weather got the better of us! The heater was really strong and the space was stocked up with so many amenities that we don't typically see at other spots like extra toiletries, condiments, etc. Janelle was extremely responsive and gave us great recommendations."

Appreciated the coffee and oh my goodness what amazing views every day. Would happily return!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We definitely plan to return. Janelle was an awesome host. She was communicative and responsive. Check in/out instructions were clear and informative. The place was clean, cozy and was exactly as described. Beds were very comfortable, and we had everything that we needed: fast wifi, tv, washer & dryer, coffee, etc."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My hubby & I love going to Clear Lake to just unwind from urban life. Janelle's place was a great location on the quiet side of the lake with a view! It's also its own freestanding building. There are birdfeeders on the front porch which made it fun to watch the swallows, hummingbirds & other birds in action. Driving around the lake, I didn't realize how many vineyards are planted! So coming from a winemaking family, I wanted to learn more & asked Janelle if there was a 1 stop shop to pick up a variety of local wines to bring home. Janelle right away conferred with her network & gave me the name of a grocery store that carried many local wines. We ended up driving there to pick up a dozen bottles!
If you are new to the area, I would also highly recommend the Visitor's Center in Lake Port on the west side of the lake - very informational & helpful! We are looking forward to staying at Janelle's again in the future."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a sweet place to rest and enjoy the lake! The space was exactly as described, and had tons of kitchen supplies to help us cook and feel right at home!"
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The kitchen needs a basic cleaning and the cabinets would have to be cleaned up. Likewise, new cleaning cloths and towels would have to be left here."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A nice little cabin with a lovely view of the lake.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time! The view is absolutely spectacular! Every morning, we enjoyed our coffee while watching birds feed off the balcony, as well as daily deer sightings. We were very sad when our visit ended. The neighborhood is a bit rundown but nothing that feels unsafe. We would 100% visit again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Love the balcony, with the view of the lake, beautiful sunset, surrounded by lovely birds all day."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing property, great view, cozy atmosphere, lots of birdwatching. You have to go a little farther for the more adventurous activities, but there’s still plenty to keep you occupied on a quiet stay, would definitely recommend!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was as described. The area that it is in, however, is not the best. A lot of very interesting characters roaming around. However, the view of the lake is absolutely gorgeous. The house itself is very small, and the bathroom is very small, but they do their best to maximize the space. Love the washer and dryer in the unit, and pretty much has everything you need to cook. If you plan on coming here, be prepared to cook. There are not a lot of places to eat around there."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved our stay here -- what a hidden gem! Janelle was a super thorough and prompt communicator (easy to follow check-in and check-out instructions), and her place exceeded our expectations across the board: great water pressure, lovely views, and a very comfortable bed. We loved waking up tucked away in the trees and spending a peaceful morning on the private deck. A perfect way to get some space from the busier Napa area while still being close by, and enjoy a truly beautiful part of the state (right on California's largest natural lake!)."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very responsive, got back to us so quickly. :) awesome host!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay– the space was clean and provided us with everything we needed to feel comfortable and right at home! It was very relaxing and private.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is in a great location overlooking the lake in a very quiet neighborhood. Easy to find, very specious and clean home with everything you’d need provided in the unit. Hosts are very friendly and easy to reach. House has really wonderful views from the kitchen, balcony and one of the bedrooms. Will definitely stay again! Great experience!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love the place! I highly appreciate Janelle replying instantly irrespective of the time.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Worth it!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this is my second time renting from Janelle! I absolutely love this little place it is perfect. I am more of a home body, and I love being able to stay in and have everything I need. grocery stores aren't far. The Chinese restaurant is actually pretty good! I love the little coffee shops! the people are nice.
Janelle is so amazing. She made sure we had everything we needed. She checked in with me! responded every time I needed her, I tried not to bother her too much! we had we needed. I can't wait to come down again! I'm already looking at the next time I can!!!! thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay ! Would recommend anytime
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Janelle is a super host who went extra miles and took care of all our problem. Our car was broken down in the middle of the road on our way to our Airbnb and Janelle offered his help by driving all the way from his residence and gave us a ride to his Airbnb. It was a long way round trip but he provided prompt help anyways. He also gave us a ride to the car rental place the other day so we could get back home on time. Our family was very impressed with how he helped in our unexpected situations and made our trip as enjoyable and smooth as much as possible.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow what to say. The ""lakefront"" view is definately as it is! Beautiful view of the lake from the deck and porch as well. The pictures dont do it justice. We could hear the bass fishing tournament speedboats roaring to get to the best fishing spots first and then quiet splashing of the lake during the evening. We BBQ'd burgers and chicken both nights on the deck and loved the atmosphere. Mosquito free summer breeze and a cold brewski, hot chicken what more could you ask. Really appreciated all the kitchen amenities. Plenty of towels and everything we needed. We enjoyed watching about 3 dozen birds devour a yard of bird seed Janelle leaves in the freeder and then as the stars come out you can see satellites and shooting stars. 10/10 would stay again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Janelle had a wonderful spot for our stop. The amenities were perfect and the beds were very comfortable!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a relaxing place to stay, we enjoyed our stay at Janelle’s place. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A million dollar view of the lake. A stress free, comfortable stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the place! It was updated, cozy and had everything we needed for a group of 4 women. The deck had an amazing view of the lake and the AC kept us cool.
The only downsides were two things. First, we got locked in the master bedroom because the door got stuck and wouldn’t open. We were eventually able to open it after about 8 minutes of wiggling and turning the door handle different directions, but it did give us a scare! We kept the room door cracked after that instead of closing it completely.
The second was the amount of bugs outside! We wanted to watch the meteor shower on the deck, but there were so many bugs gravitating towards the sliding glass door that we didn’t dare open it! Maybe some kind of bug lamp would have helped or maybe that is just how it’s bound to be, due to the vicinity of the lake."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Janelle cottage has gorgeous views, clean, comfortable, fast wi-fi, and has everything that is needed. Child and family friendly. Janelle is extremely responsive. Highly recommend for a city gateway."

Debbie"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This location had a beautiful vantage point of the lake (with a wonderfully large patio to view it!) and despite the very warm temperatures, the AC unit kept the entire place very cool. Everything was modern/updated and despite the fact we were traveling in a foreign place, Janelle left it in such a manner we felt right at home. Everything we could have possibly needed was right there. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a peaceful, calm atmosphere to spend some time relaxing."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing view, great kitchen supplies, and an AC that keeps that room cold!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were looking for a place to unplug with a good view. This location was great. Full kitchen allowed us to cook and we enjoyed the view while playing cards. Home came with streaming so we decided to watch a movie. Left feeling more connected and relaxed.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a perfect resting place! It was so beautiful and the photos don’t do the view justice!!!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very friendly host, everything was clear and easy going. The place felt great and many utilities and even herbs.

It had great views of the lake and it was very peaceful and quiet which was something we definitely needed. The outside deck and patio was a fun place to be. We saw so many birds eat on the bird feeder. The entire house was immaculate and clean. We will definitely this if we need to escape Sacramento.

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice lakeview and perfect balcony to watch birds. Janelle is friendly and easy to communicate with. We liked the relaxed atmosphere.
The describtion of this place says it has room for 6 people. As a family of 5 (2 adults and 3 kids aged 6,7 and 12) we felt the place was a bit to small. I don’t see how 6 adults would ever fit into this place. There is two nice queensize beds and a VERY small sofabed, 4 dinning chairs and a very small dinning table, only 4 plates, 3 knives etc.
Its would be much true and fair to call it a place with max capacity of 4 pers."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and quite place
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful, and serene. Janelle’s place was a great size, little thoughtful amenities such as individually wrapped toothbrushes and razors, space heaters, freshly ground coffee, condiments/ spices galore, throw blankets, etc…The balcony and lake views was the star of the show! Elevated views of the lake with plenty of birds visiting the bird feeders on the balcony was always fun to watch. Can’t wait to come back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay at beautiful views very comfortable bed and clean and had stocked up fruits and seasonings. The shower had real good hot water.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This truly was a great stay and would like to stay again quite and the birds in the morning are very beautiful to look at while looking out towards the lake
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janelle was communicative and kind. The place wasn’t quite what we were hoping for. The sheets had an odd smell. Luckily, there is a w/d in the home. There were a few Cheerios on the ground near the table when we arrived. Most likely from the last guest but it was discomforting to see things on the floor like that when first arriving to a place where you plan to stay for a mini vacay.
We were only staying for 3 nights and ended up leaving the 2nd night due to the interesting smell of the home. It seems like someone was aware that the house needed to be aired out because the kitchen and bathroom windows were cracked.
Positives: The view is lovely. The host is helpful. There was filtered water in the fridge. The decor is cute! There is W/D. The tv has Netflix and other things like that."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay. Janelle’s home was thoughtfully decorated and the view from the deck was breathtaking
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"THIS PLACE IS an AMAZING hidden gem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Super clean, easy to access, fully loaded with modern/chic decor. Great views from every room in the house. The beds were SUPER comfortable.
Great place for stargazing!!!! We even got visited by the neighborhood goat 🐐. We can’t wait for our next stay.
We stopped by Stonehouse Cellars for breakfast, where they had free EV-charging stations for our Tesla.
In summary, this place is great and you should give it a try.
Thanks Janelle for letting us stay at your beautiful place."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Janelle was so nice and communicative. The place is nice and she even has bubbles there how awesome !! The bed was super comfy too!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Janelle and her place is great. The house has great views, it will get a better once the balcony is in service. The town however doesn't have much to do, we were hoping to find bike roads for us and kids and more activities to do together but couldn't find much to do except if you tow a boat (and take it to the lake to fish)."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a nice romantic getaway. Host is friendly, responsive, and gave some great recommendations"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful, cute and extremely memorable stay. The beds were incredibly comfortable, the plants were gorgeous, the view was outstanding, the water pressure was strong. It's honestly one of most enjoyable AirBNBs I've ever stayed in."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This charming lakeside cottage has a beautiful picture postcard view of Clear Lake. You drive up a short winding road, to reach the house. Once there, you have plenty of parking, just a few steps above the house. There is a comfortable side deck & a front deck. The front deck was being rebuilt, during my stay, though the owners respectfully did not work on that deck, during my short stay. I really enjoyed the side deck, with a table & pato umbrella, for the shade. In October, the days were hot, but the nights were cool. I had a strong internet/WIFI signal. There is a table, near a window, in the living room, with a side lakeview, if you need to work virtually. The kitchen & living room have an open airy design. I found the couch comfortabe, as well as the beds. The one bathroom was small but comfortable, for 2 couples or a small family. There was plenty of hot water, when taking a shower. The views of Clear Lake, especially out the living room window & from the 2 decks are exquisite. I was very relaxed, at this lakeside cottage. Checkin was easy. There was a split A/C unit, where the ceiling & wall meet, in the living room. It cooled the cottage comfortably, during the hotter days. And, each bedroom & the living room had ceiling fans. The kitchen had plenty of supplies, to cook a meal. This lakeside cottage would be a comfortable place, for a long term stay, as well. The owners responded quickly, to any of my questions. I would definitely stay, at this charming lakeside cottage again."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place with the most beautiful view of the lake. We had a very restful stay and Janelle was very responsive.

Clearlake Oakes is a small town with gorgeous views of the mountains and lake. There aren’t a lot restaurants options so I would encourage folks to think about buying groceries and cooking, the home has every cooking utensil one could need plus a beautiful view of the lake."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"House overlooks the lake, and the view from one of the bedrooms, the living room, and the deck is gorgeous. House is comfortable and clean and has what you need.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Having a washer and dryer to do our laundry after a week and half of hiking in Yosemite and Lake Tahoe was a plus to us. It was a relaxing and queit place to unwind from our previous vacation activities before heading back to SF.

Janelle is very responsive and so helpful. If you go, make sure to book a wine tasting at Brassfield-its so nice! Until next time!♥️"
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Okay place to stay and a really good value. Had the basic things necessary for a comfortable stay.
One issue for us was both bedroom doors had split doors (a.k.a. Dutch Doors) and top halves of each wouldn't close all the way. This means sound carries between each room and the living room and kitchen."

Kitchen has everything one might need for cooking home meals. The TV has a lot of streaming options, wifi is great! A very decent shower too, kind of a luxury in Airbnb places that I’ve stayed. We could not find a place to swim there, water seems to be dirty everywhere near the shore, but totally not the host’s fault :) Janelle is a very responsive host, can’t thank her enough!"

This is a well appointed cabin close to a few shops and the Anderson Marsh Park. The hostess also responds very quickly!"

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janelle was a great host and communicated very quickly! The lake view is very nice and the beds are very comfortable.

This is a great place for a quite getaway and helped provide creating great experiences catching a lot of fish with friends on the lake."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect getaway for a weekend to relax and explore friendly Lake County. Many amenities to compliment the beautiful view of the lake. The window in the living area seems to be strategically placed to frame the lakeview like a painting. Great communication from the host and very helpful. We had a lovely experience, thanks for having us."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We just stayed 4 days at Jason’s and Fiona’s lake house. The sunrise’s were amazing. Just like a postcard. The house was decorated awesome. I had to remind my husband who was the Queen of Pac-Man. I reminded him over and over. His game was pinball but it was out of order so he couldn’t school me in it. We had a ton of fun. The beds were so comfortable. We enjoyed soaking in the tub. It truly was a perfect and private view of the lake. We felt very safe in the neighborhood and everyone was friendly. We can’t wait to go back.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, clean, so cute! The personalities of the hosts shine through and somehow make you feel even more welcome. We’d definitely stay again!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I had a great time. Jason’s place was just as he described. Great location right on the cove, clean, and very comfortable. Fishing was great, but get a guide makes it that much funner. We’ll be heading back for sure."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,good experience
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was awesome, we loved this place. Very fun atmosphere with a game room, books and great decorations. The house is right on the lake on a cove where there was tons of wildlife and great fishing. Jason was very accommodating was very responsive and gave us great recommendations for things to do and places to eat. We caught many fish right of the dock in the back. The backyard area with nice deck and fire pit was a great place to grill dinner and unwind at the end of the day. Clear lake is a beautiful spot with great fishing and sightseeing. We will be back for sure and recommend staying here!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jason was very responsive and kind. The game room was a lot of fun. There are a ton of wineries within a drivable distance. The lake wasn’t swimmable from the dock, but there were places to go close by. Great stay overall."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Booked the home for a fishing trip, was very pleased with everything in the home. The space was very nice and had enough room to fit our boat at the dock which was a big plus. We fished right off the docks at night also. House was clean and stocked pretty well with all the amenities. I would definitely recommend staying here for a getaway or fishing trip. The game room was also awesome! We really enjoyed our stay and Jason was a great host!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Fun home with silly art, dog pictures galore, and an overall Burning Man vibe. Cool game room with arcade games and emulators, bumper pool, darts, etc. Great back yard patio for hanging out, immediate access to the water but we didn't use it because the water in the south of the lake is more algae-filled in Summer so we went more north for day trips. Easy access to Clear Lake area amenities. Thank you Jason!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stay was great! Jason’s place exceeded our expectations! Thank you for sharing your slice of heaven with us!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic time, tons of stuff to do at the house and great location near lots of outdoor activities."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This is the sixth time we visit Clearlake and Jason's accommodation is wonderful. This is the boys trip for the first time and we have to say Jason's house is packed with boys stuffs. The dock is not recommended for little kids but we catched some big ass catfishes. We highly recommend this place. Definitely coming back. 😊🙏
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were able to relax completely in this gorgeous cove and comfy home! Bird watcher paradise, great kayaking, unique art and great arcade too. Will definitely be back!!! Thanks to Jason and Fiona for sharing your beautiful lake house! We appreciate all you do."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I’ve stayed here several times and it’s always a great get away. The house has evolved over the years and continues to get even better. Jason is an outstanding host and the house is both fun and yet still relaxing.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute unique house. Love the fact it’s right on water. Outdoor space has everything you need: chairs and table, hammock, bbq, fire pit!
Nice quite getaway!
P. S. We enjoyed Pac-Man!!!!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great lakefront property. We had a lot of fun swimming, fishing and playing in the in-house arcade! Great place to stay for a chill weekend on the lake. Dog friendly too."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is a great getaway for a family with teenagers. Our teens loved paddle boarding and the arcade games. We loved waking up to views of the lake and the sounds of birds!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I legitimately booked this rental solely on the arcade! Can’t overstate how much I enjoyed this place; you can tell the love and care that’s been put into making it a welcoming, recharging experience. Would definitely book again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is a beautiful place and Jason is a very kind and helpful host. We all loved the house and had a nice and comfortable time. This was a welcoming experience to have at our first Airbnb.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay here and we really enjoyed it. Great water access for fishing, and a lot of fun amenities in the home! Parking is a little tight here (which is clearly mentioned in the listing), but just something to be aware of if you are towing or have more than one vehicle. Outside of that what more could you ask for? A charming Clearlake retreat!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a really great time at this cozy and spacious home. The house had a as a great view of the lake and is located in a quite neighborhood. Jason was also a very great host, he even called us to make sure we have everything we need. Also he let us check out late. We enjoyed our stay and recommend his place to others."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a fun, quirky house to stay in while in Clearlake! Very clean and Jason was responsive and attentive. Would definitely stay again."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"House was great. Lake not so much. Smelled “worse than ever” per the locals. Went here to fish and get away some. Fishing was hard due to the lake algae and smell. Dock was not usable and water was far from swimmable. partially our fault for not knowing this place smells horrible in the heat and the lake is nearly toxic and unusable in summer.
House was nice. Good ac, nice stuff, good decor. The game room was nice and a must during smelly summers.
Property is fully fenced in. Our service dog enjoyed that. Deck and outdoor hang out space was nice and open. House was cool during the day. The solar helped us not feel bad for cranking the ac, as did the skylights.
Good: game room, comfy beds, big tub, good ac/cooling, good parking, water access (when it’s clean and not toxic mold in the lake.) very kind neighbors (one of em offered their dock for my boat and saved my trip.) good food in town, easy to get to everything.
Not as good: place was pretty dirty. Bugs about. Like spider webs on the doors and little bugs that weren’t ants on the floors all over the house that made it to our house upon unpacking. Dishes in the cabinet were all pretty dirty, leftover food in the fridge. Shower was not clean. Not the hosts fault but the tap water tasted like the air smelled. Bad. Bring a flat of bottled water and cook / drink that. Raccoons everywhere. Day and night. Again, you CANT escape the smell.
All in all, we enjoyed most of the stay. Just be advised: if it’s hot, this place is going to smell like the worst open sewage you’ve smelled. We held our stomachs back every time we opened a door. I threw up fishing several times while on my boat on the lake. I’m going to try to come back and have a redo of the fishing when the weather cools. See how that goes. If it’s nice, I will return yearly to fish.
Host was communicative and available but assured us there was no smell at the house and there definitely was.
Suggested with the caveat you go when it’s cool, and call ahead to places in town about the smell. Next time we try to go here, I’m calling Kour Thai (literally at redbud park/marina) and asking them for a smell report and catfish coffee as they all had great tips on non fishing lake related activities.
Also if you are fishing here, with a boat, you need to SCRUB your boat asap once it’s out of the water or it will stink forever. You need a lake county quagga inspection and stickers before you launch. This is avail at either of the tackle shops in town for ~$20. Clear lake tackle had way more stuff but limit out fishing had the good info. Dude set us up with amazing tips and made the trip. Game plan for us was drop shot and top water early early morning. Afternoon wind makes small boats impossible to pilot."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the kitchen is well equipped with pots & utensils, so come prepared with groceries. the host has provided so many thoughtful touches that will make your stay comfortable. protip - double check for cleanliness and critters. clearlake is kinda slow so think of activities before you come."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was our first time going to Clear Lake. We enjoyed our stay at Jason’s place. The house was very clean and cozy. It was in a quiet location. Loved sitting in the back patio in the morning enjoying the view and watching beautiful birds. We especially enjoyed the game room with vintage arcade games. Jason was very good at communication and responding to us whenever we had questions. Overall an excellent experience! Highly recommended.
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason's place was a fun place to stay for a weekend.
The games and dock were exactly what we needed for our
fishing trip on clear lake.
Check in was easy and the place was clean and comfy and interesting and fun.
even though it was really windy we always found something to do that didn't involve watching TV. good times!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a unique lake get away this is the spot! Lots of fun can be done indoors and outdoors and even if you want to do nothing but stare out to a lake and enjoy quiet peace this place has it all. For younger people there might be some firsts and for us more seasoned you will be brought back to youth! The space is cool, colorful and screams character and eclectic! The beds are super comfy the English style tub is relaxing and the patio is relaxing! The home was clean with lots of Art Deco and the host was easy to reach and very informative about all the local spots to hit! We will be going back!!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying here and the house works perfect for us! There’s parking our front for our truck/trailer, and it’s a great place to be able to bring our dogs. Jason is awesome, and very accommodating and has created a cute little home to get away and relax."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jason is a responsive and helpful host. The home has been curated as a spot of fun and relaxation. It is clean, organised, and offers all the comforts of home. Comfortable beds, a fully stocked kitchen (and conveniently located Safeway), luxurious soaking tub, mini arcade, board games, books, as well as gorgeous morning and evening views from the backyard are what you’ll find here. I was unfamiliar with the area but found it to be quiet and peaceful. Neighbours could be seen maintaining their properties/front yards in the mornings and afternoons and it was exceptionally quiet in the evenings, both on weeknights and weekends. The home features many stylised pieces indicative of the hosts’ personalities. The pups and I enjoyed our stay and wouldn’t hesitate to return! This is a great spot for any looking to explore the outdoors (or enjoy a relaxing weekend inside). Thank you for sharing your personal vacation home with the rest of us. We particularly enjoyed the sunflower garden. :)"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really fun place! Game room and fire pit were a hit! Water is low in the cove, and too cold for us to try paddle boarding. But, we had a great time watching the coots, geese and ducks swim/splash around. Beds are comfy, even the ikea sofa bed in the living room. Nice surprise to find Chromecast connected to game room tv, and there’s a very large smart tv in second bedroom.
We can’t wait to come back in warmer weather to get out on the lake (found out no boat rentals anywhere this time of year!)."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, well-appointed with fun stuff and comfy spots, accurate listing. Easy check-in/out, and easy communication with host. We would book again, and would recommend to others!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful stay love the comfortability
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,the house is perfect!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super fun house in a cool cove full of decks. Couple nice parks nearby, just what we were looking for—a calm place for a getaway. Host was responsive and knowledgeable."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,pretty cool spot. lots of conversation pieces around the whole house.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Highly recommend this rental home! We stayed for 3 days to celebrate Thanksgiving with our family 0f 10. Only 6 of us stayed at the lakehouse, two of which are teenage boys...they LOVED that there was a mini-arcade room with a few classic games...a pinball machine, Pacman gaming table, bumper pool, Guitar Hero, darts....just a room of entertainment, not to mentioned an endless collection of board games. The best feature of the house is the open layout of the home and the sunken tub!! Jason was a great host, always answering my random questions and made our check-in and check-out hassle free."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was everything we were looking for. Husband and I wanted a weekend of fishing, kayaking, and relaxing and we got all of it.
Pictures were pretty spot on, the water was really low but, being on kayaks allowed us to use the dock and get on and off the water easily.
Jason was awesome in responding in a timely manner! He gave us great recommendation to use a local bait shop to find spots near us. Well before our trip, Jason was beyond helpful.
His house was the perfect size for us, it came with everything we needed in the kitchen. Comfy beds we chose to sleep in the spare bedroom and got wake up to beautiful lake sunrise views.
Needless to say, we loved this spot and already planning when we can come back."
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a nice relaxing weekend away at Jasons.
There were a lot of thoughtful activities available at the home:
-Pinball machine, chess, Wii, board games, Pac man arcade, books, billiards, binoculars for animal watching, etc.
- The home was well decorated and gave a good glimpse into who the owners were.
-Jason was always reachable by message via the Airbnb app.
Great for a couple or a small family. For more guests, privacy may be an issue. As the guest bedroom is completely open to the living area, which may be difficult for occupants trying to rest while activities are going on.
The tub required a bit of finessing and never got truly hot. Taking a lukewarm bath is not the greatest experience. I think this was one of the only misses.
Thanks for a nice time."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at this home. Communication was great and the house was great for my wife and I to celebrate our 6 year wedding anniversary. Would definitely go here again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason’s home was perfect for a little weekend getaway. The lake was calm, but there really was no need to leave the home. We especially loved the decor and the bathtub was amazingggg!"
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was worse than picture.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was really cool and practical for our weekend away. Like explained in the notes, the rooms don't have a lot of privacy but I'd still recommend staying here. It was really fun, the area is really cool, and the house was full of games, including a pinball machine and a pacman arcade.."
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Jason was very helpful and transparent about what to expect. Lovely lake house with infinite entertainment inside, e.g. bumper pool table, pinball machine, arcade machine, wii etc. Location was not so attractive, many unmaintained buildings, homeless cats, raccoons. The lake smelled a bit, but it might be just a seasonal issue around October."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is very lovely especially the game room! Communication with the host is very easy and efficient! Highly recommend it :)
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Listing is as written! Comfy, spacious and lots of activities provided in the house itself. Would stay again if I head back to Clear Lake!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. Beautiful home with tons of activities. Its an absolute must stay if you are going to clearlake. The host is very accommodating and responds right away. Ill definitely be staying here again.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is just as advertised. You can Park truck and trailer out front no problem. The water was low when we were there but the dark is still usable. This is a very central location for fishing access to the town of clear Lake and a day trip to Calistoga for a winetasting. We have no hesitancy to recommend this place. Communication with the owners and Caretakers was very easy and helpful.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing home, very well valued. Jason, the host, was quick to response to any and all questions. I cant say enough good things about this place, would definitely stay there again."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at Jason’s place. The communication was super easy and quick and the looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very quiet! Would absolutely recommend to stay there!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for hosting me and my babies ( 4 legged babies!).  My furry friends had a blast. Perfect lakefront rental for all fur mommy/daddy out there as it is super safe for them to run around. The property interior and exterior is clean , with homey vibe to it.  Perfect for R and R with amenities that will make you feel at home. The hosts paid good attention to details providing a grill and outside chairs with a  full kitchen for guests who like to cook.  One thing I prefer though would be cable TV  :) Jason is a great host. I won't hesitate recommending this property to people  looking for a nice getaway.  Props for the game room!
Thank you!
Dr. Bella"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very nice place.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is super cute and the views are absolutely amazing. The little eccentric touches all over the house makes this charming little house an absolute delight. We will definitely stay here again when we return to Clearlake.
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this home for a fishing trip. The house had great parking out front, and we were able to keep our boat attached to the truck and charge the battery overnight. Unfortunately the dock wasn’t able to be used due to the low water levels, but we just pulled the boat each night since the public launch ramp is only 10 mins away.
We were able to bring our dogs and overall had a good time and would def book again :)"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is set up perfectly for an awesome time. The view was beautiful and the house is very open but still cozy. Something to keep everybody entertained.
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful and quiet time up in Clearlake. It’s nice being able to see the lake from almost anywhere in the house. The grill and kitchen were great for staying in and cooking! Also enjoyed the many movies and learning how to play bumper pool.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home with lots of fun games and a charming atmosphere! We really enjoyed our stay. Jason was very prompt in responding to any questions we had. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect weekend getaway! The house was filled with games and fun activities. We had some issues with checking in but we were able to get it resolved and Jason was great.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fast responses from Jason made the booking easy. Great quiet spot on the lake. Plenty of entertainment to keep you busy inside!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We just needed a quick weekend getaway from the city and was able to find this charming place for a staycation. We felt so comfortable here and loved our stay. Would definitely stay here again when we want to escape. Very cute and stylish place.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super fun, quirky getaway. Lots to do in the house (as advertised) and great hiking as close as 10min away."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jason and Fiona's place was stylish, clean, and thought out. I had really quick responses to any questions I had, and their place had everything I needed."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you want to stay somewhere with lots of options for activities at the location, this is a great place. My two boys really enjoyed the game room and movie nights. The cove is very protected, so a nice place to learn to paddleboard or kayak (we brought ours) if the lake conditions allow (algae). My 12 yr old is now a pinball fan!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife, myself and our 2 small dogs enjoyed our stay by the lake. Pictures are accurate, plenty of board games and other things to stay entertained. Lack of doors is not a problem for a couple and the fact you can't swim in the lake didn't matter to us - it's clear from the description that this is the case so no one should be surprised. Would stay here again."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home had great amenities and is very stylish. We really enjoyed the backyard and used the firepit every night. The beds were very comfortable and the big bathtub is what dreams are made of.
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jason’s place is as described in the listing - whimsical with a lot of character, well stocked with many games (we had a lot of fun playing bumper pool) which was very helpful since we were there during a heatwave so had to be indoors more than we would have liked, and with hospitable touches like coffee and paddle boards and a grill.
As a PSA, we ended up deciding to not swim or paddle board in the lake, since it was reported to have a very high level of mercury - we had read about the cyanobacteria/algae beforehand and were prepared to go to different parts of the lake that had lower levels of algae, but decided to be safe due to the mercury. So for the day we had planned to do lake activities, we ended up taking a day trip to Mendocino to hit the beach."
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"A fun little space for a getaway, with fast wifi, lots of books, and a cool outdoor shower. Jason was a responsive host, and gave us great tips on where to go swimming nearby in order to avoid the algae blooms."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here for 5 nights of relaxation by the lake. Jason's place is as advertised. My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed the game room as well as the fully stocked chest full of board games.
Would stay here again if/when coming back to the lake."
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Jason’s place was just as described. We enjoyed our time at the lake and hope to be back soon!
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Earthshaker!! Perfect for a small group. House was clean and had everything we needed for our stay. Had a blast playing the pinball machine and enjoyed the comfort of the home!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to reconnect with friends over card games, meals and drinking by the fire. Comfortable and fun spaces!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I wish I could give above 5 stars. Jason was an MVP, and extremely helpful and quick to communicate. He was able to assist in booking his place for the month, and making sure we had permission from the county. Will definitely be working with him again."
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This beautiful space was set right on the water. It’s a place to find serenity and peace. The inside of the home was artistic and modern. It has everything you need for a perfect getaway!!!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fun house, gorgeous setting, very fast wifi, and the kindest caretaker available to help at any time!"

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The lake house is an amazing place to spend a weekend. We really liked the house decor and it's location. Would definitely recommend this place.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It's a great get away; just as described.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jason's place was great! The house was comfortable and the lake was wonderful! I would be very happy staying here again if I'm back in the area.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home is very well furnished with quirky touches that make for a perfect adult getaway. The space is great for relaxing inside but also enjoying the outdoors. The backyard is spacious and equipped with a fire pit that made for a setting for star gazing and reflecting on the day on the lake. And that clawfoot tub... I never knew I loved them. Ha! Can’t wait to go back!!!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jason’s place is fantastic! Unique character and great location. We enjoyed every moment of our stay.
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home! Make sure to check out TripAdvisor to get an idea of what you can do around here before your trip. Especially loved how Pennie came and checked on us when we got in.
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is nice and open. No doors lol. Except the main bathroom. All over all great getaway.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay here was incredible!! We enjoyed everything about it! Jason was quick to respond with questions! Penny and her husband greeted us with a warm welcome and showed us around the house pointing out all the great amenities that the house had to offer!! The view was amazing and the tub was so nice to relax in!! We would definitely stay again! Thank you Jason for sharing your beautiful vacation home with everyone!
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing location, great view and beautifully decorated. Second time staying here and we love it!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Be ready for a zen experience at this gorgeous spot. U can truly relax and become one with the beautiful surroundings. I had an amazing stay and lots of fun. I don’t know why the owners would even leave a beautiful place like this, but I am grateful they do and that I got to stay here. I am looking forward to my next vacation to come stay again!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was pleasant. The house was clean and organized. The owner Jason is very committed to the comfort of your stay. Almost everything you need is in the house. If anything breaks, there is a handyman available ASAP via the phone number posted on the fridge. Overall, this house is a great place to stay with no worries. Tons of activities provided such as game boards, a bumper pool, a tv, a pinball machine, and a lot more. During our time here, we even had a deer come into the backyard and stay for a while. It is about a 10 minute drive to anywhere. To Walmart, to any food stores, the supermarket, to fishing, etc. Highly recommended for family trip."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We just stayed here for 3 nights and we enjoyed our stay. We brought things we thought we'd need, and ended up not needing them because the house had it all, we could have packed lighter! Lots of fun games, great view from the back deck, comfy beds & fun decor. We BBQ'd nightly and enjoyed the firepit & night sky. Spacious house and yard that is close to parks and town/grocery stores etc. Place was clean, the maintenance man and his wife who is the cleaning lady were friendly and accommodating. We would stay again!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice place to stay, perfect place to get away and enjoy everything the lake has to offer. House was amazing and the neighbors are friendly. Caretaker was very helpful. Would recommend this place to anyone. Thank you Jason! My friends and I had a fantastic stay!!!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this place last minute due to another Airbnb host cancellation. Jason was very responsive, and the check in was a breeze. We loved the outdoor space, and had a great time BBQing, fishing and relaxing. While the rooms don’t have dedicated doors we never felt we had a lack of privacy between the four of us. Highly recommend!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jason was super helpful and always communicated with me up through our stay. I have stayed at his house for 2 years now every May and love it more and more every time!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This was such a great place to stay!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is beautiful it is full of light and very vivid. The house is right at the lake so you can grill while enjoying the view. It is honestly such a relaxing stay and our family thoroughly enjoyed it.
2018-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason’s house is a tale of two stories. The first is the house and happy to say it’s fabulous. It’s pretty much on point in every regard plus has so many great extras such as toiletries, various little snacks and games galore! Seriously there’s everything and more including pinball, bumper pool, Nintendo. Etc etc. there’s also a stellar DVD and book collection! It’s somewhere you can happily stay indoors for weeks... and that brings me to the second part of the review, you just may want to stay inside! The house is not in the prettiest part of Clearlake... by a long way. We tried to find somewhere to swim in the lake, which is not easy but then discovered the lake suffers from a severe algae issue that can make you very sick and kill your pet. Whilst it doesn’t occur all year round, it was enough to put us off. If you prepared to do some driving, or want to stay inside in a fun house... you will have a great time!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is cool and quirky, a fun stay!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jason's lake house is wonderful! There are so many good things to say, I don't even know where to start! The location is perfect for a lakeside vacation, with direct access to the water and tons of wildlife all around (we saw otters, a heron, eagles, and deer just to name a few). It's blissfully quiet and peaceful without being isolated, with nearby restaurants and stores and tons of local wineries and other attractions. The house is roomy, comfortable, and artfully decorated; Jason has also provided tons of extras to include everything you can possibly need. He responded very quickly to all our questions and offered great suggestions of what to do during our stay - we took his advice and had a great time! This place is absolutely perfect for a relaxing, fun vacation."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second time staying at this location; it was great the first time and has only gotten better since.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for water use on a boat, your boat will be very protected from the wind. Close enough to town to get supplies or dinner if needed."
2018-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing place for a family or a group just hoping to get to know each other better. Wide open space, clean, lots of games and activities inside the property. Very thoughtful place with a cozy tone. And fishing at the dock was nice."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a relaxing family time on the lake. Lots of fun stuff to do at the house (games, bumper pool, movies). we also enjoyed the deck. The town adjacent to the house has had hard times, but this house is down the road a bit and on the lake and we felt safe and welcomed."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An absolutely fantastic place to stay on Clearlake.
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jason's place was absolutely wonderful. He was more than accommodating with my early check in and late check out. His place was cool sleek and stylish. I would stay here again without a doubt. Thank u for letting my dad and I stay at your lovely home!
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice experience. Great location. Jason was responding really quick. Such a perfect place to spent the weekend and do some fishing.
2018-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jason’s place was awesome! The house was equipped with everything you need. All ages of people are welcomed in the home. He has a whole game room, dvds for movie night, fire pit for hanging out by the lake on the nice breezy nice; I could go on and on! The kitchen was also stacked with condiments and every utensil you need which most houses usually do not carry. You literally do not have to pack anything except your clothes! Location was great 5 min drive to downtown. Everything was amazing plan to go back soon!"
2018-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Host was super helpful and quick to respond to questions. Lake is absolutely beautiful! Home is situated just a short drive from the public launch ramp which was very convenient.
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming house, peaceful location, relaxing atmosphere! We loved every minute of our stay. Played board games, bumper pool, paddle boarded with river otters close by, BBQ'd in the yard, and soaked in their amazing clawfoot tub! Will certainly be back for more fun and relaxation."
2018-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Jason is a great host. House is nice and clean. Very well decorated with much amenities. Outside view to lakefront was perfect for a little get away from the city. Highly recommended and will have a future stay with him.
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason’s home was such a perfect cozy place for a few days getaway with some friends. The house had everything you need, including board games and movies. The lake is so beautiful and resourceful, and Jason let us use the paddle board which was so much fun. Unfortunately we didn’t get the chance to meet him, but Penny, the house keeper who was very nice!
Highly recommending it, if you are looking for a nice place to relax and get away of civilization for a few days"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little house was a ton of fun. We really enjoyed spending the evening sipping wine we purchased at a local winery around the backyard fire. The house is fully decked out with billiard games, a pinball machine, and darts. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing get away."
2018-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason's house was amazing!
We had cold weather, so we light up the fireplace, had a barbecue during the day and truly enjoyed the common areas.
The house had everything you could wish for and was perfectly clean.
The only thing to take into account is that the rooms don't have doors, but a sort of shade. Although you cannot see anything, it does take away some privacy. We were two couples, so we did not love this. Aside from that the house is perfect!"
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Jason (& Fiona's) lakeside place for the weekend. It was good to relax in the sun by the lake. The house has everything you need for a few days' stay.
2017-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason's house is spacious, comfortable and right on the water - perfect if you want to kayak or swim."
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason and the housekeeper, Penny, were lovely and communicative. The house is nice and out up directly onto the lake. There are plenty of games in the house and a paddle board to keep you busy (which was great for us as we couldn't swim in the lake due to the water quality). The town is a short drive away and has anything you need."
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is awesome! We booked last minute with friends for the long Labor Day weekend holiday and the hosts were so great with communication - super quick to respond and thorough responses. Because I was unfamiliar with the area, I sent multiple questions about the location, set-up in game room for the TV, air conditioner, water quality, etc., etc., etc. (ie I was probably annoying) but they were nothing but kind and helpful. They even gave us a great tip about a boat rental place and to visit the county fair!
The house is well stocked, we were there and stayed in and cooked and played games all of the evenings. The little cove where it is located is calm and quiet for slow tranquil mornings (we watched river otters on a pier across the way!). The master bed was very comfortable and the guest room with the pull out bed was as well (as comfortable as a pull out couch can be). The only thing to not is that the house has a very open floor plan, which we loved, but that means there weren't any real doors between rooms (other than the guest bathroom). There were headed curtains for the master and a cool a old school pull down map to cover the archway for the guest room creating some privacy, but something to keep in mind when you consider who you will be staying with at the home. We loved it and thought it helped create a more cozy, family vibe.
Would totally stay again - thanks!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clearlake doesn't have much to do but this house can entertain you for house. We literally played guitar hero and went wine tasting almost everyday. Definitely a place to relax and get away for a while.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place by the lake for a relaxing quite getaway.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed enjoyed our stay at Jason's lake house. The housekeepers Penny and Dave showed us around and recommended some local wineries we should check out. The house had everything we needed and was very cozy. We loved having access to the water from the dock. The patio was lovely as well. Thank you!
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason's place was excellent. Great spot for a weekend away with a few friends. Right on the water, well equipped. Recommended!"
2017-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason and Fiona's house is perfect for a getaway! The house is quirky and fun and situated on a quiet little cove. There are lots of games to play and our son loved the bumper pool table, Wii and movie selection. But the reason he played those things instead of playing in the water was because dangerous blue-green algae filled the cove our first morning with a thick layer and never left. This type of algae is a common problem on Clear Lake and is unpredictable. If you have a boat, no problem because you can head out to areas where the algae is not an issue. But if you plan to swim off the dock, be aware that might not happen at all (and don't let your dog swim if it's present)!
Jason was a very responsive host and their property management crew was there to meet us and show us around when we arrived. This house was a great value.
One important tip: don't jump or swim between the two sides of the U-shaped dock! There is a submerged metal bar that connects the two halves towards opening where you would pull a boat in that is not at all visible from above. I nearly jumped directly on it which would have been a disaster. I hit it hard with my knee and then kicked it, too. Very dangerous, so be aware!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's a nice quit place to bring your family for the weekend or even the week. It is warm during the summer months since there isn't a AC in the cabin. The cabin and the area around it is really quit so it's perfect if you are trying to unwind and relax. The view to the lake is hidden from the lake since there is a big cabin in front blocking the view. But, overall we had a good experience and would defiantly recommend it."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place worked out perfectly for our lake front getaway; everything was communicated very accurately and still ended up exceeded our expectations. The owners have definitely been at work adding their charm to the property and we were very pleased with the positive lake living vibes associated with staying here. Highly recommended for anyone looking to get out of the city for some lake style living.
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice Lake front home. I was looking for a weekend getaway and this was pefect for me. I went alone and felt very safe with nice neighbors. Very accomadating host.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to get away from the busy life and relax.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just book it!! It’s worth it and even better if you get to share the home with family and friends. However, I was on a solo spiritual trip and stumbled upon this beauty and had no regrets. The view is breathtaking and the space allowed me to experience all 4 elements, earth (mountain), fire (volcano), water (Clear lake - largest body of fresh water in CA), and air (cleanest air with a cool breeze as you sunbathe). Come relax and soak in the beauty of Marlena’s wonderful space.
Also, you can go hike the view! About an hour away called Mt Konocti Hiking Trails.
My new R&R home in CA!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Marlena was so lovely! This place was incredible, the views were stunning, and it was everything we could have asked for. The reviews all speak for themselves, we’ll definitely want to come back for a longer stay.
Instructions were also good to live by, you will not want to leave once you get there! Definitely grocery shop ahead of time."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house provides amazing views of the lake especially during sunset. Perfect for a couple or group staycation
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Marlena was a fabulous host. The views were sensational!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlena is an excellent host who was proactive in providing us with plenty of information and recommendations days prior to our departure. I stayed with my girlfriend here for a peaceful getaway, and we got exactly what we asked for and more.
The home is beautifully decorated, and we found ourselves finding something new that caught our eye each and every day. Obviously, the main reason we booked the house was the view, and it did not disappoint. I recommend going out on the patio at night and stargazing, as the lack of light pollution makes for an incredible sky sight.
By the time our stay was over, we found ourselves finding every excuse to not leave until the last few minutes. Whether you’re looking to book a home to lock yourself in for a weekend, hit the local towns, or whatever else tickles your fancy, Marlena’s home will give you the experience you’re looking for."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Marlena’s place is wonderful - breathtaking views perfect for a do-nothing kind of vacation. We did a grocery stop before arriving and didn’t need to leave the house at all! Is was really quiet and peaceful, we truly enjoyed our stay there"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Marlena is awesome
Host.
Peaceful and awesome view property. Must visit."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"No words to describe how beautiful and peaceful this home is…it has nature’s blessing! The deck outside has soothing views that can transcend you to a different place. The home is cozy and comfortable. The host, Marlena is super helpful, friendly, responsive and a great soul! We will definitely re-visit."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Marlena's place and Marlena are top notch. We loved our experience for the second time. Can not wait to get back. This place can be summed up in one word....""magical."""
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Extremely peaceful. Marlena is very responsive and always ready to help. Got some well deserved rest and quiet at this cozy place.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Summerset has become a happy place for us and we have stayed here a few times. I would stay again (and again) here and enjoy the peaceful R&R.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We recently stayed at Marlena's place during the holiday season and had an exceptional experience. The picturesque view and the relaxed ambiance of the location are truly unparalleled. It's a place we would love to revisit in the future.
Marlena's responsiveness throughout our stay was noteworthy, adding to our overall positive experience.
The only minus: The gas grill, which was a central part of our holiday feast plans, wasn't functioning and appeared to have been neglected for some time. This was a bit disappointing. Addressing this would make the stay perfect.
Overall, we highly recommend Marlena's place for its serene vibe."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the best stay so far. The host is amazing. The best host from my experience.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing!
The views only seen in movies!
100% recommended if you like amazing sunset and sunrise views"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the best AirBnb stays ever!! place is exactly as described in the photos, beautifully done house with an absolutely incredible view. Marlena was extremely responsive & friendly and made us feel super welcome. she even left a box of goodies for guests to pick from. The home itself is really well stocked, and super tranquil. The outside deck is the reason we booked this place and we thoroughly enjoyed watching the sunrise, sipping on tea and enjoying outdoor games on the deck. such a fun place, we'll definitely be back in the summer!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place. Super peaceful.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Marlena's place was absolutely stunning! The property has incredible views of the lake, while the space felt private and secluded. It is a worthwhile trip up from San Francisco and offered the retreat my family and I were looking for.
Marlena's house had thoughtful touches and it felt like we were transported to a cozy cottage in nature. The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed for all of our meals there (roasting veggies, baking cookies, and even grilling). The bathrooms included fresh towels. Most importantly, her warm and kind communication throughout our stay made our experience seamless."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our 3rd time staying at this amazing place and never disappointed. We really enjoyed the view, so relaxing here! Marlena is such a great host, she made sure that we had our privacy and got everything we needed in the house. I recommend this place to everyone who seeks for some relaxations!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is an excellent spot to get away from it all for a peaceful, beautiful, and restful stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Summerset was exactly what we needed - a place to relax and rewind! The views really are amazing from the deck overlooking the lake. And when we were not outside (as it rained a couple of times when we visited), we chilled next to the wood fireplace, watching movies and cooking in the fully stocked kitchen. There were lots of board games to play, books and magazines to read - really old school and nostalgic! This is just what we needed. Marlena was such a wonderful host and was a pleasure to communicate with. We would love to stay here again - 5 STARS!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Marlena was incredibly gracious, welcoming, and kind! The house and views were just stunning and the ideal location for a relaxing weekend away."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely breathtaking views on the entire property. We had abundant sunshine and enjoyed the expansive deck areas to recharge. Many windows to take in the view, the birds, the peaceful nights. The house provided lots of privacy and the beds were very comfortable. We prepared our food in advance and the kitchen was well stocked. You will not want to leave. Marlena is a super hostess! Thank you for sharing Summerset with us. We hope to return in the spring."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Incredible views, beautiful bathtub, very quiet and remote with lots of games and music to keep you entertained"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a relaxing and cozy place with stunning view. My family and two dogs enjoyed the stay. Marlena has been very helpful providing instructions. There was no issue checking in the place. There is not much food options around here, so make sure to bring food and water during the stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is the perfect getaway weekend spot! Marlena was an incredible host - very responsive and kind. And the house was spotless! The view is unbeatable, we’ll definitely be returning."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home felt like a home — it was cozy on the inside and relaxing as soon as you step outside. It was the perfect place to truly unplug; the best parts were the mornings sitting out back with a nice cup of coffee and in the evenings with a beautiful view of the stars! Marlena truly made this place a home — it had all the amenities that one would expect for a getaway.
Tip - We forgot to get enough groceries to last our trip; would highly suggest grocery shopping prior, as you truly would not want to leave the property."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Couldn't get enough of the privacy and views. The house is a bit shabby chic. I would love to hear the stories of some of the decor finds. It had lots of games, books and music. Didn't need to go anywhere...
Would come back to check out kayaking trails. 😊"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The best. I don't want to advertise how awesome this place is so we can hopefully come back and there is availability. Everything about it is perfect and more than advertised. I could go into specifics but just trust and go for it.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Marlena is a wonderful host and her place is perfect for a getaway. It's remote and private and has everything you need to relax and enjoy the beautiful views (including an extra toothbrush which came in handy night 1). The beds are comfy and everything is set up perfectly to host. Our 2 year old loved running around the property and playing with the outdoor Jenga blocks. Sunset is amazing as was the stargazing. Highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such beautiful views of the lake from every spot in house, especially the deck! I loved lounging on deck during day and stargazing at night. It was so peaceful there, and Marlena was a very gracious host.The perfect little getaway that I needed!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Going back to stay again at Summerset is us voting with our feet (positively). The place is just as described, the views and the comfort of viewing from the deck, whether soaking in the sun or views of the lake and Mt. Konocti during the day or pristine views of the night sky in ""Dark-Skies"" friendly Lake County, are simply mesmerizing and accounted for most of our stay. Do take note of Marlena's recommendation to complete grocery shopping before arrival at the property because it is hard to leave the property once you're settled in at Summerset."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I had an unforgettable stay at Marlena’s stunning lake-facing Airbnb! The breathtaking views were matched only by your warm hospitality. Thank you for providing a perfect retreat that was so peaceful, it truly helped me unwind. I can't wait to return!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Marlena was a great host, views were amazing. Very peaceful, perfect place to get away and relax! Highly recommended!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlena's place is lovely, and she's a fantastic host! The views were fabulous. It's a really nice place to relax and do nothing and is very quiet and isolated. Even though she was on the property, she completely respect our privacy, and we felt very comfortable. I loved taking a bath with views out onto the water! My original plan was to spend all our time on the deck, but it was extremely hot and very windy while we were there. We spent a lot of our time inside instead, so plan for that as an option. The one bummer was that the curtains were very light, so I was up at sunrise both days instead of getting the chance to sleep without the kids. So bring an eye mask if you're a light sleeper! Marlena is a super easy and communicative host, and it was incredible to have such an easy check in and check out. In the last few years, the ""checkout"" list for some airbnbs has felt increasingly difficult. Hers was an absolute piece of cake! Would definitely recommend this spot. :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing location with beautiful view of the lake!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Summerset very much. The place was curated thoughtfully, it is very cozy and welcoming. The lake view was breathtaking, and the night sky was amazing, we ended up seeing the Milky Way right from the deck. Communication with Marlena was easy and effective, she is very friendly and welcoming. We will definitely come back in the future."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very serene, beautiful setting and the lake view is spectacular. You can completely unwind and relax here. Marlena was a spectacular host. We’ll definitely be coming back."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Happy and Peaceful. Nice spot.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing get away, as advertised!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful stay in Marlena's little oasis. It is clear that she takes immense pride in this space and her intentionality in designing the home is apparent in every component of the destination. From meticulously groomed plants on every corner of the property, to little notes welcoming us, Marlena clearly has a gift for hospitality and we are grateful for her willingness to share it with us."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to get away from the hustle of city life, take in some incredible scenery, unplug, and unwind, Marlena's property is just the place for you. Due to our conflicting work schedules, my fiancé and I were looking for some much needed quality time together, and we certainly found it here. We spent each day relaxing on the spacious deck, enjoying the views of Clearlake and basking in the sun."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous view, great host, can't wait to come back."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The pictures are accurate but its hard to capture the full beauty of the place. Honestly, we thought we would head to wineries and be out and about, instead, we instacarted food and stayed home. The place is absolutely beautiful. Marlene was very accommodating and responsive. The home is in a quiet area of Clear Lake so do take up Marlenes suggestion of bringing in groceries. We brought our 17 month old baby and small dog with us and had a great time."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful place in Clear Lake. Beautiful views, quiet, and relaxing. Would recommend and hope to come again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great time here! It was so peaceful to be surrounded by nature on all sides. This home has a cozy vibe to it and everything I needed to use for cooking was available in the kitchen. Marlena was extremely helpful with directions and tips on places to go for fun in the area. I’ll definitely come back again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cozy place, beautiful property, scenic views and amazing decors. Few things felt outdated like Beds were not very firm and Bathroom doors were not getting locked, but we didn’t had any major issues/concerns with it. Thanks for being a wonderful host to our family."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely stay. The place was sweet and inviting, and the views were breathtaking. All in all it was a lovely weekend."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay at Marlena’s house! Beautiful views and very relaxing
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, quiet getaway with the most beautiful view!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect quick getaway from our hectic lives. The views and privacy attracted us to this home and it did not disappoint. It was relaxing and quiet. Marlena has music, DVDs, books, magazines, and all sorts of little extras to make the stay extra special. We never left the property! It was wonderful."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful location with outstanding views, starry night skies, and hundreds of chirping birds all day. The house is very comfortably laid out and it was nice to have a big living room to hang out in all day. We brought our infant and had lots of space to arrange her playmat, pack 'n' play, bouncer, etc.
There was a huge rainstorm during our stay that knocked out the power for about 9 hours, which meant that the electric stove, microwave, refrigerator, and heating didn't work. Marlena took really good care of us and brought us dinner! The house is well insulated, so even though it was cold outside, we were comfortable without having the heat on.
Thank you for the wonderful stay, we will be back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the lovely stay! We enjoyed the place a lot. Hearing the birds outside the deck felt so peaceful and watching the stars at night was amazing. Great trip overall. Thanks Marlena!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful and homey house, decorated inside and out with details that make it both tasteful and down to earth. There were many small amenities around (bottle of wine, lots of materials for a great bath, firewood, etc), and honestly one of the best and most peaceful views I've had at an airbnb. Marlena was proactive about communicating and very responsive. Would strongly recommend a visit here if you're looking for a peaceful getaway."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay! The views from the deck are breathtaking and the sunsets are spectacular. We had the most relaxing weekend, and our dog loved exploring the beautiful property. Thank you so much, Marlena!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay. Very relaxing location and beautiful home and property. The view from the deck was amazing. Marlena was a very responsive host and accommodating. There was even extra amenities which was a nice touch.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jack, Panna (our dog), and I (Suzie) had an amazingly relaxing time at Summerset! The view is even better than the photos could capture. We spent so much time out on the deck and relished every single moment. The privacy and lack of noise was fabulous (I questioned my hearing at one point because there was NO noice. NONE Thankfully a bird chirped and I was relieved to know I could still hear). The amenities of the house were much appreciated as trips to the grocery store aren't as easy as a straight shot down the hill. But if you're ready to disconnect with technology and connect with nature and all it's beauty, this place is THE place. Hope to come back again in the near future :-)"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pure relaxation. If you are looking to unplug, relax, and unwind, look no further. The lake views are unbeatable, the silence is serene, and I loved the circa 1982 vibe! Great collection of DVDs too. Highly recommend and will definitely visit again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place to disconnect and soak in breathtaking lakefront fires in absolute peace and quiet. Not having immediate access to wifi felt initially daunting but quickly dissipated with all the ways to reconnect with byte and yourself t Summerset. Wonderful selection of DVDs, CD collection, and board games. Be prepared to hunker down, especially come nightfall, because getting to/from the home is a 20-min drive each way into town with a stretch along narrow bends and minimal light, so plan your outings and food wisely. Overall, we had a wonderful stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a view! The home was so comfortable and full of character. It was the perfect place to relax while enjoying stunning panoramic views of Clear Lake!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family had an amazing 3 night stay. We didn’t leave the entire time. Breathtaking views and experience from dusk till dawn and then the stars! Truely a special place to unwind. Thanks Marlena!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Marlena was very friendly.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The only way I can describe Marlena’s is a retreat center but much linger before we arrived Marlena really made us feel like we were at home through her communications To say having a view with a full field of vision is an understatement and everything in the home was so thoughtfully and intentionally designed so that you would feel transported to another time. We were looking for a place where we can really disconnect and Marlena provided just that. I hope we are welcome back because I would love to stay here again and again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I couldn't describe the feeling until my wife verbalized it. Staying at Marlena's place gives you that feeling of summer vacations from childhood. If you chose to stay here, you will enter the realm of not having a care in the world (as long as you let your cell phone have it's own vacation too).
I have already recommended Marlena's place to our friends and family.
Do yourself a favor and click on the 'Reserve your stay' button right now!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What an amazing location & fabulous views! Marlena’s home is very comfortable & relaxing, with lots of thoughtful touches to make your stay a very pleasurable one.
We particularly loved the various outdoor spaces, where you can relax & take in the views & the sun, before retreating to the cool of the home for a snack, drink & siesta :)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We travelled from San Diego to celebrate my 40th birthday. There were 4 of us. The location was wonderful...the view is spectacular. The deck is the best part of this property. This isn't a high tech property so don't expect to show up and connect to wifi or find fancy electronics. BUT, Marlena has everything you can think of to make your stay cozy and comfy; a FULL kitchen, washer dryer, endless games, DVDs, a stereo, BBQ (both electric & charcoal)... You should be prepared to hang out. There isn't very many close options for food or entertainment. That isn't what this place is. We ventured out for one meal during our 5 day stay. Everything is at least 20-30 mins away down an incredibly windy road.
Our only issues were minor...
- I had a hard time getting the grill lit (the starter didn't work but I eventually was able to get it using matches)
- The couch is not the best for sleeping. We had a one couple and 2 singles, so one person slept on the couch.
Overall, it's a great place to recharge and connect with loved ones. The property is remote and just lovely."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazing weekend at Summerset. The house was so cute and comfortable, and had all the supplies we could've asked for. It's very secluded, so be sure to stock up with all the food you'll need before you get there. Then walk in the door, turn off your phone, and forget about the rest of the world for a couple days.
The main attraction here is the view, and it does not disappoint. Gorgeous during the day, and absolutely breathtaking at night. Lots of great seating for enjoying the view, and a fun collection of board games, DVDs, and CDs for when you feel like you should do something else for a bit. Bed was comfy, appliances worked well, shower was great, coffee bean grinder was provided, checkin/out was a no-brainer... None of the little missteps that Airbnbs often make.
Although we didn't see her once, Marlena was incredibly helpful and responsive. Highest possible marks all around. Really, a magical experience."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great experience just to relax and just to disconnect from technology and life
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views from this house
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,beat host ❤️ what an amazing property and best part is how well it was setup. views are just mesmerizing.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The view is just beautiful and it don’t stop when the sun goes down. The stars come out at night and it’s magical! Take it in and make memories.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Marlena's place was amazing. We had the chance to disconnect from the crazy world we live in and find tranquility, peace and relaxation. This is the perfect place for someone trying to enjoy sunsets while drinking a glass of wine. Waking up in a quiet environment was unbelievable. Hearing the sounds of birds as you wake up was priceless. At night, we got to see a beautiful sky full of stars. Perfect romantic weekend getaway to take your loved ones.
Marlena did an excellent job communicating with us and asking if we needed anything. As she says in the description, once you get there you won't want to leave the house.
I would definitely recommend this place to anybody who wishes to relax and enjoy wonderful views of the lake."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay was very comfortable and enjoyable. The view from the deck was amazing! Marlena is very kind person.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Marlena is an amazing host and her listing is exactly as described - truly a refuge where you can unwind and connect with nature. Our stay was incredibly comfortable and we will definitely be going back.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Marlena was a very considerate host and made sure our stay was very comfortable and enjoyable. The view from the deck was amazing! We spent majority of our time there.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlena’s place is a beautiful oasis in the middle of some of the most breathtaking scenery. My husband and I are bird lovers and we saw so many fantastic creatures. We also love to cook and found that the kitchen had everything we needed.
There’s no wifi but we barely noticed: there’s plenty of cell service for any necessary outside connection, and Marlena has a pretty fantastic DVD collection that we took advantage of.
We brought our kayak and found plenty of boat launches within 15 minutes to enjoy beautiful Clearlake.
We will definitely be back!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s always so difficult to leave Marlena’s home. There is something truly so special about this place. It was our second time back and we felt so calm and so rested just from being there two days.
The view is spectacular. Standing there over the lake is almost a spiritual experience you can’t help but unplug and be present. Marlena is thoughtful, detail oriented, and superb at communicating.
Everything is spotless, the place holds so much charm and Marlena has cute notes everywhere that does the thinking for you.
I can’t recommend this place enough, we are so grateful we found it. If you need to disconnect and recharge this is without a doubt the place you want to come to.
Come see it for yourself."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Incredible place to relax.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice host, cozy house, great patio for star gazing and excellent lake view, you cannot ask for more."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an amazing pick around Clearlake area. While the location is a little remote, which will takes 10 more minutes driving on a winding road, so better to grab everything you need with you and just stay the whole time inside. There is no WiFi, so we had chances to watch many dvds, though most are old movies but very classic. The most exciting part during the stay was that Marlena allowed us to flight the drone, and with the aerial view we can find what a great location it is. Highly recommend everyone come and enjoy the tranquil experience."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The view was amazing from nearly all parts of Marlena's place. I wish it had been sunnier for us to enjoy the wonderful deck!
We didn't plan so well coming in as the drive to Marlena's place was long for us (first trip with an infant). We only picked up a few groceries so when Marlena asked if we wanted anything in town on our second day, we asked her to pick up a Safeway order for us and she gladly did! She's a great communicator and was very helpful during our stay. We enjoyed all of the little touches like the logs left out for us for the fireplace, the self-care packets left for us, the bottle of wine, the high quality shampoo/conditioner. We would stay here again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A fantastic stay to get away. Marlena was very helpful and accessible! We loved getting away for a weekend and enjoyed the area with a wine tasting nearby. The scenic lake view was amazing to wake up to and rest in.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Summerset is hands down one of my top three favorite AirBnb stays. Five stars across the board for this wonderful and very special home. The view on the deck is absolutely stunning (even better than the pictures). It is indescribable and will literally TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY once you step onto that deck. The interior of the home is also VERY, VERY CHARMING! Again...much better than what the camera can capture. If you want to reset and recharge this home is the PERFECT place to achieve this goal. I also completely agree with many of the reviewers when they say that once you are at the home, you will NOT want to leave because the view is addicting. The only thing that I think surpasses this home is the host, Marlena. She is probably the MOST GRACIOUS and most accommodating host I have interacted with. She will go out of her way to ensure that you have a restful and stress-free stay. She gave us passes to an amazing local winery and bought us delicious desserts! And...communicating with her was a breeze! Her response time is impeccable! The essence of Summerset (both inside and out) is a true reflection of Marlena's human spirit. We will definitely be returning..."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Summerset is not your normal everyday vacation rental. It is a unique house with art and a color-coordinated scheme that offers the feeling of being comfortable and at home. There are lots of interesting things to look at, including dried thrush grass enclosed in glass next to the front door. There are views out of every window. It is an older house but doesn't feel like it.
The master bedroom has a soaking tub surrounded by unique tile which simply isn't seen in this era of generic tile from Lowes or Home Depot. There are nice touches in the bathroom like quality lotion, bath salts and shampoo. And although the second bedroom had its own bathroom, the master bath is also accessible from the living room so that people staying in the other bathroom can access the tub without going through the master bedroom. That's handy if you have more than one or two people who prefer a soaking tub than a shower.
The deck is an outdoor room by itself with many views - there are chairs and other outdoor furniture facing east, south, west and north so you can sit wherever the sun is. It is totally quiet, except for many species of birds that make the area their home. If you're a birder this is an ideal house because it's where the land meets the water so there's two different habitats next door to each other.
Marlena, herself, is a wonderful and caring host who doesn't intrude, and mainly communicates through the airbnb app. On the last full day of my visit, she brought some duraflame logs for the fireplace, but I spent most of my time out on the deck until it got dark, then it was a bath and bed for me.

The only thing to caution is that the road in is narrow and winding. I was tired and drove really slow, but luckily, there were no locals behind me for me to annoy with my slow speed.

I flew in to Sacramento, stopped at the Walmart in Woodland (just off of I-5) and bought a small cooler, then drove through Woodland and bought groceries at Raleys. That was a good solution rather than going into Clearlake for groceries after the long drive."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the best Airbnb out there, please do yourself a favor and book this! Marlena is an incredible host, the home is truly an oasis. Everything was perfect, the view was even more breathtaking in person! This was also the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever seen- truly spotless! We will absolutely be back and are thankful we were lucky enough to experience Summerset."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is my favorite Airbnb! It’s even better than the pictures. This is my 2nd time coming back here and I’m sure I will be back again and again. We love this place so much and highly recommend it to people who are looking for place to relax and enjoy nature. Marlena is an AMAZING host. Super responsive and go above and beyond to make sure all guests feel welcome and get anything they need in the house. We love her as much as we love her house, such a sweet lady."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Marlena’s place is likely the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at so far. The view of the clear lake is absolutely breathtaking. We had a great time enjoying the privacy and the no Wi-Fi life. Marlena is super thoughtful and very responsive. I would highly recommend her place to anyone who’s looking for a beautiful and quiet place to recharge.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We are lucky to stay there for 2 nights and being able to see the 2 different ways the beauty of the lake. You could only hear the sound of wind and bird. We stayed and fall asleep on the sofa set on the deck in the afternoon. The sky is clear with so many visible stars. Every corner of the place are carefully designed with details. High quality bedding and towels make the stay even luxury. Would love to come back in the future.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time back at Marlenas beautiful home and we loved it more than ever! Just as stunning and peaceful as the first time, our family really enjoyed our weekend stay here. We drank wine, played board games, had coffee out on the terrace, and Marlena was just a darling putting up with all my questions this time around :)"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This may just be my favorite Airbnb stay to date - it exceeds all expectations and is not even more wonderful than pictured. The location, the home itself and the ease of communication/logistics was unlike anywhere else. It’s one of those “medicine for the soul” type experiences and our group is already making plans to return. Thank you Marlena for sharing this little slice of heaven with us!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best Airbnb I've ever stayed at. Period.
The house has everything you need and more.
The view is unbelievable, we could not stop looking at it!
Marlena is the perfect hostess.
There are so many thoughtful touches, you feel like you're being pampered. We celebrated my wife's 30th birthday here and it was a brilliant spot for it.
If you get the opportunity to stay here, book it asap. You won't regret it!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best Airbnb location we ever stayed in. It has the best lake views imaginable with a mountain backdrop. It was peaceful and quiet. Marlena is a very caring host and she made our stay very enjoyable. There are plenty of music cd’s, dvd’s and games to keep everyone entertained. The kitchen is fully equipped and we cooked every day. It’s a great place to disconnect, relax and enjoy life!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlena is a great host! The house was just as advertised and more! It rained most of the time we were there but we had more than enough to keep us occupied and relaxed. There were four of us and a large dog and we all fit comfortably.
Marlena thought if everything so we never once considered leaving to pick up something we forgot. It also helped that we overpacked groceries and wine :)
Anyhow, we’d stay again and again! Don’t pass this up!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place that was quiet and scenic to spend some time away from the Bay Area. Marlena’s place was perfect since it had a wonderful view and was not too close to any neighbors. Summerset is one of the cleanest Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in, and was well-stocked for us to cook all our meals during our stay. Additionally, we appreciated having Marlena on the property while we stayed since we did have some questions that came up. Definitely would come back here again in heartbeat!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The view and the house were amazing and it was so nice to have Marlena so close by on the property in case of any problems - the only issues we ended up having during this amazing weekend was where to have our morning coffee in the garden because there were so many cute spots to gaze at the view from ! highly recommended, will be staying here again!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A beautiful and cosy home away from home lake house. A great deck space to read and enjoy the view. We stayed at Summerset with two infants and a dog and was very enjoyable and relaxing. The attention to detail was impeccable and very clean. We were impressed by how well stocked and equiped the kitchen was!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful, peaceful getaway at Summerset. The first thing that we noticed when getting out of the car after a long drive was how stunningly quiet the area is and how awesome the view from the deck was. The entire place, inside and outside, was kept very clean. We were a little worried about not having Wifi (*laughs nervously*), but there was plenty to do between watching the varied DVD collection, board games, yoga, cooking, and just relaxing. We also cheated a bit and streamed a couple of shows through our mobile phones.
Marlena is an awesome host who texted us once in a while to check in but otherwise left us to enjoy our quiet stay. She also left us a few extras like chocolates, wine, and fuzzy socks, which we really appreciated.
As Marlena and others have mentioned, we definitely recommend bringing your own food and groceries because you will not want to leave the place once you are there. We were able to cook and store all of our meals in the full-sized kitchen.
We would definitely recommend this stay if you are looking for a quiet and relaxing getaway!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much Marlena! We truly enjoyed our time at Summerset! We can’t wait until we return sometime in the near future. This place is literally above and beyond from our expectations! It’s like a little place in heaven!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful place to do absolutely nothing and wind down and gaze the stars!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was perfect for our family outing. You can tell a lot of thoughts has been put into decorating the house both inside and out and we loved it. The deck provides a great platform for relaxing and enjoying the unobstructed lake view. A very pleasant surprise was how many birds there were. We spent hours watching all kinds of birds including two bald eagles catching and eating fish.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlena's place is one of the top Airbnb places we have stayed in terms of views, accommodation, amenities and stock of all things one could need for a restful and wonderful experience. We spent an entire day just relaxing on the deck, soaking-in the wonderful views. There are numerous seating areas around the house, so you can have morning coffee facing east and afternoon wine watching the sun set. The kitchen is stocked with every cooking utensil one can imagine, including a whole array of spices and condiments.
Just bring groceries, beverages and settle-in!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as advertised! A view to die for, privacy very rare to find and everything you could want for a wonderful and relaxing stay. This is a must stay kind of place. We will absolutely be back again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlena's place is heavenly, the best way to unplug and have a cozy weekend. The views from the living room and the deck area are just amazing. We loved our stay."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful escape! My sisters and I brought my mom her for 60th birthday. It is high up in the mountain, not right on the water. Almost 360° of water and Mountain Views. We enjoyed choosing a movie from her expansive selection each night, did yoga on the deck every morning, visited Brassfield winery (HIGHLY recommend!), played cards and explored the towns around the lake. I brought my 8mo old crawling baby and the house was fairly baby proof, but there is a small gap at the bottom of the deck railings so we just had to watch him closely to keep him away from any edges."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay (the view of the lake is amazing). Marlena was helpful and was great at communication, from booking through checkout."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place is Marlena’s lake house. If you are looking for a place to spend some time away from everyday chaos, then this is your spot. We spent three relaxing nights here and were sad to leave. The house is exactly how it’s been advertised - very charming, low tech no tech, but you will have everything you need and more. The views from the back porch are breathtaking and you probably will spend hours just sitting there and taking mental pictures. Definitely one of the places on my list to visit again.
Thank you Marlena for making us feel welcomed."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view alone is worth the trip. We stopped for a few days after a packed Napa Valley trip, for much needed R&R. Enjoyed being the feel of being off grid, yet still 15-20 min from groceries, coffee shops and Chinese take out. Nothing but the sounds of the birds. Plan for sleeping, reading and taking in all the sights. Nostalgic selection of DVDs to finish off the night. Hope to be back to enjoy the view again. Already miss it."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"this place was great! we only stayed one night, we wish we could've stayed at least 3. the house is clean and the views are incredible. it's so quiet and peaceful. I would definitely come back!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlena was an absolutely lovely and communicative host that went above and beyond to ensure we were prepared and taken care of during our stay. Nothing will prepare you for the epic view the sweeping back deck has to offer - photos just do not do justice to the beauty that’s before your eyes. Marlena answered all our questions promptly and we felt nostalgic of the house before we even had to check out. Cannot recommend this Airbnb enough; thank you, Marlena!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could find all the superlatives worthy of describing this special place. It is one-of-a-kind, and a privilege to experience. I loved the quarter moon setting behind Mt Konocti and the glow it created on the lake. The starry night was spectacular. How long has it been since seeing plentiful stars and a planet or two in the Bay Area sky?
We came fully stocked, and never left after arriving. The house has everything you could need and reveals many special features. Loved the little inspirational sayings.
Come, enjoy, relax and marvel at the incredible landscape and habitat that is around you. Thank you for this wondrous opportunity!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I will begin by saying, an absolute true gem, a must experience! I traveled here with my husband, mom and our 2 fur babies. The view was amazing, day and night! Complete and true silence, only pure nature. Such an accommodating place. Marlena truly has a touch for thinking and providing everything you could possibly need and beyond. We did grocery shopping prior to arriving, as suggested, but Marlena would still check in on us any time she was in town to make sure we weren’t missing anything; completely amazing!
We truly did not want to leave, we absolutely enjoyed it to the last minute. We could not be happier or more relaxed after our stay here and cannot wait until we can get away and come back."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location for a digital detox. Great view. Supremely quiet. Excellent to just de-stress. Loved it.
Just be sure to get your groceries and food as the road to get here is windy."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marlena was an amazing host and great with communication. The house was very clean and exactly as advertised. The view was great during the day and star gazing was amazing at night. It was a perfect place to unplug and decompress.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Came with husband and dog for a little r&r. The house has amazing views and everything you need! We brought groceries and had all the necessary items to cook meals. There are plenty of towels, blankets, dvds, games, and fun things like telescope and music. Loved the extra touches like sunblock, makeup remover wipes, doggie bags and bowls. We can’t wait to come back! Thank you Marlena!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Marlena is very sweet and thoughtful host. And her house of gorgeous and peaceful. We had so much fun.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful spot! We loved staying at Marlenas, an amazing view over the lake and surrounding mountains, just like in the photos but more beautiful in person. Very quiet and very relaxing stay, would definitely recommend Marlena as a host and her property."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time! The view was spectacular and was the perfect little oasis to get away from everything.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is by far the greatest Airbnb stay we’ve ever been to. A wonderful place to just relax and kick all your anxiety away! Definitely a place for family vacation. I think our 5 months baby girl loves this place as well cause she’s in a very good mood during these days😊 The lake view is absolutely amazing. About 20min + to Safeway so it’s very convenient to get some groceries and prepare some delight food yourself. Definitely gonna stay here if we visit Clearlake in the future!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely lovely location. It’s perfect for enjoying a stunning view, disconnecting from the chaos of daily life, and encouraging a sense of intimacy for small groups. I booked this location for a friend’s bachelorette weekend, and it was gorgeous. I didn’t know 2 of the girls who came, but the location was so cozy and pretty that it really encouraged conversation and relaxation. There’s a stargazing, too! There’s a telescope, for those interested in the stars. One thing to note—this is not a swimming lake. Boating, yes, swimming, no. I would highly recommend this location. I went in the summer, but I’m interested to see what a winter trip would be like (there’s a beautiful fireplace we didn’t get a chance to use). The beds are so fluffy! I really can’t recommend this place enough."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlena was fabulous! The house was super tidy and she did have everything you need! Best stocked Airbnb! Marlena is so right bring all your food before you get there. Also when planning your meals and not sure if you need to bring an item from home Marlena is always there to answer your questions! The trek up and down to the town is very winding and narrow roads but pretty! The view is breath taking. We spent most of our times starring out at the lake!
Thank you Marlena for letting us stay at your home it was a perfect get away!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great time on the property! The deck was the best part of the house. We spent most of our time there.
Note, the only con of this place is that it’s far from town."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent view more than we expected. This is a perfect vacation house if you just need a place to stay with family and relax in the house.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great view, lovely home! Perfectly relaxing."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, clean and a place you can feel at home. Marlene is the best! she was very accommodating and helpful. Suggest bring your own movies or download before hand, as no wifi and spot connection areas. She had a great selection and a record player!! was a treat. Highly recommend this place."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very relaxing time at Marlena’s house. We wanted to come back the minute we walked into the house. We truly enjoyed the view and the property. Thank you Marlena for your hospitality. My kid already asked when we can stay again at Marlena’s place and see the dog, Lily."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is THE BEST place I have ever stayed! I was in love with the place upon arrival-- the unbeatable VIEW, the interior decoration of the house(you can tell the owner has a good sense of design), well stocked kitchen, a nice collection of kitchen accessories(I like everything about this kitchen, from plates, cups to even paperholder!), the nice flow of layout, spacious deck area all around, and well made tile floor outside....
We LOVE that at the evening time we can hang out on the deck at the perfect Summer temperature enjoying the view WITHOUT mosquitos or bugs!! My baby kept on waking up in the middle of night where I had to take her out to the deck, and me face up laying on the sofa on the deck with my baby sleeping on my chest and looking into the sky full of stars was surreal...
This place is a little paradise! And the host is extremely welcome and responsive. She even offered to pick up something when she was in town. Thank you so much for your hard work to keep such a nice place available for us to enjoy!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I enjoyed our stay at Marlena’s lovely lake house. We were in need of a relaxing weekend away and this was the perfect place. The view of the lake is breathtaking and the sunsets and star gazing were unforgettable! Marlena was a wonderful host, she even offered to pick up anything we may have forgotten while in town. Can’t wait for our next stay!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family really enjoyed the view and calmness of Clear Lake and was tranquilized all the time we stayed.
I had been out of the stress from everything! I think we need this place at least once a year!
Thanks Marlena!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed the calmness of Marlena's home. It was clean, inviting, and was stocked with many things that made it easier for us - basic spices and cooking supplies, toiletries, and grill accessories. The deck was wonderful and it was very relaxing to spend the warm afternoons and cool evenings. Very quiet and private. There is a winding road just below the deck (about 30 feet below) that seldom had cars driving through it so it didn't bother us. The heat was a little dry so if you're sensitive to that, bring a small humidifier to ease breathing. The heat made us crave some water time - wish there was a pool. There is no lake access from the home in case you were hoping to take a dip in the lake, you'd have to go to a public beach for water access. We brought our 17-month old and had to bring our own high chair and crib, so bring yours in case you are travelling with little ones. We hope to come back in the future."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for some quiet time - don’t look any further. The place is gorgeous - beautiful views over the lake and plenty of space will make your stay full of relaxation. We enjoyed our time here reading books, hanging out on the terrace with a drink or 2, bbq, star gazing with the telescope and some board/card games, watching birds and lizards which can be quite interesting too. Absolutely recommend!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was so relaxing, I lost track of all time! We enjoyed the birds and sunsets on the patio, and found some local hikes and routes to kayak each day. A bit of a ways from town, so we packed some food and stopped for groceries as suggested by Marlena! Truly a gem to rest and relax at!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There’s a part of me that selfishly doesn’t want to admit how much I love this place! It is one of my favorite places I’ve ever stayed and I’ve stayed in wonderful places all over the world.
The views can’t be beat. It’s peaceful and quiet. There’s a comfortable, well stocked, and loving touches throughout the entire house. It’s tucked away in the middle of a mountain, so while you’re not on the water, the view makes up for it.
The host, Marlena, is warm and inviting. She even checked in with us at one point to see if we wanted her to pick up anything for us while she was at the store.
I absolutely hope to visit this place again. I really can’t say enough great things about my experience."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We both had a great time! Marlena’s home is indeed a quiet space to recharge and renew. The view of the lake and Mt Konocti is fantastic. Evenings on the deck included shooting stars (the night sky is nicely dark) and many satellites (including the ISS twice). A great base to explore the area, or to just chill. !"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space, views, and hospitality were all incredible. One of our favorite Airbnb’s we’ve ever stayed at.
Marlena went above and beyond and was a tremendous host, even volunteering to go into town to get a few things we had forgotten.
We particularly enjoyed the views and relaxation from the deck, as well as the charcoal grill which we made many (mostly) delicious meals!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay here with our puppy. Views are amazing from every part of the house. Kitchen is well stocked and the house was really clean. We also loved using the charcoal grill to make a couple of meals.
Overall, great attention to detail and cleanliness and that paired with the views of the lake, cant beat it! Marlena was very responsive throughout our stay. We will be back for more trips here."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place with great views to the lake.Highlight for folks traveling with kids is the swing, lot of board games, movies and outdoor patio. The house is clean, and beautifully decorated and it’s difficult to beat the awesome views from the bedroom and living room.it’s definitely a great place to unplug and relax."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Summerset is a wonderful place and Marlena is a gracious hostess.
My mom and I spent 3 peaceful days here and couldn’t feel more rested and rejuvenated.
Thank you, Marlena, for putting your heart and soul into this little paradise by the lake and letting us all enjoy it.
I will be back!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlena’s place was a perfect escape from our busy lives in SF! If you’re looking to unwind and relax, this is definitely the place to go. We spent all of our time on the deck with our dogs, who felt immediately at home. It was great to be able to relax outside & let them wander, knowing the property is fully fenced in. We got to meet Marlena, who is warm & welcoming and everything you could want in a host. We will definitely be returning again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It’s a bit of a windy road trip trek to get to this haven, but it’s worth it! From the personalized chalkboard welcome to the “help yourself” goodie basket... Summerset offers the isolation and getaway-from -it-all that my family needed. The stars were bright at night and wildlife was alive and well during the day. Such a relaxing and wonderful vacation. Thank you, Marlena!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,If you’re considering it.. do it! Our 1 year old doesn’t rest well in new places. She slept great both nights we were here. Summerset is very peaceful and feels like home. We booked it on a rainy weekend and still were captivated by its beauty. Marlena was very kind and thoughtful and we had all we needed.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was so lucky to book this place!! After a rough week at work, I decided to find an Airbnb.
Amazingly, this hidden gem (which is booked for the next couple of months) was actually available! Marlena was very communicative and replied to my messages immediately. The views were AMAZING and the home was full of goodies!
I especially loved how she welcomed my fur baby! She left him bowls to enjoy his food and water, flashlights to take him out for his walk and poopie bags.
In addition, we were welcomed by a personalized note and goodies! What a great getaway from city life. Surely a digital detox. There were a lot of books to read, games and cds/records!
I wish I could book this hidden gem again but it’s already booked for the year. I’ll keep checking hopefully I’ll get lucky again lol
Thank you so much Marlena!!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway! The house had everything we could need to bbq and enjoy some relaxation! The deck and view of the lake are spectacular and we spent most of our time out there enjoying the beautiful days we had during our stay! Marlena is great and quick to respond to any questions or anything t hat comes up. I highly recommend staying here! We hope to be able to stay at this beautiful home again soon!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place has a beautiful view and relaxing environment. Great collection of movies. The kitchen is well equipped. We cooked all the meals at home. We enjoyed our stay and hope to come back again.
2021-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"First thing first.. definitely can’t beat the views!!!

One of the reasons i booked this place is because of the “rare privacy” however that was not the case. The owner was actually staying feet away in her cottage. I wish we would have known because we wouldn’t have booked.
Another reason we booked was the jacuzzi spa tub pictured over looking the lake, it didn’t work. The knobs were removed so you couldn’t turn the jets on.
There were chewed up sunflower seeds on my night stand in the bedroom and all over the deck. In the rules it asked for shoes not to we worn inside so i didn’t and within 20 minutes my feet were black from the dirty floors.
Last but not least i found her to be very rude in the messages she sent during my stay.
*** don’t forget to turn a light off at night, she will write you and let you know in the morning."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marlena’s place is the perfect retreat and reset. The pictures truly don’t do the deck and view justice. We loved all of the outdoor sitting areas and spent all day outside on the deck soaking it all in. Inside the home is cozy and well cared for with everything you need to prepare meals. Marlena is an awesome host and even texted us to check in if we needed anything while she was in town. We will absolutely be rebooking!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The property is perfectly described and exactly what I was looking for. Would definitely stay there again.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great space and fantastic views!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly spectacular! An exquisite getaway, fully off the grid and a peaceful oasis with breathtaking views. We so enjoyed the tranquility of the location, and both waking up to the birds singing and ending a leisurely day with drinks on the balcony to savor the sunset. The host is top-notch, providing excellent responsiveness and thoughtful touches throughout the listing. This is one of our favorite Airbnbs where we’ve stayed in the world, and we highly recommend this location for nature lovers looking to recharge. We can’t wait to return!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly a gem! Marlena is a super host. We stayed here a few nights for my birthday. At first I worried about not having WiFi at the house, but once we got here we totally forgot about it. This place has so much more to offer. I can’t say enough how much I love the view. It’s even more beautiful than in the pictures. I would have spent more time outside on the deck if it wasn’t too cold. The only thing we wish we have is the outdoor heaters. The house itself is so charming, clean and comfortable. Every details in the house are so thoughtful. We had such an amazing time and we already booked the next visit already!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The views are gorgeous and it’s a great place to relax. The kitchen was very well stocked with 20+ spices and multiple cooking oils. The swing outside and bathtub with a view of the lake were also lovely.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a lovely stay – the view is unbeatable! There isn't much to do / eat around there, so it's the perfect place to unplug, relax and enjoy the view."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing views, very cozy, quite and private house. Very clean house with a full kitchen down to the smallest detail of variety of spices."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlena's place is truly amazing! If you want getaway from the chaos of real life, I highly recommend her place to relax and unwind. The views from the deck are breathtaking. This is the perfect place to turn off everything and enjoy nature. Her place is clean and she provides everything you might need. True gem!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay at Marlena's place, with an amazing view, cozy and well appointed house and lots of fun touches (DVDs to watch, CDs to listen to, games, books, and well appointed kitchen). Would love to stay here again!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Expectations were above and beyond! This second time around I brought my sister and her husband along with my husband. We had such an amazing experience! We love the view. We could be outside in the deck for hours just gazing at beautiful views! We will definitely be back in the future. Thank you so much for your hospitality and your kindness!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very stylish space. I even loved the books. The colors on the lake never stop changing. Stunning. Best house on clear lake in our opinion!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marlena’s place is more beautiful than what is described and shown in the photos. We didn’t get out of the house during our short stay. Amazing views from anywhere in the house. Our 5 year old had a blast. We will definitely come back.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were so happy that Marlena had everything we needed and more in the kitchen (appliances, spices...). Great place for a restcation! We loved sleeping on the patio, sitting by the fire at night, and taking baths in the large tub. It was nice to unplug as well! She’s so friendly and awesome. We hope to return soon!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so beautiful I even wouldn’t want to tell about it to anybody because it’s already booked till summer. But let me tell you one thing, we will definitely come back. Thank you Marlena!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marlena’s Summerset home was beautiful and the pictures on here do not do it justice. As soon as we walked in we noticed how much love and care goes into making sure her guest have a comfortable stay. I really enjoyed reading her little notes around the home too. She also checked in with us when she made a trip into town asking if we needed anything. Thanks for being a great host and for being dog friendly! We loved being able to take out big pup with us!!!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlena's place is squeaky clean and nicely decorated. Kitchen is well stocked and toiletries are provided (even hand sanitizer, which is very thoughtful). You don't have to bring a lot since there is a ton of books, movies, and games in the house (bring chromecast if you want to watch Netflix). My favorite part is the deck! It is massive and the view is surreal! We spent most of our time on the deck simply just taking it all in (also drinking cocktails, stargazing, and birdwatching). We even saw a small plane flying over the water which was so cool. We will definitely stay at Marlena's place again in the future. My family and doggies had an awesome time. Thank you for hosting! :)"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place really is heaven on earth! Marlena has created such a relaxing, cozy space and the view alone is enough reason to stay here, but all the small touches help make the trip that much more special. We can’t wait to come back, it was a perfect getaway in these crazy times."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! The view is great in rain or shine. Truly a great place for a home away from home (but with a better view). Huge plus that it’s pet friendly!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views!!! The house is very comfortable and cozy.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Marlena's was a deeply enjoyable experience. The lake view was everything from the picture and way beyond. My partner and I (and our dog) stayed here for my birthday trip – this is a great place for peacefulness, reflection, and quality time with yourself & your company. Thank you Marlena for making your place available during COVID (and following the protocol) — we felt safe and refreshed after the trip."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Marlena’s place was perfect! Marlena was an amazing host who responded quickly to our texts/messages, and the house was exactly like the photos and prepared so that we never needed to step outside the house for anything. The view of Clearlake from the deck was serene, quiet and peaceful. We want to visit again in the future!!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We love our stay here. Like all others suggested, we spent all our time here and never leave during our stay. We're lucky that we got perfect weather so spent almost all our day time on the deck (and some night time too because it's a great spot to see the stars). To me the highlights is morning yoga on the deck while watching sparking sunshine over the lake and for the kids, they love the swing and bird houses in side yard. But generally, doing nothing and just staring at the sky, mountains, lake and hearing bird singing is priceless and worthwhile every second."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the perfect location for family vacation for those with a loved one on the autism spectrum. It is very difficult to take our son to places without bringing along a kit full of his favorite items that help him to cope with unfamiliar situation and sensory overload. For those people who can’t put up with strong colors and potent smells, this place is perfect. The walls are painted in airy neutral colors, the lighting is very soft and warm, and all the soaps and detergents are unscented or have light natural scents. Around the home there are also different amenities to help people on the spectrum self-soothe. A tree swing hangs outside the house. If you are looking for a sensory friendly place to travel this place is amazing!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was AMAZING. My family and I have been using Airbnb for years and this by far had the most beautiful views we ever stayed at. The whole time we were there, all we did was just stare out into the lake from the living room. It felt unreal and serene. Also at night, the sky is full of stars! Such a great experience. The house was very cozy and clean and had such a nice vibe to it as well. Our host Marlena was also one of the nicest and best hosts we've had! She was incredibly thoughtful and kind. We will definitely be coming back here again! Thanks for everything Marlena!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is the most amazing and beautiful location i have stayed at. The view is absolutely incredible!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and quiet place to rejuvenate and relax
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing balcony for reading and relaxing. Would not recommend for crawlers or new walkers as there are edges. Otherwise, Marlena’s place is comfortable, and and has a great kitchen!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Summerset is a great getaway from the busy city life. We spent 5 days here and felt it was less. The house itself is very tastefully done with all safety and cleanliness procedures adhered to. Marlena was prompt in replying for anything we needed. While we didn't get to meet her (due to COVID), she was always available through text message on the app. The kitchen is stocked with all the possible cookware and basic items like spices and oils. The appliances work very well so one can cook a full blown meal. We cooked all meals at home. Tip: There is a Safeway about 15 minutes away at Olympic Dr. from where one can source all the groceries. Best to stock up before driving up to the house as you will not want to leave the house. The bedrooms are cute and bathrooms are clean. The deck is amazing and on a sunny day, one can laze outside and sip on some champagne. Overall, we loved Summerset and can't thank Marlena enough."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem of a home! The pictures are accurate, but in person the deck feels even better. Marlena was a thoughtful and responsive host. I would definitely come back again. Note, there is no wifi, so this is not a great work remotely spot, but it is a lovely getaway spot."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"absolutely beautiful views! so many comfortable places to sit on the gorgeous deck. the house is even more beautiful than the pictures...I loved having breakfast listening to and watching all the gorgeous birds outside the kitchen windows. best of all, due to the pandemic I was cooking all my meals. the kitchen is so well equipped, there was nothing I needed that wasn't already there. Marlena was gracious and friendly and helpful. will definitely come back here!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Views are absolutely STUNNING in person. Marlena was super super quick to reply to all my questions. Highly recommend this place. My family enjoyed their time here so much!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Summerset is a great place for R&R. It has great views of Clear lake and good amenities.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing views! This place is absolutely amazing! My brain could not take how beautiful this place is! I felt like I was in a painting. Definitely recommend! Me and my husband are planning on returning in the future. It’s so quiet, private and peaceful! Marlena was amazing at communicating! Thanks for the pumpkin bread!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Summerset has everything you need to relax and recharge. So many thoughtful touches throughout the home. Pictures don't do justice how beautiful the view of the lake is! Marlena's place is the perfect blend of cozy and modern. I'm usually an excursion-seeking type of traveler but I spent my whole trip here indoors easily. Already planning my next trip back!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easily one of the best vacation homes we’ve been to and hands down, the best host we’ve ever had the pleasure to meet.
The views from the deck are mind blowing and we loved the ultra comfortable deck seating, especially for some spectacular stargazing. The house itself if cozy and Marlena has been very thoughtful in setting it up and making people feel comfortable.
In addition to making us feel welcome, Marlena made our stay very memorable. She’s one of the nicest people we’ve come across on our travels and she went out of the way to FedEx something we left behind.
Absolutely recommend this amazing place and we’ll definitely be coming here again!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The view is amazing and the house has everything you need for a cozy getaway. Marlena was a very lovely host!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely recommend this place if you are looking to get away for some R&R. It's secluded, cozy, has the most amazing 180 views of the lake, and has every amenity you need to unplug and unwind. The host was so friendly and helpful, but also gave us our space and privacy. During the day, I relaxed for hours on the deck reading my book and taking in the crisp air, the serene lake, and the chirping birds. At night, we made delicious dinners, lit the fireplace, listened to music and watched old movies. For a week, I was able to escape the clutter and stress of every day life, and I definitely plan to go back again in the future!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing views, nothing beats it - you don't have to go anywhere but relax absorbing the nature and views. A must visit for those looking for a peaceful weekend getaway."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is truly a gem. It’s the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at and the experience was made even more special thanks to Marlena. We came here for my wife’s birthday and she found a card and a gift waiting for her when we entered the house! We then went into the living room and the view of the lake is just spectacular. The same thing with the bedroom where we woke up every day to a view of the lake and hills from our bed. There’s no WiFi or cable so we spent time without any devices and playing board games and relaxing. Drinking tea on the deck while watching the sunset was also great. Marlena was quick to respond whenever we had any questions. She also left a game of scrabble and movie snacks for us the night before we left for home. I highly recommend staying here. I think we might just come here regularly whenever we want to unplug and relax.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlena is a truly wonderful host. She was very welcoming and thoughtful, clearly always considering our comfort during our stay at her place. She even offered to get us pizza and wine to be ready when we arrived!!
I’ve been to many very nice AIrBnbs but this is truly the best of all. The views of this house are hard to describe— much better in person than the photos. It is so nice that the house is designed such that all rooms in the house have the view. The expansive deck is really amazing and so lovely. The cute side garden with all the bird feeders attracts so many adorable little birds and I greatly enjoyed watching them and listening to them. The place is very private which is really fantastic. I believe Marlena stays in the small cottage next door, but we wouldn’t have known if we hadn’t seen a car parked outside. So she fully respects her guests privacy. The house was immaculately clean and had everything we needed. Basically it was as if we were in our own home with all the kitchen equipment and anything you could imagine available. There are so many games, DVDs and CDs to enjoy, and also an awesome collection of books and magazines. As the posting has noted there is no internet, so this is a great opportunity to unplug and just relax and enjoy the beautiful nature in these serene and lovely place. Highly recommended and will definitely stay here again if we come back to the area."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay exceeded expectations. Marlene was a helpful host, and the accommodations were wonderful. Very happy!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved every bit of our stay at Marlena’s property. She truly made our stay beautiful with her excellent and outstanding hospitality. The property is a jewel in itself, with a beautiful and huge expansive lake view deck. Stargazing at night was an added bonus! The views were even better than pictured."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Views! Views! Views! This is a perfect place to relax and unwind. Marlena’s place is beautiful and has touched that are heart warming. We felt like we landed on a piece of island. We couldn’t get enough of it. Thank you Marlena for sharing this gem with us.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful beautiful place. We’ll be back Marlena! :)
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is definitely off the beaten path. It’s tucked away on a mountain without any distractions. It’s a wonderful place to unplug.
Marlena is a very sweet and helpful host and has all necessities (outside of food) available for use. Beds and pillows are super comfortable and good quality, which is a huge plus for me!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Summerset was just as we hoped: relaxing, quiet, and a perfect way to recharge. The views over the lake were breathtaking, as advertised. We spent part of each day just relaxing on the deck, looking out over the water. Maybe the most unexpected and special part of our stay, though, was the thoughtful communication from Marlena. We were staying there for our honeymoon, and she welcomed us with a sweet message and bottle of wine. She was available to us via text for anything and everything (including getting us a few lemons for a meal we were making), but also made sure to give us the utmost privacy. Thank you, Marlena! We hope to come back again someday!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place with a wonderful view. Kitchen stocked with all the utensils you would need, and clean sheets and towels. Would stay here again!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The view can’t be fully understood through pictures! It’s unreal
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is a spectacular hidden gem. Very private with a massive deck and breathtaking panoramic views. Enjoyed my stay very much and can’t wait to return!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place with the best views! The views from the deck and the living are definitely stunning. The house had a lot of little nice details that make you smile :) Definitely a place to come back! You really get to disconnect and enjoy the nature.
Also Marlene is a super host! She will make sure you can relax and have the best time! Thanks for everything!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The most relaxing escape! Beautiful blue skies, warm hospitality, thoughtful touches, and a lake view that felt like heaven on earth. Such a fun couple of nights away to celebrate my husband’s bday with our two kids. We are grateful for Marlena!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is better than the pictures...the deck is AMAZING!
The TUB is stellar, and there was every thoughtful touch added from coffee filters and seasoning to charcoals from the barbecue.
My favorite touches were the “lady products”.
We plan to come back and visit very soon."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall it was a wonderful experience for our group. We felt nurtured and relaxed after spending three nights at this fantastic property. After our arrival, we didn't leave the property once during our stay. We lounged around between the enormous deck and the living room. The spectacular scenery of the lake reminded me of Europe. I often forgot I was only two and a half hours away from San Francisco! Marlena was gracious, helpful, and was a great hostess. I recommend this place and will visit again. Thank you, Marlena!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a gorgeous, special place and hosted by such a thoughtful, sweet host Marlena to boot! A wonderful picturesque, quiet home to escape the city with just the right amount of comfortable comforts needed. Marlena was such a joy to have met and was so helpful and thoughtful, even leaving a mini homemade pie for us. We really enjoyed the beautiful views and large deck to lounge on, especially watching the sunset. Just what we needed to recharge and hope to return!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The location is an excellent choice for family and friends to visit. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to rent it again.
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"When I tell you this house is a dream home. I mean that honestly, the huge fireplthe beautiful deck that opened windows looking at the mountains and the lake, the private dog to fish, the Jacuzzi off the master bedroom all the extra. Blanky's when it's well equipped kitchen and my Jew. I'm a chef. I didn't have to bring anything with me this time. Except for this house so much. My children are grown, but they're young adults and they absolutely love that house. It was hailing and a storm came. We lit the fireplace and played family ate good. We slept good for my 53rd birthday. It was absolutely amazing. I suggest if this house is available. And you're looking for family fun, peace and quiet. In an absolutely beautiful home. The downstairs which has a spiraling staircase. My daughter's love that room. This was our second time staying there. I cannot reiterate how amazing this house is.Thank you again victor"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our family had an amazing time staying at Victor's place! Caught lots of fish right off the dock and had a relaxing time in the hot tub. We will definitely be back to stay in the near future!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I really enjoyed our time at
Victor’s lake house. We enjoyed the fireplace, hot tub, and fishing off the dock! It was a private and peaceful setting with wonderful views of Clearlake. We hope to come back again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"the houseis absolutely amazing from start to finish,the fireplace ,the hot tub,the patio ,the private dock couldn't possibly have asked anything more. We had Thanksgiving dinner and played board games around the fire

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Super great space for enjoying Clearlake, for my first time out kayaking I had a pleasant stay, with plenty to do!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was quiet, clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the back deck and the dock, kayak and paddle boat were great. We were able to catch fish right from the dock and our family had a great time. We would definitely come back again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had such a wonderful time at Daniele's place. The deck/dock was extremely peaceful and nice. Even with the rain over the weekend it was very cozy.
We had everything we needed in the house and it was a great location to stores and restaurants. Highly recommend a stay here, it was so relaxing and exactly what we needed"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Everything is exactly as described. We enjoyed paddle-boating and sitting on the back deck by the waterway. The neighborhood has seen better days, but everyone was very friendly. House is clean and has everything you need, including games."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Daniele's place is right on the water, so you have access to endless fun paddle boating, kayaking, and fishing. The home has a shed where you also have access to life jackets - a huge plus. The place felt spacious and clean, and Daniele was always responsive to any of our questions. A great place to stay!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a very pleasant stay. Although only there for to sleep, we got the rest we needed. Thank you for a lovely stay. Oh and many geese flying overhead and in the lake which was wonderful to see"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daniele's waterfront duplex is lovely! It is located in a Clear Lake Oaks, a neighborhood of homes on little canals, which is really special. Her space has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and an open-concept living/dining/kitchen space. Best of all is the back patio and water front dock! Daniele was beyond accommodating--pet-friendly, communicative, helpful, and flexible about our check-out time. We made good use of the back patio, fished off the dock, and used her tandem kayak. We definitely plan to return!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is an absolute hidden gem!! The pictures definitely did not do it justice! I had the opportunity to stay in Daniele's home this past week for a family emergency and I felt right at home - I did not have to worry about anything! The kitchen was more than stocked, tons of linens and the entire home was cozy and welcoming! Felt right at home! OHHH and the neighbors are VERY nice! I met 3 of them in my short stay and they were very kind and welcoming!
A bonus? Right out the backdoor is a water way with several native birds. We saw about 75 pelicans just floating off the back deck daily - must be their routine! The outdoor area is just as amazing as the home with comfy places to sit, a warm fireplace and the beauty of nature!
I can not wait to visit the area again and will definitely rent this home again! Thank you Daniele for sharing your place with us!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was as described and peaceful. Daniele is very helpful and responsive. She let us check in early because the weekend was raining and we could not do much outside.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host and great stay for the weekend.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice home on the lake.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is comfortable and look like the pictures. The neighborhood is peaceful and there's everything you need around like gas, groceries and walks.
However, we felt that there was a need for better support, as the accommodation lacked basic items such as paper towels, gas for the barbecue, and gas for the firetip.
Another thing it was at backyard the of the house there was a skeleton of a cat that looked to have been there for a long time, and we didn't feel comfortable with that. But overall it's a good spot."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place! It rained during our stay but we had a good family time in the backyard with the fire pit, dart board, foosball and board games.
Daniele was clear in her communication and gave us a heads up that the cold water in the kitchen wasn’t working. She also gave us options of checking in early and checking out a bit late. We definitely felt that she strives hard to be a wonderful host."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"5 stars!!! Absolutely enjoyed our stay! Dany is a superb and friendly host. Great location, the home is squeaky clean and VERY well-stocked. We really enjoyed the paddle boats and fire pit. You’ll feel right at home at Dany’s. Marcel’s French pastries is just a short walk away - excellent customized Keto vanilla cold brew and plenty of non-keto desserts :) Enjoy!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a really nice stay at this location with my family. Good value! The home has dock access straight from the back porch. Nice hangout spot on back porch as well. There are a double sit atop kayak and peddle boats to use. The dock is in the keys amidst other homes, but it’s only about a 10-15 minute paddle to the full lake. Really nice fall colors in the lake and nearby hills in November.
The kitchen was well stocked. It was nice having a washer and dryer.
There are some nice walks in the area, although note that many (not all) prohibit dogs. We had no issues walking our dog around the neighborhood. There are a lot of outdoor cats that live in the neighborhood; this was fine for our dog but just a note to dog owners.
We had fun off-roading on walker ridge road. Plenty of fishing and hunting in the area if that is your thing. Overall a ton of outdoor options.
Host was very communicative and had prepared a helpful binder with recommendations etc that was nice to have."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My children and I felt right at home. Super comfy living room and bedrooms. The back patio was amazingly peaceful and beautiful. Kitchen had everything we needed. Shopping was close for the food we wanted to shop for or DoorDash. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,my sisterand I absolutely loved this air B&B. this place was amazing! Daniele's a great host. Responsive when needed help for anything. would highly recommend this place to anyone. would definitely come back again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice house for a good price.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it was the perfect house for me and my lady. we loved the location. this house is clean and very appeasing to the eye.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very relaxing and we caught a huge bass and catfish.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Danielle’s place was great. Right on the water, so we took advantage of the kayak/pedalboats. Location is quiet and private. Short walk or drive to some shops and restaurants. The place itself is spacious and has nice outside deck, right on the water and is pet friendly. We really enjoyed staying there."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice and peaceful place! Very relaxing, just wish I new how to fish!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to reset and unwind!
First time visiting the area but Daniele was so helpful with restaurant and things to do near by.
The neighbors were friendly. The house is exactly like the photos!
Definitely plan on visiting again!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"First two day's A/C on the fritz. I tried to figure out the digital puck but shut it
down. Called Daniele in the evening and she tried to get repairman out that night
but he couldn't make it. However he did show up first thing next morning and walla, it works. I'm better off staying away from I.T. things. Her location in the ""Keys"" is easy to find and has quick access to open fast water. Daniele was great!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family enjoy the stay and would do it again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax over the river
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to get to, looks like the pictures and squeaky clean place! Nice amenities that make you feel at home. Co-host was very responsive. Not a ton to do in the area but we drove to Blue Lake resort and had a great time at the lake!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at Daniele's place. The access to water from the backside deck was amazing. The boats and the kayak with life jackets was an added plus. We were able to take our paddle board on the water too. The kitchen was well equipped. The exhaust fan was not working but it was supposed to be fixed soon. The only issue we faced is that the bunk beds were a bit squeaky which disturbed our sleep. There were guests in the adjacent place who were very nice, but we could hear them in the patio area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,You will not be able to find a better value than Daniele’s home. We appreciate how quickly she replied and that they let us check in two hours early. The dock is beautiful and well maintained and so convenient if you bring a boat!

was friendly."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Daniele’s place and her communication with us was great. We had a little trouble getting in but she helped us out immediately with the lock code. She was very responsive. Her place was exactly as advertised, it was very comfortable for us, even with an 18 month old baby.
The location was good, but it was not what we were looking for. This is not anyone’s fault though, we just didn’t do enough research on the general area :)
Everything with the house and with Daniele as a host was amazing though."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, place and host. Would recommend. Very responsive and accommodating host. Best to book both units because back of house and deck can be shared between the units."

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great value, clean and spacious, nice amenities, pet friendly. Groceries 2 mins away, or a large Safeway 8 mins away. Currently the backyard launching of boats is not an option due to drought, but there is a public ramp a half mile away. We may well return here if California ever gets adequate rain again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We were in the area for a death and the home was so much better than a motel.

Thank you Daniele for everything and we will return again.
PS. Toto (our dog) stays thank you for the visit."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daniele made my stay very inviting and clean. I felt very taken care of as she checked in a few times to ensure all my needs were met. The home was just as described with a well stocked kitchen, lovely outside patio. I attempted to float in their canoe, but the water this time of year was too low...but I sorta expected that. 100% would come again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Daniele’s house. Great location, nice and clean, and great communication. Would stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Daniele’s place is a nice house perfect for our trip with our family of four and two dogs. The scenery is great. And it’s a perfect place in a little town with everything you need.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked our ""End of Summer"" family trip at the lake house in Clearlake Oaks. We had never been to Clearlake before. The lake house was perfect for Me, my husband and three children. It was stocked with everything you need. There was plenty of games to enjoy together. There was scooters that my children enjoyed riding in the nice little quiet neighborhood. The kitchen was nicely stocked with everything you need for cooking. The lake itself was not impressive and smelly, not good to swim in. But I've now learned it's been like that for years, and you have to drive to the nice spots. We had a blast at the lake house, enjoying each others company and just spending quality time together. We will be back, FOR SURE!"
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,Was a cozy little place to stay and was super close to all the major things around the lake area. We had some issues but the host was super quick to respond and be helpful. It is a newer looking Airbnb and sound like they will be making improvements for their guests. all in all we were happy with our stay and would stay here again.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this place! We decided to take the last minute boating trip and found Danielle’s place. It was our first time to Clearlake and Daniele was very welcoming! In fact, We had a minor boating incident and Daniele happened to check in on us. She was concerned for our safety and didn’t stop communicating until we were home safe!
The house fit six people perfectly. All the amenities are there including a map of the are. The house is really cute and very clean. The lake is low, so there are very few places you can put your boat in. Her place is a five minute drive to the nearest launching area. Plenty of parking. She texted me when the place was ready for an early check in! Who does that?! Daniele that’s who!
We enjoyed our stay and will be back. ❤️"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect home for a weekend getaway or a getaway period!
First, communication was on point and very responsive. I appreciate Daniele answer all my questions prior to arriving and even during my stay.
The description is exactly as described.
Cute spot for a quiet getaway. Paddle boat and kayak came in super handy during our trip. There were life vest provided but we brought our own. Everything you need is found in the home (kitchen, seasoning, toiletries, etc.)
Great hot water pressure int he shower (which I loved).
Would highly recommend this home and will be returning."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I enjoyed our stay greatly and tried to take all advantages of our stay with everything provided. Very well stocked house with multiple additions. Daniele had outstanding communication if something were to go wrong or if something/anything was needed. Highly recommended for nice quiet family getaway.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Came to the lake house for July 4th weekend, and turned out to be one of our best Airbnb stays. Daniele is an awesome host, very responsive. The house was very clean, cozy and had everything to make one feel at home. When we arrived at 9:30PM I was wondering how to get in as I totally forgot Daniele had given the door entry code through airbnb 3 days before our stay; I messaged Daniele on how to get in and she immediately responded with the code again, and also opened the door for us remotely. My kid enjoyed the bunk bed. Paddle boating was a family fun activity and as an added bonus we got a good view of the July 4th fireworks 🎆. Thank you Daniele for making our stay so memorable and we are looking forward to staying again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,So Daniele is awesome and had a great time at her place... not one issue. I will be staying again! I strongly recommend.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is just incredible. Beautiful home, gorgeous views the water, super friendly neighbors, awesome amenities, crazy easy check in process, and a wonderful host. We came up for a Father's day fishing trip plus work from home getaway. My husband caught 10 fish off of the dock in back! I had a great time taking calls in front of the fire pit and doing my crosswords in the sun in the afternoons. The best week we've had thus far for sure. Daniele was super responsive and was quick to answer all of our questions (and help out when I accidentally locked myself out of the house, smh). If you're looking for a peaceful getaway or want to work from home somewhere else, this is the place to go!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice and clean place. Everything from booking to checkout was EXCELLENT.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, great host. The firepit was nice on the back deck. Definitely recommend."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Daniele was very communicative and the property was exactly what we were looking for: very quiet and right on the water. They had a lot of fun using the paddle boat!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet and clean sanctuary, a perfect place to relax indoors or outdoors. A cook's paradise in the kitchen!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Daniele’s place felt like home, it was welcoming and had a lot of nice personal touches throughout the place. My kids and I really enjoyed the backyard as well and were fishing off the dock throughout the entire stay. Communication was clear and anything extra needed was just a quick text away. Definitely look forward to another check in soon and would recommend to families and couples. Thanks!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location by the lake, plenty of parking out front, very clean and well kept living areas. Nice out door patio area with a bbq as well. Very responsive and friendly host."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Place is a wonderful getaway from the city. Kid friendly too with all my children under 5, it felt safe for them to wander around. Love the easy access to the water and the fire pit at night. Wish we took more advantage but we came when it was windy and raining at times.
Only problem was the cleanliness. My son had some allergies from previous pets. He never had a problem w this before but luckily I had some benadryl on me. Also, my kids found a used cigar on the side of the sofa :/"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice location. Loved fishing off dock and Bbq on patio. Furnished nicely with games n fun things to do inside. Kayak n pedal boat on dock. Lots of birds. Very relaxing and they have netflix, lol."
2022-05-01,2.0,Group trip,"Pros:
This is a great location. Right onto the lake from the house. The living spaces (kitchen, living room, bathroom) were clean.
Dani was quick in her responses.
Unfortunately, I had to leave very quickly. After arriving at 8pm on a Sunday night to check in, I started to have slight sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, sinus's, itchy/irritated throat. This was in the master bedroom with half bath. I have allergies to dust, mold, mites I woke up several times in the night, and finally I woke up at 7am with wheezing. The wheezing is a severe reaction for me towards mold. I sent a message to Dani right away. She responded immediately and agreed to a refund for the rest of the nights. We left before 11am on Monday.
A few things to mention:
1. The stench in the room with the double bed was terrible, unbearable. No one could sleep in it. My mother in law slept on the futon in the living room.
2. There was no bath mat in the main bathroom we used a small towel.
3. The back patio furniture (seating area & tables) was filled with dust. I tried dusting it off & my allergies kicked in.
4. The water down the dock is surrounded by muck/mulch/algae.
5. The paddle boat is filled with green water & blocked by the muck in the water.
There was no way I would've been able to paddle boat out of kayak out without clearing out the green muck on the lake.
6. There is a washer/dryer and water heater/water tank in the master bedroom. If you are a light sleeper, the water tank makes noise every time you flush the toilet.
7. The carpet was supposed to be shampooed and the shampoo process was started and a note was left stating, ""I started shampooing and stopped. I didn't realize anyone was coming."" I appreciated not checking into a wet carpet situation, but perhaps maybe that could've contributed to the allergies as well."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is awesome- location is great, it’s super clean and love that we get to bring our dogs! Can’t wait to come back :)"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have used multiple Air B&B homes at Clear Lake and this has been the best. Very clean house, modern, well equipped, nice dock in the back to park your bass boat. Daniele was amazing, super responsive, and very accommodating. Will definitely look for this home again on our next fishing trip."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"top notch Communication , comfy , clean and spacious for a 2 bedrooms."
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"House was awesome, clean and had mostly everything we needed. Daniele was very quick to respond. Check in and out were really smooth as well. Would recommend"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute place. We booked Daniele’s place last minute as our spring break plans were not solidified earlier. From the get go Daniele was super responsive and instructions were clear.
We ended up checking in late so the fact that check was super easy was helpful at the late hour. Daniele stayed in touch and made sure we were comfortable.
The kitchen is well stocked both in terms of utensils and basics needed for cooking a meal. Kids enjoyed playing several board games that is in the guest bedroom. Beds were comfy and the room cozy for a great night’s sleep. The deck is great for grilling or just hanging out.
We didn’t use the kayak but kids also enjoyed the paddle boat around the keys. Overall a great short trip and an excellent host. Would love to do it again if our visits bring us to Clearlake. Thank you Daniele for the awesome experience!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was wonderful for our 2 night stay. Clean, quiet, comfortably sized and very cozy. Had it not already been booked, we would have extended our stay here. Great spot to fish right from the private dock, adventure around on the kayak and paddle boat, BBQ and movies on the big screen at night. Nearby bait shop, grocery store, coffee shops, and public boat ramps and piers. Daniele was very helpful and kind. This spot is a hidden gem that made the 3 of us very happy!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ideal location. Quiet and right on the water. House is nice and clean and we felt very safe while staying here!
Courtney"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great cozy place. I love communicating with Daniele she is so a great host, considerate and thoughtful. The place is right on the water. I was able to get my boat in and and out okay but water is shallow. The front has an empty lot next door for additional parking which was great for my boat too. The place is nicely decorated and well cleaned. I would definitely stay there again!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cozy house was great for a short family vacation. We used the paddle boat, kayak, games, and outdoor fireplace every day! Great location and prompt communication too. Keep in mind this is a small house, so pack lightly."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super cute house in nice neighborhoods. Daniele is very helpful
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was generally okay. The rooms were tidy. There were enough things in the kitchen to do some cooking. The grill was great, too. The paddle boat was fun as well.
What was special were the paddle boat ride where you’d see different bird species. For the night time, stargazing is excellent. If you have a telescope, you should bring it!
Just a note on a couple of things:
1. The host is not sure about the potability of the water for drinking. You could buy bottled water at the store, or you could boil it, too. They had an electric kettle.
2. The lighting in the dining and living room were quite dim. It was too dark to be able to play board games properly. Maybe not so bad if you were just drinking.
3. The description says there are kids’ toys and books. Technically there were, but don’t count on it."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect spot for us! We had 2 adults and 2 kids and we had an absolute blast. We took the paddle boat out for an adventure, grilled burgers, and sat by the fire while enjoying the view of the water. Everything we needed was there at the house. Thank you for a great location to make great memories!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Do you need some peace and quiet? This place is perfect for that and I love to watch the water outside, the Canadian geese, ducks, birds and even diving ducks. A nice place for birders. The veranda on back deck is so pleasant and neighborhood very quiet. Nice to have full kitchen and open lot next door for more privacy."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daniele is friendly, communicative, and responsive and I had a great time at her stay. The house itself is both comfortable and trendy, and there’s tons to do! From barbecuing on the deck to going out on the lake, you won’t be bored."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daniele’s place is just beautiful! All the little touches she thought of made this space feel like a home away from home, and was perfect to celebrate my boyfriend’s birthday. The outdoor fire pit, kayak and overall atmosphere were lovely. Can’t wait to be back!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was amazing! The view was spectacular! In a great neighborhood. The owner is nice and accommodating. I will recommend the host and the property. Will definitely come back soon!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice and cozy, we had a great time at Daniele's place. Daniele was super reactive to all the messages we send. Great host!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay, the bad part was that the lake water level was to low to be able to use paddle boat or kayak, but this isn't Daniele's fault there is a drought. Daniele was very quick to respond any time I needed to contact her. Would recommend and stay again. Thanks Daniele"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at this Airbnb during a working vacation. The wifi is speedy, and taking conference calls while sitting on the deck over the water makes work much more fun. The house is dog-friendly, and located in a great spot near vineyards, water sports, etc.
Daniele is a great host, and responds extremely quickly."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house is very comfortable for two families. It has everything you need for a vacation. Daniele is very nice host and outstanding in communication and support. We stayed for a weekend when the temp > 100. But air-conditioning is very good that we wouldn't even feel hot inside the house. I 100% recommend this house in Clearlake.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super nice clean house hosts really friendly lady Five star easy

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The lake house was perfect for us. Very clean and Dany was very easy to get in contact with the whole time before and during the stay there. Would definitely stay again when in the area.
,,,"Honestly it is a nice place but if it weren’t for the bug bites, and the cockroaches on the bed. This place is bug infested and also has a lot of dust everywhere. If you have bad allergies this isn’t the place for you. Floor was pretty dirty walking in and even the bed was made but had dust and things all over them."
