2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Kristie went above and beyond- we only stayed for one night and wish we could have spent more time here. Down to every little detail she made the home feel so cozy and welcoming. When we come back to eureka this will always be where we go.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is very cozy with a truly livable feel. it is a perfect balance of historic old house with modern amenities with fun art everywhere.
Before visiting I wasn’t keen on the shower/bathtub setup but the shower was fabulous and if you like a deep
Bath you’ll certainly love the tub.
The recommendations for things to do in Eureka made me wish we were staying longer!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! Kristie’s place is exactly as described and I would say, even better than the pictures. Very roomy. Everything is spotless clean and fully of arts!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I along with our 2 dogs stayed for a few nights during my husband's 50th birthday road trip. The house had anything you could wish for! My husband loved making himself some coffee and he spent a lot of time on the back deck. In the evenings, I generally sat inside and worked on my cross stitches. The neighborhood is quiet with some older run down houses but we enjoyed walking around and taking note of the kept up houses and the architecture they provide. The house is across the street from a community center but the entrance is on the opposite street so you dont get that activity. We would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kristie’s home has by far been the best bnb I’ve ever stayed at! She was not only incredibly kind and responsive, her home is so cute! It’s not just a bnb! It’s curated, thoughtful and clean!
We were there to run a marathon and there was nothing better than coming home to this beautiful space.
Thank you and hope to stay again next year!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved our stay! Felt right at home here 😁 Would love to stay again
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely home stocked with everything! It was a great size and I loved the back deck. The space was clean and nice. Great shower pressure and cool light switches
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute little house. Perfect check in and check out.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What an adorable place! Lots of attention to detail. We had everything we needed here. Great rest stop on our multi state trip and our dog liked it too!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This rental is clean and had everything we needed. The home has so many great touches. We enjoyed our short stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kristie's place was just what we needed. Very clean and comfortable, beautiful and spacious. We loved our stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristie's place was more than we
had hoped for! She even let us know the house was available for early check-in. Once there, we felt welcomed and at home. The amenities were all as stated in the description, but the kitchen amenities were above and beyond. The bed and pillows were super comfy. We loved the bathroom (the shower in the clawfoot tub rocks)!
I think the best word describing the home is ""charming"". It was the perfect getaway for my husband and I. We even drove out to Ferndale, had a wonderful lunch, and enjoyed a walk through town enjoying the shops and architecture.
We both agree it was the nicest place we've had the pleasure to stay at! I am in Eureka a few times a year and hope to be able to stay at Kristie's again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kristie’s place was amazing! It made me feel right at home. She had lots of listed amenities, and the place was very clean. Her home is truly one of best airbnbs I have stayed at. Thanks Kristie!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kristie is a great host, she responded fast and made accommodations last minute for me. Her beautiful home was a wonderful escape and quiet place to stay. I do love that she put nothing creepy goin on in the basement definitely made me laugh, there was nothing I could ever find wrong with this place it was amazing and had all the charm of the era it was built and the tub was amazing! Would certainly recommend to others."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Kristie’s house was one of the best Airbnb’s we have ever stayed in. The house was bigger than expected and had absolutely everything we could have possibly needed. I would recommend it to anyone and would love to come back!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I promised myself to come back here and stay longer!
The host has decorated this house tastefully and stocked it up with generosity and thoughtfulness with everything you need to feel at home immediately.
The renovation preserved historic integrity and offered modern amenities; light fixtures, switch plates (buttons) window coverings, to appliances, super comfortable bed… Gotta try the shower!!!
A sun lover’s delight! The sun flooded the living room in the morning, and I watched the sunset on the back deck. Meandered my short walk to the restaurants and shops through the area for a taste of old California. Can’t wait to go back!
Thank you Kristie 👏🏼"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This house is the cutest place to stay. Great deck in the back and a public park just across the street. The house decorated beautifully. It is stocked full of amenities. And the host is super attentive. We loved this place.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"kristie was so sweet and communicative, and the place blew us away!! so beautiful and clean, i cannot recommend this place enough. thank you so much kristie for being an awesome host and letting us stay at your lovely place!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Immaculate in every way. Traveling for business and it met every need. I brought my puppy and it was perfect, enclosed kitchen with hardwood floors, with a great backyard that offered lots of privacy. Owners provided older towels for the dog to dry off after a walk in the rain. Human towels were soft and big. The bathroom was accommodating and taking a long bath after driving from Portland, OR was sublime. Clean, close to the downtown area, yet also private, and off the main road. Fast wifi and I was able to order MOD PIZZA via UBER EATS while I did work and watched TV. Lastly, from the couch to the bed, all the furniture was well kept and comfortable. I will look for this booking again when I come through next month, thank you! Loved it!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was great from the get go. We felt right at home. She responded quickly and answered all our questions. We were truly impressed with all her amenities and her home was very clean. Cute small cozy backyard was great for some coffee. Overall my wife and two friends enjoyed our stay and would pick this place if we come back to Eureka, CA."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"great listing, flexible & kind host. would recommend when visiting the redwoods"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"The most important thing to me in a rental is cleanliness. Chan's place was spotless. To get to the house the neighborhoods are a little run down, but the actual street for Chan's place is new and very nice. There is a huge walk in closet in the main bedroom which served us as an extra sleeping area. The house is definitely a rental, has no character. Would stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and well stocked place. Easy to get to and in a private location in Eureka. Everything is new and well taken care of. Fenced in backyard was perfect for my toddler.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,Nice new home with lots of space. Large shower in the primary. During our stay the back yard was not mowed so kids couldn’t play outside.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chan’s home was lovely, spotless, and very comfortable. Definitely recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was well maintained, and had a modern feel. It was minimally (but tastefully) decorated. Chan was responsive and answered all my questions. Overall, it was a good stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was extremely well cleaned. Everything worked and me and my family had a great time. It’s the perfect place for making base and visit the Redwood National Parks.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Chan’s place was amazing! In a great part of Eureka with lots of privacy. I would definitely rent their place again next time I visit!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"For passing through the area this was a great little spot. Although we only stayed one night, we were very comfortable. It was easy to find and we felt very safe. The accommodations were very clean and the family all slept well. I was very happy with our choice, and felt the home matched the listing well."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I enjoyed our stay here. Chan was very helpful and responsive with the details for our check in and questions we had. The place itself was very clean, spacious, beautiful, and we really appreciated all of the ammenties and attention to details to ensure we felt safe and comfortable while on vacation."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family was stopping in Eureka on our trip from the Bay Area up to Seattle.
Chan's home was a recently built and beautifully furnished modern home.
It had all of the amenities that we needed. Three bedrooms and 2 and half bathrooms were great for a family of four. Communication from Chan was terrific and very responsive. Chan's house was about a ten minute drive to the waterfront district with shops and food.
The record player with Beach Boys and Janet Jackson albums were a bonus!
We would highly recommend Chan's home to anyone who needs a place in Eureka."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"The house was impeccably clean, very spacious and comfortable. My family loved it!
Thank you!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely house!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was exactly as advertised. Great newer home, well furnished in a quiet neighborhood. We used it as base camp for a few days in Redwood National Park. Fireworks in the town of Eureka were phenomenal. Highly recommend this home to anyone looking to stay in the Eureka area"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Would recommend the place to friends! the place is new, super clean, very spacious, with well set amenities and appliances; matching exactly the photos and description. Chan is very responsive and quick in returning messages. thanks for having us!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chan’s listing was everything we needed for our two nights in Eureka. The home was spacious for our toddler and enough room for our whole family whom we were road tripping with. Everyone had their own bed and bathrooms weren’t an issue. The entire family loved the home and it was our favorite out of all of the homes we stayed in during our trip. Stay here, you won’t be disappointed."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great home! New and very clean. Loved everything about this home from the location to the details inside. Thank you for making our stay easy and comfortable!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Lovely modern, spacious home. It was pristine and a great place for my family of 7 to gather. The bathroom was well stocked with towels, soaps and shampoos. I liked that the home was in cul-de-sac. We would definitely stay there again if we went back to the area."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The airbnb was very clean, Chan had great communication, and everything was as described. My only gripe is it's a 100% airbnb house. There's no sense of this being a comforting home, it's very sterile. The main living room is lacking furniture, or anything on the wall, rubs etc so it's very loud. The best bed by far is the guest bedroom, it's the only bed with a box spring. The primary bed is larger, but is super hard."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,A perfect stay! The place was even better than pictured. We’d definitely stay here again.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Chan’s home was even better than described! Great communication throughout. It’s a brand new home with everything one needs for a very comfortable stay (especially with pets) and in a very quiet part of Eureka. Stores were close by. HIGHLY recommend!!!👍👍👍

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are visiting Eureka this is the place to stay!!
This house seemed almost too good to be true! We thought there would be a catch, but everything was as perfect as it seemed online. Chan is the most thoughtful and gracious host.
He provided us with all of the information we needed. He went above and beyond to make our week long stay comfortable and memorable.
He had excellent restaurant recommendations like Annie’s Cambodian Cuisine, which was one of our favorite parts of the trip.
There was so much to do and see in and around Eureka that coming back to this house made it so very relaxing after a long afternoon out.
Thanks Chan and Eureka, CA for an amazing week!!
We will be back!!
Kendra and family"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed in a few airbnbs over the years, this is hands down my favorite stay, ever. Pat was a wonderful host - kind and friendly, helpful and super considerate. The space was clean but also felt homey and comfortable. Pat was prepared and there were so many thoughtful things available things - that I would have never thought of but were helpful (I’m speaking to you, bananas!) My trip was a quick one, but my down time was spent at Pat’s and it was the perfect place to lay my head and unwind. I’ve already started planning my next trip out, hopefully for a longer stay! Thank you Pat, for creating a nice little home away from home!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy spot that was easy to find and clean as a whistle. Close enough to all the sights and very private and comfortable.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pat’s place is very sweet. She is a super friendly and easy host. The place is small, but has everything needed to feel quite comfortable. The weather was good, so I was able to expand onto the little patio, which was quite lovely. Pat recommended a place to eat within the neighborhood that was very good and gave me ideas about what to do nearby. She was always quick to respond when I needed something or had a question. Overall, I highly recommend her space for one person or a couple. Thank you Pat, for a wonderful stay."

The bed, linens & pillows were comfortable and warm. The space is perfect with plenty of room for 2 people - a couple, best friends or family (we were a mother & daughter traveling together).
Pat’s place has so many helpful amenities: a Keurig selection, snacks, toiletries, dishes…really anything you can think of or may forget. She even had a custom welcome sign hanging outside for us! Local recommendations, visitors info and a guest book to sign.
Pat was friendly, helpful & responsive. We cannot wait to stay there again. Highly recommend!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pat came out and welcomed me when I arrived. She had given me clear, easy instructions so I could have made my way in myself, but I appreciated her warm and personable welcome. She showed me the place which is cozy (a realtor’s word for “small”), but perfectly comfortable and furnished with everything I needed and more. The bed was comfortable, coffee was available and I lacked for nothing. I would recommend this Airbnb without reservation."

Pat could not have been any nicer, as a matter of fact, I'd have to say that she was one of the nicest Airbnb hosts I've ever encountered. Pat gives a lot of attention to ALL of the little details that make your stay with her so enjoyable, right down to the new tooth brush you'll find, among the other thoughtful offerings in her toiletries basket. All in all, Pat's studio is a definite ""find"" in Eureka! Highly recommend!"

My flights ended up getting delayed so I showed up later than I had origianlly thought. Pat was there to great me with a smile and a warm welcome. She even had a little welcome sign along the path to the door for me and a little chocolate candy on my bed. I had complete control over the temperature in my room which was awesome! I like it cold when I sleep and I never heard a peep while trying to sleep at night. There was a little patio with a beautiful setting for me to sit on in the moring and enjoy my coffee before I started my day. This is the place to stay if you ever venture this way. I will definitely be back! Thank you Pat."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pat literally came out and greeted me at the side walk and walked me back

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Pat is a great host! It’s a great place to stay for a weekend getaway in redwoods national and state parks.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our time here. It was a small, cute little find. Pat was very flexible with us as we had initially said we would arrive an hour after check-in time but ended up arriving right at check-in. Her place was spotless, felt safe and secluded. I enjoyed our stay with ample things to do in the surrounding area, and plenty of recommendations that Pat had put pamphlets of in the space.
I feel as though it was very worth the price and great to have Pat so close and responsive on messages when needed. The bed for myself (being a little bit tall) and my partner was a slightly crammed and a little worn, but we still slept quite soundly and stay very warm on the quite cold nights while we stayed. The space heater within the room really helped out and warmed us up quickly.

Eureka has many venerable Victorians, which are interesting to see. The streets are peculiarly named and arranged, so Vada’s good directions and suggestions were especially helpful, that and GPS solved the puzzles. I’m glad she provided a picture of the house, complete with arrow where to park. Even though we didn’t meet, she made me feel at home."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed in the Green Room at Vadas and really enjoyed her minimalist style and thoughtful layout. Also I liked the water craft with yummy water and coffee pot for fresh coffee in the morning. There is a boiler or furnace thing that clangs at night but didn't bother me. Also regarding Eureka in general, the edges of town are much nicer than the center. The center of Eureka they have ""let that go"" as the expression goes. The edges of Eureka like where Vada lives are nice victorians and good restaurants and (oddly enough) there are quite a few sequias and redwoods right in town to admire! Anyway if you're looking for a place to stay in Eureka, which obviously you are if you are reading this, then I recommend Vadas Green Room."

You can never be lonely when you have dogs around 😆 I had a lovely stay here and absolutely would stay again!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very well-appointed over-the-garage apartment with all of the kitchen and bath amenities. Coffee filters provided—bring your own ground coffee. Ceiling fans, windows that open, and a very adequate wall heater make it easy to control the temperature. Subscription TV that is very easy to operate with the remote. Bed is comfortable and nights are extremely quiet. Numerous windows makes the space bright and happy—along with many gorgeous houseplants. It felt very private and safe. Parking is easy and close. The apartment has been updated with obvious love and care. Owners are responsive but not hovering. The very best host notebook I have seen—with every bit of information you may need while visiting. Extremely clean!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Air B&B I've ever stayed at. Feels like home away from home. Hosts are welcoming and attentive and home is inviting and clean.

Once you enter, you’ll then realize that you have found the best AirBnb in Eureka at this price point. It was cozy and warm and felt like a home. It was immaculately clean and well provisioned with furnishings, linens and plants that really contributed to the comfortable cozy feel of their place. Loved the couch to watch TV at night, the shower was a dream, the bed and pillows very comfortable.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a nice, clean, comfortable and well-decorated place to stay. Great value as well. We stayed for a quick night so we’d be close to the hospital for an out-patient procedure very early the next morning (we live a good distance away). It was conveniently located not just to the hospital but to places to grab a late dinner as well which we ate in the full kitchen. Our stay was short but it would be a pleasant place for a longer stay so that the whole area could be explored and enjoyed."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is one of the best valued and most comfy I’ve ever stayed at! Shin and Tony have created such a perfect and welcoming space. We loved the roomy couch, the view all the way to the ocean, little gnomes thoughtfully placed everywhere, and the super cozy bed. Also admiring the gorgeous garden outside that’s clearly had so much love put into it. Thanks for everything, can’t wait to come back :)"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shin and Tony were great hosts! Their accommodations were clean, comfortable, and walkable to the downtown area. They were also easy to get a hold of and very responsive. The Airbnb is a ~40 min drive to the national park as well so you can enjoy hiking during the day and nearby bars/breweries at night. They also left a binder of things to do for us and multiple books/maps of the area, which we used to plan our activities."

2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice apartment, very pretty and clean, and a good value!
""Walking distance"" to Old Town is maybe a bit optimistic, and Eureka itself is a rather depressed city right now, with more homeless people than tourists. But hopefully that will turn around.
We enjoyed Redwood National Park."

Great kitchen with all necessities for cooking including some spices, balsamic and olive oil, coffee and tea, water filter, and ice cube tray. Cozy living room with a smart TV. Very comfortable bed. Clean bathroom with a great shower. We really could not have asked for anything more!
The property felt safe and entrance to the guest suite was very accessible. No trouble with parking during our stay. Spent time chatting with Tony who was very welcoming and friendly—he even gifted us with fresh crab that he caught himself! Their dogs are adorable as well. Highly recommend staying here, especially at such a reasonable price!
Thank you Shin and Tony!!"

The unit is a great value for the price; it’s spacious and clean with a lot of natural light and in a central location. Although I didn’t do much cooking on this trip, I especially appreciated the full kitchen. Shin and Tony were mindful of social distancing, but they were very friendly during the two brief interactions I had with them. I would definitely return in the future!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks for the last minute overnight! you are a live saver.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place in Eureka! Clean, comfortable, and well located for my trip to Eureka."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here while visiting the redwoods after my camping fell through, and I was really glad I found this place somewhat last minute. It's a mother-in-law unit, so it's not attached to the main house, which gives it a feeling of privacy. The full kitchen is a nice perk and would be great for longer stays. I loved all the plants and decor; the space felt really cozy. I briefly ran into Shin and Tony outside and they seem like very nice and friendly hosts!"

Lots of natural light in every room. Another highlight - sharp knives! The kitchen is well-stocked and a joy to cook in. It's well-designed and utilized the space very well. The bed is large, clean, and comfy. They even thought to include an air purifier.
I was able to comfortably work remotely at their dining table with great lighting and internet connectivity for video calls.
Overall a very pleasant stay with plenty of thoughtful amenities. Highly recommend staying with Shin and Tony (and their pups) if you're in the area!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay at Shony's place. Tastefully decorated with healthy plants that gave it a homey feel. Location fitted our needs. Pretty quiet at night. Good communication. Will plan to book again when going to Eureka.

The space is full of light and plants and is very well organized. There was even an air purifier. I often bring my own air purifier, pots, knives but will not need to staying here. I will ALWAYS stay here when I visit Humboldt in the future. What a score to locate this charming spot. The hosts were also very helpful and pleasant to chat with.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were invited to a wedding in Fortuna and needed a place to stay that was nearby. We’ve never stayed in a Airbnb before but due to it being Labor Day weekend all hotel rooms were sold out. Shin & Tony’s place was perfect for what we needed for the weekend. The apartment was close by to restaurants, gas and quick fast food joints. Also close to a Dutch Brother’s which was wonderful since we don’t have any in the Bay Area. The apartment was clean, well taken care of and getting into the apartment was easy through Shin’s directions which was great since we were coming in late at night and didn’t want to bother anyone checking in if we needed. That being said both Shin & Tony were available if we needed anything or had any questions. Lovely stay and they absolutely deserve the high scores they receive."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing!
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"perfect bnb for a short stay, they had everything we needed and owners were extremely helpful in all aspects of our stay.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely efficient, well kept, stocked with all the amenities you could need, a wonderfully warming and welcoming environment, every detail has purpose. I felt at ease the moment I walked through the door. Tony and Shin give meaning to super host."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very inviting, clean and comfortable place to stay. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals. The living room has a comfy sofa with a TV to watch many programs. The bedroom has a very comfortable bed to sleep in. The bathroom has an amazing shower head, with a toilet to die for. Also has a heater set up to blow warm air when getting out of the shower. The owners are very quick to respond to you're needs or questions. Was able to park our car right in front. Very quiet neighborhood which is close to everything. We have stayed at many airbnbs in Humboldt as our daughter goes to HSU, and this is definitely on the top of our list to stay again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and clean, we love everything about it ."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were delighted to meet Shin & Tony and stay at their adorable place. They've restored it beautifully.
The esthetics were wonderful. It's obvious they put considerable time and attention to detail decorating and filling the place with beautiful mid century modern furniture, sweet hand picked pieces, and a well stocked kitchen and bathroom. It was comfortable, inviting and we felt quite at home. Tony's choice of plants is lovely and ads a feeling of aliveness.
Their openness and easy accessibility were appreciated and endearing, lending itself to an intimate experience. We really enjoyed connecting.
The dogs have individual personalities and we enjoyed them too.
The full fledged vegetable garden was overflowing in greenness. It was
kind of them to offer to share it's goodness (and asian pears).
There's a nice health food store just down the street.
It's easy to stay in Eureka and visit the Redwoods. So rejuvenating. Reverence to be with beauty, more space and trees than people, and listening to wind in the trees. A deep serenity and stillness."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for walkers who love to explore. The host’s garden is lovely & serine. We travel around this orb and often use Airbnb if available… this lovely guest house is sparkling and spacious! Within driving distance, many exciting adventures to be enjoyed."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great last minute find. When I was planning our trip, I booked a hotel due to no airbnb properties being available. Upon check in at our hotel, we found it to be less than what was represented so immediately checked out and had no where to stay. We were so fortunate that Shin & Tony had a last minute cancellation. This property is perfect. The location is convenient, it was impeccably clean, host communication was quick, and offered everything needed for a pleasant stay. Thank you for hosting us."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shin and Tony’s apartment was spotlessly clean and beautifully appointed. We particularly enjoyed the plants throughout the sunlit setting and the beautiful garden setting. It seems that they have thought of everything one might need in the kitchen, bathroom, and living room and even have an umbrella available. The listing includes a guidebook for activities and dining that we found to be most helpful. What a beautiful part of California... only wish we could have stayed longer in that wonderful apartment."

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent hosts! They met us miles away to bring us our pillows:)
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect home base for exploring the Redwoods! We stayed for six days and the apartment was just right for the two of us. The kitchen is well-stocked and the fridge was large enough to hold all of our food (due to COVID we of course brought all of our meals); the gas stove and oven take time getting used to if you don't normally cook with gas, but the pots and pans were solid and dependable and easy to clean. The shower takes a bit to heat up, but since it was just the two of us we didn't run out of hot water, even when we took showers back to back. The internet is lightning fast! We spent our evenings continuing our pandemic binges, and during the week I had a few Zoom meetings and there were no problems connecting. We didn't get a chance to check out most of the local spots, because we've been very COVID-conscious, but we went to the Cafe Marina and Woodley's Bar on the marina and we felt comfortable. It was the first bar we've been to in over a year! We sat outside and kept our masks on, and the staff did an excellent job of making us feel safe. If you're looking for a cozy place to stay and relax during quarantine (and after!) look no further."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Shin and Tony are the ultimate hosts,! This was our second stay and is our favorite Airbnb so far. Tony and Shin remembered us and were very friendly and responded to any questions very quickly. Should be a 10 star rating! Thanks again and we will be back!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10 would book again
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could put ten stars on value. This was my favorite Airbnb I’ve ever been to. Maybe it was all the beautiful and happy house plants. Or the coffee beans and grinder with other basics and pukka tea. The art was pretty and interesting and I got to learn about some native plants. Everything was very clean, and I basically wanted to move in. The dogs were cute, and Shin and Tonys backyard vegetable
garden was a treat to see from the window. We brought our own wireless speaker so we were vibing out. :)
Just great energy all around. A+"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing very peaceful first time with a super host and it was perfect loved it !!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, well-appointed place to stay. The kitchen had spices and sharp knives, the shower got up to temp quickly, the wifi was great, and the vibe was very comfortable and homey (great artwork and beautiful plants!). Very responsive and friendly hosts, with clear check-in directions. Definitely will look to book here again."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved the place. super cute and clean
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed a short stay at Shin & Tony's place. The flat was really nicely furnished and decorated and the bed was very comfortable. Will be back.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean place
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was a great home base for exploring the beautiful nature around. Very good location and very clean apartment.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Chez Shony was a great place to stay - the perfect size, very cozy, comfortable and warm, and has a full kitchen complete with an electric water kettle, French press, full spice rack, cooking utensils, pots of many sizes, aluminum foil, and much more. The full kitchen made it very economical and is rare when traveling. It was also very clean. There are many nice details like the beautiful wood kitchen table and the art on the walls. We wouldn’t mind having a place like Chez Shony ourselves.
FYI the kitchen has a pocket door, so if two people are working from home, one can sit in the living room and one at the kitchen table and have some noise separation.
Shin and Tony have a very cool food garden which the place looks out on. Downtown Eureka was a short walk away, and we also biked to Sequoia park, hiked Arcata Community Forest and went to Luftenholtz beach for tidepooling 20-30 min north, all of which we recommend."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super comfortable with nice art, plants and touches. Gas stove is a major plus! Was a great weekend getaway and felt super relaxed here. Shin & Tony made the whole process real easy."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great amenities, beautiful locale, feels like home. On most of the nights, you can hear the drone of the ocean."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect small home above a garage, with a full bathroom and tub, a real kitchen stocked with the essentials, a bright living room, and a wonderful bedroom. The hosts were great and the location is extremely convenient within walking distance to Broadway stores. Very quiet and nice neighborhood. Definitely would stay here again, and because it is a mini-home, a longer stay would be quite comfortable."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a pleasure to stay with Shin and Tony. The space was comfortable, clean, quiet, thoughtfully organized and totally peaceful. Really nice people. I highly recommend!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shin and Tony's spot was a huge welcome after a couple of days camping. The kitchen has everything you'd need to have a home cooked meal (including sharp knives), and there were little details everywhere that made the space feel very comfortable. The heater in the bathroom was a nice touch, and expect plenty of light coming through the windows on sunny days. Also gnomes! Ninja gnomes, lil gnomes, shy gnomes, outdoor gnomes. They felt just as welcoming as all the vibrant house plants."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an awesome stay! Definitely down for another.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was amazing! It was super clean, well taken care of and had everything we needed! Place was provided with all the amenities you could possibly need, we got to cook and they even had all the good spices for us! It was contactless and they were always quick to respond to any questions I had over messages. I highly recommend booking this place."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Shin and Tony’s place was amazing!! I stayed four nights by myself and I felt very safe the whole time. The apartment was so very clean basically sparkling. They have plants in every room and a few gnomes around the apartment too. It made the place feel so much more homey. The towels were super soft and nice and there was a heater in the bathroom!! Shin and Tony even provided their Netflix account so you can watch tv and movies during your down time on their very comfortable couch! I loved the place and eureka and I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay. The apartment was sparkling clean, beautifully decorated with lots of thoughtful touches. There is lots of natural light and Shin makes use of that light by placing beautiful, thriving plants throughout the apartment. We felt immediately at home the moment we walked through the door. The location is perfect and In easy walking distance to down town and old town, as well as short drives to visit the beach or take a hike in the redwoods. Our host was immediately responsive and thoughtful."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place. Cute decorations and very clean. The bed wasn't that comfortable but other than that the place is amazing.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Shins place was great! It’s an apartment above the garage so it had its own private entrance. The decor was the cutest and it was super clean. The place had some thoughtful touches like labeling the light switches and having cleaning wipes and extra masks if needed. Check in was with a keypad entry which made it contactless and super convenient. I highly recommend on staying here when visiting eureka!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a really stellar little apartment! It’s in a great location, and the space itself is very nice. Given the state of the world, we spent our week stay chilling in the apartment and going out to hike in the endless nature nearby (and get takeout), and this was perfect for that. The bathroom is especially nice—a bidet and a heater so you don’t have to take a chilly shower!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect for our needs. Covid conscience... extremely clean. Bed is comfy, kitchen fully equipped. We couldn’t ask for anything more. Thank you Tony and Shin!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great accommodation if you’re visiting the redwood state and national parks. Heather was proactive and provided clear instructions for check-in and check-out.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather’s properties are the best in Humboldt. Super clean, comfortable and convenient."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean spot to take a few days to visit family. Everything you need including the coffee was a nice touch! Having a secured garage to park in was a nice bonus. Can’t state enough how nice and clean it was!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful, quiet, peaceful place. I was there for work and everything was just what I needed. I know it may seem like a minor thing to some, but there are even spices in the cupboard! 😀"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were so thrilled with everything about this stay! The location was lovely and felt very private, and unlike many airbnbs, the amenities felt truly quality and like genuine love and care were put in by the hosts. Things like: nice towels and plenty of them, great washer/dryer, great water pressure, extra trash bags: the little stuff that makes all the difference! We have stayed in several airbnbs on this trip and Heathers location and hospitality really stood out!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"A very nice place to stay! The upstairs living space feels like a well-appointed flat, great for single travelers or small groups. Downstairs you have a private garage which is very convenient. Perfect self check in/out with great host communication. I have been a guest with Heather a few times and always has been a great experience."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So this is like a one-bedroom apartment over a garage, and that 1 car garage is empty for your use and it would probably fit a large truck.fit I'm not sure if the garage is attached to the main house but I never heard anybody else. The place was clean, the bed+pillows+sheets were comfortable, the Wi-Fi was top notch, the shower had plenty of hot water, and everything worked as it should. Heather was a great host and always responsive. As noted in other reviews, the main entrance is down a short semi-paved driveway, alleyway, which could probably be easy to miss at night if it was your first time there. Overall I thought it was a great value and if I'm in Eureka again I'm going to see if it's available."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Heather's place for 3 nights and enjoyed staying there.
The place is very clean, located in the nice, quiet area. We really feel home there.
The bed is very comfortable; kitchen and bathroom equipped with everything you need.
There's enough electrical outlets for charging devices, reliable Wi-Fi and Smart-TV with streaming apps.
Heather is a great host - she replied to all my questions momentarily.
We definitely will be back.
Thank you Heather."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heathers place was great, just as advertised and exactly what we needed for our weekend trip."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything we needed and nothing we didn’t! Great place to stay while visiting relatives in the neighborhood. Nice quiet table to work on during the day, comfortable bed."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved having a garage to park our car. The apartment was spotless lots of towels, bed comfortable. As someone else mentioned, the bedroom curtains still allowed some light in from the outside lights. I only made breakfast a couple of mornings but had everything I needed to scramble some eggs.
The only thing that could be tricky is finding the alley you have to turn into to access the apartment. Fortunately we are familiar with Eureka and it was daylight. Great place."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unit is as described and shown in the pictures. Neighborhood is quiet and convenient.
Use of garage is much appreciated."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Heather’s place was perfect for my husband and I. We were visiting my sister and soon to be brother in law and everything was so close we didn’t have to drive to far for anything. Place was nice and clean. We liked that we were able to use the garage made it easy to load and unload and kept us dry when it rained. Overall we would definitely stay here again!!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay! The house was nicely decorated, spotlessly clean, comfy and quiet. Supplied with everything we needed (lots of towels!) Having a garage was a big plus. The location is such that you’ll have to drive for any shopping or to visit Old Town. The neighbors across the alley have several security lights and the curtains let some of this light through, so bring a sleep mask if you need total darkness to sleep."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was as described or better. Hosts were responsive and helpful.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed many places all over the world and the thing that stood out for us was that once we went through the front door the place felt like home, cared for. The host anticipated needs like extra linens, soap, and even some cookies and popcorn. I felt like the host maintaned the property as if they would stay there themselves."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, I really appreciated the garage and the spacious kitchen. everything was great and would definitely recommend this host and property."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to call home for a Eureka visit. Clean and comfortable. Everything you'll need to feel at home. Was great to have garage access and nice new washer and dryer to use. Clear instructions and communication. Hope to make it back some day. Thanks again!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather’s space was a whole house, enclosed garage included. The living area was upstairs. We felt very safe and well-provided for. Our two nights there were refreshing and we felt pampered. Obvious care was taken to ensure her guests have everything they could possibly need, including a washer and dryer. We were super impressed."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Heathers place was cozy and welcoming. Loved that it was closed to restaurants and that it has a garage for your car. Totally recommend if you are looking for a great place for your stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Heather and her property are both truly warm and welcoming!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather was an excellent host. Her home was perfect for our needs while visiting the Redwoods National and State parks. It was accurately described, so cute, and well provisioned. Her home was spotless and felt safe- we loved the garage parking. Eureka was a cute little town and I would definitely book one of Heather's listings in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. The small home was in a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood within walking distance to Sequoia Park. Everything was clean and new looking. Exactly as described. We hope to visit and stay here again soon. Thanks Heather!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a sudden change in our travel plans and Heather was extremely responsive and it was easy for my husband and I to secure and check in to her property that same afternoon. The apartment was very cozy and clean and there was a lot of information on things to do in the area. We especially enjoyed spending the afternoon in the nearby zoo. We would recommend the property to friends
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Valkyrie Farm. It was so peaceful and we loved our unit. The bed was super comfy and the kitchen had all the things we needed. The instructions they gave were very comprehensive and included photos, so we couldnt go wrong. I wished we had stayed for longer. We will definitely be back"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This has been my favorite place I have ever stayed with Airbnb…greatly enjoyed the space and in close vicinity of Redwood National and State Parks.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time at Valkyrie Farms! Studio is exactly as advertised. Very clean, uncluttered space. Super easy, understandable communication. Dogs are sweet and the goats are great entertainment. Feels very 'naturey' but still close enough to run into town. Ask about buying T-shirts - they're cool!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful farm and cabin. It was perfect for my wife and I. We only stayed for a night but it was perfectly comfortable and had everything we would’ve needed to stay longer if we needed to.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place very lovely vibes. Good to hang in the Freshwater valley where its quiet and very beautiful and just a few minutes from Eureka and Arcata.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved this place! It was beautiful and peaceful. The host’s were so nice and we had great conversations! I love how all of their rented out places each had a fence to provide privacy. I loved the farm animals and their dogs were so sweet! There was even a little barn cat! 10/10 perfect places to start off our California trip!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay, location is beautiful, would love to stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Honestly, I’ve never been to Cali before and I was just looking for a quiet place near the redwoods. I happened to find this place…. Wow. A cannabis farm? Super cool. So relaxing and quiet with a very pretty scenery. Was able to buy shirts from them too! Cute doggos and goats."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,LOVED this awesome little studio. It was perfect for the stay and such a chill atmosphere. Valkyrie is the only place I plan on staying when in this area. Love it
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Valkyrie was everything we wanted and more. As residents of socal it was a tranquil place to unwind. Absolutely beautiful and we most certainly plan on visiting again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful, cozy helpful, and so close to incredible hiking!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10. Planning on staying here again. Super clean. Loved how it was decorated. I would recommend that if you have trouble walking to stay at a more accessible spot on the farm but it wasn’t terribly hard to walk from the car with luggage in tow in provided wagons. However it is not wheel chair accessible. I’m not sure if the other spots are on the farm are. Lovely stay. Lifted our spirits high!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Definitely cool place to stay I couldn’t figure out to get the heater to work so my friend and I were pretty cold thru the night but other than it’s cool oh and there’s trail to the house so u have to walk thru the tall grass and our shoes and pants got soaked so I just wish the grass was cut or at least make a pathway.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great place to stay, year round!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The host was very responsive and friendly, the area felt very safe and was gorgeous. Not to mention the very inviting orange cat who greeted us immediately. Would 100% come back and stay again."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful on the farm! It was a rainy season, so prepare yourself walking through the grass to get to the studio.

2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, good spot, remote. I encourage you to go only between March and October, as their main attraction is only present then. And obviously you know the expected activity here, but even so the smell is pretty strong."

We are very introverted/private people, so the simple and contact-free check-in was super convenient. We also received ample instructions from booking to check-in and out, so we always knew what to expect and never had any issues getting in and out. It was so peaceful and private and we wished we would have had longer to spend here.
I came across the Airbnb listing a few years ago when it went ""viral"" and I saved the screenshot, knowing I wanted to visit one day. Now that it has happened, we were even more impressed than we anticipated. I can't rate highly enough!"

It was easy to get to, secure yet serene. The goats and cool ass cat are also a welcome and great bonus as animal lovers.
The property was extremely walkable with plenty of sights to see. Our hot tub was a magical experience under the stars and we Highly recommend utilizing it.
Overall, Amazing experience, would recommend, and will definitely be back!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michaela’s place was fabulous! Private and peaceful, the house had everything you could need and super easy to find. We had a great stay and enjoyed the surrounding area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was so beautiful and peaceful. Loved all the beautiful flowers. The goats. Everyone was so kind. The studio we stayed in was spotlessly cleaned and super comfortable. Will definitely book another stay at this place.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay at the studio was super comfortable and Michaela provided us with plenty of instructions to get in and find it! Beautiful farm and we loved saying hi to the goats :)
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Valkyrie Farm. Everything was nothing short of their description of the Airbnb and the amenities were perfect. I’ll definitely stay here again if I travel to Eureka again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful. Quiet. Beautiful. Relaxing. Clean. AHhh-mazing!! It had never occurred to me to stay at a marijuana farm because I don’t imbibe, but this place popped up on my feed and I thought ‘what the heck?’ It was utterly amazing and I can’t wait to go back!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely fantastic time here. I could easily say this was one of the loveliest and most 'well-worth it' Airbnbs we've ever been to.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful and unique airbnb to stay at if you are in the Eureka area. You definitely need a car to get around but that was no problem for us because we rented a car to drive up to Redwood National and State Parks anyway (~1hr drive north). The surrounding land for this airbnb was very pleasant and it was nice to see the goats and dogs and cat =) Even though the studio is on a property shared with other inhabitants (another airbnb and the hosts' residence), it still felt like we had a private space and didn't have to worry about being ""bothered"" by anyone else there. I wish we were able to get a tour but we had plenty to do in Eureka and up at the redwood forests, and otherwise we just spent the time relaxing in the outdoor chairs or watching TV in the studio. The town of Eureka is a 10-15min drive away but there were lots of restaurants and grocery stores in there, which was convenient. Definitely would recommend this spot as a home-base if you are going to be in Northern California!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is wonderful!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Had an amazing trip to Valkyrie Farm in Eureka! Magical property...seriously!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Relaxing stay overall, the bed was just not the most comfortable! But other than that, it was worth the price and views. Loved the free samples as well, thank you for letting us stay and experience Humboldt county!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The farm was amazing. The studio was absolutely spotless and well equipped to cook and enjoy our weekend. We loved the outdoor tub and peaceful ambiance of the location. It is also a quick drive to the lovely sights of Eureka like the Lost Coast brewery and Los Bagels downtown. There was even a friendly cat that came over to hang out with us. An absolutely wonderful and romantic getaway for us. We would highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I cannot rave enough about this place!!! AFREAKINGMAZING. We found this gem super last minute while driving down the Oregon/Cali Coast on a 10 day road trip. We were thrilled to find it available and the reservation to be accepted. The samples.... OMGGGG. 2 good rips of the GushMintz and we were WRECKED. The piece de resistance was the private stocktank tub & fireplace. The PERRRRFECT way to unwind after a 10 hour drive: the warm water, a crackling fire and some goooood weed = HEAVEN!!! THANK YOU for having us!! We hope to be back in the future!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved the place and the animals! no complaints.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An excellent spot! Home based here for our hikes up north in the redwoods and it worked perfectly. Not far from the beach also. Very private and secure. Really comfortable and enjoyed the entire vibe!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The peaceful atmosphere. The beaches all around were amazing. The samples were perfection!!!!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a treat, to walk around a cannabis farm and see all the plants. Loved the goats too and of course the free samples hit the spot."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely weekend getaway for my partner and I. We came across some bumps in the road at the beginning of our stay, but Michaela was responsive and very communicative!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This looks lace is a little slice of heaven in a chaotic world! We loved the place, loved the animals, loved the beauty of it all! Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay at the farm studio was great! Easy to find our way there and were greeted by the cute goats on our walk in. It was comfortable and a good experience. The soaking tub was super relaxing. We enjoyed some of the samples provided during our hot soak on a cool night. It was just the relaxing atmosphere we were looking for. On our way out the orange cat walked us to our car. Would stay again and recommend this place to others!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is a very unique place to stay. A great jumping off point to go north and south to see the thrilling coastal rocky shore and inland to see the giant trees. Michaela and Jonathan are very nice and helpful.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michaela’s place was wonderful. We found this while looking for a place to stay while we visited the Redwoods. Easy check-in, quiet, and just great all around. Bed was comfortable, studio was clean, sample product was amazing.the instructions were all very clear on how to get there too.
The outdoor tub was fun to use as well, and very relaxing. We also got welcomed by Rat the cat every time we came back at the end of the day. He was very sweet and cute. He reminded us a lot of our own orange kitty at home. Would definitely recommend, and would stay here again when we visit the place where we got engaged. :)"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,best stay ever
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cozy little get away! It was peaceful, beautiful area, and well worth the price. We would love to come back to this place again to decompress!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thanks for hosting! Beautiful farm, need to stay a little longer next time around."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,awesome stay!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing! Will certainly be back to utilize the soaking tub and hopefully take a tour. Short stay for only 1 night but it was the perfect place to stay and enjoy the complimentary goodies. Highly recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved Michaela’s place and the farm tour. Will definitely recommend this place.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What can I say to accurately describe the stay at Micheala's airbnb? Mark. It was serene, it was private, it was comfortable, it was breathtaking and just what we wanted to celebrate our 10-year anniversary. We loved everything about our stay and Emilio was the perfect tour guide. Hoping to stay longer in the future! Thanks for an amazing vacation."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My only complaint is that I wish I had stayed longer!! This is well worth a whole weekend, can’t wait to come back :)"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Having visited a couple of cannabis farms in the area, Michaela's place stood out as the first solid structure I had stayed in for a week rather than a tent!
The check-in instructions were extremely clear and easy to follow. I was helpfully accommodated on a farm tour the morning of my arrival day but long before check-in, which was great help. The tour was very informative and Emilio quite a character!
When I did check in the place was clean, the welcome gifts much appreciated and of great quality, the bed was comfortable and the decor and literature around the cabin fascinating.
I would not hesitate to return, preferably with my family.
Please support these invaluable local farmers' businesses!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing experience at michaela’s air bnb. So peaceful and very clean, the extra goodies and hot tub was the perfect touch! Would definitely stay here again"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michaela's place is truly magical. It's the perfect getaway spot for anyone looking for peace, relaxation, and learning about some really good local herb. We received a wonderful tour of the farm and our tour guide was super hilarious, friendly, and clearly passionate about what he does. The Studio House is cozy, has all of the necessary amenities to cook a fine meal, and the hot tub is amazing!
My favorite part was listening to the tree frogs at night and waking up to peaceful misty mornings.
I definitely recommend this place!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful, responsive host- unique cool experience!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here! Peaceful and relaxing. Everything was just as described. This was a great space for us to rest from a week of traveling the Lost Coast before headed back down to San Francisco and flying back to Tennessee. We enjoyed the complimentary treats and the tour the morning we checked out.If back in the area would definitely stay again! Thank you for sharing your space with us. 🖤🖤

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed here for his 55th birthday. What a cool get away and completely relaxing time. Explored all day and came back to our amazing treats left for us and just enjoyed ourselves!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, serene studio. LOVED this place. :)"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was nice, the weather couldn’t be controlled and it rained a lot, so having to walk through the muddy area of grass was tough. We loved visiting the area. And staying on the farm."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a unique place to stay with fun activities within driving distance! Highly recommend.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My favorite place when in Humboldt. Clean, comfy, convenient to town, excellent samples, stocked kitchen, and just a darn good place to stay. Michaela is awesome. Would recommend to anyone looking for quiet and peaceful accommodations, but close to town and the beaches. Ten minutes or so to Arcata and the University. Def would stay again the next time I'm in town."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Second stay...snow during night... really peaceful
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you Michaela for hosting my husband and I during our stay in Eureka. Close by to all the sights and Redwood National Park. Enjoyed the farm animals views and also the friendly ginger cat. Cozy stay, enjoyed the farm atmosphere."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay in Eureka! Studio is an amazing space and has plenty of room for 2-3 people. The treats were definitely a plus! Not far at all from the main town and really close to a lot of gems. Would definitely stay here again!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Serene surroundings and fresh air were a big plus. We enjoyed our getaway thoroughly and appreciated the complementary goodies.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the place was super clean. the samples left were more than generous and were very good quality. the property was adorable, even during the off season. I'd love to come back when the tours are going on! but even without it, comfy, cozy, and an amazing place to do some stargazing"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"3rd trip to Michaela’s this year and I already can’t wait to come back! I love this place! It’s so cozy and convenient. A great base to explore the area. The samples were great as always. Very clean and stocked with everything you could need. Stay here, it’s just a great place!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful getaway in beautiful humboldt county.
I would recommend bringing an extra towel if you are going to be using the tub!
The bed was very comfortable and the heater worked great! So cozy."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cozy place. Excellent hosts."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredible stay on this beautiful farm. Amazing value.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect stop on our honeymoon. It was a great experience that we are planning on doing again!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is great quiet and great location
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,lovely studio but off season for the farm so nothing to see. nice hosts.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,perfect
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved the stay! The samples were amazing and I loved just sitting out on the porch and taking in the peaceful sight. Thank you!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the perfect stay. We will definitely be staying here again in the future.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just came back from our second stay here. This place is a relaxing retreat where you can unplug and get away from it all. It is very comfortable and private. The gifts left by the host are beyond generous! I slept like a baby! Everything is clean and disinfected. The host is very responsive and helpful. The location is hard to beat! Lots of great food nearby. Check in and out is very easy. I honestly can’t wait to come back to this little oasis. Book this as soon as possible, you will not regret it."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect get away, we absolutely loved our stay."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I definitely would Rebrook this room again. It was very clean and organized. I enjoy the location. And the setting was very pleasant. We felt very safe we were behind a gate which made it felt like a secure compound.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Book this now
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome. You can’t beat the privacy, the atmosphere, and the weed is great too!! Super cozy stay, they had everything we needed to be comfortable."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The house is very suitable for a short stay.
The path, from the parking to the cabin, is really a bit too long and completely unlit at night.
It leads in the middle of a sloping slope, with a meadow. Is not well solved, neither to transport the luggage, nor to come back to the cabin at night, accident-free. The outdoor lighting in the cabin is also too dark. You can't see enough or sit outside. It's just too dark. The other buildings on the farm have significantly better outdoor lighting and safe paths.
Unfortunately, there were no animals on site, the enclosures were empty and abandoned.
The hosts are very kind and you can always find a point of contact. Overall nice, for a weekend."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely setting and a perfect retreat for solo/couple travelers or a small group. The studio is very comfortable and has all the essentials. It’d be easy to spend a couple days just chilling here if you bring in your groceries, or use this as a base to visit Eureka or for day trips around the region. I briefly met the host, but this is still a farm so there’s always work to be done. The tour is nice too, really neat to learn a bit about the region and this farm’s operation. It may be one of the more unique stays I’ve had given the setting, but the hospitality is all here. Don’t miss it!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay!! It was everything it says to be! Highly Recommend ♥️
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing stay. It was all perfect. The studio was extremely comfortable, nice decor, kitchen and bath had everything we needed, the outdoor tub and fireplace was a nice touch. Oh and the complimentary samples were awesome! We will definitely be booking again in the future.
One small suggestion would be a fire pit by the sitting area. That would make this a 6 star out of 5 star rating 😊"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful little farm, in a beautiful quiet area!! Michaela is an amazing host! I must say the bed was extremely comfortable after exploring and smoking all day! we will definitely be back and actually can't wait! Thank you for opening your farm to us all to be able to explore and experience all it's beauty and hard work ❤️"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,From the moment I booked this place I was beyond excited! I told all my friends and really had the highest of expectations. I will say that it did not disappoint at all! Definitely exceeded any expectations that I could’ve had and this is something that I will do every year for the rest of my life! Such a cool experience with excellent hosts! Definitely check out Karobi stables for horseback riding! And the soaking tub is a real pleasure morning and night!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a wonderful weekend in the Studio! We had everything we needed and more (thanks to some complimentary cannabis samples). We appreciated being in such a scenic location within a short driving distance to/from both Eureka and Arcata. The 3 Corners Market just down the road came in handy (we picked up some locally made ravioli for dinner from there one night). I’d definitely recommend making use of the outdoor tub! It’s awesome at sunset! We hope to be back!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Location was close to Redwood NP. The farm tour was very interesting. Communication was great.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nothing but great things to say about this stay. Very charming space in the most quiet lush location. The weed is great and the host is the most helpful. You can even get a tour... you must try the hot tub at night. We loved it here!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,super chill place quite jn the woods with weed doesn't really get much better
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the most outstanding AirBnB I have ever stayed at. The environment, the decor and the well-cared-for living space came together perfectly. Very clean, good lighting, west facing porch, just a great spot. Surrounded by so much GREEN and life was sublime."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here! Stoners dream for sure, they give you a ton of samples and you’re really in the middle of the weed farm. Hosts were super responsive and sweet, and everything was extremely clean! I felt very comfortable smoking out of the pieces there and they also provide you with rolling papers. I prefer firmer beds so had a bit of a hard time with my back on the bed provided especially after a weekend of hiking, but my little sister loved the bed so could just be me lol. The patio areas also directly face the open space of the other units but we didn’t mind at all. Will definitely stay here again next time we’re up north :) thank you!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place, so unique and so fun 🥰"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A nice chill time on the farm. Lots of Stoner culture permeating the whole experience, including food in the fridge and pantry you'd expect for midnight munchies. The samples were generous and ”high” quality. Will certainly be back if I'm ever in the area again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Do yourself a solid and just book it. Peaceful, clean, generous and GOOD samples, sweet outdoor soak tub, and I seriously made friends with the goat.
bed is very comfy, stocked kitchen, etc.. Michaela is amazing and very accommodating. Would definitely book again in the future. I would give a ten star rating but air bnb stops me at five."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"An absolutely amazing stay, it was the best part of my trip. I highly recommend taking the farm tour. I will definitely stay again if I'm ever in the area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great place to stay, will definitely be coming back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a great place to stay. Very peaceful and beautiful. The free samples were great and the tour of the farm was fun. I definitely would stay here again if I am in the area.
Also loved meeting the goat and chicken as well as the beautiful Argentinian dogo. If you are a marijuana enthusiast don’t miss out on this place. Such a cool experience!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to take a step back and slow down, this is the place! Clean, beautiful and peaceful!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love it here!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic! The cabin was super cute and the bed was comfortable. I liked being located between eureka and arcata, not far from food, beaches and redwoods. They also provided a binder with many great recommendations of the area. 10/10 would stay again"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an awesome place to stay. This was such a fun place to take my marijuana loving husband! But is was equally great for me too, and I don't consume. All directions and suggestions were perfect and very helpful. The whole time we were there we kept thinking ""We're definitely coming back here again!"" So until next time..."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful property! My daughter and I had a great time.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was perfect. Greta the goat and her chickens were super friendly! So glad we stayed here as Michaela had the perfect hiking and food recommendations. Redwood Park was only 15 minutes away and we ate at Salt House Fish afterwards. Thank you!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely a dream experience! Just as heavenly as other reviewers have noted. Easy check in, stunning surroundings, a do NOT miss tour, comfortable and exceptionally clean. She is a warm and welcoming host - allows you to enjoy your privacy and very responsive to questions via text.
Michaela’s place is too good to be true. Treat yourself and GO!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beauty! If you are looking for a place to disconnect and enjoy the beauty of Eureka while relaxing and smoking weed this is the place for you! Everything that you see on the photos is what you should expect if not more! Michaela was very nice and instantly messages back with any questions you may have and Emilio the tour guide was very informative and was such a great laugh. I’ll definitely be coming back and telling others about this place.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great place in a great location.
Redwoods within view and nestled away out of the city but still really close by everything. The farm has such a peaceful vibe even without the Cannabis. Comfortable and Relaxing."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Haven’t seen such a beautiful star sky in a long time! Room was very clean.
2022-06-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"There are multiple air bnbs on this property, you are able to see the other guests. The shampoo, conditioner and shower gel are large used bottles not personal. The bed is hard and the pillows are flat."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow... just wow! I'll by saying everything is advertised. The farm is beautiful and everything easy to find. The studio is extremely clean, with a comfy bed and great decoration. Everything was simply amazing especially their products!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best sleep I’ve gotten in 8 long months. A true respite for my body, mind, and spirit. We will be back!!!! Thank you 🙏🏼"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely fantastic stay. We loved everything about it. The studio was very clean, well set up, and had everything exactly as described. The studio and the farm itself was beautiful to say the least. We used it as a homebase for exploring Redwood National Park. The samples were a great added bonus as well. Only thing we wish is we would have had time for the full tour. I reccomend this place to anyone staying in the area who is looking for a tranquil and relaxing setting with the added bonus of a working farm. Loved it all! Please do yourself a favor and book this place or one of their other 3 locations on the same farm. Till next time! Thank you!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was one of my favorite Airbnb’s. I felt such an essence of peace and although we didnt meet the owners I felt a sense of community. The property is beautiful and everything is perfect! There needs to be more Airbnb’s like this. We will be back
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay for a weekend get away w/ my husband. Pretty close to town w/ everything we needed. Generous samples and was awesome to have a place to smoke & relax at the end of night.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place, been here twice, and will likely come back again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location to be able to explore the area. studio was clean and stocked with supplies needed. the free samples were a perfect touch!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay on a sweet farm in a heavenly area.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,🔥
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would stay here again and again and again. Literally nothing to complain about. Airbnb was on a beautiful farm and you definitely felt secluded even though everything you need in town is easily accessible. The samples were all we needed and tasted amazing. They did a tour of the farm and I can’t even tell you what an experience it was. They are very informative and I can tell they love what they do. Thanks for being an amazing host.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay here.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,best stay ever
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time here. Two days in April there was a lot of rain and fog and we enjoyed every bit of it! Beautiful property, great space, nice hosts and pets. We will definitely recommend this little gem and hope to return."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely nice getaway…

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful property!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful place to stay in a very central location in the emerald triangle. Michalea & Jonathan were excellent hosts and the company of Rat the Cat and Greta the Goat as well as her chicken roomates gave us the exact expirience we were hoping for out of staying on a farm. We went before grow season had started but Jonathan was so kind in accommodating a tour of the farm for us anyway and it was a great tour he was happy to answer all of our questions and let us take pictures it was everything! The trek from the car the actual studio was our least favourite part but it was worth it to get to see Greta the goat each time we walked by.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable place. Kitchen has everything you need for a nice weekend stay

We had to check in super late but we let Andrew know ahead of time and he made sure we knew where to park and how to get in. It was very easy and straight forward. The home itself is cozy, peaceful, and has all the things you’d need for short or longer stays. Even though the house is right on a main road, it was quiet and had a sweet small-town vibe."

The linens provided were super nice and I suspect took some time to find. The neighborhood is great and if you are younger, I am 83, you can easily walk to Old Town. The Old town center is about 1st and F st.
Andrew went the extra mile to make this a great stay and a repeat one for me, my next time though Eureka."

The house had everything you would need (and more!) to have a comfortable stay. We especially enjoyed the easy check out instructions and how well set up the kitchen is."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Instantly felt at home. This spot was clean and had more than what I needed. What stood out were the small details: extra toothbrush/toothpaste, coffee pods with creamer, brita, soft towels, and luggage racks to name a few. Finding the location was a bit tricky in the dark with the one way streets, but shouldn’t be an issue during the day. There were some restaurants within a 15 min walk but with how dark the neighboring streets were it was better to drive. Andrew was friendly and proactive in his communication. Overall great place and I enjoyed my stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,very clean and cozy place to spend the night.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a very cool place with mid-century modern touches. The bed and couch are comfy, the kitchen clean, but our favorite thing is the flat screen tv concealed in the living room furniture. At first it seemed like a busy street, but even though I’m an early-to-bed kinda guy, there were no issues, the traffic quieted down and I slept very well here."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I just spent three nights at Andrew’s place and really enjoyed our stay in his cozy guest cottage. It’s exactly as it appears in photos, spotlessly clean, and comfortable, with a well equipped kitchen, spacious shower, plenty of thick high-quality towels, and an excellent bed. Andrew has provided additional thoughtful touches like toothbrushes and toothpaste for those who might have forgotten theirs and a fleece throw for relaxing on the sofa. The property is in a quiet residential neighborhood that’s about a 15-minute walk from the Old Town district packed with restaurants and stores, and in general, we found we could get wherever we were going in Eureka within a few minutes drive time. Communication was great; Andrew is very friendly, responded promptly to inquiries and offered his help if needed on a few occasions. We would not hesitate to stay with him again if we return to the North Coast area in the future"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay and the place had everything we needed. It was cozy and clean. Loved the big bed and the tv, the shower was awesome, and the heat pump was a great feature. It was a bit awkward for us to find in the dark because our map app gave us weird instructions due to the one way streets, and the street was a little busy around rush hour, but it wasn't a big deal. We really enjoyed our stay, thanks Andrew!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Andrew was very nice! He really wants you to feel like you are in a home away from
home- he had coffee pods, cream and sugar. Plenty of pods for the washer . If you forgot your toothbrush and paste he had it for you! It was and is a great place for two people to stay! Andrew was also very responsive to his guests needs. We have family there so didn’t need much from him, but he was there to offer places to see and eat, etc. Will stay there again!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have had the pleasure of staying at several different places in the area due to working out of town. This place sets the standard for how I a place you are staying at should be set up!!!! The home was immaculately clean in every aspect!!! The bed was so comfortable. I slept like a baby.!!! I cannot say enough good about this place. If you have the chance to go and stay there, do it, you could pick a better choice in my opinion. Thanks again to the hosts they were excellent! I will absolutely stay again if I have the opportunity and definitely recommend it!!"

The space was small, but incredibly clean and comfortable, making me feel right at home. I especially loved the great selection of K-cups for coffee enthusiasts like myself. The retractable flat screen with streaming options was a nice touch, too!
Andrew went above and beyond by providing thoughtful extras such as zip lock bags, laundry pods, a loofah, and a range of toiletries, including a toothbrush, toothpaste, and Q-tips. I also slept great during my stay, as the bed was comfortable and provided a peaceful night's rest.

The AC units worked great, the bed was comfortable, everything was really perfect. Can’t wait to be a returning guest.

There when you climb the suspended bridges, you realize the mighty height of the Redwoods. Not far from Heather's house. We enjoyed the place every day during our 4 days trip. Located between Humboldt Redwoods Park and Redwoods State and National Park. We also visited some fabulous farms in the area for eggs and fresh milk. We liked Blue Blossom farm. At night we enjoyed our sleep. The area is quiet and the neighbors respectful."

The backyard is fenced in & there is a small deck, with outdoor seating & a grill. This is a great house, for a family with children or a group of friends or for business travelers. The house is close to Hwy 101, if you are driving North or South, to explore the Redwoods or just visiting the general area. The neighborhood felt safe, & there is also plenty of shopping nearby. Most importantly, the host is very kind & proactive, to ensure your stay is relaxing & enjoyable."

Turns out everything was great. All communication was done via e-mail. Our host was always responsive and very accommodating. We had a last-minute change which she handled perfectly.
When we arrived, the place looked brand new. The house was definitely just remodeled and was very inviting. The key was in a lock box just like was described. Once we walked in the front door, we noticed everything was brand new. All new flooring, doors, windows, moldings, fresh paint, cabinets, furniture, and appliances. The bathrooms were also remodeled and spotless! Everything we needed was supplied. The kitchen was stocked with silverware, pots, pans, mixing bowels utensils. All of it. We needed nothing! There were plenty of towels and toiletries in the bathrooms. They also have two washers and two dryers.
To sum our stay up, everything was great! Based on this experience, we will definitely try and Airbnb again!"

Heather was a great host and very easy to communicate with."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent a few days in Humboldt horseback riding through the redwoods, fishing, canoeing, hiking, beaching, shopping, and visiting the zoo. It's a great place to come home to at the end of the day. The home is warm, newly renovated, and very clean. We even picked up some of the decor that we liked. We had everything we needed including two sets of washers/dryers to wash all our clothes before we came home. There was plenty of space and it felt like we were at home. Heather was great communicating and everything went really smooth. We would definitely come back. We even got a visit from one of the neighbors who gave us some good pointers on things to do and visit on our drive home."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great accommodation for 1 or more. Kristine thought of everything. It was like visiting your friend who prepared in advance. There was wine, water, food, snacks - even gluten & lactose free options. She provided a guide for attractions in the surrounding areas and travel time. This in centrally located to a LOT.
The furnishings, decorations and personal touches were fantastic. I loved the bed, especially the sheets. I had to check the label to see where she bought them. I bought a set before I came home.
I'd love to come back with my daughters, son or a friend.
I highly recommend this AIRBNB.
Thank you for having me"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay. Kristine is a great communicator. Rental is cute and she thought of all the details. We wanted for nothing.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Kristine's place. It is clean and homey, and we can tell Kristine put a lot of effort into making it comfortable for the guests. We also enjoyed the grill in the backyard with the beautiful redwood scenery. Kristine is also super friendly and responsive. She took the time to greet us upon our arrival and recommended scenic drives and trials in the area. We would definitely stay with her again when we are back in the area."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredible stay! Kristine made us feel at home and at ease from the get-go. Everything was carefully prepared, and her space had everything you would want! It was clean, very nicely decorated, and fully stocked. She went to great lengths to guys to create a local guidebook with recommendations and she was spot on! The easiest 5 stars I could give. I’ve stayed at plenty of other BnBs with family and friends but this one was the BEST!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristine was very thoughtful and kind in her messages. Her place is so sweet and with the most peaceful, beautiful views of the redwoods. It was clean, comfortable, and exactly like the pictures. We loved staying at her location and hope to do it again in the future!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cozy place. We were welcomed with lots snacks, a bottle of wine. Really did a great job of making this place cozy. We hiked the trail just right outside the house. We loved the SUPER comfy bed after a long day of hiking and exploring. A little cold but nothing the heater couldn't fix. The hosts were responsive and accommodating!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very pleasant stopover at Kristine's, everything was great. We found the grill, terrace, sensationally equipped kitchen to be particularly cool. We can highly recommend the accommodation."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best Place Around
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristine is such a kind soul! Her forrest suite made my first visit to the redwoods and my birthday extra special. Her guidebook was also so helpful! I will be missing the redwoods and would 100% plan another trip here! It was truly magical. Thank you so much Kristine! 🙏
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristine was honestly the best air bnb host I have ever experienced. She was extremely helpful with making my trip as special as possible for my boyfriend’s surprise birthday. Location to everything was perfect distance. She provided us a booklet of things to do, hikes, and top places to eat around the area. She welcomed us with a bottle of wine and snacks and was extremely responsive to any questions we had. The forest suite was extremely cute and cozy. I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to get a quick escape. It’s quiet and peaceful with breathtaking views."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful property- very quiet, which was exactly what we were looking for. The apartment was very clean and nicely decorated. There was a nice selection of complimentary snacks, beverages and easy meals, which was a nice surprise. The ceiling is a little low, so it’s probably not a good fit for someone who is really tall. The hosts were super friendly and we would totally stay here again if we come back to the area to visit."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the Forest Suite! I enjoyed returning there at the end of the day and I wanted to stay longer.
First off, Kristine greeted us when we arrived and gave us some additional tips for 'must sees' in the area. There were many nice touches in the suite, starting with it smelled good! The space is well laid out with the lounging space with a view of the back yard and trees, the well stocked kitchen and large bedroom and bathroom. The bed was comfortable with nice bedding. There were candles, throw blankets, food essentials and snacks, and books and games. The Forest Suite was so cozy! We had morning coffee on the deck, soaking in the country-like neighborhood. I would 100% come back to stay and 100% recommend this place to family, friends, and basically anyone visiting the Eureka/Arcata area. It would be an excellent option for visiting parents of Cal Poly Humboldt students or anyone staying for a little bit in the area. Thank you for creating this amazing space."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kristine was a great host! She welcomed me once I arrived and informed me on a variety of things to do around the area. She also sent me a very detailed guide book on different restaurants, hiking trails, and attractions in the area. The guest house was amazinggg and super peaceful! Perfect for 1-2 guests. The aesthetic and decorations were so cute. The living room area was super cozy, and she even had little snacks in the kitchen. I will definitely be back! :)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristine and Sibbi were friendly, considerate, responsive, and accommodating. Their airbnb was thoughtfully arranged and decorated, very clean, with nice touches like snacks and drinks, a deep tub, written materials on local highlights, and a fun game we enjoyed playing. The area is beautiful, surrounded by redwood trees. A peaceful spot away from town, which is just a quick drive away. :)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend staying here, Kristine was a wonderful host. Very attentive and considerate, the forest suite definitely exceeded our expectations. Would stay here again, great hospitality thank you for having us."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was a great accommodation , had everything you need for a relaxing stay"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is one of the best Airbnb I have stayed in. Kristine was very responsive and also a very caring host. We were getting late due to heavy rain on the way. Kristine offered to help by looking at the routes that might be clear to reach. The place is beautiful and the hosts have made sure you have every comfort possible during your stay. They also kept a bottle of wine, chocolates and a lot of snacks. I had the best nights sleep before heading out to explore the redwoods. I would come back again and next time for a longer stay possible."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Phots do not do this little place justice. Kristine’s & Sippy’s in-law is immaculate and very thoughtfully set up. My husband and I very much enjoyed our stay and we were able to enjoy a glass of wine with a gorgeous backyard view after putting our baby to bed. We would definitely stay here again.
Thank you Kristine & Sippy!
Best,
Natalie"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The location was stunning. Gazing out at the giant redwood forest was a one of a kind experience! And the apartment was one of the most well thought out airbnbs we’ve ever encountered.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If Love and Light was a person it would be Kristine. 💕
I checked in at 10pm and she and Sibbi waited up for me! I was driving up from San Fran and they kept tabs on me. 🌸
The place was magic. It was detail on top of detail. 💫
There was a wonderful surprise in every corner of the apartment you looked. 💖
There was wine, high quality organic food and a deer who came visit daily. 🦌
I meditated daily in the redwoods on the property. 🧘🏾‍♀️
It was a rebirth. 🧚🏾‍♀️
I felt, loved, cared for safe and secure.
These are excellent examples of human beings and I am grateful our paths crossed. 🦄
Thank you for everything Kristine & Sibbi.
1 Love🕊️"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent 2 nights at the Redwood Forest Suite, as we were traveling through California and seeing some family. The space was very clean and decorated beautifully. It was one of the most well-appointed places we have ever stayed at. Kristine and Sibbi were wonderful hosts. They were friendly and attentive but allowed us our privacy. We definitely recommend this spot!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is just lovely. Kind, helpful, responsive hosts; beautiful surroundings-- redwoods in neighborhood and gardens off the back patio; special touches throughout the space-- eucalyptus scent when we walked in, a cold bottle of wine just taken out of the fridge, snacks and coffee/tea and some basic foodstuffs for dinner and breakfast; cozy linens on the beds; brochures and books about the area. One of the best airb&bs I've ever stayed in. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a quiet and beautiful spot for relaxing and enjoying nature The redwoods are so close and also hummingbirds in the flowers beside the deck. The space inside is as lovely as outside. Beautiful decor and a well stocked kitchen made out stay even better

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place!! So quiet and peaceful yet close drive to everything. We saw deer one morning. Space was larger than expected, had everything we needed, and very clean.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was nice and quiet.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Kristine's place in Eureka, California on a quick weekend getaway to celebrate our 3rd wedding anniversary. The place was perfect! It was in a safe and secluded part of town, but close enough to everything to be convenient. We would highly recommend it!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful surroundings, and a very tastefully decorated place. Kristine left a lot of thoughtful touches like coffee and snacks. Bed was very comfortable, and the backyard was amazing. Easily accessible from Redwoods NP. Highly recommend for anyone travelling through the area!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"They made us feel very welcome when we arrived. And in addition to the many provided amenities, and the beautiful views, the hosts were so friendly, helpful, kind, and had amazing communication! They provided the perfect balance between being available and letting us do our own thing. The space was so neat and creativly designed, and the shower was spacious. We will definitely stay here again!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It isn't often I book with airbnb, but I'm very glad I did for my trip to Eureka. Kristine and her husband were very welcoming and kind. They have a beautiful home! Upon arrival, we were greeted and given a tour of the premises, which was wonderful! Prior to our visit, I had mentioned the trip was for my partners birthday, and they were kind enough to gift her champagne. I couldn't recommend anywhere else to stay. If you're coming to Eureka, this is where you want to stay. When I come back I definitely hope to stay here again"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful vacation, Kristine was very kind, helpful, and generous"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kristine’s place was phenomenal!! Absolutely beautiful home and property. Peaceful backyard with beautiful views of the redwoods….we were even greeted by a deer as we enjoyed the sunset on the back patio! Kristine went above and beyond to be accommodating to my ever changing schedule- allowing me to cancel and rebook with a days notice. In addition to the outdoor beauty- the home was wonderfully equipped, clean and cozy with the best provided snacks!! When we overcooked our dinner after a full day of driving, we were so grateful to find a box of pasta and sauce provided for us that saved us another trip to the store. Kristine even left us a bottle of wine, and allowed us the pleasure of picking our own apples and blueberries in the backyard…YUM! I have stayed in several air bnbs and this was by far my best experience. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend this to everyone. Wish we could have stayed longer. Thank you Kristine!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful! The place was clean, well kept, and Kristine was extremely responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay again 😊"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this space. The hosts were very friendly and gave us a warm welcome. The pictures do not capture how comfortable and clean this place is. As a guest we have access to trails and forest if that’s your thing. We could have spent many days at this serene space. The modern chic esthetic makes you feel right at home. We were also very pleased with how fully equipped the small kitchen is. We had everything we needed and then some. Definitely a memorable stay and hope to be back on our next trip to Northern California
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We especially loved the quiet, rural setting of Kristine's Airbnb. It has a lovely back deck and access to hiking trails. The unit was spacious, it still left us space to store our own items, we loved that. The kitchenette was very well equipped, easy to do some simple cooking."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy's house is on the edge of a ravine filled with redwoods and other huge trees, and the back deck is right in the midst of them. It's in a lovely part of Eureka and was very quiet and peaceful. We greatly appreciated that the refrigerator was stocked with breakfast items. Everything about our stay was perfect. We would definitely stay here again when in Eureka."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a magical stay. Don’t sleep on Amy’s wonderful place in the redwoods in town. Convenient home base for exploring the parks. The spirit of the redwoods is in this house. Thanks Amy!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay. Only thing I’d note is that the beds have footboards and are quite short. So if you are tall (I’m 6’ 4”) you may have a hard time fitting on the beds.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Amy’s place was amazing to stay at. It’s located in a beautiful area, right on the edge of Eureka. With woods right outside the living room, it offers privacy and peace. The place was impeccably clean, showing Amy’s attention to detail. It has all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. Moreover, the design and furniture give it a museum-of-design-like ambiance. I highly recommend staying at Amy’s place; it offers everything you need at a very attractive price!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,My mother and I felt right at home from the moment we checked in. Great location in a quiet neighborhood. The house was clean and well kept. Beautiful views of the forest and wonderful artwork! Amy was very accommodating and responsive. We’d love to return in the future!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Amy’s place!
The neighborhood was incredibly quiet and peaceful and the backyard was beautiful.
Just the right amenities in the space as well. We never wanted for anything. We would stay here again if in town!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay. This is a beautiful, spacious home that looks out on a redwood forest. At the same time, it's only a few minutes drive from restaurants, stores, and anything you'd want in a small city. We have a lot to do whenever we're in town, but I told my daughter that I'd like to return there and have a day just for sitting on the porch or looking out the windows. It's that kind of place."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place to spend Thanksgiving and the weekend! The kitchen was fully equipped for us to prepare breakfasts and dinner. Great restaurants nearby, too - Brick & Fire, Sea Grill, Tuyas in Ferndale. We ran out of time before we ran out of things to do in the area. The house was cozy, with individual heaters for each room, the beds were comfortable, the cupboards and refrigerator were stocked with all the basics and then some, the Tree Room was as incredible as it looks. The back deck was a beautiful spot for my morning coffee. Beautiful and peaceful, a perfect place to come home to after our out and about adventures. Highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is lovely and the setting is simply beautiful. The kitchen, porch, and back deck are especially wonderful!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time in the house. Area was private and had a great deck. We had breakfast under the trees every day. Amy was responsive thoughtful and accommodating. We enjoyed our stay and would return.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Amy’s place. The home was clean and well furnished with comfortable furniture and wonderful art work. Lovely touches we’re found around the home. Our favorite place in this house was the tree room. We spent hours here gazing at the redwood trees.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As other reviews stated great everything so comfortable and homey forest in back yard location one of the best we have stayed in, so glad we found it
Dave and Janet - Golden CO"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy's house is a dream. A quiet and tranquil space to relax and enjoy nature. From the living room and porch you can feel that you're surrounded by nature, almost feel like you're in the middle of the woods. But still super well located within minutes of downtown, supermarkets, restaurants, etc."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're considering going to the Redwoods, do it! The magnificent beauty was mesmerizing and beyond my wildest imagination. Amy's home was a lovely  place to return to after a long day of hiking. I enjoyed taking a bath and cooking on her wonderful gas stove.
Also, the bed was comfortable, and it seemed there was a new heating system, as there was no sound to bother me.
The trees off the back deck are stunning! And I enjoy enjoyed picking an apple off the tree on the left side of her enchanting yard.
Thank you, Amy!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and house. Views are amazing.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The magical redwoods in the back deck were a highlight of the trip!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Amy's Woods near town was just perfect. Quiet area with the forest right in the backyard. Sitting on the porch every morning to start the day with a tall drink of nature really sets the mood for the many redwood trails we would hike later in the day. The home has everything you need in the kitchen, bed and bath, definitely a home away from home. Amy was very quick to respond with answers to my questions and we never actually saw a neighbor, so very also very private. There was a mixup with our rental car, so the first day we spent on foot and there was a little grocery within walking distance and the next day we walked to town for breakfast at a local bagel shop and then to the car rental place. Great weather for walking and anything else you might want to do. Loved it and would absolutely stay again! Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED our stay!! This is special place. The views, the location, the tree room! We would absolutely stay again!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This getaway in the Redwoods was peaceful and perfect! The house was exactly as described and was the perfect, cozy getaway for our family."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this house. It was a calm, cool retreat when we needed a break from exploring the area. There is so much to do near the house. I highly recommend it, it was gorgeous. The back patio and tree room are very relaxing, it was well stocked. Amy, the host is very responsive if anything is needed."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cool treehouse set at the edge of a redwood forest. Beautiful artwork. Very soft beds. Stocked kitchen. Accommodating host.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amy’s place was everything we expected and more. Her house was clean and had everything you could need for the stay. All the instructions were well written which made finding the place and checking in very easy. The surrounding trees were so peaceful and you forgot how close to town you were. Overall great place to stay, especially for the day trips to the beautiful redwoods parks in the surrounding area that we did."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place - exactly as described - excellent communication.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! I’d happily stay there again; very relaxing and comfortable.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful and quite! Great feeling in the woods
second time staying and will return!
Neighbor has a wonderful light projection into the trees at night
Fairies flying around!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location, accommodations, and quietness was exactly what we needed. Your backyard patio view is peaceful. I would recommend your home to family and friends. I would definitely stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house looks on to a forest, though it is in an accessible location, close to anywhere you'd want to go in Eureka. We spent as much time as possible in ""the tree room"" and one of us took over the nook there. The house has a spacious, somewhat open design. Every piece of furniture seemed to be chosen for its beauty and simplicity. We hope to return.
Note: Follow the host's directions; Apple Maps led us astray towards the end of the route."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy was a wonderful host and the property was gorgeous. the beds were super comfy, fully stocked kitchen for everything needed to cook or make coffee. would definitely stay again and I plan to! the forest room was incredible and where I spent most of my time in the house. loved it!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is an amazing place to stay and Amy is a wonderful host. It was very clean, had ample space and beautiful views of the redwoods and it felt very safe - everything one could hope for. Eureka and the area were amazing with many things to do and explore. We want to go back soon to finish everything we didn't do on our list."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Hi Amy,
It looks like I can write a review. It will follow shortly.
Mark"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this stay was perfect!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful getaway! Quiet and relaxing in the woods!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful setting for this lovely home! We stayed in Eureka to visit several Redwood Parks, and then came home to enjoy the redwood trees in the yard! Amy’s house is so comfortable and clean……with a well stocked kitchen and her beautiful artwork on the walls made this stay absolutely wonderful.
Highly recommend to anyone visiting this area."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is perfect in both location and vibe. The beds are so comfy and soft, and the back room with the view into the forest is beautiful. The only thing I would say is that the bathrooms really reverberate sound, so perhaps not the best for a new shy couple ;)
The location was amazing, 5min from Sequoia Park (which is an actual park with a playground) where my mom and I spent the day taking photos. The house is very close to the freeway if you want to (duh!) drive into the Redwoods, and the stove is great to cook on."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely home! We thoroughly enjoyed our four-day stay. We would have our morning coffee in the tree room looking at the redwoods, make breakfast in the well-stocked kitchen, and spend the days exploring the redwoods north and south. Eureka’s central location was perfect for that. We also were able to easily get groceries at Safeway to cook dinners to enjoy in the house, and eat out at Brick & Fire the night we didn’t cook. The living room was comfortable and well set-up for evening movies. And the beds were comfortable and having two bathrooms was very convenient.
Any travelers this summer should read up on the Last Chance Grade construction project between Klamath and Crescent City and plan travel accordingly. We avoided the area as much as possible because it takes a long time to get through even during the “open” hours.
The host’s communication and directions were excellent. A true gem."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house and excellent host.
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet location among the redwoods. Location is very close to town, but you feel miles away under the redwoods."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet neighborhood. We had to drive a few minutes to get to food etc but that was fine. Loved being cool in July while the rest of the state was hot.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Amy's place was the perfect home base for exploring Redwoods National Park. We were only in town for a few days, but were comfortable and happy with the location."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home, perfect for a nice quiet get away. Pictures do not do it justice - the tree room was AMAZING!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Eureka. The redwood room is relaxing and cozy. Modern kitchen with beautiful hardwood floors.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amy's house is serene and spacious. It was a huge amount of space! One large bedroom, one normal size bedroom, plus a large home office with a desk looking out into the trees. Lots of closet space. There's also a kitchen/breakfast room, a full living room, and an additional ""tree room"" with wrap-around windows and views into the redwoods. Our family of three had more space than we needed for the week. The location is quiet and private, with beautiful forest views. We spent most of our time around the kitchen table, or doing ""family art time"" in the ""tree room"". Communication was completely smooth. Thank you Amy for such a great stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the nicest house i have ever stayed in from any online bnb service and i have paid a lot more as well. I was walking around in my bare-feet and not once did my feet feel dirty! The beds were very comfy, i recommend the room over looking the forest in the back yard!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great space tucked away in the redwoods made a great home base for us for a long weekend.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was spacious, comfortable, clean, and quiet. The views out the back windows are amazing. It is a convenient location, but it feels like you are staying in a forest. Everything went smoothly with communication and check in. It was a great stay!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay. This is a beautiful home with an absolutely stunning view of local natural beauty. Host was friendly, prompt in responding to communication, and so helpful. I would 100% stay again"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is nestled in the forest which is serene and private. The tree room has beautiful views of the forest and all it's wildlife. We saw a mother deer and her fawn the first day of our visit, it was quite magical. Amy's art is stunning, we felt like we were at an art showing. Loved the house!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really lovely, quiet spot on the edge of town."
2020-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A nice place to stay, with plenty of room to spread out. I absolutely LOVED the tree room. You feel like you’re out in the middle of the woods, yet you’re still very close to town and all those amenities. It was great snuggling up in the window seat with a cup of tea and just enjoying the view. Only negative aspect was that one of the bathrooms appeared to have not been thoroughly cleaned (some debris in the sink, etc.), but the other bathroom and the rest of the house was spotless, so we just stuck to the other bathroom to be safe."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place! Exactly what we were looking for- close enough to the Redwoods to make this a great home base. Really enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Terrific space. More spacious and beautiful than expected. Very clean and quiet. Fast internet. Amy was super communicative and was quick to respond to any request (she even brought over a pot for us to cook pasta in). Highly recommended.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"As a writer and editor, every morning was a pleasure to take my coffee, look out at the redwood trees and then begin work. The house is on a suburban street bordering the park, so you have the benefit of the trees and nearby amenities. Amy is terrific host and artist. I bought one of her pieces. You should, too."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This property is so much more than described, photos just can't catch it's beauty, kind of the same way photos can't catch the grandeur of The Grand Canyon. So close to every ware you may want to go & see in Humboldt County. This is a GEM !!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful bed, superb quiet, a gorgeous space and a kitchen you can really cook in: a delight."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely time in the house in the woods. Made the 10 hr drive completely worth the serenity of that beautiful space. Thanks Amy!
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,amfiaehe9rgqw[PFVM
2020-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall this space is clean and worth the stay. Pros- the back room is so peaceful, kitchen is nice, & the neighborhood felt really safe. Cons- the heater is really, really loud in the master bedroom and it kicks on several times so the first two nights we were there I got hardly any sleep. Also, the bathroom doors don't offer much privacy, which was a bit awkward. But host was great, home was lovely and I highly recommend!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This air b and b is quite lovely, quiet and an excellent in Eureka. Amy is a wonderful host and has provided a clean well maintained home for your stay."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and beautiful place. The tree room is really relaxing. Amy was an amazing host with quick responses and great tips of the area.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was perfect for my friend and I when we were exploring the redwoods and the coast. All the amenities we needed were there. The host’s directions for finding it without our having to slog through downtown Eureka were especially helpful.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy’s place is really an escape in the woods while being close to town. It’s really quiet and cozy. The room makes you feel like you are in the woods while enjoying the indoors. The location is great, close to major places along 101. The lounge chair was an extra hit!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and very nice.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an incredibly unique house with a really cool vibe to it that suits quiet reflection. I would consider using it as a creative retreat of any kind, the view out into the woods and the isolation were the perfect counter to our activities in the city that weekend. In addition, Amy was on it with communication if we needed anything, a much appreciated plus to an already great stay. Thank you so much for the great place and service!"
2019-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Locating the place the first time can be tricky. The views of the trees were indeed lovely. The place was clean.
2019-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A little hard to find but a quiet and beautiful location. Amazing setting with redwoods in the yard. Great location. Easy to get around the area from there.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy’s place was the perfect getaway for my husband and I. It is located a short drive away from shopping, activities, and restaurants; but it feels miles away and was very quiet secluded."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy’s house backs up to lush open space. There are two patios- one off the dining area with a huge delicious apple tree & the other off the study shaded by massive Redwoods. Every evening we spent hours on the peaceful back patio enjoying a glass of wine & nibbling on local charcuterie we bought during our sightseeing trips. Amy’s house is tastefully decorated, minimalistic & cozy. Amy’s artwork hangs on the walls & it’s beautiful.
As a testament to the homeowner ~ we had an unfortunate and unforeseen situation that popped up a few days before we were to arrive. Amy was amazing working with us, she was understanding of our situation and was quick & professional in communication with us. We absolutely loved our stay & would highly recommend staying here!! Thank you, Amy!!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eureka is beautiful enough, but Amy's place was like being in my own natural sanctuary. The space is serene and surrounded by trees and gardens, but still right in town.
Stay here. Get inspired."
2019-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,Amy's place is exactly as described. It has a neat sunroom at the rear that goes out to a deck in the redwoods. It is roomy and very clean. Amy left fruit and yogurt for snacks/breakfast. And her paintings give a nice feeling to the place. We enjoyed our stay at her place.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay there and felt like we really were in the woods! It was so peaceful and magical. From the back deck you'd never know we were near a city. Amy is a wonderful host and made us feel so welcome. She even had lots of different breakfast items and beverages for us which was a delightful surprise and treat!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Always a great stay at Amy’s. Second time back and we love the peaceful setting and comfortable, clean home😍"

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy's Airbnb was a pure delight! Such a gorgeous setting, like being in a magical forest. The amazing artwork just added to the wonderful atmosphere. My husband, brother, sister-in-law, and I all appreciated the special touches and added comforts (even special foods left for us! That was way above and beyond. 😁) Immaculate environment. Missing nothing. We would love to to stay there again."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Home is just as described. Close to shops, restaurants and coastal areas."

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazingly large space with a bunch of thoughtful, minimalist design touches. While staying here, I used the space for some Instagram photography and the pictures turned out amazing. The location is conveniently central to the nearby Redwood hikes."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is in a beautiful location! It is quiet and spacious inside. The bed was super comfortable and Amy was a very responsive host. I highly recommend a stay here!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Coming to visit our daughters and we found your listing. We knew in an instant that this was the place to stay. Your pictures on the site did not do justice to the actual beauty of your home. When we arrived we were surprised and delighted to find a warm, open, clean and inviting place. The rooms are well furnished and your artwork is amazing; going perfectly with the beautiful setting of redwoods and forest. The neighborhood is quite and peaceful. The best feature is a wonderful open sun/window room overlooking the forest with the most comfortable chaise lounge we’ve ever sat on. Had a wonderful time with family and friends and will definitely return! Thank you for Everything Amy 😀"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow, what a place! If you are not a local, or even if you are this is such a neat spot to get a feel for some much needed nature. We loved bringing our kiddo to this home and waking up to some seriously beautiful redwoods and very calming surroundings. The space was tidy , had everything we needed, and the artwork was very beautiful. We plan to visit again, we recommend it completely!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a terrific time at Amy's. The house was very comfortable and well positioned - it nudged up to some great Redwood's. Amy herself was super hospitable, communicative and accommodating. She met us at the house and explained everything. It was a great place to unwind and relax before heading through the Redwood Forest."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Penthouse is absolutely amazing and deserves 6 stars. If you're visiting Eureka, stay here! Commination was great with very clear and detailed instructions."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We are so lucky to have found this little gem in the center of old downtown. The penthouse was spotless and furnished beautifully. We appreciate Sarah‘s communication throughout our stay and look forward to coming back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are reading this review to determine whether you should book Sarah’s place, let this be your sign: BOOK NOW.
These accommodations are top-notch. Everything is thoughtfully decorated, and the entire space is as tidy as it comes. I’ve stayed in Airbnbs all over and this one was my favorite—hands down.
There are cute shops downstairs and restaurants within blocks. The bay is a few hundred yards away. Redwood National Park (the reason for our visit to Eureka) wasn’t too far of a drive.
Sarah was an incredibly friendly and responsive host—even providing us with some impromptu recommendations for seeing tide pools in the area.
I assure you, reader, that if you book your stay at Sarah’s penthouse, you will not be disappointed."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best air bnb stays I have ever had. The location was perfect, the apartment was clean and extremely well appointed and truly felt like home with all of the thoughtful touches. Sarah was always available and just a pleasure to work with."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Back again for our annual visit to Eureka and to The Penthouse. Five-star accommodations. Sarah is a fantastic host. Be sure to pack a spare luggage piece to fill with treasures from nearby retail shops in Old Town, especially Land of Lovely, The Humboldt Mercantile, Eureka Bookstore and Ciara’s Irish Shop. Consistently delicious restaurants include The Sea Grill, Ramones (also great for grab&go picnic items to take on a Redwood hike), and the Five Eleven."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a fun spot right downtown by the water. Tons of character. We loved it.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a lovely apartment with lots of historic charm.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s Penthouse in Eureka was one of the nicest Airbnbs I’ve stayed in, including in beautiful spots in Europe. Sarah provided everything a traveler needs plus more- a beautiful fully-stocked kitchen, a large and very comfortable sofa sectional with cozy blankets, and two well-decorated and appointed bedrooms -perfect for a long or short stay. Not to mention a gorgeous view of the bay. 5 star."

The amenities were wonderful, from the kitchen to the bedrooms to the bathroom, we wanted for nothing. Thanks again, Sarah, for making our stay memorable!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our time in Eureka was made so much better by our stay at Sarah’s place! The place was a perfect combination of history and charm while also being updated and clean. The bed was also extremely comfortable. We loved the holiday decorations and felt even more welcomed and at home. Sarah was also extremely communicative and helpful. I cannot recommend this place enough and hope we’ll have the chance to come back soon!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Penthouse is adorable and very well appointed with everything you need to make your stay comfortable. Super clean, and beds are very comfy. I loved sitting in the window, sipping my coffee in the morning, watching the rowing crews in the bay. Good food is nearby and there are lots of nice shops and boutiques moments away. I felt very safe at all times. Host (Sarah) was very responsive when I had a question. I would definitely recommend this place."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sarah’s place is a very well designed and furnished accommodation that makes you feel comfortable and excited about being in historic location that offers beautiful sites within walking distance to the historic downtown area with great restaurants. It is centrally located between historic Ferndale and Arcata as well. We had a fantastic time. Thank you Sarah!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place will live in our hearts forever! Not to sound hyperbolic, but I couldn’t have scoured the earth for a better place to spend my wedding weekend. Yes, the location was perfect and the space was beautiful, but more than anything, Sarah was patient, prompt, and accommodating. And oh my God, the bed… the bed was so comfortable. I hope she’ll have us back, because we loved it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed a week and every day The Penthouse was a glorious, cosy and relaxing place to come home to at the end of our day’s hiking. The view over the harbor is spectacular and the apartment is beautifully decorated with so many lovely touches and lots of character. Comfy beds and big sofa with lots of cushions and throws and the entire place was spotlessly clean. Sarah went above and beyond as a host making sure we were comfortable and had every thing we needed. We’d definitely recommend this place."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the best stay here! The apartment is in a perfect location and so cute with all the antique themed furniture, with modern updates in the kitchen. The place is spacious and super cozy. We loved that we could just walk to stores and restaurants and enjoyed the view of the bay. The host was also fantastic. Very friendly and responsive. We'll definitely be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular! Just like the photos - really well decorated and very clean. Bed, pillows, linens were so nice - what a great place to sleep. Everything was perfect!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loft living at its finest!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the beautiful Penthouse! It may be the nicest Airbnb we have ever stayed at and we have stayed at several all over the world. It was beautifully decorated, had really nice linens, excellent coffee, the kitchen was well stocked, beds were comfortable, and the location was perfect. It even came with a view! Sarah was very easy to communicate with and had many personal touches (a bottle of red wine and 4 beers for my husband and friends!). We really appreciated that Sarah had lots of great information about the area in the unit as well. The penthouse was spotless and we lacked for nothing. 5 stars and I highly recommend staying at the penthouse in Eureka!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another amazing Penthouse experience. I’m making a bold statement…but it’s truth you AirB&B all stars. I want it to remain affordable and available to me so I would prefer to keep a secret but this is the coolest, most historic, walkable, AirBnB on the Westcoast. It’s a three minute walk to the ocean, two minutes to an ice cream parlor, and everything imaginable in between is at your doorstep. If you were trying to become Yelp Elite you could knock it out on a weekend trip to this historic penthouse. If a sale sign went up I’d be there! I’ll be back again next year! - Chris

Had a great time finding food for dinner and so nice to be able to pop right back up to the place which was central to it all. This place made our trip. Sarah was so responsive and welcoming. She even left us snacks & drinks. Access to laundry facilities (soap provided!) was a plus. Nice shampoos, hair dryer, everything you need to be comfortable.

We checked in a little late. The toilet would not flush, but not a problem. They came over immediately even though it was later in the evening and fixed it right away.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Penthouse was perfect for us. It is located within eyesight of the water front, across from a small park, in the heart of the restored historic section of Eureka, and is within walking distance of quaint shops and nice restaurants. All our meals at local establishments were very good served by friendly, welcoming staff. Eureka is also centrally located for those who, like us, want to hike through and explore the Redwood forests. An added bonus was the local skywalk in Sequoia Zoo and a walking ghost tour that shared Eureka history in a fun way. We always felt safe wherever we went. The unit itself was clean and well appointed, quite ample in size, with a historic theme as Sarah created the space by renovating the top floor of one of Eureka’s historic buildings. The renovation is a blend of the old and new. Access was easy with a convenient elevator. Sarah was always friendly, knowledgeable, quick to respond, and is clearly fastidious and organized. Perfect."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at The Penthouse; we had such a great visit the last time, that for this stay we invited friends to join us.

We brought the fixings for a charcuterie board the first night, knowing that Sarah had the platter, bowls, plates, glassware, etc to make any work in the kitchen easy. Great coffee, snacks, Lost Coast brewery within walking distance nearby. Place is sparkling clean and quiet with a great view of the bay. Highly recommend."

This historic beauty is on full display in The Penthouse with exquisitely preserved wood floors, doors, ceiling beams and brick. It is spacious with luxe accommodations throughout. True to its online description. Huge windows provide direct views of the bay. We enjoyed watching daily activity of commercial fishing boats, crew boats, and a variety of shore birds. We appreciated being in the Old Town core with walking ease to all it has to offer. Sarah is a proactive, highly responsive and gracious host. She made us feel prepared, welcome and pampered in every way. The Penthouse is an extraordinary gem and will be the ONLY place for us to stay when visiting the Redwood coast!"

Sarah was very responsive and accommodating. When we had an issue with the shower, she came up right away and was able to solve it.
We were surprised by the unusual request to strip beds and wash linens before our departure, since we already payed $125 for cleaning. We are hosting an apartment in a big city, but would not think to ask our guests to launder linens. Other than that, our stay was really lovely."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah's loft apartment was top notch on all fronts.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Have you ever imagined the refined elegance of the late 1800s? People dressed fine, wood was solid and well…things were crafted with love and by hand.
The Humboldt Penthouse is of elite level grandeur. As sailing ships come to port you can be there overlooking their entry into harbor. A quick walk with a loved one in any direction you will find great food and/or that sweet treat you’ve been craving.
After staying in Air B&Bs from coast to coast this Penthouse is one of my favorites. Beautifully decorated to inspire the timeframe of this historic building you will find yourself yearning for extra nights here. Don’t miss this stay, it’s historic.

Kitchen stocked for cooking if you want, laundry machine available and plenty of toiletries. Sarah was quick to respond to any questions we had and was incredibly thoughtful. We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and waiting for us was a personal note with a bottle of wine and locally made macaroons! Having our favorite drinks on hand as well as some snacks are really nice touches. Check in was super easy and location is right in the middle of everything! No need to drive your car if you want to eat or shop at the many locations around you. If you’re visiting Eureka you definitely want to stay here!"

The historical building was super cool, we could not have been in a better location (seriously) and we enjoyed every little charm of this home. 4th floor. Swanky elevator. Laundry steps from the Penthouse door. Tuesday, we stepped out of the building right into the Farmers Market. Gazebo fountains across the street.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful apartment with high ceilings and lots of space. It's on the top floor of a historic building. It's been fully renovated so it has modern amenities but still has all the charm of its history with exposed brick everywhere even in the shower. The couch is a big sectional that is great for lounging. It's right in the middle of the historic downtown area so there's plenty to walk to. Overall a wonderful stay!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property, wonderful location. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Penthouse was even more wonderful
than the pictures appeared. Sarah was
incredibly hospitable and the space was
immaculate. My family and I thoroughly
enjoyed coming back after some long
hikes, knowing that we'd have a
comfortable home waiting for us with
great beds, a fully-stocked kitchen, the
best living room couch ever, and washer/
dryer to take care of our hiking clothes. I
cannot recommend The Penthouse more
highly."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The penthouse is perfectly located in downtown Eureka, close to shopping and great restaurants. The view of the bay is just about unbeatable. We found it very easy to get down to the bay and the marsh for birdwatching and to hop on the highway to go north or south to see the sights - botanical gardens, redwoods, Woodly Island docks for fresh crab, farmer's market, etc. The unit was perfectly stocked - both kitchen and bathroom - with nice touches throughout. The upper floor location enables the great view and my husband and I took the stairs while my 82 year old mother-in-law used the neat old elevator. What a fantastic find, we loved it!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing location, walking distance to great restaurants and shops. Hosts were very thoughtful, making sure all necessities and amenities are there. This place is very well maintained and although in an old building, it is very open, spacious, and practical. Everything was sparkling clean. We stayed there with our 3 and 6 year old, and all enjoyed our stay very much."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing space in close proximity to the waterfront, restaurants and shopping. Sarah and Travis are excellent hosts and provided nice additional touches to enhance our stay."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. The home was everything we expected and more. Great location and walking distance to everything.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,AMAZING! This Penthouse exceeded all of our expectations. Love the Penthouse!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place to stay for our family, right in the heart of everything. We loved being with a short walking distance to multiple restaurants. The hosts were very responsive and easy to work with through our stay."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place in a wonderful location
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay with our two kids (8 + 13). The place was beautifully decorated and thoughtfully stocked with everything we needed (towels, pots/pans, nice kitchenware, even spices and sugar!). It was super quiet at night and was a great base for exploring the redwoods and the coast. The in-building laundry was a big help. We enjoyed getting to know the town as well!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I visit the area every few months to see my Cal Poly Humboldt daughter as well as check in on a rental property I own and have been to many places between Trinidad and Eureka. This place is AMAZING and perfectly situated in Eureka. Hosts were super responsive and even checked in with me before to check on my preferences for tea/coffee beer/wine etc. what a great touch!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Best air bnb I’ve ever stayed at! The location is perfect with restaurants across the street, a cute little town on the corner you can shop at & an dock at the end of the block.
Parking & checking in was a breeze. There was an elevator to get to the penthouse. The communication with the host was also stellar. They went above & beyond to provide everything we needed.
Once we got inside, we were so wow’ed by the tall ceilings, decor & warm wood floors. Beautifully furnished & incredibly clean!
I recommend this stay & urge you to book this oasis if it’s still available! Cheers!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down the most memorable Air Bnb I’ve stayed at so far. Parking and access to the penthouse was well explained, making it a breeze to find and enter.
We arrived later in the night and upon entering the space, we were welcomed in by a lit (electric) fireplace, ambiance lighting throughout the apartment, a bottle of red wine and locally sourced chocolates. The apartment reflects and compliments the town’s unique history so naturally. The attention to detail in the design and in the little house warming favors the hosts provided we’re thoughtful and delicious; making this experience feel unique and personalized.
I highly recommend visiting the town of Eureka, and it’s surrounding neighbors Arcata and Trinidad. Especially if you love the outdoors, live music, art, great food, good people, and of course you MUST stay at this Air BnB!
10/10 will absolutely be returning!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah & Tim’s penthouse is one of kind and so charming. They really put their heart and soul into making it comfortable and welcoming for their guests. We stayed for 3 nights and felt at home. The living space was warm thanks to the electric fireplace, and very spacious. Lots of natural light and beautiful views of the bay during daytime. We really appreciated the attention to detail with all the decor too, everything was so tasteful. The kitchen and bathrooms were well stocked with all the essentials. The penthouse is located in a historic building which had cute shops on the ground floor. Very convenient location, super close to cafes, shops and restaurants in downtown. Parking and check-in was super easy. We really enjoyed our stay, and will definitely come again! I highly recommend staying here if you’re visiting Eureka."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and wonderful place, host did a great job."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Penthouse was perfect. My mom came to visit for her birthday so it was a great vacation for her and a wonderful staycation for us. The hosts were so sweet and even left some personalized birthday goodies for my mom. It was right in Old Town so it was nice and close to everything. You could easily go out but we stayed in mostly just to enjoy the space. I would recommend the Penthouse to anyone!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! Way bigger and nicer than what you see in the pictures. Great location. We ended up just walking to all the bars and restaurants. Everything was so nice and well decorated. The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen was big. I would stay here again.
