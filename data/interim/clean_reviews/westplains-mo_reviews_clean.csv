The house was super clean and comfortable. You can tell it was recently renovated and she chose terrific furniture and decor.
We stayed for a few nights to celebrate my grandpa’s 90th birthday. It was nice to be able to cook in the kitchen and have access to a full size refrigerator.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place looks incredible. There were conveniences I never would have noticed from the pictures - like a smart heated and lighted mirror, a bath bomb, make up remover towels to name a few. Everything in the house was tastefully updated! After a long day spent outdoors the tub was so nice! I appreciated that anything that was provided to use on skin was extra soft - like the towels, the blankets, bedding, pillows. And I always appreciate when the hosts think of providing Q-tips! The framed pictures of famous people from West Plains was such a fun idea and so memorable. I loved the laundry setup with the stone folding table. We’re doing a home renovation right now and I was taking notes! They did such a great job with the place. If we had our kids with us there would have still been plenty of room for all 5 of us and even one more. There’s a whole table designated for local recommendations, handbooks and WiFi and I even noticed a little office nook with a printer. The fireplace was such a bonus feature as well. Naomi was super responsive and friendly. Our experience was wonderful and the home is a total gem!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Definitely recommend a stay here! Everything was clean and well managed! This place is actually nicer than the photos let on! You can tell the host put a lot of care into her thoughtful touches; like a varied assortment of coffee, a dark colored makeup removal rag, snacks, and comfortable bedding! I was a little nervous that the home would be hot since it didn't have central AC, but the window units did a great job and we were always comfortable! We definitely would stay again!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We LOVED it! 1000% better than a hotel and cheaper! We felt at home and will definitely book it again as we are from West Plains but travel the US full time so it’s great to come home and see family and have a nice place to stay without imposing on family!

The only downside we dealt with (and I hate to even add it because I know it's not the host's fault) is the neighbors dog outside barking all the time and pretty late into the night. It was right outside the bedroom windows so getting to sleep was a little rough.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I’ll be back really soon
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Full disclosure, I made the reservation for my boyfriend, so this is second hand knowledge. He had no trouble finding it with clear entry information. It’s brand new, immaculate, and has everything he needed, including a washer and dryer, which was much appreciated. The bed was very comfortable. The most important thing was how responsive Caitlin was. I don’t think I ever waited more than 15 minutes for an answer. In addition, she was really flexible about check in and check out dates. My boyfriend told me the wrong date to start which was easily fixed. His purpose there was cut short, and he had to leave early. Caitlin was amazingly accommodating about that. I did let her know that on the front end that it might happen, but she went above and beyond. My boyfriend thought it was such a great place, that he told the educator with whom he worked to recommend this listing to future students. If my boyfriend goes back there, I will definitely try to book it again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled around during the day. It was very nice to have such a peaceful, clean, and well maintained home to come back to. Caitlin answered every question very quickly. The area is beautiful and the town is friendly and welcoming."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay! We rented two of the townhomes side by side to accommodate our extended family, and it was the perfect place to stay in between our activities and visiting with friends. The rooms are all very large and the kitchen island perfect for the kids! Loved having a washer and dryer and full kitchen. All of the best were SO comfortable! We would happily recommend this stay to any friends or family coming to West Plains!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very cute house! Everything was very clean and all the extra linens was appreciated. The portable fans were a great idea too, as we get hot at night.

Close to town. Laura gave us recommendations for places to eat and always responded to our messages. There was a lovely park in the area as well with trails. We highly recommend this wonderful property.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We thoroughly enjoyed this stay; the house is filled with character, balancing nostalgia with modern amenities. The all-season front porch is like stepping back in time, very cozy and comfortable setting throughout. Best stay (away from home) that we’ve had in years!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wow! Really enjoyed our weekend here. It's not often you get to see a home styled this beautifully. It snowed during our stay which definitely added to the experience. I've already recommended it to several friends and family and would definitely come and visit again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay and I'd absolutely stay again in a heartbeat! Everything was SO cute and had a ton of little details that I just loved! The host explained everything perfectly and even had some extras that I wasn't expecting at all and it was really close to everything so I didn't have to go far to get dinner or run for things I forgot. The beds were even super comfy and the rooms were set up really well so they had as much space as possible! 10 out of 10, for sure!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cathy’s rustic cabin was a perfect place to get away from it all. Set off by itself which made it peaceful. Very close to multiple trails in the Mark Twain Forest. I will definitely keep this place in mind for a future trip!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We truly enjoyed this little piece of heaven and can’t wait for our next stay! It was spotless and had everything we needed. Noah communicated and responded quickly. Could not have asked for a better quick getaway!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were brand new to Airbnb. This was easy. I had been told there would be nothing so I feel like we brought the entire kitchen and didn't need to. Comfortable beds. The only thing I would add is directions on how to use the shower. My son slipped in the shower so new grippies for the bottom of the tub.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent host
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is probably the best Airbnb i have stayed at. It was clean, had the little extras that made it feel welcoming. There was water and soda in the fridge. Extra toiletries if needed. Everything was clean and neat. The host was easy to communicate with and very responsive. Would stay here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We rented here for a month while looking for land. The place was charming, tidy and very thoughtfully stocked with things from baking soda, flour and coffee in the kitchen to extra tooth brushes and laundry soap. The four bunks were perfect for the kids and the two tables meant there was a lot of room to spread out. The owners live nearby and were quick to respond to any questions we had. Convenient to stores/parks and on a pretty quiet street. We enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend it to others"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful experience renting from Cleo, would definitely do it again if I am in the area."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were there 5 weeks and felt like home. We loved having a washer and dryer and very clean home with no carpet. Their hospitality was exceptional. Very pleasant stay! We would stay there again if the occasion arises. We had everything we needed.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Fantastic stay! Cute little home with many little “extra” amenities, from toiletries to bottled water in the fridge and laundry pods/ dryer sheets for a load or 2 of clothes. It was very clean and comfortable. I would gladly stay again my next time in town."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Landed here after moving from out of state while we were waiting for our new home to close - it was a great landing spot, and the hosts were friendly, helpful, and made everything easy. We especially appreciated the bunk beds so no one had to share a bed."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great for the price and stay was pleasant. Prompt response to small repair. Easy to check in and out.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice comfy place to stay. Other than just being 1 BR, my family of 5 found it comfortable to stay in for the 10 nights we were there. Convenient drive to downtown and the civic center. Not far from the main shopping area with Walmart. Good place to stay 👍👍"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The home worked for our quick overnight. I wish they would have divulged the out-of-order cooling system. The window units were not ideal but worked for our quick trip. Communication was immediate and pleasant. Check in was a breeze. Kids loved the bunk beds!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home with everything you need to make a home away from home. Very peaceful and friendly community. Extremely attentive host will make sure that your stay is relaxing and enjoyable.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Awesome place, glad these accommodations were available."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The stay was great! Communication was excellent !
2022-03-01,2.0,Stayed over a week,"Made a mistake booking here. Their policy is to enter your living space and clean once a week. It’s my fault for not reading the policy as carefully as I should have but nevertheless, I did not want to have a stranger in my personal space. When I asked if they would stay out of my living quarters, I was told to not take it personally. They continued to enter and on top of that charged 50$ a week for the unsolicited cleaning service. It’s a real shame too because the house itself is warm, comfortable and very nice overall. It’s also conveniently located very close to the hospital which is fantastic for travel nurses, but I wish I’d chosen some place else to stay. Ended up canceling early with no guarantee of getting my money back."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Spacious, close to everything, well furnished, lots of extras, snacks, and wonderful communication.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at this wonderful Air BnB for over a month due to a clinical rotation at the local hospital. This location is great, within minutes to everything I needed! The communication was excellent and the extra goodies they leave were so sweet and thoughtful. I could not say enough about my stay! 5 stars all around"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What great hosts! They made our stay so easy-with good communication, a spotless home and very comfortable accommodations. They left special treats, basic kitchen items as well as any needed toiletries. We were able to bring our doggie and he loved it, too. Don’t hesitate to book your stay here.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really great stay!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This listing was perfect for me as a travel nurse. It is less than 10 minutes from the hospital and 10-15 minutes from the local grocery, pharmacy and eateries. The house was very clean and well kept. The host was very kind and helpful. The entrance was discreet and secure. I'd definitely stay here again."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Adorable little house. Perfect for our family of 5 for an overnight stay. Would have accommodated our extended family, for a total of 8, if they had been able to join us. Cute rooms, plenty of beds and seating. Wifi and roku TV provided. We ordered Dairy Queen and had it delivered (not something we can do in our little Iowa town). The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because I'm a light sleeper and the master is closest to a decently busy road. All in all, however, I would book this place again, in a heartbeat."
2021-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,The house was nice and great location but the original add did not mention wanting an extra 25$ per pet. During our stay the central AC was out which we did not know until checking in. Even though they did have a window unit in the front room the bedrooms were hot and stuffy so we ended up sleeping on the couches to be able to stay comfortably cool.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Cute Air B&B. Super friendly host . It was great staying there. Great location . Super easy to get around to different places. Recommend staying there.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,place was very Centrally located and convenient to everything on town. Is on a busy road but otherwise a quiet stay. Didn't even see any of the neighbors.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice little place. Seemed clean and had everything that was needed for a stay. The master bed was SUPER comfy. Only little issue is that the bedrooms did not have curtains (only blinds) - so as soon as the sun was up, so were the kids (which made for a really early morning)."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chelsea was very accommodating! Came down for a rehearsal dinner and wedding. Needed 3 of her townhomes for me and relatives and she provided 2 adjoining and 1 across the street. Super fun to be able to walk across street to see nephews n nieces whom I haven't seen since going into Air Force. Also, due to timing of flight and rehearsal at 4pm, we wanted to chk in early to shower and get gussied up. Chelsea allowed early chk in so we didn't feel rushed. Very easy chk in process. Very clean open concept, exactly as described. Plenty of towels n hot water for all! I can only speak about my king size bed and it was comfy! I didn't hear anyone complain about theirs, LOL. Only issue I was not prepared for first night is the horn from train through the stillness of countryside. Second night ear plugs made me sleep like a baby, LOL! Highly recommend if you come near here!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Loved the condo - beautiful inside and out! Total luxury! Completely stocked with all the things you would need. Safe location and nice neighborhood.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a new tri-plex unit that was great for a big family to stay for a week.
If you’re a light sleeper, bring ear plugs and sleep mask. Trains (about a half mile away) come through town throughout the night blaring their horns. We kind of got used to it by the time we left. The bedrooms have blinds but get bright as the sun comes up.
With that said, we plan on booking here again for our next visit in a few months."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Not exactly convenient but absolutely worth the short drive! We loved staying at the Hideaway! It was the perfect size just for us and the price reflected that. It had everything we needed (loved the king sized bed!) The dogs were welcomed and the extra room outside gave us a great place to throw the ball to wear them out. But my favorite were the winter time night sounds, near and far. 🦉"

The slate shower and glass shower doors exquisite. The bed linens soft and earth-toned and, glory be, soft pillows, too, in addition to firm.
Bullfrog kept up a constant serenade throughout the night and I awakened to birdsong.

King size bed with a good mattress and pillows, which I find is sometimes hard to come by in an rental. Nicely decorated. Front porch to watch beautiful sunsets. A fire pit, firewood included with chairs surrounding it sitting by a little pond. Owners were prompt with reply’s to any questions. Wished I could have stayed longer."

We loved the king bed, kitchen to make some meals, and tv to watch our shows. The pond was fun to fish in. We went up to Piney River Brewery one day (about 40 mins) and that was a blast. We brought our dog Winnie and she enjoyed the place as well."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Pat & Rita for immediately jumping on and fixing the Wifi issue. Thanks for driving over an hour to get it fixed. It saved my day (or should I say night) - as I had to attend a meeting at night!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great option if you are looking for some space and relaxation. It is well laid out and nicely decorated. The best part is the night sky and seeing all of the stars and planets. The kitchen works for some basic cooking but may be a disappointment for those who really like to cook. There was no way to set the oven temp accurately. There are pots and pans and dishes but you will need to bring all food supplies because there are only a couple of spices, coffee filters and paper towels. There is another AirBnB just a few feet away so you don't have the area completely to yourself."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Remote but easy to find! the accommodations were cozy and warm! we had more than what we needed and the place was very private. We appreciated being able to bring our dog and he was very comfortable as well.

We were very thankful for such a great space to crash in."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a perfect weekend getaway spot! Great location for my wife and I and our small dog to get away for a few days.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A must stay if you can book it when in the area! 5 *****
Pat & Rita are great, communication is excellent!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED this place. We came for the Show Me Shed Dog event in Mountain Grove, I was sad to find out that three of our fellow shed hinting friends have already stayed there and it will now be a fight to get it first. Haha! It was our first AirBNB rental and it did not disappoint. We were very happy with it, I wish I could get them to come decorate my house! 🥰"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is wonderful. Had everything we needed for an impromptu stop and Pat and Rita were very helpful. I wish we could’ve stayed a few more days.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Definitely one of the best Airbnb experiences I’ve had. Pat & Rita were very kind/helpful and communicating with them was a breeze. The location is absolutely perfect if you’re looking for somewhere quiet, private and pretty. Everything in the house was super clean and the bed as well as the couch were very comfy. Perfect for my little family of 4. Definitely recommend staying at Pat & Rita’s!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"One of the best places you could ever find!! This was such a wonderful experience to stay here. Everything was so nice, clean, and cozy! Exceeded all our expectations. This is truly a hidden gem, and was so nice to go somewhere so peaceful and quiet."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a gem! Tons of extra touches including high end sheets and towels. The electric fireplace under the tv made it cozy inside and there were amazing sunset views from the porch and fire pit. Wifi and streaming were strong. Couldn’t have enjoyed my stay more.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a great little find! Check in was a breeze and every accommodation was accurately described in the description. Cozy and comfortable in every way. I definitely plan on returning sometime. A bonus for stargazers; Cabool has very little light pollution, so the clear night sky was spectacular!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic place.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A wonderful little hideaway in the forest.
The “Shouse” is immaculately set up for the most comfortable, cozy stay.
Great attention to every detail you need and wonderful welcoming hosts.
Highly Highly recommend!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pat and Rita were amazing host. Very quick to respond and extremely helpful. Their home has amazing views and extremely quiet. Great place to relax and unwind!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pat & Rita are the sweetest hosts and their place stands alone in all star amazingness!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay! The owners are wonderful people who are easy to contact and have made the cabin a cozy place to stay!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is beautiful and the “shouse” is so homely and cozy. So much thought and effort were put into every detail of the place and it shows. Pat and Rita are super hosts and we appreciate their amazing hospitality.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great getaway from the everyday bustle of life. Can't wait to stay there again! Amazing view and great service.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,we enjoyed our stay at the shouse. everything was clean and we didn't feel the need to hover over our toddler. everything we needed was available to us. our dog loved being able to run in the yard.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you really need a ""get away,"" this should be your place! You open the door and there is open fields and fresh air! Stars are gorgeous at night. My dog loved just being outside exploring and the place is so cozy, woody, and lovely."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Not enough can be said about the incredible drive and hard work poured into this property. You can tell the majority of the place was made by hand — from the ceiling panels to the hand-stained trim, to the numerous homemade decor/furniture, to the lights installed in the towering pine trees above the fire-pit, and much more. The rustic, homemade nature theme of the place makes you feel right at home! Not only is the “Shouse” beautifully made with plenty utilities/amenities (such as a fireplace heater and access to Roku), but it also manages to be mostly secluded while resting only about 10-15mins into town. The only downside is that the Shouse rests close to a moderately travelled road, so it can get a bit noisy at times — but it’s quiet for the most part. Overall, we really enjoyed the place and would definitely pick one of Pat&Rita’s properties again!!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great private retreat lots of ambience in the small cabin, loved the decor and appreciated the responsiveness of the hosts."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had such a great time. Very cozy home away from home. Hope to be back one day.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"beautiful place
So homey. You wont be sorry you picked this place to spend time at"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a quiet, comfortable place to stay with nice amenities. It’s away from town but close enough if you need something that it’s an easy drive. We’ve stayed here before and came back because it’s so peaceful."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful little hide away! It’s beautiful, cozy, and warm. It has central AC and is pet friendly. We can’t wait to stay here again! Thank you!!"
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The house is very nice, and beautifully decorated. We found the living room furniture to not be very comfortable. Being in the country, the house did have a few bugs.
The location was close enough to town for supplies, but far enough out to have that country vibe. It us a beautiful drive there, too.
Also, I was lucky enough to see a family of deer in the yard in the morning!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time visiting and we love it here! Very warm and cozy.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean & Cozy place to stay! Just far enough away from the city but close enough that it wasn’t inconvenient when you had to run to the gas station or wal mart. Just a heads up, there are dogs that wander into the yard.. both very friendly dogs that we came across but if you bring a dog selective dog you may want to check around the house before letting it out. Our dogs LOVED the yard. Lots of space to run.. Also close enough to hiking trails and Branson that it didnt take an entire day to get where we wanted to go!! Highly recommend."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was very homey and comfortable! My wife and I loved staying here. It was clean and nice. A+ Airbnb!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"VERY Cute Place! Also, clean and comfortable! In a very quiet location with lots of room for pets to play. The roads are fun, rollercoaster roads, but not easy on easily car sick folks."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful land, comfy bed, nice privacy."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,a great place to stay and a great price. Peaceful and quiet and cute cute cabin
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house - beautiful and has so many cute touches to it. My dog loved it too….lots of care spent on the inside of it.
Downside:
1) we could hear Construction happening every morning during our stay and it occurred literally behind the house. It seems like they’re expanding which is great but if you do not want to be awakened early in the morning, this may be an issue for some. For us… not really an issue.
2) No hose outside - so will make it hard to clean grill for future guests that come as it was very dirty requiring lots of cleaning bfore use.
3) Parking is conveniently located on property but its unshaded so if you have leather seats and it’s a hot day it will make it uncomfortable to sit in there."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The home was cozy and really warm!! Loved the getaway for a night. Stores are close by. Thanks a lot, it was a meaningful experience for us."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a very comfortable Airbnb and the inside feels so homey. Relaxing and unwinding here is easy. If you’re considering this Airbnb, it will not disappoint."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very comfy, modern with rustic style, all the amenities to make it feel like home!

But the ""Shouse"" is clean, relaxing, and Pat & Rita provided a lovely, welcoming little retreat on our road trip!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful off the beat and path place to stay. I would highly recommend staying here.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a great place for a get away! The bed is so comfortable, the AC works amazing, and the space is so well laid out!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place surpassed ALL of our expectations for a weekend getaway! The cozy decor, antiques, comfortable bed, and the quiet country setting was everything we were looking for. The bonfire was the perfect place to unwind, and being able to bring our dog, Violet, made it really feel like “home!” All the little touches made this an unforgettable place to stay. Great job, Rita & Pat!"

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Truly loved our stay. Location was very peaceful with a lovely view. Also loved how convenient it was to get to the house from 60 highway. Loved the modern touches, WiFi worked great, bed was very comfortable, and loved the complimentary wine! We also loved having the dogs come up to greet us.☺️ We liked the firepit and being able to see every star in the sky at night. Definitely would stay here again! Thank you"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you choose to stay at Pat & Rita’s place you won’t be disappointed. My husband and I had a very enjoyable, relaxing stay. Brought our dog, Jake, and he had many places to explore. Best airbnb we have stayed at."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So cute and comfy! A tiny country castle along a quiet road. Modern with rustic touches and an open yard with a fire pit. Great hosts that welcome you to your “home away from home”. Awesome property, and a good value in the area. It was definitely a convenience that pets are allowed as guests too! I’d stay again in a heartbeat!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was very happy with the whole experience.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a very lovely one night stay. The cabin is cozy and has everything you need. The surroundings were very peaceful and felt like nestled in the woods at the base of the Ozarks. I recommend staying here!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures cannot do this place justice at all. Pat & Rita put some big love into this cute place. We only stayed a couple of days but will return when we can. The weather was perfect and a beautiful full moon. Stay here if you can, it is a must!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Pat and Rita’s place is a fantastic getaway! It is always clean with everything you need for a comfy, relaxing and peaceful stay. They are great at communication. We have stayed here a few times and it is consistently great! Thanks!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Pat & Rita's place is great! They went out of their way to make the trip special.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wow! Pat and Rita's place is amazing! We were headed to Nashville Tennessee from KS and this was exactly the halfway mark. Lucky us!! Their place is sparkling clean and so comfortable with so many thoughtful touches. Will definitely stay here again!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A sweet, extra quiet country shouse. Roomy. I wish we had time for a much longer stay. I would highly recommend it to decompress. Yet... I can imagine adding a couple more friends or family for a getaway."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A wonderful retreat, surprisingly luxurious. We would have loved to stay longer, I highly recommend it!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A little hard to find - we were tired, in the dark, coming from the opposite direction - but it was completely worth finding. Amazing, cozy place with lots of great personal touches. No-contact host was very responsive."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place is absolutely fantastic and peaceful. Pat and Rita was easy to communicate and always stayed in touch. The house is packed with all required amenities, and I would definitely recommend for anyone planning to come to Missouri."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This location is a great getaway for a couple. The location is remote, but not too far out of Caboole. The actual house is beautiful, and the bed the most comfortable I have been on. I am hoping to come back with my husband for a few days of a getaway."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Vicky was awesome, very responsive, and has a wonderful place to stay. We were there to watch the 2024 solar eclipse and the property made that a great experience. One of our group in West Plains experienced a foul-up with a West Plains motel which had lost his reservation. With the eclipse stretching local motel room availability, my long-time buddy Tom suddenly had no place to stay. Vicky immediately okayed having him stay with us in the second bedroom of the Airbnb, so the next day's eclipse experience was perfect for all. Thanks for everything, Vicky!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Vicky was a wonderful host! Her place was clean, cozy and had everything we needed."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A superb, modern, clean two bedroom guest house with all the modern home conveniences - spacious kitchen and living area, two large bedrooms with comfortable beds, WIFI, tv, and climate control thermostat. Even a large covered front porch and located on a beautiful homestead. It was perfect for us and Vicky is a perfect host."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay here. It is very clean and decorated nicely. Our dogs loved the big yard and seeing the neighbors’ cows. It was the perfect size for a family of 4. There were a lot of extras too (ie snacks). We will definitely be back. Thank you

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay if you are visiting the area I would highly recommend staying here. Very close to two bridges and West Plains. If we are back in the area, we will be sure to stay here again. Thank you"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was very satisfied with my stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Vicky’s guest house is great. You will feel right at home. Smells good inside and is super clean. The house has all the amenities of home. The TV is already set up for you to stream. Internet is decent. I work from home and didn’t run in to many problems. If the internet did glitch out, it always came right back.
The guest house is tucked back from the main house, so it feels really safe and private. Plenty of parking. It also right by a section of the ozark scenic byway, so the area is gorgeous.
Vicky herself is an absolute gem of a person. She is generous, kind and informative.
I would highly recommend this house!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"One can have a beautiful and attractive place, and yet may not hit all the notes, if the host is not amiable. That was not the case for Vicky. She was welcoming, inviting, and down to earth person! She bonded with my mom and came to visit and say hi to her. (My mom had suffered stroke-like attack a few years ago causing her mobility and speech to deteriorate). We booked the place at the last minute after the heat stopped working at a previous place.
Thank you, Vicky for hosting us! We will keep you in prayer as you continue to bereave over your mom!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I believe this is the second one as I extended my stay at Vicky’s! This was the second place where there was accommodation in the restroom for my mom, as she continues to strive daily against stroke-like symptoms and effects that have befallen her. Thank you for your amiability and hospitality, Vicky!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place! Awesome people! Clean and quiet!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the cutest little place. Vicky was a great host and even picked up cupcakes in town for my daughters birthday because we were not going to make it into town in time. There is plenty of space and things in the little guest house for your stay. Kids enjoyed the smart TV and all the space for walks with the dogs outside. Will definitely be back when we are visiting friends.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Comfortable house with nearly all the amenities of home. Very quiet and beautiful setting with nice outdoor spaces. Great spot for a multi-day stay with the whole family.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet and restful location, but convenient to Highway 63 and West Plains."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We would recommend mend this place to EVERYONE

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, clean, communicative host!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little guest house, 2 bedrooms and small living room and full kitchen. Has a front porch and grill that I didn’t use due to it being cold. Very therapeutic being on a cow farm - seeing all the cows grazing outside the window. Super dark at night and quiet. So nice.
Really nice big bath towels, thick and cushy.
Would be nice to have a self check-in, but Vicky is very available anytime you arrive."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Vicky’s place was excellent. Its a great place to stay if hiking or just relaxing. Lots of extras made it a great stay.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a quiet out-of-the-way place that is a real gem for anyone looking just to get away and have some peace and quiet. The space is comfortable and clean and very homey.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Delightful place to stay in a wonderful woodsy setting.. Vicky is very accommodating and has really thought of just about everything one might need. I mean there was even a bag of fresh garlic cloves on the kitchen counter as well as olive oil and just about everything else including ground coffee, tea and 1/2 & 1/2 in the fridge. Comfy beds and very quiet for sleeping.. Her place is exceptionally clean and well organized. Plenty of space overall and a super homey feeling which was most welcoming after my 13 hour drive. Definitely a place I'll stay in again for my next seminar in Missouri. Thank you, Vicky! Your extra attentiveness to detail really stands out especially to a fellow super host.."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this, could not have been any better! Thank you"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Vicky has DEFINITELY earned the title super host! I highly recommend this AirBnB for your trip to the Ozarks. Enjoy peaceful pastoral vistas, and gorgeous drives through the National Forest surrounding the Twin Bridges. For driving enthusiasts you will have a blast taking in the sights and curves of the road."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful quite setting in the heart of the Ozarks. Looking for time away and a place to clear your mind this is it.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best home away from home!! There’s nothing more you could want from a air bnb.
Very homey, clean, private and comfortable.
Vicky is a wonderful host who is approachable and accommodating. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else the next time we are in town.
She goes the extra mile!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We went last minute not knowing what to do with 2 young kids. The skating rink was great for our 5 year old. Also if your looking for an outdoor experience look into white ranch conservation area. Trail 6-2 goes downhill to a T and if you walk straight through the woods for 100 yards you can have the spring river all to yourself.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place to stay while away from home. The peaceful and beautiful surroundings make this place the perfect home away from home.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay. Very comfortable. Highly recommended!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay in the West Plains area. Vicki thought of everything. The space was open and easy for my dad to move around with a walker when needed. The house is very tastefully decorated and comfortable. We will definitely plan to stay again when we come back to visit family.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay if you are in the area
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,WOW! Better than we planned. Kitchen was fully stocked. Personal touches were everywhere and beutiful. Loved the kitchen angel on the fridge. I think my wife wants to find one now. You and your husband were awesome and quite helpful. I would recommend the place to almost anyone. The front covered porch was helpful when it rained a bit. And the family really enjoyed our stay. You guys truly are Super Hosts! Thanks again and we look forward to being back next time we are in the area.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend The Guest House. Vicky is a great host. She exceeded our expectations and her rate is very fair. The Guest House was very clean and a great place to stay!

We look forward to staying at Vicky’s Guest House the next time we are in the area."

Not too far out to be out of cell coverage and WiFi is included. I was able to not only get coverage, but more than enough to complete my online college work. It is not too far from town. Also not far from multiple rivers. Amazing and quiet place to take the family and enjoy the quiet. The only thing that would have made it better was if there was a washer and dryer. I'll be more than happy to stay here again."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a terrific value and a terrific host. We will stay here again in the fall.
Our family was worried about coronavirus, and our host was very thoughtful and placed cleanliness above all. We were very comfortable in her very well-kept home, and we felt completely safe in this location. This area of the country and state has very, very little coronavirus activity and it is ten minutes from a hospital should you need it. It is simply perfect anytime, but especially right now.
This home is perfectly located to take advantage of all sorts of ourdoor activities and state and national parks/forests. It is located within a hour or so of a half-dozen beautiful blue springs and swimming holes and as many picturesque, old mills.
This home is located 15 minutes from several restaurants in West Plains, Missouri (we liked Kiko Japaneses and Bottleggers BBQ) and 45 minutes from Ava, Missouri, where we liked Oxaca Mexican, and Hucklebuck BBQ.
The hosts were very thoughtful of our needs and daughter. They were super responsive and respective. We can't wait to return."

Fortunately for me, there wasn't anything for me to worry about. Keri and Steve had everything covered. Just a quick trip to the grocery for some perishables and I was good to go. They also allowed early check-in, which I thought was very generous of them. I was looking for a quiet and private weekend, and I definitely got it, just as advertised. Very satisfied, I would definitely recommend."

It was so peaceful and the home was very comfortable. We were warmly greeted by Steven (and sweet puppy, Sadie!) when we arrived. The owners were incredibly respectful of our privacy and encouraged us to explore shared farm property. We especially enjoyed watching a mama cow and her calf graze nearby! We felt we could easily get in touch with the owners, however we didn't need anything during our short stay, everything was thought of! The home was immaculately clean, the WIFI was strong, and we slept great. If ever we return this area, there is no question we would stay with Keri & Steven again."

2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful house with plenty of beds. Was a little shocked when reading the house rules that we had to strip the beds even after paying a clean up fee. Oh well.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Home was clean fresh and very inviting! We live on a farm so it was nice to stay somewhere that felt like home to us! Owners were very quick at answering messages, and always there to help. Will definitely stay here again!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Coffee with the cows!! An absolutely charming home and location, with super hosts! Out in the country just a few minutes from shopping, restaurants and anything you might need. You can enjoy your morning coffee gazing at beautiful open fields filled with wildlife/ cows.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Keri and Steve are great hosts. Their house is very nice and comfortable. We had a very pleasant stay. Keri was very quick with responses to concerns and questions. They bent over backwards to accommodate. Because of our circumstances, my wife and I had to stay in multiple Airbnb’s and VRBO’s. This was the nicest by far. And the only one with washer, dryer and dishwasher. It is only a couple of minutes from West Plains."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. It is out in the country but for us that was ok but it’s a little father out than I would prefer. BUT don’t
let that stop you from staying because it is so much better than a hotel. We have family in West Plains and we normally stay at a hotel so this was definitely a plus for us. Would definitely recommend it!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is so sweet - the character made me feel very cozy and comforted. It’s remote but still close to town, so you get the best of both worlds. The nature noises are incredibly peaceful, and I had a nice time unwinding outside each evening, as well as coffee outside each morning. This place has everything I needed, plus (bonus) furry friends. The cows across the street are the cutest, and I enjoyed sitting outside with Tom the cat at night. He’s very sweet and snuggly. I can’t wait to come back. I’ll definitely be staying here again on my next work visit."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a conveniently located and beautiful home. It's very cozy, and such an amazing view. It was very relaxing and we will definitely be back soon!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Super cute and clean. The owners live in a house behind the property, but I almost forgot they were there because we never saw them. The house is on a nice piece of property where you don't see any neighbors. It is very peaceful, we loved it."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay here! Perfect for a getaway into the country. We were only there for one night but we easily could’ve stayed for longer because there was plenty of room for our family of four. The views out of the windows are beautiful and my children liked looking at the cows. The owners went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. Overall, a great stay! I hope we can go back sometime!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great place to stay! Highly recommend. The beds were comfy, the space was sparkling clean, the views of the countryside were perfect."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This lovely house in a quiet area just outside of town was clean and nicely furnished. The price was also really reasonable and the owner responded quickly (and in a very friendly manner) to any questions. I would definitely stay here again if I'm in the area.
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed the peace and quiet for the setting. Keri and Steve are very responsive and helpful.
The interent was more than sufficient for checking emails and accessing the internet. It may not work for playing video games on line but if that's what you are interested in doing you might want to consider something in a city. We would go back and stay again."
2021-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful views on a quite road. I would definitely recommend this house to someone wanting to get away. Although there is WiFi to stream television, it isn’t the best so if you need to access work or school remotely I wouldn’t recommend a stay here."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts. House was clean and well taken care of. Neigborhood was quiet with easy access to everthing. Would gladly stay again if ever in area.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was exactly shown from photos. Carol was amazing and even reached out to prepare for our arrival. Our kids even enjoyed the fun toys she had! Plan to return the next time we come to west plains!

We will definitely be staying here again on our next visit.
Oh, and my husband loves the candy in the candy jar!!!🥰"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home was just what my family needed to stay in for our daughter's wedding. It was perfect and decorated so nice for the Christmas season. Had everything we needed. Easy access from entering the house and getting around town. Very clean and spacious with a nice kitchen. We didn't feel like we were on top of one another like we would have been in a motel room. Priced right too.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay. Child friendly. Felt at home. We will stay there again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying here!! Clean and well stocked! Carol and Mike have thought of everything in their beautiful space. I always feel like I'm coming home. We have stayed here several times and honestly, it is my favorite AirBNB. I have stayed in several across the country and am always so impressed by these hosts! You will love it!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house in West Plains, close to pretty much everything. Carol was great, and let me know I could check in early if needed. Like all the other reviews stated, they have thought of everything. If you need it for your stay, it's probably in the house already. The house was very clean and comfortable. My family lives nearby, and I would stay here again the next time I'm in town."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the second time we have stayed here and my young son loves this house! As always, very clean and homey feeling.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time to stay at Carol and Mike’s property. Once again, we were not disappointed. This house is very comfortable, quiet and conveniently located. It has a very well equipped kitchen. We love to cook and we really enjoyed using this kitchen. It is definitely our “go to” place in West Plains."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Carol thought of everything.. even to the container of Kit Kats!! Appreciated the ""extras"" available for ""if needed"".. like the First Aid kit, and razors . The house was so cozy and we all slept very well. Each time we returned to the house, we felt at home. She even had babies in mind. Thank you both for allowing us to stay while we married our youngest from KS and spent time with son from KY. Thankful we will have a place to go to when in West Plains again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carol and Mike, you were so kind when we had to cancel our first trip. Booking with you again quite healing
for those of left behind.
Your home was wonderful . It had all the things anyone could want. The bathroom was large and easy for my handicapped sister to move around with her cruches . well stocked with towels and toiletries.
The kitchen was stocked with all the dishes . cooking pans and utensils needed.
My bed was so comfrey, just want to sleep in.
All the decorations were beautiful and seasonally appropriate.
I look forward to staying with you again."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a great experience staying in this home. It was VERY clean and had a lot of little extras that made us feel right at home. There were toiletries in the bathroom in case we forgot something, a snack cabinet with goodies and snacks, and games and stuffed animals for our daughter. We enjoyed a movie on the tv which included netflix and there was wifi which the kids enjoyed too. Thank you for being wonderful hosts, and we would definitely stay again in the future!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Description was accurate with a lot of nice added touches. Very thoughtful hosts.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Where do I begin?! This was our first AirBnB stay and I'm sure this will be the one to beat! It's a gorgeous, welcoming home with everything you can possibly imagine to feel right at home (even cornhole and board games for the kiddos and family time!). We loved having our morning coffee on the covered back porch and watching the birds, squirrels, even a nearby groundhog (?) and the neighbor's cute dog. Its close to everything and super accessible. Carol has put together an excellent guide for places nearby to eat and visit. The playground right around the corner was the icing on the cake! Thanks again Carol and Mike! We were so sad to leave and can't wait to visit again to make more precious family memories!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice home, real roomy.Lots of extras we weren’t expecting."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay at Carol and Mike's beautiful home in West Plains was very special for our family. It gave us the opportunity to savor a comfortable and relaxing visit at a time when we were very concerned with health issues of a family member. In addition to the lovely decor, the entire house was spotlessly clean. We especially enjoyed gathering on the back porch and playing the corn hole game in the shady, enormous backyard.
This is definitely the place we want to stay for our next visit to West Plains!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family of 6 enjoyed Carol & Mike’s home. I have OCD when it comes to how clean rental homes are and this was the cleanest home we’ve ever stayed in! There was plenty of room for everyone and they had age appropriate toys for our youngest two children. There is a small park just a short walk from the house where we were able to say goodbye to our family before we headed back home. The area was quiet enough for coffee and donuts on the back porch in the morning for breakfast. They were kind enough to have plenty of snacks in the cupboard and the bathroom was fully stocked with anything you might have forgotten to pack. I’d give 20 stars if I could!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family enjoyed our stay. The home was very clean. The kitchen had what we needed to make breakfast. There were plenty of towels and cozy blankets. Highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing Host and communication. House was lovely and served our purpose fully. Would recommend to anyone staying in West Plains. Thanks Carol! 🙏🏻
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Carol and Mikes place was one of the cleanest Airbnbs I’ve ever been to. The location was perfect for a quick visit to my grandparents house, which was within walking distance. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked. We will come back again for our next visit to my grandparents house."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This Airbnb was so clean and well appointed. It had everything anyone would need and felt just like home. It’s extremely convenient to downtown, close to great restaurants, stores, and tourist areas. Their beds were super comfortable, the kitchen had everything you needed to cook and other items if you forgot to bring something from home. Their bath towels were big and luxurious with additional personal bath items to make you feel like you were at a spa. Loved the selections for watching TV after spending time visiting a family member in a nursing home. The back porch patio had a lot of room to sit outside in the mornings to drink coffee. I would highly recommend staying here, you will not be disappointed. Thanks Carol and Mike for sharing your home with us!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The kitchen is fully stocked with anything you might need, plus there were snacks to grab, which was a nice touch after a long ride from airport.
There is a large laundry room at the back entrance with a private bathroom.
The living room was a cozy place to sit and watch a movie. The large dining room table was great for our card game.
The bedrooms are wonderful, and each one unique with luggage stands. My friends each picked a bed. One was chosen because it was lower to the ground, and one was chosen because it had the softest mattress. You’d have thought I had the three bears with me from Goldilocks.
The bathroom is large with anything you may have forgotten. The towels are large and soft.
There were houses close to downtown but I remembered the annoying train that runs through that area. So if you’re looking for a place I can honestly say based on price, location and amenities this is it. Your are just two quick turns to the main road that leads everywhere and it’s quiet."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mike and Carol's place was absolutely Awesome. It was very clean and we loved it. They were very responsive hosts, if we had any questions. We loved the neighborhood. It was very peaceful and we loved the little park that was close by. We will definitely stay again when in the neighborhood."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Carol and Mike's house is fantastic!! This is my second time staying here and it is extremely clean, well-stocked and feels like a home away from home. I will always stay here when in the area!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, very clean. Awesome super hosts! In all likelihood, we will return in the future."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was very clean and well maintained. The host gave very clear instructions for entering the home, and was quick to respond to questions I had. She even messaged me short time after checkout to let me know an item had been left, so we were able to get it. Would highly recommend this property!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great communication with host, good location, cozy home with all the essentials and more"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is very comfortable, clean and conveniently located. It is appropriately sized for a family or small group to be very comfortable.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a nice home away from home. The host was great at communicating to us about public issues and keeping us up-to-date. The house was everything we needed and then some.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a jewel! Truly a ‘home’ away from home! It was beautiful and comfortable. Quite a find! Carol was amazing in meeting our every need, along with those needs we didn’t even think of! I was stunned at a post-it note on the fridge saying ‘you’re welcome to anything in the cupboards and fridge.’ Unbelievably generous! 5 stars for sure!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful home. Extremely clean and well stocked. They have thought of everything. Then teenagers will love the chargers that are in each room. Easy access to highways and close to food, gas and grocery. Mike and Carol were easy to communicate with as well."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect location for my visit “home”. We were visiting family in the area and this home gave us a great space to visit as well as relax. I enjoyed running in the mornings in the neighborhood. I also know there is a nearby walking park but the neighborhood was safe and friendly. The house was immaculately clean and the hosts provided so many extra touches! Snacks, many charging stations, and back yard bag boards are just a few. We enjoyed our stay and we are hoping to stay again next year."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,We were in town for a wedding and let me tell you the host did a wonderful job accommodating my guests and I! Very homey feel to the place and the cornhole boards were definitely a hit!
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,G
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay. The hosts have put a lot of thought into so many extra touches to make sure their guests are comfortable. Home was located close to the main roads, but far enough away & on a large lot so it had a country feel to it. We were only there for a couple of nights & were only in town for a funeral, BUT, if we ever find ourselves in West Plains again we would totally stay here! Thanks Carol & Mike!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carol & Mike’s home is immaculately Clean! So comfortable and convenient! They are such great host, the house is stocked with whatever you might need, even snacks! We loved it! Don’t look elsewhere, this is the place you want! We will definitely stay again!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Oh my goodness!!! I can’t say enough about how wonderful this place is!! We were in town to help my dad move from his farm to a house in town. After a flight delay we got in at 11:00pm tired and hungry with no food the next morning for breakfast.
Then we see a note on the fridge that the food in the refrigerator and in the cabinets were for us!!! Milk, juice, yogurt, bottled water, pop tarts, cereal and even nutty bars!!!
The place we so clean and the beds were actually comfortable!!! Especially after a loooong day of cleaning out and packing!!
We will most definitely be staying here on our next visit!!!!
Thank you!

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We completely enjoyed staying in this quaint house! It was clean and comfortable. Furnished with everything you might need during your stay, such as cleaning supplies, trash bags, laundry detergent, extra paper products, etc. Also conveniently equipped with a clothes steamer, hangers, and lots of kitchen equipment which we used and enjoyed! We felt safe and enjoyed the cornhole game that was available! The host was kind and quickly attended us when we locked ourselves out one night. We highly recommend this place and hope to stay here again sometime!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Such a warm and welcoming home. There was lots of time and love put into this home. My boys and I really appreciated it and enjoyed our stay. The stove is great we made a whole Thanksgiving meal here; love the broiler looks like a pan storage area. Very quiet comfortable and safe area. The host is just as warm, welcoming and inviting as the home itself."

We traveled with two babies; there were toys, a pack & play, puzzles. The house itself was perfect for our stay; cozy, comfy beds & linens. Overall we were so pleased. We'd definitely stay again next time we're in West Plains."

The hosts provided very informative pre-stay communication. They also provided some much appreciated extras. My family truly enjoyed our stay and will do so again when in West Plains."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were very accommodating. They allowed us to change our plans at the last minute and dealt with a customer support issue that arose from those changes. The place was clean and even came stocked with some snacks and condiments and seasonings for cooking.

,,,I would not recommend staying at this property. The owner will absolutely lie to squeeze more money out of tenants by claiming damage that never occurred or that she created on her own. This property was left in perfect condition.
