2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I absolutely fell-in-Love with Kristen and Heather's place - the 2 best co-hosts I've ever known and their units are the best! I fully intend to return and experience the beauty, the sanctuary and the serene settings - simply a wonderful experience each and every time.
Returning soon as I pray the space will be available in-between other bookings - this Loft above Charm is more than Charming is Excellent, Expansive and Exceptional - my hats are all off in my most humblest approaches!
Thanks to You, Thanks for you and Thanks a lot - always and again!!!
JOES"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute apartment with a nice central location. I loved that all the historic charm was maintained.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I’ve seen in this location many times and I’m thankful for the opportunity to stay there again
Bed is big and comfy!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I rented this for a minster and his wife, that was coming to preach for our church. They absolutely loved it. It was a very spacious apartment and had lots of natural lighting. There was some paint chipping but some of these building down town are over 200 years old so I would except that. It’s the second story and the steps are a little steep. But over all it’s a beautiful, antique, apartment with all the updated amenities."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such a charming place. It was huge. We requested to book around 630 and by 730 she had approved it, which was nice because we decided last minute to stay the night. The gas heat was wonderful. The only thing i wish they had was a tv in the bedroom. The bedroom mattress was comfortable. Everything was clean. We will definitely stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the second or third time we’ve stayed here, and it’s great. Great value and great accommodation!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Convenient location and so spacious.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We have stayed here before and plan to again. Comfortable bed. Great location
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"A cool spot for a longer stay, parking can be a little bit of a pain mostly just on the weekends but never anything too horrible. Thin walls so you will hear neighbors working, outside noise/cars driving, music from bar area across the street, etc. Also the stairway going up can be very dark depending on the time of day, there’s no light until you make it to the top of the stairs, that’s the only change I would make. Although, these minor issues wouldn’t prevent me from staying again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,An incredibly unique place that had everything we needed. Lots of room and great location. Great find!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Highly recommend staying here a day looking forward to coming back.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Second time staying here. Walking distance to the river and several antique stores and restaurants.
Quirky neat place. Will stay again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment exuded beauty with its exquisite architecture, emanating a historic and elegant ambiance. The unique floor plan, open space, and high ceilings contributed to its luxurious and historically inspired atmosphere, complemented by contemporary decor. Additionally, the convenience of a washer and dryer added to its allure. Situated in what appeared to be the prime area of town, it was mere steps away from the renowned floodwall mural, making it a delightful stay for art enthusiasts. Moreover, the proximity to excellent restaurants, including the tempting allure of patties and pints, made it an ideal location."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough good things about this apartment. It is HUGE, so so beautiful, and… LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!! Kristen’s instructions were clear and simple. Next time I’m in Portsmouth, I am definitely renting this apartment. I can’t wait to come back."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was good for us. The space was very large with the bedroom upfront close to street and kitchen and bath at the rear. We did hear some music during the night but not enough to hinder our peaceful stay. It was a good value. On street parking was close and available.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Centrally located. Close to bars and restaurants.
Ok spot overall."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I absolutely loved my stay here and fully intend on coming back. It was absolutely wonderful and such a magical experience. The entire place is absolutely gorgeous and fit into the area perfectly. This is truly a gem of a stay.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"First , great hosts! Great location! Place was very spacious and updated bath area and bedroom. Expect it to be “older with paint chipping”. I didn’t mind, it was a great place and location in Portsmouth."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is impeccable and worth every penny! Definitely worth coming back for another stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,great place near some really cool bars and restaurants
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"I enjoyed my time here! I actually did a one-month extended stay, so I have a good sense of the place.
Pros:
- The apartment is very spacious. The bedroom is huge, there is plenty of storage space, and there's no shortage of sofas.
- The decor is homely and comfortable. Exposed brick, a walk-in shower, and an antique aesthetic (including a pie safe in the living room where I kept my clothes).
- The location is awesome. You're cattycorner to a great bar and minutes from the waterfront. There are often markets going on down the street. And of course, you're spitting distance from half a dozen antique shops.
Cons:
- The place isn't dirty, but it's not spotless either. Some dust/cobwebs/dead bugs around, crumbs in the drawers, and peeling ceiling paint.
- Wifi works fine, but was often spotty.
- Communication was just okay. The hosts answered questions when I had them, but never responded before/after my stay. This was nerve-wracking since I was coming for a whole month."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really lovely historic apartment in Portsmouth. The place was HUGE for one person, but it felt plenty welcoming after a long day of travel. No issues checking in, and the streets were relatively quiet so I got a fantastic night’s sleep. Would stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I would book this again. Great value for price. very spacious.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Randomly picked as we were driving through the area. This place is a beautiful second floor apartment! The bed was the most comfortable we have ever had on a trip. The decor, atmosphere, and comfort of staying here was just like being in your own home. Would choose this place again without hesitation!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Delivered as promised! Beautiful restoration of old building near welcome center, flood wall murals, and Boneyfiddle. Very walkable neighborhood with shops and food. Apartment is huge!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly as described/as seen in the pictures.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,An enjoyable stay overall! Very nice bed and shower. Spacious and mostly clean except for dust and a dirty dish drying rack. Some buttons on the TV remote didn’t work.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just right
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just as enjoyable
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice room
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This apartment was absolutely beautiful and very homey! Thank you for letting us stay!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Only issue we had was lack of toilet paper. Told us to look diwnsyairs but no additional toilet paper. We only has 1/4 roll when we arrived
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Will definitely be back in the future.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A real delight and gem in the heart of Bonneyfiddle that I will return to again and again!!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great spot, an upstairs apartment right in downtown Portsmouth. You can walk down to the murals on the floodwall (only a block away) and all over the small downtown area. The apartment is beautiful, a very old building, but with all new amenities. Older than indoor plumbing most likely, so anything that needs water is at the back (so bathroom and kitchen) and the bedroom is at the front. The furniture is comfortable, and the A/C is great. It was so hot when I was there, but not in the apartment. A fan helped with the airflow. The bed is comfortable. The kitchen doesn't have a lot of equipment, just one large pot, so if you are planning to cook for yourself, you might want to bring a knife and a frying pan. These are minor details in a very nice place at a great price."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I look for interesting places to stay & this did not disappoint. The entire second floor of an historic building, nicely preserved but with modern touches. Lots of space, I wished I had brought someone to share it with. Slept like a log."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I Love the Loft! Be back next week!
joes"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great couple of nights at Kristen's apartment. Very spacious and a great location. Everything was as advertised and the space is great. I won't hesitate to reach out to Kristen on my next trip to Portsmouth. Thanks!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Was much larger than I expected, and I loved the eclec ic decor and decorations. My only complaint would be the shower could use a shelf. Responsive to my questions throughout my stay. The flat has so much character and feels cozy."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Extremely responsive and professional throughout the process. Great place to enjoy an evening in small town America.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a huge amount of space. You must climb a tall staircase upon entrance, and the bathroom is across the apartment from the bedroom. Fine for us, but if you have elderly in your group, just be aware. It is so beautiful!! Great space."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay, quaint apartment close to everything!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place that is centrally located to so much going on in Portsmouth. I would definitely recommend Kristen’s place.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our stay.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommended. A perfect location, tons of space, and a great price. Dishes and cups in kitchen cabinets weren't clean from previous guest but otherwise entire unit including bathroom was spic 'n span. TV controller didn't work well and wasn't replaced even after a visit by a rental representative but he got it to the station I wanted and that was okay, so maybe it will be replaced for the next guest. Extremely responsive and friendly hosts. I was concerned about nighttime noise as the bedroom faces on a commercial street but it was very quiet."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing hosts! The ability to book day of was such a relief! The place was also amazing! I need to buy that mattress for my house! Will definitely stay here again

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place has a great view overlooking the street with historic buildings as far as you could see. I loved the architecture of the massive arched window in the bedroom. The place was larger than I expected and the bed was very comfy. The neighborhood had a neat vibe with all the unique shops surrounding the area. I would definitely stay here again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kristen was a wonderful host. The place was beautiful. Bed was super comfy. Kitchen was amazing to cook in. Really enjoyed the downtown. Everything was walkable. The winter wonderland was a must do during the holidays.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved Kristen's huge and gorgeous space in downtown Portsmouth. It perfectly met my needs for a good night's sleep and proximity to Amtrak station across the river.

Details-
We were in town for a funeral, so really we didn't need much, but if you're coming to Portsmouth you definitely should stay here. I have stayed at a TON of Airbnb's over the last 4 years and this one stands out for its charm, mixture of old character and new amenities and VALUE.
The #1 reason we stayed was because it was dog friendly and no BS fees and charges.
If you're a future guest of Kristen's with a furry friend I advise you take good care of your pet so that people like Kristen can keep offering dog friendly without fees. I love traveling with my mini-Goldendoodle and always try to frequent places that are dog friendly. Roxy approved.
You can't replicate the type of character in this place at Hobby Lobby or Restoration Hardware. Exposed bricks, transom windows, original woodwork, etc. I can stay at basic Karen places easily...finding character and interesting locations is why I choose Airbnb over my Hilton Diamond benefits."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Though Kristen’s place is large, it felt extremely cozy and homey. It is in an excellent location with it being in the heart of antique shops, boutiques and restaurants in Portsmouth, as well as one block from the murals. We felt right at home here!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great location! We had a fantastic stay, and a great visit with family in Portsmouth. This property is very spacious and comfortable!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a fun place to stay in downtown Portsmouth! Kristen has created a beautiful space that was perfect for having a couple of people over after work to enjoy dinner together. I loved the large window in the bedroom and how open the whole unit felt. Plenty of natural light in every room. The location was great to get out and see the murals and a beautiful sunset over the river. I would definitely recommend Kristen's apartment for anyone looking for a large, beautiful and affordable place to stay in Portsmouth."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,love the historic atmosphere. Perfect location. Patties and Pints was right across the street and they have amazing food. Good location and walking distance to everything needed.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The stairs entering the apartment are high and a lot of them because of the tall ceilings but worth the climb. The apartment is huge and well decorated. Make sure you plan on using the kitchen it is so lovely it is a shame not to spend time in there as well. We have stayed here twice now and it is cozy, warm feeling, comfortable place to stay in a convenient location. Kristen is excellent at keeping you informed and making sure you have a great experience."

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place in downtown Portsmouth. The pictures do not do it justice. Super spacious. A little noisy early on the evening but we expected that. It settled down about 11:30 pm. There were only a couple drawbacks:
We would have liked a TV in the bedroom and although check-in was 3:00 pm, we couldn’t get in until almost 3:30. They said the house cleaner was still cleaning.
We had been in Portsmouth since about 2:00 and was hoping to get in at check-in.
I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The upstairs apartment was tremendous. What a great location! Everything was within walking distance. What a great historical city. You have quite a gem there in Portsmouth. We plan to visit again.

2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very spacious and awesome location! Right in the center of town. Well stocked place! Had one small issue with plumbing in which the owner was very communicative and helpful. Overall a good stay! I would recommend staying here!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space is large, there is only 1 bedroom but you have a whole floor to yourself. If you love early 20th century spaces this a great stay. Sound proofing could be better but its an old building so you can only do so much."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place is spacious and perfectly located downtown to restaurants.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a positive experience staying before, we just had to come back. Highly recommend this place."

A little dusty but clean."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So spacious and comfortable! We couldn't believe the amount of space and how sweetly furnished the apartment is! We felt like we had a glimpse of how Portsmouth must have been 75 years ago. Also, so clean, and check-in was a cinch.
There are 22 steps up to the apartment and 17 more to the upper bedroom. This was not a problem for us, but just keep that in mind. Also, the bathroom is next to the kitchen n the opposite side from the bedrooms. Not a big deal for us."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful apartment close to antique shops and restaurants.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful newly renovated historic 2nd and 3rd floor apartment in Portsmouth's historic Boneyfiddle district. The decor matches the architecture with today's modern amenities throughout. Heather is a wonderful host and have stayed in her other properties. This is the 1st time staying in this property and will not be the last. Just one word of caution to older guests or anyone who is handicapped, there are 22 steps to access the first floor of the apartment and 12 additional more to access the top bedroom."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This space is gorgeous. There is plenty of space to relax, unwind, and enjoy the uniqueness of the city. Everything from the relaxing claw-foot tub to the views overlooking the city, this place was perfect! A definite go-to for any travelers and somewhere I hope to stay again, if the chance arises!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anthony was an incredibly thoughtful host who made sure to check in on us to see if we settled in nicely, he provided an array of snacks as well which was helpful after our drive! 10/10 would stay with Anthony again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Kitchie Kottage was the perfect place for our visit to Southern Ohio. It was extremely comfortable in a great location and quiet neighborhood. Anthony was a wonderful host, communicating frequently to ensure that our needs were met and leaving a welcome basket of snacks after our trip. I definitely recommend staying there and hope to do so again!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean house with beautiful bathroom and lots of towels!
On the other hand, floor was very squeaky and it was tricky to not to wake up my baby just by walking on it… Beds were not very comfortable to be honest, clean but not very comfortable, and pillows too hard… Just wanted to give an honest feedback…"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cleanest house I've ever rented, fresh cut flowers in every room, and drinks in the fridge for us. i couldn't ask for anything more... even tho Anthony provided more comforts and more hospitality including great conversation at the fence. we were happy , dogs were happy, the week was perfect."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were in town for the weekend to attend a funeral. Anthony was very considerate and accommodating. He had a gift basket with snacks- and he knew that we had a baby so he even included snacks for the baby! It’s truly the little details that matter and that warmed my soul during the difficult time we were having. I’d stay again if the opportunity ever arises (hopefully in better circumstances!).
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place and great hosts! Appreciated the location's uniqueness, history, and beautiful view of downtown. Enjoyed meeting the owners/hosts and seeing their labor of love."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at the Monastery and everything was as described - beautiful house and gardens, spacious bedroom and bath, comfortable bed, good shower, morning coffee and a very attentive host. It was fascinating to see how Trevor and Kara have returned the Monastery to its original beauty but added all the modern comforts. We hope to return soon."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kara and Trevor are wonderful hosts of a truly unique home in a lovely setting.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Trevor and Kara were so excellent! We got a tour of the manor and got to do our Easter service online that night in the library where the priest used to take confession!!! It was a magical night and I'm so thankful to both of them, especially when I accidentally broke the knob off the oven 😭
Definitely worth the price!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kara and Trevor are wonderful hosts!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely historic home in a quiet part of town. Kara & Trevor have done an amazing job restoring the home and preserving its history. They are very accommodating and eager to share the history of the home with guests. This place beats any traditional hotel in the area and is a great place to stay for those coming into town for a short visit.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place! I would like to stay there again. I felt right at home and enjoyed the tour and hearing the history of the monetary.
Would have appreciated a box of Kleenex and perhaps a hairdryer, however I know they are just getting started.
The towels and washcloths were very nice but were all white so I was hesitant to use them to remove makeup. Maybe providing one darker washcloth would be nice. However, I would give this place very high marks no matter what."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome stay, host was extremely helpful and quick to respond!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful historic property with a stellar view. The hosts were fantastic and we enjoyed our host sharing the history of the monastery. We will not hesitate to stay here again!

The grandeur of the Old Portsmouth Monastery and the surrounding grounds are breathtakingly beautiful. The home was exquisitely decorated for the Christmas holidays, which added its splendor. The guest rooms and bathrooms are gorgeous and spotlessly clean.
I look forward to my next visit and hope it is soon."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Kara and Trevor’s place to be close to an event at the university. They are wonderful hosts and we loved hearing about the history of the house. The house is spectacular with so many original features lovingly restored. Luckily, we got the added pleasure of seeing it decorated for Christmas . The view from atop the hill is beautiful.
We stayed in the McArther room. The room was decorated to perfection and the bed and linens were so comfortable. The amenities were just as described. We will definitely stay again if we need to stay overnight in Portsmouth."

The home is beautiful, spacious, and tastefully decorated in a way that your eyes were drawn to all their mementos from travels. Your space even inspired me to write in my journal again - thanks Ernest Heminway. Kid friendly, easy directions, labeled lights to help navigate what felt like our home away from home. It had everything you need to make family dinner, and then some. It was professionally stocked with linens and toiletries. 5 stars all the way through.

We did a short run (5 miles) and the neighborhood is gorgeous and safe. She even put together a guide book and had a little welcome note with some coupons for us! We were overwhelmingly happy with our stay. Heads up if you’re trying to go to the ribber on a Saturday night- we didn’t get to because it was a 2-3 hours wait around 6pm.

Maile was extremely friendly and helpful during our communication via the app. She recommended some places to check out while visiting. Our favorites were Sonora (a Mexican restaurant 3 mins away) and Buckeye Dairy Bar (a really cute place with putt-putt). Maile’s place was great for our family, because there was plenty of space to spread out (master suite and a room for each child) and the children loved the play room and toys. There was a water table in the backyard that we cleaned out and played with that they also enjoyed. Our favorite part though was the hot tub! It was a fun activity to have, especially when it rained. The decor in the house was stylish and there were some great updates, like the master suite which was very comfortable and attractive. A great place for families with young children!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this place was perfect. You’re not far from downtown but it isn’t a location that feels like nobody else is around while still being in the middle of everything. I definitely will be returning.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I think this is my 4th stay at the River City Loft. Debra and Connie are so thoughtful and extremely responsive. My little home away from home!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous stay in Portsmouth. Loft is just like the photos and perfect for a couple or family staying in the area. There is a set of steep narrow stairs to access, but there is also a chair lift for those who need it (for themselves or luggage). We have had no problem with these. Kroger right next door for food runs and downtown is walking distance from the loft. Highly recommend Oscars for dinner. Absolutely our favorite place to stay in Portsmouth. We’ll be back!"

I come to Portsmouth for work periodically and having a safe and quiet haven is very important to me. There is a well appointed kitchen (there's even an air fryer!) and very nice washer and dryer. I'm right at home and can do my work during the day then go back to great wifi for getting some computer work done in the evenings. Portsmouth isn't very big and the apartment is perfectly situated to walk to many of the downtown restaurants, the park and mural walls, you can even walk to Kroger if you'd prefer not to drive. The apartment is clean and everything is tidy. Definitely recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Loft is hands down better than the rest! Myself and my co-workers visit this area frequently for work, and we are always ecstatic when our business trips align with availability at this location. Looking forward to many stays to come!"

We will definitely be back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were very impressed with the decor and cleanliness of the loft. Nicest unit we've been in. Would definitely recommend it.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous stay in downtown Portsmouth! Loft is exactly as described and is an oasis in which to work and relax. Beds are comfy and the neighborhood is reasonably quiet. Amenities are perfect. Kitchen is great and although we did cook while there, there is a Krogers less than a block away. Several downtown restaurants are within walking distance. We really enjoyed Oscars (don’t let the fact that it’s at the Holiday Inn put you off - food and drinks were great). Great walking/running along the river is close by as well (along with some interesting historical murals). We definitely hope to stay here at the loft again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Have stayed here several times. They continue to go above and beyond to make it a great stay! It’s like a home away from home!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, clean place to stay and friendly, responsive hosts!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t worry if you forget to pack something for your stay because this loft has everything! From an iron and ironing board, hairdryer, first aid kit, to a fully stocked kitchen with anything you might need to cook or bake! The loft is open and roomy and handsomely decorated, even the light switches are labeled ! Centrally located to restaurants and grocery store. Gracious host with great and quick communication. We will definitely stay here again on my next visit home to Portsmouth !"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very very nice.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay in Portsmouth OH.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for a weekend in Portsmouth or a professional trip. Quiet, private, safe. Offstreet parking was a very big plus. Washer and dryer, even an air fryer. The apartment was great! I look forward to my next stay!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Always love it! Great open space!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family absolutely loved the River City Loft! It met all their needs and more! We would have stayed longer but it was already booked for the days we needed! We will definitely stay again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, spacious, spotless, and comfortable setting equipped with everything you could need. And it’s pet friendly!
I will definitely stay there again when I’m
back in Portsmouth."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a great place to stay while in town! Very walkable and pet friendly. Hope to stay again next trip!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time we stayed at Debra’s place. As the first time, it was immaculate and well decorated. It was Christmas time and the decorations were perfect. We stayed there again because we loved the accommodations. And would certainly stay again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable! Love the access to lots of local places and how easy it is to find!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had stayed in this Loft last year and was impressed with how nice, beautiful, and modern it. The Christmas decorations added to the atmosphere of the holidays. It is one of the nicest Airbnb’s, if not the best, in Portsmouth. So when I returned to Portsmouth this year to visit with family, I definitely wanted to stay there again. Since I am older, the lift on the stars is an immense help. The price is very competitive to any other hotel or lodging in the Portsmouth area. Well worth the cost!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Debra’s place was perfect for our needs. I wish the stay were under better circumstances but we will definitely stay again. Thank you for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent! I will definitely be staying again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Debra’s place was fantastic. It was exactly as described and like the pictures. It was a great place to chill and spend the weekend. Comfortable beds. Excellent furnishings and comfortable living environment. It was exactly what we were looking for.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really enjoyed the Modern Loft! The place was much more than I expected for Portsmouth and was very worth the price. Will definitely be back. Great host and very responsive with any questions or needs. Thank you very much!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I can’t say enough of how great this place is. I stayed several nights for business recently. Portsmouth doesn’t have much in the way of hotels nearby (I think there’s only one), and this airbnb gives you great flexibility with more privacy and a better space than you can get in a hotel. It’s huge and has all the amenities of home, including being pet friendly. I had one issue during my stay that was totally my fault (locked myself out), and the hosts were really responsive and gracious about it. If I have to stay again, I’ll definitely be looking for this place."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very cute an comfortable
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great stay! It is nearby many places and matches the pictures perfectly! The hosts are very responsive and made sure we had no issues checking in or during the stay.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Debra has a beautiful loft and she cares for it very well and it shows. It was very clean and well decorated. Very spacious and lots of natural light.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debra's place was wonderful, my husband can't climb steps and having the motorized seat to go up and down was wonderful. It defiantly made it a lot easier for my him."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Recommended! Read my other reviews.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, very clean, and open. The rooms are attached by a sliding door, so that might not work for everyone, but it was fine for myself and my guest.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely stellar AirBnB experience! This space is absolutely gorgeous and sparkling clean. Debra and Connie were such kind and responsive hosts.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW. Hands down one of the best Airbnb’s I have ever had the pleasure staying in. Coming back here after long days truly felt like walking into home. The host has truly thought of everything and even in the midst of the city it was such a beautiful place to unwind. I wish this place was located somewhere else so I could continue to stay for years to come! I recommend this place a million times over, if it’s available BOOK IT! Thank you for how thoughtful and intentional you were when designing this space. It truly shows."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lovely space, looks just like the photos. Comfortable mattresses and pillows. One downside was there is not a dishwasher in the unit, but that would not have been a dealbreaker for me either way. The internet speed could use a boost, but otherwise everything was fantastic. The loft is beautifully decorated, and it was easy to settle in and feel right at home. For being an upstairs unit, the AC worked splendidly and kept the temperature just right throughout my whole stay. The hosts are wonderful and very responsive too. I will definitely rent this space again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Love the fact you can walk everywhere. The space was great and loved the private entrance. Like the fact parking was right there. Felt very comfortable. Cleaned! Would stay there again. Portsmouth has a special place in my heart.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome home in a great location w/ private parking, that was walking distance from everything. We would definitely stay here again if we are ever in town for another competition (Yes we took first place 😎)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were extremely pleased with the River City Loft! We hope it is available every time we return to Portsmouth. We have stayed at many Airbnbs, and this was definitely one of the nicest. We found the loft to be even better than described in the write up and pictures. We liked having a well-lit private parking lot. We felt right at home. We agree with all the positive comments other guests have made. Totally AWESOME!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice loft and very comfortable stay. The whole space is organized and relaxing. From super soft sheets to live house plants and fluffy towels they have the details covered. The location is convenient, easy to find and great parking. Be prepared to hike up steep and narrow stairs, but it’s worth it! Great place for a great price!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another very pleasant stay at the River Loft. Thanks to the hosts for offering this beautiful location.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Debra. Beautiful loft. Very comfortable and full of great amenities. Convenient location. Highly recommended. We would love to stay again.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! It was spacious with little extras that stood out to my family and I. There were games to games to play (darts, checkers, cards & Portsmouthopoly). We enjoyed the hospitality & the space. We will definitely stay again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Love this property! So much character and charm. Nice location close to everything downtown. I enjoyed my stay very much and hope to return in the future.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved the loft. Very private and peaceful. Debra was an excellent host, easy to talk to and willing to go that extra mile to make our stay enjoyable!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Debra’s place was extremely clean and easy to get to. The location is close to plenty of good restaurants. Debra was very responsive and kept in contact with me as needed. I would highly recommend staying here or her other two locations.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time staying here and I will be staying many many more times. So homey and spacious. The place is just beautiful and so comfortable.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Spotless and spacious. It was a wonderful place to stay and communication was great too!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The River City Loft was just as described and a great space - larger than it appears in the pictures. Debra's instructions and communication were clear and helpful. No negatives for us. Some things to be aware of: the bedrooms are separated by a sliding barn door that is lovely but has some gaps - for sound and visibility. Wasn't an issue for us at all but if you need privacy between the rooms take this into account. Parking is easy and reserved for the loft so that was great. There is a Kroger and Starbucks in walking distance so very convenient. Overall this space is lovely and a great spot for a couple or small family.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,River City Loft is beautiful. The pictures do not do the place justice. It looked like something from HGTV. Debra is a great host. The loft had everything I needed. I will definitely stay there again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place, love staying here when I'm in town. Walking distance to great food."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were very pleased with our stay here and will definately stay again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I were impressed with the loft, decorations, size, and the all out quality. In the morning the traffic was a little noisy, but not horrible. The lift on the stars certainly came in handy for me since I had knee surgery this year. It is the nicest Airbnb I have stayed in when visiting Portsmouth."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,i loved the way the place looks. I felt right at home as soon as we walked in. Kroger is literally down the street from the place so if I don't have a car it's not that far to walk. loved loved loved the place
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Place is actually even better than pictures somehow! Very cozy and made our trip home for the holidays so much better!
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place is great, cozy and comfortable. Spacious. Right by Kroger, can walk to coffee and some restaurants, everything else is a very quick drive. It could get a little noisy, you could hear traffic and the train fairly easily when you were in the bedrooms, that said the street wasn't that busy."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very nice modern place
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AMAZING! So beautiful and spacious. We used this loft to prepare for our wedding and it was perfect. I would stay here again, for sure. Highly recommend!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The loft was just as wonderful as the pictures. My daughter got ready for her wedding here and I’m sure the pictures are going to be lovely. We used the kitchen a lot and it was well equipped. It had everything we could have needed and then some. We are very thankful we were able to bring our fur babies with us too. Looking forward to staying again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a very comfortable stay for weary travelers from DC and LA for my dad's birthday weekend. Debra was a great communicator and the place was perfect. Looking forward to our next trip.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place. Super clean. Host is beyond professional. Incredibly surprised by how nice the place was considering it was in Portsmouth.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful stay. Spacious, lots of natural light, comfortable, high quality/value, loved the intentional touches and decorations- very aesthetically pleasing and makes a place feel more homey and less like a shell to crash in for the night. Private and easy to check in and out. All the amenities we needed. Easy to check in and out. Close to Kroger and coffee places. We loved it and will definitely stay again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing as usual! any time I'm in town it's a must place to stay at.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Debra’s space was very lovely. There was ample space given the size of the loft. The neighborhood was quiet. The space was clean. And Debra always communicated with us in a timely manner.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,beautiful place even better than the photos and Debra was so nice and helpful.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The loft is absolutely gorgeous and a pretty great price for what you’re getting! The hosts were friendly and even put out some bowls and treats for our puppy. Loft was clean and modern while still giving a throwback to the history of the town.
The town itself is historic and has some really awesome things, although it’s a little rundown in some places. There’s a ton of antique shops, bakeries, and interesting restaurants you don’t see everywhere else! The mountains are absolutely gorgeous and was one of my favorite things to look at on this trip.
Overall this was a great trip and I recommend staying here!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unfortunately, we had to cancel at last minute due to getting COVID. Our host was very understanding, communication excellent, and we look forward to rebooking at a later date. Many Thanks to our hosts. I know this location, as I'm from the area originally. Would highly recommend visitors to Portsmouth consider this location, close to many shopping, grocery, and art/cultural events."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely space, nicely decorated and even had to enjoy the electric fireplace for atmosphere despite June heat. This was a great location to walk to restaurants and the flood wall mural. The communications were excellent. Would definitely stay again if come back to hike in Shawnee State Park."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and clean loft! We came in the area for a wedding and there was plenty of room for two couples to share. Wonderfully priced for a one couple getaway as well. Our host Debra was very responsive with all communication!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful place. 1200 square feet. First class in every way. It looks brand new. The best Air B and B we have ever stayed in. Would highly recommend. We will be staying there again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Place is awesome, great host Highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I returned to Portsmouth for a family wedding. Debra's place was very clean and comfortable and it is modern. I plan to stay with Debra again whenever I return to Portsmouth.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay. Easy access and parking. All the amenities we needed were there. Will definitely stay here again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, gorgeous space. A lot bigger than I was expecting. Parking is right by the door. Right next to other homes and apartments and near the school, so it was a really safe, quiet area. Definitely will be staying here again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Debra was so kind and courteous. The loft was spectacular and better than what the pictures depict. She is very responsive to your messages and concerns and very polite!. Check-In was so easy and Check-Out was the same!. She warned us that the loft was not really set up for children but it accommodated our 2 children very well. Highly recommend this property and the Host!.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect! My wife and I booked it for a weekend and really enjoyed it. The dart board was fun. There were snacks, tea, and coffee available when we arrived. I cannot say enough about how kind and helpful the owner of this property was. The space was contemporary but cozy. The beds were very comfortable. I would highly recommend this stay to anyone."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was adorable! The host was kind and timely with all my questions as well as flexible with check-in time! The space has great character to it and if you love natural wood, western or barn aesthetics, you'll love this place. It's perfect for a couple looking to get away to a quiet place. The only downside to this place is it's location, it's little faraway from a grocery store, or things to do, but the character of the space makes up for the distance. I also believe that in a few years it might be in the heart of a bustlinh downtown area, right now it seems to be in the processing of growing."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very reasonable price with easy access. I enjoyed the stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a gem! We frequently visit this area and will definitely stay here again. Kristen was very flexible. Our plans changed a couple of times and she quickly responded to our requests
2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had stayed at this location years ago and it felt like they were building something reclaiming an old neighborhood. The maintenance has been neglected and it is falling into disrepair. The weeds, trash and poison ivy greet you as you approach the porch. We cleaned the toilet and the bathroom mirror but the layer of dust was everywhere. No one is checking up on the place. Empty soda dispenser just another indication of neglect. The lock on the door feels flimsy and unsafe. The electrical looks dangerous with electrical tape holding in one of the bathroom nightlights. The another bath electric outlet seems to be holding up some artwork (fire hazard) The place went from hopeful to neglected and we are disappointed by our stay, the neglect, and lack of communication."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Eclectic decor and comfy couch. I would say if someone was older the floors are a bit uneven and someone may struggle walking through the kitchen to the bathroom. It is in a historic area. Alot of the buildings seem to be the same way possibly because of being so close to the Ohio.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great. Don't hesitate to book!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was beautiful inside. A cozy feel of home. The place was clean comfortable and was just so nice!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is a destination. Everywhere you look there are unique details. You will be taking pictures of this space and sharing them with friends. Very spacious with high ceilings. Fully stocked place to relax for days in.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay in this adorable industrial remodel! Terrific location close to the river murals, restaurants and pubs. Host was easy to communicate with and parking was right outside the door. Would stay again if the need to be in Portsmouth arose again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute and comfortable space! I want the number of the decorator that did this place! lol! So cool looking. We only stayed one night. I wish it were more so we could get to know the area. The heaters were a challenge to figure out but once we read the instructions (duh!) we got two of the three working.
I would recommend this place to anyone coming to the area."
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable bed

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Do not let the outside appearance prevent you from entering this beautiful space. Beautifully decorated and everything you need while traveling. Laundry room is a little difficult to locate however, we had no trouble finding it when needed."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great little hideaway!
I stayed while visiting family. Quiet, was close to things I needed to get to. Could hear the church bells.
Very nice place and will definitely recommend and will be staying again!"
2023-12-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I were in town for a wedding. We were running late, so we went straight to the wedding. Check in to the unit was late. However, when we arrived there was no heat. The temperature inside was the same as the temp outside… in December. The wall heaters would turn on then click off. There was a small space heater, but the unit was so cold, the space heater did little to help. We put on every layer and wore our winter coats the entire night. It was apparent the heat had been off for some time. When one of the co-hosts responded to our messages/calls, she said “well it worked last week when I checked it”. On another occasion, the host insinuated it was our fault because we didn’t check in before 9. Awful, miserable experience. We have stayed in this unit in the past and really enjoyed it, but the lack of accountability and insinuation that the heat issue was our fault cannot be ignored. Lesson learned, check in during business hours or you may not have heat in December."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful little place to stay for the night while we were in town. We were only there for one night but it worked out well and was close to everything we needed. We walked over to The Scioto Ribber for dinner. Definitely try one of their steaks!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is our 2nd time staying here and we absolutely love it! We love being so close to downtown for food and shops. Will stay again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend getaway in Portsmouth! Kristen's Air Bnb was a great location, clean, and very peaceful. We came to Portsmouth to celebrate a friends' birthday; Kristen was fantastic getting a balloon for us before arriving. Our friend was SO surprised as soon as we walked in. Thanks for this perfect little gem ✌️"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My wife and I were just looking for a one nighter on our way back home and this place was perfect. The place was very cool and clean and had everything we needed. We had dinner at the Port City Pub and breakfast at Market Street Cafe both were very good. We look forward to staying again sometime on our travels south.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great stay and a great host,"
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,I quickly gave a review after our nights stay which was inaccurate. In stepping back from our stay I was able to better put into words a more accurate description of our experience... Super Cute place however the location is was not viewed as a safe place. The front door has no outside lighting and the front door and a couple of windows have blinds that are semi sheer making it very easy to see in from the outside. . The apartment is located in a super sketchy part of downtown. The master bath has a door with a flimsy lock that leads into a dilapidated part of the house leading to possibly other apartments? Loud music was playing until late at night. We had a reservation to stay here on our returning trip but we cancelled due to our first experience knowing we would loose the full amount of what we paid. Of all the AirB&B's we have stayed we can't recommend staying here. Again.... Super cute place with a lot of character. Bad unsafe downtown location.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was charming and lovely and enjoyed being in town. We would definitely stay at Kristen’s place again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always a great stay. Thanks Kristen!

Bed was very comfortable and the place was clean and spacious
Will totally stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kristen’s place was everything we could have wanted for our short stay in Portsmouth. I have been to Portsmouth before and one of the main reasons I booked it was because the location is perfect to walking to restaurants, shopping, the river, etc. The apartment actually was more spacious than the pictures make it seems, which is always a plus. The place was clean and we felt like locals. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The pictures do not do this place justice . By far the most spacious , beautifully decorated Air Bnb I’ve stayed in ! Very much enjoyed my stay 😊"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The apartment is beautiful. It’s impeccably decorated with lots of space. Location is pet friendly and near several green spaces which was perfect for our pups. It was a bit out of our planned route (on our way back home to the east coast) but the quaintness of the town and the apartment was well worth it.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Kristen’s space. Neat apartment. Easy check in, worth the money, place was as described."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Blinds into kitchen & living room looks nice but can look in easily after dark. No hand towels in bathroom or kitchen. Total of 3 wash clothes & 3 towels which unfortunately smelled a bit musty. Sour smelling sponge in dish drainer kitchen. No other options available for any type of clean up. Otherwise bed comfortable & for the money worthwhile & would stay again
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Unique property. Lots of antique stores nearby we would've liked to explore had we had time. Will plan a visit back to the area soon.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Place was exactly as described. The location is walkable to about anywhere in Portsmouth.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Good locTion. Nice stY
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place downtown. Places to eat close by. They are trying to revitalize the downtown so a lot of places were empty but it wasn't slummy feeling. The apartment was very well set up and decorated. It was very comfortable.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is under rated. It’s beautiful and so so cozy. It was an escape from the Portsmouth atmosphere which made it! Walking distance to restaurants, ice cream shops, kids museum, antique shops and the river. Host is right on top with communication. I extremely suggest this air bnb. Which I’m only hurting my chances for when I return…."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Little hot in the place but other than that it’s a good spot for the money.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet, well situated, and very clean. Easy walk to the brewery and riverfront. Thanks for having a fresh can of coffee!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot right in the middle of downtown Portsmouth near the main drag of restaurants. The place was very clean, had everything you need, and her directions made it easy to find. Would definitely stay again next visit."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a fun and unique AirBnB, and we were glad we had the chance to stay there. We loved the area and the proximity to the downtown restaurants and river walk. The hot shower and comfy bed were much appreciated."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An absolute gem in the rough. The area is clearly in transition and this unit is right in the heart of the old downtown area. So cute and well put together, we were very comfortable and cozy. The photos don’t do it justice. Only wish there was coffee to go with the coffee makes and filters.
We were in town to visit family. We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Boarded up windows in same building, bit run down neighborhood so you would think we wouldn't like, right? Wrong! Once you enter Kristen's apartment you feel comfortable and at ease. An eclectic interior (see photos on her ad)--kind of country charm that we see out here in the West as well--that makes a unique stay. Glad to see Portsmouth in revitalization of the Bonnyfiddle district. Recommend a trip!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed here several times and it has always been great. The hosts are always responsive and friendly. I will very likely book with them again. It's my go-to Airbnb when I'm in town.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great time at Kristen's place. It's in a great location within walking distance of several restaurants. We took the kids to paint pottery and visited the local bakery. The place was clean and welcoming, we had a great time."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Five stars all around! It was beautiful on the inside!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a great place to stay in Portsmouth, I would recommend to others. I liked the decorating theme."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would give this 10 stars but I don’t want it to be all
Booked up so I can’t go back!Beautiful unique decor, I could not stop looking around in awe! Such an amazing experience and more spacious than I expected, plenty of towels, blankets, pillows and sheets. Comfy large bed and pillows! We will definitely stay again"

The living space was comfortable, and the decoration was quite unique, but fitting. We would stay again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a beautiful decorated space in the downtown area near great places to shop and eat. Very very comfortable and clean. This was our second stay and because it was great the first time had to return! You can not go wrong staying here the host is great.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very unique place. Loved the decorations. Very clean - despite allowing pets, I was cautious thinking there might be dog hair or fleas… but I saw none of that! The apartment is heated by built in gas heaters, which kept the place very warm, but it was a bit difficult to find a “good” temp we had to keep adjusting them. The lock box to get in was a bit tricky and could have benefited from more instructions such as- after entering the code pull the box “open” not down like u do a lock.
We went in the middle of February so the town wasn’t very busy but it was warm enough for us to walk around and enjoy the antique shops, but some of the shops were seasonal and were closed at the time of our visit.
Overall it was a beautiful place that has been well taken care of and clean. I would recommend staying here."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very helpful host!! They made sure I received a delivery from home when I realized I forgot a power cord!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great accommodations and close to several restaurants!!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location. Walkable. Plenty of room. Heaters warmed the place nicely. Glad there is a mirror in the kitchen. Lighting isn’t the best in the bathroom. But it’s so large and spacious. Love the shower. Just wish there was a bathroom barn door instead of curtains. About 8 steps to walk in. And a grassy spot for the pooch just a few feet away is nice.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we really enjoyed our stay in Boneyfiddle! The place itself was really well done and comfortable. the location was awesome and it was easy to walk to restaurants and bars in town, as well as the murals and other attractions."

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing accommodations and so happy to see this destination in my partners home town coming to reality. The cherished Ole Latern Restaurant that our late dear & beloved one worked many years is getting a new life and we got to enjoy the already remodeled annex in rear! It had everything to feel at home especially with our Ziggy (Pug-Zhu), beautiful taste & decor. The area alone is definitely to be explored as who can do all this in a short distance.....eat, shop antique-candy-doughnut-ice cream stores and pubs, walk dog along Ohio riverfront, what else is their to say except, no holiday necessary to visit. Thankful"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Air B and B is perfect….location, decor and ease of getting in and out. Host was pleasant and easy to communicate with as needed."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a real gem. The Southwestern decor is amazing. It is charming and cozy with the best of features…the kind of place you don’t want to leave.
As other guests have noted, the side of the building where the entrance is located might make you wonder what you’re getting into. But as you step inside, you’ll be glad you came. I’ll definitely be back."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location is terrific. This place has everything you need. Would rent it again for sure!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I always love staying in ""the cowboy place"" when I'm in Portsmouth. It's perfectly located and a very short walk to the lovely riverfront. Also, it's always clean and check in and check out are incredibly easy."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb was awesome! Close to downtown Portsmouth and an easy walk to where we needed to go for a wedding. Bed was comfortable and the bathroom is nice.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The exterior is rough, but the inside is just like the pictures! fun and eclectic. Vanilla creamer in the frig was a nice addition.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Decorated with an eye for detail and character, lots of room, cozy space in an open floorplan, fantastic bathroom!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Don't give the entry doors any thought. They will let you into a uniquely different interior design. Very spacious layout, comfy furniture, large bathroom and hugh walkin closet. The location is within walking distance of many of Portsmoth's groceries, restaurants, and watering holes!"
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Looks super sketchy from the street. The industrial look is cool, but pretty drafty and you hear 100% of whatever traffic is on that street. Next time I’ll spend the extra $40 for a hotel. Only real advantage to us was the fridge/freezer for breast milk storage. Wouldn’t recommend staying here with smaller kids, some exposed plumbing and weird placement of outlets/switches"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stay here! The design & decor of this place is AMAZING. Super convenient location—highly recommend.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was exactly as advertised. Very clean and spacious. Will definitely stay again.

We are glad that we stayed in this house, and we will definitely come back again when we visit Portsmouth next time."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very unique property with lots of interesting details. We haven't stayed in anything quite like it! There were a few quirks (no door or exhaust fan in bathroom plus very dim lighting, no dishwasher) that might make a long-term stay more challenging, but it worked just fine for our family's one night stay. As another reviewer noted, the building and neighborhood does appear to be in transition; however, we felt safe and it was nice to be within walking distance to restaurants and shops. We enjoyed the flood wall murals as well. We would stay again and recommend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great and so close to everything on 2nd street
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"a very rewarding stay in Portsmouth, OHIO. the place was perfect and tastefully classic ""rustic"" kind that I appreciate, quality resourceful workmanship utilizing natural resources (the 'raw' wood , repurposed corrugated tin roofing, rustic finishes on the bathroom wall ,...etc.) and very up to date on things that matter (kitchen/bath) to make a stay there so relaxing."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place very cozy
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was great. But it was not very clean and there wasn’t a washer or dryer on site.

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The inside of Heather’s home was very beautiful and we enjoyed our stay there. The only suggestions that I have is to warn people what the exterior of the building looks like. I would have never thought the outside looked like he way it does after seeing the pictures in the inside. My daughter was nervous about going inside because of it. Other than that we really enjoyed your home and I have recommended it to my mother. The location is very convenient.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place right downtown. Easy walking to restaurants and shops.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful experience during brief stay! Heather was readily communicative when I had trouble getting in initially (my fault, not hers). The property is clean, quite, spacious and well-decorated. Within walking distance of a number of dining locations. On top of all that, a total steal when factoring in cost. Would recommend to anyone staying in Portsmouth!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Heathers place is in the beautiful historic downtown Portsmouth, OH. It is just steps away from all the antiquing you can possibly imagine and some of the best locally owned restaurants in town! Do yourself a favor and look no further for your next weekend getaway!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I always love staying at Heather's place. It's very comfortable and incredibly convenient. You can walk to get fresh eggs at the farm center and coffee and pastries from businesses on Market Street. It's always clean and Heather responds quickly to any questions.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heathers place was perfect. Close to Shawnee State and easy check in. Clean and spacious
We will be back😀"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Unusual & artistic space in a fascinating area with a history based on the Ohio & Scioto rivers as well as the pioneer era, Erie & Ohio canal, and the earlier Hopewell mounds. Convenient, quiet, clean, and comfortable!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Easy to walk to everything in Portsmouth. Enjoyed the murals, views of the river, and learning the history of the area. Close to Shawnee State Park and the Serpent Mounds. Great value, fun decor, and super clean!"

Creative, extremely clean, comfortable bed, super large closets with a galley kitchen that was well stocked with cooking supplies. You’ll enjoy your stay."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was my first Airbnb experience but I was not disappointed. It was such a great experience. I was just sad to have to leave early. Hopefully I can book again next time I am in town.

The place needs some TLC and something needs to be done about the noisy AC.

2022-11-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Zero response when messaged via Airbnb. Finally called him for check in instructions. Get a hold of him finally at 6pm. Before we walk-in he tells us a family member been staying there and place isn’t cleaned up. Keep in mind we made this reservation days in advance so not like they didn’t know they had a reservation booked. Dirty dishes in the sink, trash over filled, dirty floors- things you don’t want to see when walking into an Airbnb. He washed the dishes and dumped trash. Apologized and said he’d make it right for the mess. Well we got a call on checkout day and he asked that we leave a good review for our stay. I was speechless. Evidently he forgot the conditions and fact he said he’d make it right for the dirty stay. We never got a refund or comped night."

We also went on a boat ride on the Ohio River and it was a feast for the eyes. Speaking of feasts, Rachel cooked a bit for us and it was absolutely delicious. The hosts, Rachel and Jack, are exceptionally generous, fun-loving, kind, and great storytellers. I'm happy to call them friends now. I will be telling everyone I know about this place. And I will be back. Highly recommended :)"

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"WONDERFUL!!! BEAUTIFUL!!! PRIVATE!!!! Such a wonderful environment we were greeted by two of the most friendliest Great Danes I've ever meet in my life!

The pool is right behind to the guest house, and the pool is completely unseeable from the road and the main house! And the location is incredible very close to town and very close to Shawnee Park, we did go hicking but I know how wonderful Shawnne is!! Just an absolute homerun of a stay!!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've driven past Portsmouth hundreds of times on my way to other destinations and have always been curious about visiting. Rachel and Jack can share encyclopedic knowledge of the town and their poolside house is an ideal base camp for antiquing in the historic Boneyfiddle district. The pool and patio area was wonderful and we really enjoyed getting acquainted with our hosts and their affectionate and curious Great Danes. The interior is simply but comfortably furnished and features a huge sectional sofa that's ideal for reading, snuggling or napping. There is no stovetop/oven but there is a grill poolside and Rachel also offered to carry anything we might want to bake into the main house and back to our door. A full-size washer and dryer is available. You will have to climb a ladder to enjoy the high-quality mattress in the loft. I'd return to this airbnb even if it wasn't swimming season--would not even consider a cookie-cutter hotel for a return visit to Portsmouth."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We didn't get to meet Rachel because she was on vacation. However, the lady she had watching the place was super nice and always quick to respond to anything we needed or wanted to know. It was exactly what we needed and my kids loved it!!!"

Rachel and her family were terrific hosts, spot on with local tips and great with communication!"
2018-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel and Jack are lovely hosts. We felt very welcomed. The place is beautiful. I wish we'd had time to swim in the pool, but I did spend some time in the morning sitting by the pool drinking in the beautiful view. My colleague slept on the sofa and he, not a chosen member of the dog-loving community, did comment on a little dog smell there. I thought the dogs were an awesome touch. My quibble would be that the air conditioner was loud, and it struggled to push out the warm air up in the loft. But overall, a comforting place to lay our heads for the night. Many thanks!"

I'm fairly allergic to scented candles, air fresheners and waxes so something to keep in mind if those are things you are sensitive to... The location is great... you are right near all the action in Portsmouth if you are coming to town for any event this will be a great benefit to you. Especially with easy access to the main routes in town."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host with a nice private area that makes for the perfect getaway in a beautiful little town. The pool house of great for those wanting to get away from the city life and spend quality private time.
2018-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel was extremely hospitable, making us feel very welcome and at home, which is great when traveling to new places! She was available if we needed anything or had any questions. The pool house is charming and only about 10 minutes away from Shawnee State Park, where we spent three days hiking. Also, the town is charming; it was fun to walk around and check out the antique shops; the Dairy Creme's ice cream is delicious; and the murals tell quite a bit of the story of Portsmouth and are absolutely beautiful."
2018-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The pool house is a unique, comfortable and neat space. The ladder to the loft is not suited for every person, but if you don’t mind a little climb it is something new and different.
Rachel is friendly, welcoming and helpful."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Neat place just wish we could have used the pool! Great location to meet our needs as we were just passing through. Very spacious for two. Rachel is very friendly and welcoming.
2018-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel and Jack and the dogs were all great hosts. Nice little place in Portsmouth, OH, if you have reason to be here. The pool house is a nice touch. The woods out back were beautiful. Climb up the hill and enjoy the beautiful view of the Scioto River. The Scioto Ribber is an amazing steak place just down the street. We would stay here again."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible hospitality! Every meal was based off recommendation, and they were all amazing. Great location between historic downtown and beautiful hiking. The perfect little home for our best friend reunion (wish we could have come in the summer, when the pool will be open!). Style of home was a little too rustic for us, but that being personal preference, I would definitely recommend staying here! Oh, and the Great Danes are awesome."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place stay friendly people

2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had stayed here a few weeks ago and jumped at the chance for a return visit during a “Sister Weekend.” Cozy, warm fireplace kept us toasty. Plenty of amenities, from food and drink to toiletries and DVDs. Close to downtown Portsmouth’s many wonderful antique shops and pubs. Friendly, helpful hosts with three very friendly Great Danes. We’ll definitely schedule another visit - especially during warm weather when the pool is available."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place thank you so much!!!
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Somewhat Secluded but close to town. Excellent Hosts!
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A little piece of paradise! Well-stocked pantry and fridge. Many amenities (Kuerig, TV, DVDs, CDs). Friendly, flexible hosts. Although the bathtub drains slowly, the host was up front with letting us know about this issue. Close to restaurants and activities but secluded. A great place for couples, friends, etc."
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The host's recommendations for local events were super helpful!
2017-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely property with a lovely family! They were very accomodating and went out of their way to make sure we had what we needed. Loved the dogs! We were surprised to find it didn't have cable tv. But that one's our fault for assuming it would. It was a little challenging to find our way to the pool house when we arrived in the dark, but our host quickly came to the rescue."
2017-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very unique and secluded spot. Clean space with friendly hostess.
2017-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location is lovely, conveniently located to restaurants and other shopping. Lovely setting, beautiful pool, very private, very much as displayed on the Internet. The dogs were large , but friendly. Would visit again when in this area."

2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts! Nice, quiet, clean pool house and beautiful, friendly dogs!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great experience, our 2 and 4 legged hosts were great! The beautiful Danes kept us all company as we relaxed poolside enjoying the hot summer days and nights. The pool house was immaculate and had a great vibe. This is just what we were looking for to get away and enjoy our anniversary. We will definitely be back again."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel, Jack, (and their dogs) Winston, Luna & Franklin were wonderful hosts. They made us feel welcome and provided great insight on things to do in the area. Accommodations were perfect for our quick weekend getaway."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have been staying here while working away from home. I usually stay three nights a week and I have to say this is much more restful than a hotel. This place is perfect if you're looking for a quiet getaway from the daily noise! The three puppies make it seem more like home and after a long day of work, it is nice to sit by the pool and unwind. Rachel and Jack are very welcoming and very down to earth. I would recommend their cozy pool house to anyone in the Portsmouth area."
2017-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great hosts! My only concern regards the loft & the ladder; some may have difficulty maneuvering it, especially for middle-of-the-night bathroom runs. (The couch is very comfortable for one person). The access is easy (7-10 minutes from town); the setting is beautiful and it's great with the pool & the woods."
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an enjoyable stay at Rachel's Airbnb! The setting was beautiful and the host was most accommodating. I'd recommend staying here for anyone who will be in the Portsmouth area.
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rachel and Jack were responsive and welcoming. Their space was as described and a very pleasant alternative to a hotel. We enjoyed the peaceful setting and will definitely stay here again if we ever pass through again.
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel and Jack thank you so much for your hospitality, the Pool House was so much fun. We really loved hiking way up in your old growth woods. There were places there worthy of being on a movie set with the giant Beech trees, everything was so green. Loved your dogs with boundless energy too. Wish it was warmer the pool looked so inviting. I've never gotten to play music with an Airbnb host before, loved your guitar Jack and the chance to jam with my flute to it. We hope to come back another time indeed!"
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I highly recommend it. Rachel and Jack are great hosts. The guest house is nice, and their extensive woods is great too. It was cool to be able to go on hikes on the backyard. I didn't get to use the pool but it looks like it will be great in the summer. The dogs are very friendly!"
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very friendly, answers messages quickly, nice location.
The pool house is clean and comfortable."
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful view, wonderful hosts, friendly puppies!"
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel & Jack were great hosts. They had plans to be away from their home for the evening but made sure to stick around to check us in and show us around, which we appreciated very much. Rachel was very helpful through out the booking process and made herself very available to us during our stay. Her dogs are large but friendly. I got the feeling several times that she would accommodate for a guest if dogs aren't their thing. The pool house is cozy and private from the main house, and the pictures are an accurate representation of the space. Would love to visit in the summer to see the pool!"
2017-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very kind, delightful hosts! Incredibly hospitable, responsive and communicative. The only airbnb I have ever had a music jam! And on another day when I got sick Rachel graciously stopped at the store to get me some medicine and chicken noodle soup!
The dogs are magnificent and friendly. The house has a rustic character and was nice and warm (a concern of mine because I visited the pool house in the winter.) Appliances all work as needed. The back of the house is beautifully wooded. Although the house is away from the road, it faces the road so road lights are noticeable if you stay in the loft (but not if you sleep downstairs on the couch.)"
2016-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed meeting Rachel, Jack, Ava and their pets. We decided to sleep on the comfortable, broad couches downstairs rather than in the loft, and Rachel accommodated our request for an extra sheet and pillow. We got a good night's rest."
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel was a wonderful host and we loved staying at her place! You get the best of both worlds, being minutes from downtown Portsmouth but also in the hills. Rachel, her family, and her beautiful dogs couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful!"
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,See previous.
2016-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Rachel was very nice and easy to talk to. She helped with bringing the luggage in and fixing the bed to two twin beds (rather than king size). The pool house was very quaint and comfortable.
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Extremely personable hosts and an extraordinarily unique location. Well worth the visit even with the pool laid up for the winter. Hidden gem in southern Ohio.
2016-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel and Jack are nice people. They had a plumbing problem in the guest house when we arrived, and Jack worked hard to fix it. When it was unable to be fixed during our stay, we negotiated with Rachel to use the main house bathroom and stay in the guest house at a reduced rate. The property was lovely and I imagine would be even more so in summer."
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I enjoyed staying in Rachel's guesthouse. Her place was well appointed and comfortable. The pool was amazing. Everything was clean and well kept. Rachel was very accommodating with a late heck in and all instructions were clear and easy to understand. I would definitely stay here again.
2016-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. The owners were very nice and the property was very private. The pool was great.

2016-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Vetters are polite, social hosts and the pool was great! If you're looking for a bit of rest and relaxation, then their pool house is for you. We were able to bring our puppy and he got on well with our hosts' three friendly canines."
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The pool house was as described and the hosts were helpful, friendly and accommodating. It was great having access to the pool! Their land is a little oasis in Portsmouth. This is one of the best stays we've had at Airbnb, and we've gone to Key Largo! We'd definitely stay again."
2016-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Rachel and Jack are very friendly and great hosts. They gave us good recommendations for food and things to do. There dogs are beautiful and well behaved. The property was beautiful and the pool is amazing. The pool house is cute and was a nice place to stay. It did need a little cleaning when we got in but our reservation was last minute. My only recommendation would be to add a TV but my family had a great time and would love staying again.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was Perfect! It was centrally located downtown, with clear directions to all things Portsmouth. We found as much peace at this space as we did at the Native American retreat we experienced for the solar eclipse at Serpent Mound. It was fantastic to explore the town and also enjoy the many cozy touches at the tiny home.
Excellent moment!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We ended up not staying here as our daughter was born early and we were in the hospital the whole time. But Janie’s communication was great!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cutest little home! It was so cozy and so close to everything I did while visiting! Easy to get in to. Lots of parking. It is a tiny home so don’t reccommed more than 2 people unless you have a child. But I travel alone so it was perfecr
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful tiny home in Portsmouth. You feel like you’re in a totally different place inside their home.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place to stay highly recommend
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I currently live in another country, but, I only come back into the states to work. Staying at this place felt like home. In many ways, even though it's a tiny house, it's very welcoming. You're one block off of downtown.
Everything is within walking distance. I highly recommend this place. The host is great very helpful. Thank you Janie for everything i will be back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,we love staying here!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great place. Highly recommended.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I 10/10 recommend planning a trip to stay at this tiny house! As someone who manages Airbnbs, this was one of the most thoughtful homes I’ve seen or stayed in! Janie had everything thought of - from the phone stands/charges, snacks to await arriving guests, and so many other small but meaningful touches. We loved the location in proximity to fun things to do and places to eat downtown. The tiny home was decorated so well with many odes to the area. We absolutely adored it and cannot wait to plan another getaway here!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome tiny home. With being right down in Portsmouth, I thought noise would be an issue but it wasn’t. Slept through the night with no issues. Bed was also super comfortable! We had a great time!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is super cute with lots of amenities! We really enjoyed our stay and the location is super close to all the fun things to do in Portsmouth.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough wonderful things about this spectacular and precious tiny home. It truly is a little slice of paradise, right in the heart of the city. This is one of those rare moments I wish I could leave more than five stars. Can’t wait to visit again! Additionally, Janie was very communicative and kind. One of the best hosts I’ve ever had. ￼￼"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a wonderful little house full of character and charm. The house was well kept and very clean with nice amenities. Would recommend Janie and her little house to everyone.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a little gem of a place! My mother in law stopped by because she HAD to see the tiny house and she described it perfectly, “it’s absolutely darling”.
The space is very well laid out, and the high ceilings make it feel much larger than its 200sq ft footprint. 10/10."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent host and place. Awesome appliances and carpentry accents with local aspects. One of the best I’ve stayed in.

Spot was clean, comfortable, great location. If I found myself in Portsmouth again I’d happily book again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a tiny house haven. I can't wait to come back here in warmer weather. There wasn't a detail that was missed, from the basket of goods in the bathroom with the stack of hair ties, to collection of local activites and resturants available. It is clear that so much effort and consideration for the guest who will stay was thought about in each sq ft of the home. We loved the entire stay and urge others to try this tiny house experience!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the best stay I’ve had yet for so many reasons! The story behind the place is beyond charming, won’t spoil it for you. Being in the hardware business for decades Janie has selected top materials to construct and furnish this tiny home! Finishing touches such as local commissioned art, literary selections and ornamentation that tells a story of my hometown it was so very special for someone who hadn’t been back in years. Portsmouth may not be as it was in its hey days, but considering that was just before the Great Depression this is a perfect location and setting to explore a part of the town steeped in history that is experiencing a revival of the downtown area! In a minute walk you can eat at Patties and Pints, with its many taps and prohibition decor! Just a healthy walk more you can visit the historic Portsmouth brewery or have a morning walk along the Ohio River. In between I had joy of having my cards read by the phenomenal “Mystic Rose”. Definitely recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome tiny home! We will certainly repeat! Thanks.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect little tiny house, extremely clean and super cute interior. Close to restaurants and etc."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a delightful tiny home! Janie's place was absolutely perfect for us - we were in town just to see our son's show on tour at the Vern Riffe Arts Center, and Janie's home was right around the corner. It made for a cozy place to stay, within walking distance to what we needed. Janie took care of all the little details, even adding some holiday touches to the decor given the season. The coffee and snacks were nice to have, and the details in the home were perfect, from small tables and shelves to put phones and glasses, to lots of blankets and comforters as needed and an amazing rainfall shower! This tiny house is tucked in a rather unexpected lot but was quiet, and we could literally walk to everything we needed. Maestro's Mexican Grill just down the street made for a delicious dinner. Everything was great, and our stay was far far nicer and more reasonably priced than any of the nearby hotels. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at Janie's tiny house! It's in a great location, very walkable. We felt right at home and appreciated all the little extras. It was a perfect place for a girls getaway. We can't wait to come back!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Tiny House is just what you want in nicely done and decorated space! There is plenty of room, all the amenities you need. Well thought-out placement of appliances. Loved the decor and information given to local restaurants etc. The Italian restaurant (#8) on the map (and very walk-able) has had a name change, but the food is excellent.
Nice touch with a few snacks on the counter after arrival, they hit the spot. The porch is just perfect for sitting at night or with your coffee in the morning. There is ample yard space to roam around in for kids, and some outdoor seating with a small 'fire-pit""for those cooler nights.
You will enjoy your stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a lovely evening, sleep, and morning at the tiny house. Thoroughly enjoyed exploring Portsmouth, and the house was clean and relaxing—everything I needed! Would love to come back."

I like how they had brochures, menus for restaurants and other cool information about Portsmouth. We can’t wait to stay there again. It’s close to the downtown area, so you can walk to a lot of places for eating, shopping, or in the area for anything at Shawnee State University. Great host. Easy to work with and very responsive to anything we needed."

For an old house it seemed to be very well insulated - super quiet! Would absolutely stay again!
The one old-house quirk to be aware of: there's not much water pressure in the shower, so if you have very thick or long hair you might have a tough time. The water does get good and hot though!"

The over head lighting was great, but a lamp in the front room and the bedroom would be nice for watching TV or resting in bed. The bath room was cute and clean and had we everything needed.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stephanie was a great host. We were in Portsmouth for an event at the Verm Riffe Arts Center. After looking at the hotels in the area we searched for an airbnb. We could not have been happier with the our decision. The location was close to downtown and the area restaurants. Located in a peaceful part of town. The house was really nice on the inside. It had everything you would need and then some. Much better than any hotel.

,,,"Probably would be okay for two adults. Building windows are boarded up and and looks abandon (cannot see in the listing pictures). Heat is ventless gas which you would expect in a garage. Place smelled of natural gas when we entered the building. Door in the bathroom goes to two separate businesses in the front of the building and can hear one of the businesses music playing. Needless to say the place was very unimpressive. My wife, son, and I did not stay the night, instead we booked a night’s stay at the State Park Lodge."
