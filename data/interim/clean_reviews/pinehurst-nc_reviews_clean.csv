2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough about how wonderful our stay was. I was hesitant to book because it was a relatively new listing, but since all the reviews were so positive, I took my chances. I’m so glad that I did! Dixie is extremely responsive and answered all my questions almost immediately. Check in was extremely easy with the code provided so no need to worry about keys or locking the door.
The condo itself is lovely, modern, beautifully decorated and everything seemed new and spotless. Lots of snacks available as well as coffee and tea. I enjoyed getting up each morning and sitting on the balcony with my coffee overlooking the golf course.
The club house is within walking distance if you so desire.
The full bed is very comfortable and I appreciated the luggage rack that was in the closet.
The information book Dixie left has everything you’ll need. I’d give this place a 10 if I could! We hope to come back!! Thank you for sharing your lovely place with us!"

And a little extra that I enjoyed was the unit has cable and streaming services. A lot of places only offer streaming, but appreciated access to networks during March Madness!"
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,House was great and we loved the golf feel. Kyle was great to communicate and always responsive.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The Riggs Cottage is as charming and incredible as it seems! The views of the championship course were amazing and the putting green was not only great for the golf fans in our family but the toddler as well. It was also in an amazing location within Pinehurst. Two minute drive to the village and the resort.
We had 4 couples and the cottage provided plenty of space for parking with inside the house not feeling cramped. Bedrooms were spacious as well trying to fit in portable cribs for kids. Kyle was also very fast to respond to any questions we had.
The only downside we were short a couple towels and felt like some of the areas of the house could have been a little cleaner.
We would stay here again and will try to in the future!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just as described and clean and easy to find. There were a few things I would suggest. the TV placement to the setting area is not convenient to watching, since it is off to the side. the curtains over the sliding door do not cover the entire window and therefore people can see in always. The bedroom was beautiful and bed super comfy, slept so well, however there is no ceiling fan and no TV. I need both of these to fall asleep since I have anxiety at night so I ended up using my iPad and turning on the fan on HVAC unit all night. Otherwise it was a great stay and beautiful surroundings. Thank you."

Thank you"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place. Clean kitchen, comfortable bed, near everything in Pinehurst. Golfer here and was able to scratch that itch without staying at the ""Pinehurst Resort.""
Enjoyed my stay; Keurig works well!!!
Traffic thru there is getting a little crazy with the impending US Open/construction/etc. My advise to anyone who stays there is: no matter what your GPS says, when you're coming out of the condo complex, turn right on Pine Tree Road, then take St Andrews Road to get to wherever you're going. Beulah Hill (5) is extremely busy traffic-wise. Be safe!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tessa’s place is very cozy. The decor is wonderful and time and thought went into the small details. Sitting on the back deck watching golfers was fun! The horse track was walking distance and the golf club and pro shop were very close by as well. Because we arrived early on day one, I messaged Tessa via Airbnb and she responded and allowed us to check in a few hours early. Entry is easy. We would stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. Couldn’t ask for a better spot for our two day golf trip. I’d come back here again in a heart beat

The kitchen has everything one needs and the Keurig coffee maker with pods, cream, and sugar was appreciated. Access was simple and her communication was clear and responsive. I would certainly stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tessa's home far exceeded my expectations. Super clean with so many extra amenities, including numerous golf books to read while sitting on the deck in the afternoon sun while watching golfers go by. Her restaurant recommendations were spot on. I hope its available next year when I return to Pinehurst.
Harvey"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent little spot for a couple. The apartment is small but very cozy and had all the amenities we needed for a short stay. Nicely decorated, lots of natural light and a great little patio area to drink wine and watch the golfers. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The couch is off to the side of the TV which was tough for two people to watch together. Local area is quiet with the exception of a few loud cars coming by in the morning. Short drive to quaint restaurants and shops. We loved our stay and would come back!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I was in town with my son for a father-son tournament. Teresa's place was the perfect spot for us to stay the night. It was right across the road from Pinehurst Resort and on #5 resort course. The back porch was a great spot to have breakfast and watch golfers come through.

Great view of the golf course and even though we don’t golf, we enjoyed watching the players right outside the condo. The bed was comfy, sheets were soft and the towels were fluffy. Air conditioning was comfortable and the kitchen worked well for making snacks and drinks during our stay. There was a Kurig coffee maker with coffee mate and sugar to start our day. The location worked well it was easy for us to visit family in the area. Would recommend if staying in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved my stay here. small but perfect for my daughter and I when in town for a golf event. it was so cute !
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Last minute trip (literally booked the night before) and I was arriving late at night (11 pm). Tessa’s directions, including keypad entry, were perfect. Also, she left the lights on both in the entryway and inside, which was much appreciated with how dark it was when I arrived.
No golf for me on this “one-night stand” but the location is good and overlooks Course #5. The place was spotless and the bed was comfortable.
Due to the nature of my trip (had to leave at 7:30 am), I can’t really speak to the amenities, but the welcome folder was great and very thorough."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,The unit was as advertised with pictures and content. Easy self check in and check out. I would not recommend more than two adults and 1 child due to tight bathroom space. At times it was a little loud in the bedroom with passing traffic but very close to everything in town.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfy place!

I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant or better host."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,An absolutely perfect getaway stay for our anniversary.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"GREAT place in an A+ location, on the 1st fairway of Pinehurst #1.

KAC"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Caddyshack on the 5 and would stay here again. It was located in a great location to access the quaint village of Pinehurst and the golf courses we visited. The balcony was wonderful to enjoy coffee while watching golfers playing the course. All information we needed regarding the property was organized in a binder as well as some local recommendations.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect well put together getaway, couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Although it was a planned one-nighter, we would have loved to have stayed longer at the Caddyshack on 5. Tessa's place is so clean, neat & well organized. It was perfect for a twosome like us who are out-n-about but like a quiet little place with a comfy living room with big screenTV to relax in at the end of the day & uber comfortable king bed to sleep in. The kitchen is fully functional if you want to eat-in & the little outdoor deck affords you the opportunity to take your favorite libation & relax to a good view of one of the fairways of Pinehurst #5 (which in our case was snow but nonetheless beautiful & tranquil). The location is close to everything Pinehurst & Southern Pines. If you enjoy watching the horses work out (which they were on a 25º morning), the horse track is directly across the street.
Pinehurst is a short distance trip for us & we come there often. We hope to stay at the Caddyshack again, only a few nights longer preferably. 5 stars & highly recommend it."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Tessa is a great host! The location of her rental is fantastic, I would definitely book again, and would highly recommend!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing stay! Such attention to detail! The condo had everything we needed and an amazing view of the golf course!!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay!! It was the perfect location, close to everything, and it was fun to watch golfers on the back porch. The bed was very comfortable & the place was extremely clean. 10/10 stay!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place and super clean. My family loved this place, only bad thing is we did not get to stay longer !!!!!
We will be back."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tessa was a great host! Very generous and a great communicator. The condo was extremely clean and had everything you could possibly need for a whole stay. I especially loved the ironing board and the view from the porch. I enjoyed watching the golfers while having my morning coffee. I will definitely be staying here again!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the location is literally walking distance to the golf course and minutes from everything.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Attractive and relaxing place. Well organized and comfortable. Nice view of the golf course.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and host!
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Caddy Shack on #5 is a great place to enjoy a couples get away. The unit is comfortable. The deck is the best spot to enjoy morning coffee while watching the early morning golfers tee off.
In addition to golf, the condo is conveniently located within a short distance to restaurants, fabulous shopping, and just about anything you want to do while in Southern Pines.
Tessa provides great information to local places to visit.
We attended a fabulous wedding at the Weymouth center. Highly recommend you visit there if you have the chance."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Location is perfect! Everything inside is very clean. The host is very accommodative with check-in and check-out. Overall, I couldn’t ask for a better stay in Pinehurst!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The decor is updated, very stylish, cozy and clean. The beds and linens were very comfortable. And the location is just perfect to explore and enjoy Pinehurst. Our Host was responsive to our emails and provided accurate descriptions of this cute condo."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place with a great view. Perfect location to anything you want to do from golf to restaurants to shops. We had everything we needed. Oh and the bed is super comfy!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great condo!
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Delightful, light, airy decor. Most everything needed was available. The kitchen was well appointed with dishes, cookware, etc. Excellent set up of bar cart if you need those items. Washer and dryer available across the parking lot in an outside building. Parking for this unit is not at the door, and most availability is to the far right of the next door building.
Deck out back is coolest and best for mornings...full sun most of the afternoon. Watching golfers come and go proved to be quite amusing!
Communication pre/post stay was timely from this host.
Do note that although this bath has a hand-held shower installed, the plumbing is bypassed and is TUB ONLY. The listing SAYS tub, but Air B&B icon shows a tub with shower overhead, which is not the case. (Maybe Air B&B could correct their icon for clarity). It is a lovely, large garden tub, and as so prevents easy leaning over the edge to wash hair.
If you're a lover of a completely dark room to sleep in, I suggest bringing black poster board and painter's tape to block light from the security light in the parking lot that's just outside the bedroom window. There's a Dollar General a few miles down the road where you can purchase items if needed. The windows have nice, wooden venetian blinds, but light leaks around the edges...something certainly not in control of the host unless black out curtains are added. Poster board and tape do the trick nicely, and I use this simple fix lots of times when traveling.
Great location in the Pinehurst area, just beyond the Village proper, with limitless options in type and $-$$$$ range for dining available."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Nicely decorated and very clean.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"It’s a super clean, sweet and adorable place and I’m glad we were able to stay there. We’re not real tech savvy and couldn’t figure out the tv but Tessa was right at our fingertips 😊. The tub/shower is an amazing space! We truly enjoyed it!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. The condo had everything we needed. The check in process was simple. The condo is decorated beautifully.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in pinehurst!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay and the process was seamless for our first time using Airbnb! Would highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic condo for any Pinehurst trip.
Very Clean!! Location is perfect
Great Host"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is right on the first fairway of Pinehurst #5 course and the view from the back deck is excellent. The condo was clean & very accommodating with pretty much all the amenities you need. There was ample parking at the condo with no more than a 15-20 min drive to shopping areas & various restaurants. Tessa did an excellent job providing all the details we needed prior to our stay. She also has a notebook in the condo with specific directions (wi-fi, TV, appliances, supplies, check-out) as well as information about local restaurants, shopping, and things to do. We had a fantastic stay and will check availability of Tessa's condo again for our next trip. Bruce & Linda"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks again Tessa for a great stay in your place. Will most likely rent from you again. Thanks!!!
2021-08-01,3,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay at the Caddy Shack! The view of the course was amazing!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Tessa’s place was just as described. Has a great view on the back porch. Google maps will take you past the entrance though once you turn in so follow her directions.
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at Tessa's place, and it was just as good as the first time. It is in a convenient location. The place was clean and just as advertised."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Book this beautiful condo! You will not regret it. My husband and I had everything we needed to have a night away from the kids. We were just a short drive from Southern Pines and the great food/shopping. The neighborhood is super quiet and we got to watch golfers from the balcony while having our morning coffee.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at this condo. No matter why you are visiting the area the location is perfect for golfing, visiting the Pinehurst resort, shopping, and is in close proximity to plenty of restaurants. Or if you are having a lazy afternoon and dont feel like going out there are plenty of options for food delivery on Uber eats or door dash.
The photos posted on the site are a true representation of what to expect during your stay. Checking in was extremely easy and the host was available almost immediately upon contact. While I barely used the kitchen it was very well stocked and should I have wanted to cook everything I needed was right there. The condo gives off a really calming vibe with the paint colors and decor which made it really easy to relax after a long day. The bed was super comfortable; probably some of the best sleep I've gotten in a while.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The treehouse is absolutely charming. It’s much bigger than we imagined. Everything is so well organized and thought out, and available right where it needs to be within your reach. It’s very very clean. One of the most clean air B&Bs we’ve been in. Our GPS kind of had us lost, we were looking for building 70 versus unit two so that’s probably why. That was our mistake. Turning in and out off the main road is tight & hard to see, so be careful. The view was spectacular. We couldn’t ask for a better stay, it is a perfect place to get away yet still be close to all of the surrounding amenities in Pinehurst."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Five star in every respect. Pinehurst is well known as a golfer’s paradise. But I now know it as the town that has the “Knotty But Nice Treehouse” – which is one of the most beautifully decorated, serene, tranquil, and relaxing places we’ve ever visited. We thoroughly enjoyed sitting on the deck, watching the fish jump in the lake, the rabbits foraging on the lawn, the hummingbirds flitting about, and the deer with her two fawns who made regular appearances. We highly highly recommend the treehouse for a getaway, or a long vacation, and if you want to play a round of golf, then that’s OK too."

While not lakefront, you have a great view of the lake from the deck. Everything was exactly as described and looked like the pictures. Felicia is a great host, very communicative and offered good recommendations. The kitchen appeared to be well stocked, however we only took advantage of the wine glasses.
Walking to the Village of Pinehurst is an option, not far, but the roads are narrow without a shoulder.
Add a little whimsy to your next stay in Pinehurst and stay in the treehouse."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,I grew up in the Pinehurst area and had been in one of these unique houses in my childhood. I was amazed at how well the home had been remodeled and how open the floor plan was. The location is perfect if you're traveling anywhere in Pinehurst or Southern Pines. We took an Uber to Pinehurst and back for less than $20 round trip.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Felicia's home is absolutely beautiful. We stayed here for a night after a long car trip and it was a truly welcome oasis. I would highly recommend visiting!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect! What a wonderful retreat. The accommodations were exactly as advertised. It was so nice to have our own space for a few days. The views and location were fabulous. Check-in with Felicia was seamless.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely fell in love with this beautiful, unique space from the moment we drove up. So sad we didn't book more nights, but absolutely will be back for a future visit. The whole area is so charming. The neighborhood is magical. And the treehouse itself is beautifully-furnished and such a lovely place to get away from it all and just relax (while still being just a couple minutes from all the amenities you could ever want or need.) We also really appreciated the 10 pm ""quiet hours"" in the community, which provided an extra layer of peace and relaxation. A total gem of an airbnb from check-in to check-out! Thanks for a great stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved everything about the treehouse. We can’t wait to go back in the future!!

2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and cozy place to stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely, unique property in a quiet location. Property kind of reminds me of something you would see in a classic James Bond movie - just is kind of retro and different. Excellent location minutes from Pinehurst Resort and all that Pinehurst has to offer. Very clean with nice features (i.e., pretty views from deck, etc.) and amenities (i.e., very walk in large shower, etc.). Check-in and check-out very straightforward and easy. We enjoyed our stay very much."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful time in Pinehurst for a wedding! The tree-house is beyond cute & we’re looking forward to coming back for a longer stay soon! Perfect for a little weekend getaway :)
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay was beyond perfect. The treehouse is such a unique stay and the perfect location to anything you would like to do or need. Felicia has thought of all the right touches to make your stay comfortable, clean, and welcome. The decor is perfectly knotty! We loved the balcony with a view of the lake and the floor to ceiling windows with views of the golf course and the addition of all the sunlight. We highly recommend a stay with Felicia and her Knotty Treehouse."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely adorable little place to stay. The light and surroundings are gorgeous, the pace of life there is pleasant and unhurried, and Felicia was an attentive and gracious host. Well worth it!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oh, how I enjoyed my stay in Felicia's lovely treehouse! I chose this listing because it looked creative and charming, with spacious views, and I had a good deal of reading , writing, and study to do in just a few days. I needed a serene space with expansive views. Felicia's home was all of that and more. The space is SO creative, the kitchen well-equipped, the home spotless, the neighbors friendly, the decor creative. The treehouse has lovely, full-length windows all around, and they open to serene views of a golf course in the back and a sparkling lake in the front. And I could read and study on the deck until it got too dark to see, all the while watching the beautiful colors in changing sunsets. The home feels tucked-away, but Pinehurst is just a short drive away for food and fun. This was a solo trip for me, but I've already raved about it to my husband, and I'd go back in a heartbeat. Thank you for a lovely stay, Felicia."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Breathtaking is the only word I can use to explain this home, Felicia is on a whole different level..exquisite!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The venue was exactly what I was looking for. It came stocked with everything needed. The fiance and I wanted a small two day getaway to celebrate him finishing his military contract as well as expecting our first child together. It waa very peaceful and close by to shopping, resturants, and activities. One night we stayed in and the next we went to Red's Corner and a sip and paint. We are planning to come back in the future."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Do not hesitate to book the Knotty But Nice Treehouse. It is so unique, cozy, well-appointed, and CLEAN. The location is central to nearly anything you could want to do in Pinehurst, and the community is very picturesque and quiet. You can tell from the moment you enter that Felicia puts a lot of effort into making sure guests have a great experience."
