2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent house for a girlfriend reunion while visiting our undergrad Lycoming College. Comfortable, quiet, four beds, two bathrooms, with super comfortable couch and soft seating. We weren’t there enough to enjoy/use the full and fairly stocked kitchen, outdoor seating, or backyard fields but it was nice knowing they were there. Duane was super responsive and helpful with any needs. We’d definitely return for another visit and highly recommend. Very clean and not cluttered at all. Two nights at a local two queen bed hotel would have cost more - plus at Duane’s we each had our own bed, 3 BRs, 2 bathrooms, kitchen access w/ coffee pot, and an amazing living room for long talks."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place! It felt right at home. Loved the park like setting !
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as expected, no unpleasant surprises. House was very clean, quiet area, no homes next door. We were able to watch a baseball game that was across the lawn and visit with the locals. Game was over at a reasonable time and it was nice amenity."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house. Communication was top shelf from Duane. Even offered later check out if we wanted to stay a bit later.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Diane’s place was clean, comfortable, and accurate to the description.
Our host was informative and effectively communicated leading up to our stay.
We didn’t need anything because everything was provided."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect space for our group. Nice sized kitchen, fun backyard, and plenty of sleeping options. We had a great stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great stay at Duane's place. The home was clean,, comfortable and roomy. The beds were extremely comfortable and the hosts were friendly, responsive and helpful. Everyone in our group had good things to say about Duane's place and we would be happy to stay there again on future visits to the Williamsport area. This place desrves the highest rating."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Everything about this place was perfect. Nice size with ample space in the living room and kitchen for everyone to gather. The the bedrooms were good -- beds very comfortable. Lots of room to park in a nice quiet neighborhood. Easy to park. Duane was great to work with -- he communicated often and let us know everything we needed to know in a timely fashion. Especially appreciated the non GPS directions to the house. If you stay here, be sure to follow those closely. We really enjoyed our stay here."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was exactly as described. It was very clean, quiet and comfortable. Also very well equipped. The location was perfect for us, we rode our bikes on the Pine Creek rail trail and hiked the waterfall hike at the Rickett's Glen State Park. It is a short drive to many good restaurants in Williamsport."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay at Duane's place was perfect for our daughter's graduation from Lycoming College. The house is about 10 minutes from the college and away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Williamsport. We found everything to be clean, working, and accessible. No strange idiosyncrasies like having to use a work-around to anything. The house is at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac and backs up to a ball field with plenty of green space, and was very quiet and peaceful. Would definitely recommend and would stay here again. Thanks Duane!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Duane's house was great! Very quiet and comfortable. The only thing missing was a TV.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay for a softball weekend tournament. The house was clean and had everything we needed. We would 100% stay there again!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was welcoming and restful. the overall ambience of the space was very relaxing and informative in a lot of ways. Helpful information about the area, building, and it's history taught me things I didn't know about Williamsport, despite living there for 15yrs. I would definitely return to this place if available when I come back to Williamsport."
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Host very attentive and answered quickly.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Extremely cool place with interesting art and a cool old building.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I’d love to stay at Ashley’s studio again! We wish we had had more time to hang out and enjoy the space while we were there. She is an excellent host. Her description of her AirBnB and her directions to access the studio were clear and helpful.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Would definitely stay here again, what a calm, beautiful space! The bed was super comfy, too. The Pajama factory is a fascinating place to just wander through. The Buzzsaw Cafe was delicious. Just another thing to love about Williamsport!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a phenomenal stay. Such a unique and beautiful space. It was quiet and peaceful and the energy was immaculate.
We loved having 2 buildings to explore, enjoy, and take in the art.
Make sure to have a long charging cord with you if you want your phone to reach into the loft bed with you at bedtime."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,:)
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,was just as described and a great bargain.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cool location! Great price and the bed was soooo comfy. We liked it so much we went back on our drive home.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful loft! The vibe was everything. Soo much to do and see in the rest of the Pajama Factory. It really felt like home for the weekend. I'm used to RV kitchens and even without a full set up in the room it was perfect for making small meals and my morning coffee. I loved all the personal touches in the room. Perfect for a solo retreat or to share.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The bed was incredibly comfortable. I loved the reading selections in the sitting area and the oracle cards! It was like this place wanted me to come and stay! Thanks for the great experience. Makes me wish we lived closer so we could come more often.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great and unique place to stay. Definitely worth a visit for the novelty of the stay alone
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I feel so lucky I was able to stay at this place! With Ashley’s instructions it was very easy to get inside and the location of the studio felt private and peaceful. It was a personal treat and I recommend this place to anybody who is looking for an inspirational place, wants to focus on a project or just to spend a good time. The factory at night feels almost surreal, there is art everywhere and if you meet any people outside the studio,they are all super friendly. There is a wonderful souvenir shop, you can spend easily an hour or two there. Coffee at the coffee shop is top notch. I really hope to stay there again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Everything is listed as described. Even small details like providing water, paper towels, tissues. Thank you for the minor details. I enjoyed my stay when I needed an emergency place to stay after working night shift."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ashley's place is excellent for a stay. The Pajama Factory is very special place. You are living in an art gallery. The shared bathroom on the floor is nearby and everyone kept it clean while I was there. It was never an issue. Ashley was great at communications. I would easily go back.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay for the most part. Later in the night kids were screaming through the pipes profanity. This went on for a few hours. Besides this, the place was clean, parking was easy, and it was a nice self-care retreat."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Thank you!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Will definitely be back.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay for a few days, like I did, while visiting family. Ashley's instructions were clear and detailed, and it's really nice to see the work of a creative community at the Pajama Factory. The room was comfortable, and it had a guitar in it, which was very soothing. Not sure if that will be there forever, though. Thanks, Ashley."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful and calming space
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I found an oasis at Ashley’s when I needed it most. She was just so kind and helpful. Her studio was calming, cozy and welcoming after long days visiting my mom nearby at UPMC. Truly a unique, zen experience within a culturally diverse and thriving arts community. Be sure to visit the Rust and Shine for treasures and Buzz Saw for the best coffee and service! Staying at the historic Pajama Factory was truly a one of a kind experience that I was meant to find! Thank you Ashley! Will certainly be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Ashley was very friendly and responsive.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We adored our stay!!
Such a cozy and unique atmosphere.
Buzzsaw Coffee below was excellent and it was incredible to explore all the art throughout the factory. Would definitely stay again. Thank you so much!!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean. The bed was very comfortable and there were many restaurant choices. Within a 10 minute drive. It was definitely worth the price.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was amazing. The energy from the room is extremely peaceful. The courtyard is an amazing place to sit and relax read a book, play some games, or just soak in the sun (I haven’t been here during the winter) but all in all a great place to stay a couple nights or if you’re passing through and need a place to rest your head for the night. This is the place!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed at Ashley’s a few times and it was great every time.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic stay, Ashley's studio is lovely and calming! Pajama Factory is a beautiful space with an amazing community of creatives. Everything was exactly as Ashley described and I was able to chat with both her and her cohost. Any questions were answered immediately and it was very easy to check in and out. Studio was spotless, comfortable and absolutely wonderful to come back to - this will be my default airbnb in Williamsport from now on! =)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great place , great private location"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Place was comfortable clean and quiet just what I needed.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, peaceful spot! Loved exploring the Pyjama Factory as well"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ashley’s place is amazing!! The space itself is clean, comfortable, peaceful, and beautiful. We checked in smoothly and found the spot quickly thanks to Ashley’s clear instructions. The Pajama Factory is itself a destination and an amazing place to explore. We would come back to Williamsport just to stay at Ashley’s place and explore some more."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quite an eclectic apartment!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved it! The Pajama Factory is such a unique place, and Ashley’s studio was the perfect way to experience it. Funky design, clean and comfortable space, and all the basics covered. What a treat to be able to walk out of your room and enjoy a multi-story art gallery! We had fun wandering the halls at night and enjoying excellent coffee at the cafe downstairs in the morning. Close to downtown as well, it was just right for a weekend getaway. Definitely not one to miss!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed for one night on my way home, after 11 days on the road. Ashley's place was clean and comfortable. The building is a real live/work artist space, with many studios and art lining the hallway walls. Everyone I met was kind and welcoming. I slept very well in a comfortable bed. It was quiet at night and felt very safe. I would love to stay again if I pass through in the future!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I had an emergency work trip & this was very last minure for 2 nights. Ashley was so helpful & responded quickly which helped ease the rush of my trip. She was so friendly and even suggested places to unwind after my long work week. The space is like an art heaven & I fell In love! super cool! def staying here again in the near future! 🖤
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Atmospheres is a breath of fresh air! I travel for work, and I’m usually just looking for a place that I can get a peaceful night of sleep, the bed is comfortable, the sheets soft and clean, and I certainly did sleep well.
She has lots of amenities, and I really enjoyed having the desk/kitchen area to prepare my coffee and my breakfast, as well as having a table that made it feel more like home and less like camping or a hotel.
This apartment is most certainly full of good energy. It will absolutely encourage you to partake in some yoga, or be inspired by the art pieces surrounding you to create your own.
The building is incredible and the coffee shop downstairs if fantastic.
I could go on, but suffice to say I loved my Airbnb so much that I might just come back for pleasure instead of work 🥰"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Good location
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love this place and Soo great spiritual to make myindful to good vibes and peaceful. Love this place with many beautiful colors and design of room that's what I like it.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful and inspiring artistic community haven with Peaceful and orderly quarters.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique space! The host has really thoughtful of everything in this space and responds quickly. It is truly an artist loft which is beautifully decorated with lots of little touches. My 4 year old and I slept so peacefully in the comfy bed! The floor unit kept us perfectly cool in the hot summer.
The neighborhood is diverse with a mixture of grand Victorian style homes and even a bowling alley. Within 6 minutes from the PJ Factory we went on bicycle rides at the river, and had locally roasted coffee. Around every corner in the PJ Factory are cute space that just make you smile. So many plants, nooks, and spaces to read, play pool or other games! The court yard space is UNBELIEVABLE! So many beautiful plants and flowers! Lots of seating, outdoor grill, cornhole, and life size jenga.
I felt super safe and everyone I encountered was so nice. There's a soul food truck vendor literally right out side the door. I doubt you will find anything as interesting as this in the area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"On a trip passing through Williamsport, I had the pleasure of being one of the first guests staying at this new Airbnb located in the Pajama Factory.
I used this Airbnb as a remote work location. Having the desk area inside allowed for a quiet base for remote work to take calls. Having the other amenities of the Pajama factory close by such as the Coffee Shop and outdoor courtyard allowed for additional work locations throughout the days. This location also was a great spot to have as a base to explore Williamsport after work. With being <10 min drive to downtown restaurants, and a short connection to the bike trail as well.
The Airbnb itself was charming and well-maintained. It was clean, comfortable, and cozy. The host was friendly and responsive. Staying at this Airbnb in the Pajama Factory was a memorable and enjoyable experience. This unique setting and cozy accommodation made it a great choice for a remote work getaway while passing through PA."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here for work and was not in the apartment much; however, I wish I had more time to explore. The neighbors in the building were friendly too! This was my first time ever renting an AirBnB and I hope the rest of my experiences go as smoothly as this one! Sara answered any and all questions I had and I highly recommend anyone traveling to Williamsport who needs a clean and cozy place to stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed the stay at Sara's place while in town for an event at Penn College. Exactly as described and in a cool building.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Eclectic, quirky, and unique are all good words to describe the apartment and the building. The apartment is as it appears in the photos. Recommend stopping by Buzzsaw Coffee and Rust and Shine (gifts and antiques with multiple vendors in one location). Wish I had more time to explore the art work and artist studios. As a solo female traveler, I preferred arriving during the daytime. The area is not well lit at night."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great stay! Thank you so much
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great option for pet-friendly, great communication throughout booking / stay process. During the day, seemed like a quaint, nice place for an artistic- minded person. At night, it was low lit and parking was undefined, which was a little unsettling. Overall, would recommend and stay again. Sara is an excellent host, and accommodated all of our needs."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was just like our artist loft in Boston!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Although short, we really enjoyed our stay at Sara’s! Very cozy space and lots of great art to look at in the loft, as well as the Pajama Factory. Highly recommend. :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sara was very helpful, responsive, and flexible with our stay and we can’t thank her enough! The place had a very artsy and cool vibe, and the location was close to the hospital which we needed. It also had all the essentials and was very clean."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed a lovely overnight stay. Clear instructions were helpful in getting checked in. We could have spent hours checking out all the art & the history of the Pajama Factory. A truly cool updated use of a historic building. Our studio was decorated so fun & funky. Very clean and comfy. Would definitely stay again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So much character yet plenty of space to do what you need (work, cook, relax, sleep). PJ factory is awesome!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the uniqueness of the studio. We liked exploring the artwork on all the floors. The location of the factory is perfect to access the downtown shops, restaurants and breweries."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Such a great place for an inspired, restful stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really fantastic loft apartment with tasteful artsy furniture and amenities. I stayed for a month and loved it, working from home (wifi is solid) and cooking most meals. Really tastefully decorated and the giant window provides lots of natural morning light. Loft is in a former warehouse that has been converted to many artist studios and loft apartments. The hallways are rough wooden floors unchanged from the old factory, with art of all kinds everywhere. The Buzzsaw coffee shop that is connected to the building is fantastic, and has the strongest espresso I've ever had. And I've had a lot. Recommended."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It is a hidden treasure within the city!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful spot!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Sara's loft at the Pajama Factory for 4 nights while I worked in the Williamsport area. I found the space very refreshing and well appointed. Residing in an old Pajama Factory made for a very unique stay. The whole property has an extremely positive energy. The timing for my stay here couldn't have been better. The day before my stay I had actually submitted my 2 week resignation letter to the company I have worked at for over 15 years. I will be making a fairly substantial career change in that I will be starting my own business. After getting the key from the lockbox and entering the building I step into the elevator and notice a plaque with a quote on it above the buttons: ""If at first you do succeed ... try something harder"". The last place I would have guessed to find such a powerful sign of motivational inspiration. I highly recommend this place."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Pajama Factory site is definitely one of a kind. The apartment is comfy and Sara answered all questions (especially in the early arranging) clearly and honestly.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So grateful this place exists! We booked last minute for a wedding and it was great.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The loft was a very cool space! You honestly walk through an art museum to get there and there are bunch of other cool businesses right near by. Will definitely be trying to book here again next time we are in the area!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved your place! We enjoyed the artwork and pottery you had, and being able to wander around the building and seeing all the other artwork. We really enjoyed the games and activities you had at your place as well and when I had questions, you graciously responded immediately. Thank you for sharing your place with us."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sara was so sweet and very responsive. The apartment is very cool and absolutely gorgeous. Convenient to the venue and perfect for us to use while preparing for my daughter’s big day.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sara's home was full of art and beauty that I've never seen before! 10/10 would reccomend trying to stay as soon as possible.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful cozy loft located in an amazing building!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really loved staying here. The host was kind, proactive, and had the place ready to go with only 20 minutes of notice from us booking to arrival. Great place to stay with our two pups - with plenty of areas nearby to take them out. I’d recommend staying here if you’ve got some down time — you’ll definitely want to wander the halls and check out all of the art. Grab a coffee and a book and spend some time in the gorgeous courtyard too.
My only complaint is that the couch is not stable or big enough for someone to sleep on. Thankfully we didn’t need it, but we would’ve been disappointed if we had."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Unique space. A little difficult to find but host’s instructions with photos and communication were extremely helpful.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, unique place to stay. Sara was easy to work with. Very clear instructions made check-in easy."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quirky and comfortable in a cool historic building. Buzzsaw coffee downstairs is fantastic. Sara is a responsive host. Looking forward to our next stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Don't judge this book by the cover. The pajama factory is something that needs to be experienced from the inside. The people and community are truly wonderful. This space matches the vibe - incredibly unique. Modern in all the right places. Next time we are in town we will check here first. What airbnb was meant to be.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you want more than just a place to stay then this is a gem! We spent hours exploring And talking to the people that live and work there. There’s everything from a radio station to a top notch coffee shop. We will stay there every time we come into town!! I promise you’ll never find a more captivating place to stay .
Here’s the down side , I would be glad to pay a little more for better furniture and bed. What’s there is barely adequate I’m sorry to say 🥵 I get why Sara decided to furnish it the way she did but there is a lot of room for improvement 😢
The positive far out way the few negatives trust me 👍"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Really enjoyed this place overall. The building is quiet and safe. Sara was a very friendly host. Quick tip for those looking for kitchen equipment: some of the drawers have a second drawer within them that isn’t immediately obvious - I didn’t discover them until near the end of my stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay. Felt safe. Was fun to explore around the property. Will definitely stay again next time we are in the area.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time. People in the community were friendly and helpful. The art community and warehouse reno spectacular! The outside lockbox was the only challenging piece. We'll stay there again, given the opportunity."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great stay - great communication and helpful.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment was very cute and clean. We were there for a college graduation so our stay was short and if we ever come back, we’d stay there again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sara and her place was fantastic! Everything was exactly how she laid it out. It was clean, modern, unique and peaceful place to stay. Highly recommend if you are in Williamsport 🤘"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, no issues, everything was perfect."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Love this place! A great studio with everything you need in a unique and inspiring space. The host was responsive and welcoming and more accommodating for our needs. Super comfy bed, beautiful murals. Fantastic art throughout the factory and a great coffee spot on the fist floor of the building. Wouldn't hesitate to come back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My second time staying at this venue but different room. This room was even better. Will stay again for sure.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice stay! I enjoyed my time here and felt super safe :)
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host: Sara really does go above and beyond in response to both her human and canine guests' needs. Her responses are immediate, professional and effective. And it is clear that she cares greatly about the loft and her guests' experience there.
The loft: A true New York City loft...in Williamsport, PA?!
The Pajama Factory: Not at all a ""usual name"" for something in this part of the country, but it actually WAS the largest pajama factory in the world at one time (at the ground floor elevator entry, note the photos of Doris Day and Rock Hudson in the associated films). Now it is becoming a community, including artists' lofts, venues for local activities, and the best coffee brewer in the city. And, while staying in the Airbnb, you can walk (with your dog!) through hallways of original, beautiful, inspiring artwork! So difficult to believe that this is a real place!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a cool, eclectic building! The room itself featured some funky vintage & original art pieces, books, games, puzzles. It was clean, spacious, and bright! Everything you need is right there, and the environment is great for exploring.
We’ll be back!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I’m a writer by profession, so writing an accurate description is not normally a challenge…but, this..Pajama Factory!?, has me stumped. Neither words nor photos can truly represent what this place is. I’ve lived in Tokyo, NYC, LA..and I haven’t ever come across anything like this before.
..and it is in Williamsport, PA, of all places…Wegmans Grocery Store is a big deal in this town.
But, hidden in plain sight, there is this incredibly restored factory with hallways full of artwork, and artists’ lofts, and supercool humans, and the best dogs! And this Airbnb is a real factory loft!?!? Like the kind that I’d only ever seen in movies or TV shows like Suits. And the whole place is accessible, from the curbless shower to the thoughtful open floor plan to the building elevator (which, itself, becomes a work of art after sundown). I really cannot thank Sara enough for presenting this space on Airbnb and for her impeccable hosting of this one-of-a-kind experience."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I’ve stayed at this location twice now and loved it both times! Sara is a fantastic host. Everything in the listing is super clear and accurate. The space is beautiful. Overall this place is an easy 10/10.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay. Thanks Sara for your hospitality and also the puppy time!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This studio is great - creative feel with perfect amenities.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sara’s Airbnb is a cool and quirky apartment located inside an old Pajama Factory that’s been renovated into a mixed-use hive of artists and makers. It’s also home to the best coffee roaster in Williamsport. Grab a Honey Cinnamon Latte before you set out to explore Williamsport. It’s crazy-delicious and expertly made.
Conveniently located just minutes from everything Williamsport has to offer, from restaurants and bars to the Susquehanna River, I highly recommend Sara’s Airbnb for your stay."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very beautiful place, lots of gorgeous artwork everywhere you looked. So many trinkets and pottery pieces that I was in love with. A little hard to find and instructions were a little confusing, but overall a peaceful stay"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Of you have the chance to stay here, do so! It's perfect for a couple or single person and has so much to do just in the factory alone! The space is mid mod industrial and really compliments the factory vibe. Great stuff!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Very eclectic building with lots of history. Very quiet at night which we appreciated and great little coffee shop downstairs. Would definitely stay again.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place for a short stay! There is a kitchen but we found it wasn’t quite ready for people actually wanting to use it, missing things like a baking sheet and towels. Sara was willing to drop off things we needed, but it would have been nice to need to ask for them.
The location is fantastic and it’s easy to check in/find the unit. The instructions were clear (even included photos) and Sara was available if we needed help (quick to respond).
While there are some additional comforts we would have appreciated, the value was great and we enjoyed our stay. We would recommend to anyone looking for a few easy going nights in Williamsport."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sara’ place is great - arty, funky and fun! The building is historic and such a dramatic change from the norm.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sara's place is very very cool! I wanted to stay longer to really appreciate the surroundings. The WiFi worked well, the kitchen was perfectly clean, and the neighbors in the building were all super friendly. Would recommend, especially if you're looking for something that's more fun than a roadside hotel/motel. The town has lots of cool restaurants, and we enjoyed walking Millionaire's Row."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sara's airbnb is so relaxing. Great space to stay in the area. Make sure to grab a cup of coffee and check out the game room in the same factory!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is fantastic to see an old factory turned into such a great and creative use of space! This Air bnb is an adorable studio apartment filled with beautiful artwork, creative touches, and thoughtful amenities. Sara has done a wonderful job with this space, and it was a perfect girls' night getaway for me and my daughter. Easy to find and just moments away from Penn Tech for a college visit. Make sure to walk the other floors at the Pajama Factory to see the artwork! Shout out to Rich at Naked Glass Studio who graciously invited us in to see his fabulous stained glass projects! We also highly recommend eating at Harvest Moon Family Restaurant.... don't let the convenience store and gas station fool you! The staff was welcoming, decor was cozy, and the food was amazing!!! (Hazlenut spread stuffed French toast ....wow!) Thank you, Sara, for a lovely and memorable stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This loft is as authentic as it gets. Such an amazing building and the suite is very cozy and comfortable. Loved it. Sara was a great host.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a terrific and very unique space. If you like old buildings and factories this stay will be a special treat! Everything was very clean, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was in great shape. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure in the rainfall shower. We ended up not cooking/eating in but the kitchen is well stocked for those who want to use it. Please note that the sofa does not have a pullout bed, but it is long enough for someone to sleep on."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed the quirky studio apartment but the neighborhood.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described and what a lovely place! I just wish I had more time to explore every floor! The coffe shop downstairs was wonderful as well!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The sister loft was very nice, clean, and made great use of the space. What a great use of old industrial buildings. My town is littered with them and I wish they’d be used in a similar fashion. The stay was inspirational, with lovely vendors, art, and outside spaces."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This our 2nd stay in Sara's studio and it was just as memorable as our last visit! A real gem, we highly recommend this delightful spot in Williamsport. You won't be disappointed with the accommodations in this renovated building and all the amenities that it has to offer. The courtyard is spectacular to enjoy after a day of hiking or exploring Williamsport. Many thanks again Sara for being so welcoming and allowing us to use your place again!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! Everything was exactly as described and pictured - a super cool and creative space with an eclectic and welcoming creative community surrounding. The bed was also the most comfortable Airbnb bed I’ve ever stayed in, and I’ve been in a lot. Sara is easy to reach and coordinated everything beautifully. Highly recommend!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Easy check in. We used this space for my sisters wedding party to get ready and do hair and makeup. Wonderful lighting and plenty of photo opportunities through the space and building.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the loft at the Pajama Factory was a perfect weekend getaway for my wife and I on our babymoon
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really loved the Pajama factory! The creative vibe there is great and all the people we ran into were friendly and welcoming. Sara’s place had everything we could have needed and she was very responsive and helpful.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We have stayed in many Airbnbs & this one is by far the most unique & special! We loved the artsy loft vibe & exploring the area!
We highly recommend this sensational Airbnb stay!"
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This modern, artistic, clean and comfortable loft studio apartment is a taste of downtown living in a renovated urban scene. Young people occupy the studio spaces up and down the hallways and there is quite a lot of creative energy concentrated here. It is especially suited for young people."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Super neat historic building and unique space! The space has everything you need, including neat old games! Sara gave very clear and detailed instructions for check-in, which was nice as it's a little complicated. Unfortunately, it was NOT clean. It was tidy; the linens were laundered and dishes washed, but it was not clean."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and space. Definitely recommend!!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wanna stay at a loft that will surround you with beautiful artwork and history? Do yourself a favor and book a stay at Sara's studio loft at the Pajama Factory. You will be very happy you did - the loft has large 'factory' windows with plenty of natural light and artsy/ industrial design which compliments the history of the pajama factory. I spent such a relaxing evening exploring the factory via the awesome elevator and being a part of the history in Williamsport.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay here. It's the perfect bohemian/artsy apartment. The music selection was a great touch, and we enjoyed the games/books. The bed is comfortable, the shower is the best of any Airbnb we've stayed at yet... and we get around quite a bit. There was plenty of local hiking to explore over the weekend. Highly recommend and we will definitely be back!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you are looking for a unique, local experience for your stay in the Susquehanna Valley, look no further - Sara’s space at the Pajama Factory was exactly what I was looking for. I’ve been staying in the area a few times a year for over a decade, and the last three years I’d found an Airbnb where the hosts became like family & I didn’t look elsewhere. They sold their home last year & I’ve been dreading trying to find somewhere else that didn’t feel like an impersonal, hotel chain experience - that also took dogs, & wasn’t more expensive than a hotel. I hit the jackpot finding this place - it was probably the coolest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed, actually. It was like staying in an artists’ collective/dorm, and getting an inside glimpse into the art scene in Williamsport which I had no idea was so robust. The actual building itself was so cool - I could’ve spent another 3 days just exploring and taking photos. The courtyard has multiple seating areas, for rain or shine. The studio itself has big, beautiful windows that look out onto the courtyard - they were my favorite part of the space for sure. Cool bathroom with nice rain shower & detachable shower head, little stove & fridge, cool wood floors & art throughout the space - Sara makes stained glass pieces and I actually bought one she had in her window because it was so beautiful! The space was great for my dogs, & it was the perfect setup for 1 or 2 people to make a temporary home. My iPhone wouldn’t work with the plug for the TV so if TV is a must for you, might want to make sure you bring the right equipment to be able to plug in! Also would recommend packing as light as possible if you’re only one person staying - you’ll need to bring everything through the courtyard, past 2 locked doors, up an elevator & down the hall so making more than a trip or two might be a bit much! Sara is super responsive and helpful; I needed help figuring out how to open the window, then wanted hiking suggestions, and she always responded in a timely and helpful manner! People/artists I encountered in the building were all very friendly and welcoming. All in all this Airbnb was a total WIN for me and I look forward to coming back!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, convenient,
Artsy and fun!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful stay! This studio was super cozy, fun, and unique. I definitely recommend staying here if you’re in the area!!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend staying here, especially if you're looking for a quiet, relaxing, one-of-a-kind weekend getaway. This place is so much fun: there's a screen for watching movies, lots of CDs and a sound system, coloring books, games, and a kitchen stocked with all the utensils and appliances you could need. The building itself is filled with beautiful, unique artwork, and you're free to explore the hallways and courtyard. The apartment was clean and cozy. Sara was also a wonderful host, helpful and communicative.
Plus, an added perk is that there's lots of hiking anywhere from 20-40 mins away by car!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, unique location close to hiking, antique stores, and good food."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sara was a great host - timely, communicative & helpful. The space was stunning; tastefully furnished and decorated, light pours into the airy loft, the bed, dining table and sofa are all perfect for relaxing. Definitely recommend booking a stay here"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cool studio - perfect for a weekend trip. We loved our stay. All of the furniture was comfortable, even the couch - something that is not normal in air bnbs we’ve had in the past. Also loved looking at all of the artwork throughout the building."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a very unique stay for those who are more adventurous and enjoy local art and artists. The queen bed was comfortable and the building was extremely quiet at night for a good night's rest; it was a bit more active during the day with artists and visitors walking about. The light play in the building is amazing for taking photographs, the artists-in-residence are very friendly and accommodating, and it is very fun to explore the wide array of art displays throughout the factory. The host shared very good directions for check-in, which are more detailed than most. I loved that we could bring our dog with us and walk to Peg & Bill's Diner for breakfast in the morning. Also, be sure to visit Mr. Sticky's for the world's most decadent cinnamon buns."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place to stay! The studio was so cute and cozy, and the artwork was super cool!"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay thank you!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sara’s place is great—clean, large, fully equipped, cozy and lots of character. The building is primarily occupied by artists workshops, not residential apartments, adding an exciting dynamic and energy to the space. Noise, footsteps, conversations, etc pass through the walls and floors easily throughout the day but at night all is peaceful, quiet and relaxing."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. Would definitely stay again.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. Check in was easy. Parking was a bit crowded, but there was plenty in the back lot. Host was quick to answer any questions. And there was plenty to do and see around the area. Would absolutely stay here again, such a unique spot!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had the best time at Sara’s place. The building is so cool, and we had fun exploring it. Our dog loved running around the courtyard in the snow, and the tea and hot chocolate were so nice in a cold winter day!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are considering staying here, stop considering and make the reservation. This place is full of character and charm. The artists that work there and other tenants are polite and welcoming. The place is clean and bright with a beautiful open design. Sara has a great taste in music and art which her loft reflects. I had a great time here and would recommend it to anyone."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The apartment’s building is pretty unique. I loved it. I do pay attention to little details so the blacklight glowing elevator shaft was very cool. The bed was really soft. Also they had cool old toys that I got addicted to.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely stay! The building is so unique and unlike anywhere I’ve ever stayed before. I loved the open feel of the loft and would stay here again!

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great space! Exactly as it was pictured and described. The place was clean, comfortable, and perfect for our weekend stay during Victorian Christmas. If we have reason to be in the area again, we will certainly stay here."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,an amazing space in a delightfully quirky art oasis.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect spot for a getaway. Great location. Clean and fun style!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sara’s place was very unique and inviting. It was the perfect tucked away spot for a weekend getaway in a cool location. If you didn’t want to, you’d never have to leave the building. Will be back for sure!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fabulous! Start to Finish!! Highly recommend!!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Artsy and eclectic. Sweet breakfast snacks provided. Good space. Art galleries are incredible.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We did not expect artsy and funky. It was a nice surprise! The renovated building has a bit of a worn appearance from the outside. The inside spaces are lined with art displayed by the artists living in the apartments. It was an enjoyable walk around the two floors before we left. Our apartment was comfortable, well set up and provided a comfortable bed, shower and sitting area. We enjoyed our overnight stay."
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Pajama Factory is wonderful! So cool and funky. We loved the building, community, and the space in the loft. It's roomy and decorated well without being cluttered. Lots of room for sitting in different areas (couch, chairs, table, etc) which made it easy for my husband and I to get some work done. Great little nooks outside in the courtyard as well. Definitely recommend staying there! Sara was also incredibly attentive when we asked for a few items."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,💛
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Check in was easy with the instructions. The loft was beautiful and more than I could’ve expected. Thank you Sara!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is fantastic! Super cool, funky, inspiring space. Sara’s unit is great- spacious, high ceilings, giant window you can open to the courtyard, nice kitchen, great shower and a very comfortable bed, even for 6’5” guy with creaky bones. Parking is easy. So be prepared for a short schlep to get your stuff from the car to the unit. I brought a lot of stuff and stayed five nights. And, Sara was responsive, helpful and delightful. Highly recommend!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sara was communicative, quick, thorough, and an overall amazing host. The Loft was in a really gorgeous place. The feel was unmatched. The space was furnished with useful items that were also very aesthetically pleasing. It would serve as an amazing place to get away or just stop by."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a gem of a stay for us! One of a kind building for art lovers and a really special, comfortable, beautiful apartment. We loved everything about it."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time exploring the Pajamas factory. It was such a fun unique place to stay for the night. It was very quiet and at night it got dark which was great for sleeping. It also had a AC unit which was key for a good nights sleep as well. The apartment was clean and even had snacks,coffees and teas. The only downside for us was that we like to walk everywhere so it was a little far out of town but we knew that when we booked it. We walked downtown for dinner but got a Lyft back since it is kinda far. Great stay for the price!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was a very interesting experience. It was very cool with a walking dead community kinda feeling. We loved it.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay at Sara’s loft inside an old factory now repurposed an artistic haven. As a photographer I can definitely appreciate the vibe and history of it, it is one if the most unique places I stayed at.
Otherwise furnished with all the modern amenities you could ask for. The TV might not have cable, but that’s not what I traveled to Williamsport for, and I brought my iPad anyways; so I could spend the little free time I had streaming shows with a good wifi connection.
The Pajama Factory also felt very safe. Which was a great plus for me as I was on my way back home from the NY side of Niagara Falls (which unfortunately didn’t feel safe despite the beautiful scenery).
I would highly recommend Sara’s loft for anyone traveling to Williamsport, especially if you appreciate art and history."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great old factory repurposed. Sara did a very nice job of decorating the space. Very clean. She was super accommodating and very quick communication. She’s a wonderful host. Make sure to enjoy the courtyard while you’re there. And take a self guided tour of the entire factory. It’s pretty cool.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Absolutely unique, fun, artsy, special kind of place. Not your typical run of the mill airbnb. If you're tired of the same old same old, give this give this spot a try. It will not disappoint. Sarah is super responsive. Really enjoyed my stay. Would definitely recommend."
2021-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Though unique and different, overall this place just needs to be better maintained.
Kitchen table had a few broken support arms.
TV was small and, worst of all, was inoperable since there was no in-coming cable line.
Oven hadn't been cleaned well in some time- open the broiler, and the top was caked with dust.
Stainless steel cabinets - not a good idea. Hard to keep clean and shiny, and it showed.
You work a space with what you've got, but the fridge placement was awkward and made access a bit clumsy.
Garbage can was full and hadn't been emptied. Not good.
Some of the furniture hadn't been vacuumed and had pet hair.
Nice to have a CD player, speakers and a variety of CD's, but this doesn't help much when the player itself was inoperable. Checked the electrical lines, the outlet, played with the buttons - no go. Didn't work.
Toilet seat wasn't screwed down properly and was very loose.
A peak behind pictures and knick-knacks placed against the various sills showed layers of dust and cobwebs.
So - yeah - this space needed a MUCH better cleaning.
On the positive side, and most important to me - the bed was comfortable. I slept well.
The surroundings had a very cool, bohemian feel to it.
Most of the third floor, where the unit is located, was occupied by small businesses, which made for quiet evenings.
Unit access directions were spot on.
The variety of games, decorations and odds and ends were eclectic and appreciated.
It was very hot outside but the AC unit was adequate."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment and host! She was very quick to reply whenever we had questions. The apartment is very clean and comfortable. Also, it is very quiet in the building, especially at night, which is great for doing work and sleeping."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Expect a smooth, professional and overall enjoyable experience!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed from April to August and have so much to say about this amazing place!
First, Sara was incredibly communicative, it was easy to check in, and the pajama factory is such an amazing place. there is inspiring artwork both in the apt and all around. there are trails and hiking all around this spot and the place was clean, exactly as pictured, and an inspiring place. the courtyard that you walk through has every detail you could think of and is so relaxing to walk through after a long day of work. the apt was so well lit from unique and amazing original windows from the factory and overall it was an incredible experience from start to finish that I would gladly do again! Laundry is around the corner and easy to use and Sara was so helpful not only in suggestions but in any inquries. for example the washing machine went down and she was quick to respond and setup a fix for it! I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone looking to be in a unique, inspiring, and wonderful apt. Thanks so much for having me!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This trip was a work of art... literally! Sara was an amazing host, she was always quick to respond and answered all of our questions thoroughly. The loft was breathtaking, spacious and clean! We will definitely be coming back again."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Saras place was awesome! Totally resonated with the vibe the minute we walked in...so much that I was looking to rent a space of my own! Sara was also super informative about good hiking spots and we found some good breweries that were local also! We definitely will be back!

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved Sara’s place was perfect for a quick weekend getaway, building us really interesting and shops close by, even found a close by Mediterranean Restaurant 5 minutes walk away and had a great 4 course valentines dinner (Saffron’s Grill)."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sara is a great host, super accommodating and fast to respond! Her apartment in Pajama Factory is super cozy and provides a lot of fun activities for staying in. We enjoyed our stay snowboarding and visiting the New Trail Brewery, cannot wait to come back during the summer and explore the hiking trails!"
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,unique space 💜
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A nice place to stay. 👍🏻👍🏻
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wow! What a unique space with great vibes. The industrial style and design fits perfectly. Will absolutely stay here again.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the art surrounding this apartment and inside. Lovely place to stay.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute and unique space. Would love to come back some time!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute little artsy place! Would recommend again!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sara's place is a kaleidoscope of unique art and whimsical details. I loved my time there and was inspired by the concept of The Pajama Factory. The space is pretty industrial, so I was a little chilly but there were plenty of comfy blankets. I loved how hot the shower water was. We will definitely stay again when we're in Williamsport next!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An art haven in Williamsport. A lovely space in a really unique space. Sara was very clear with her instructions, and everything was as advertised. We had a great, relaxing two days visit. The bed is super comfy :)"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic—in a word. There is something very special about these accommodations that deserves explaining, concerning the “inner” and “outer” experience. First, the inner: it’s a studio, but a larger one that the pictures seems to show. There is plenty of space for a 2 people (we are a couple, in our early 60s), tall ceilings and a large, light-filled window occupying the better part of one wall. As for the outer experience: this third-floor studio is one part of a great whole, the Pajama Factory building, which is the vision—wholly realized, and ongoing—of an artist/community/commercial “happening” that doesn’t just fulfil a community (and human) need for such a place, but has, one can tell, helped bring it into being. To walk the halls on several floors is to feel a part of “art in progress,” not to mention all the artwork on display to admire. My feeling is that Williamsport is a significantly better place for its existence. (As to the activity in the building: have no concern, there is quiet and politeness throughout—you really get the sense that the people who come and go are truly happy to be a part of this.) And then fully outside: Williamsport is a cool little town, good restaurants, a river walk, other notable buildings and neighborhoods…and then beyond, the PA Grand Canyon area and state/other parks with hiking to impressive heights for amazing views—all within 20 – 30 minutes: this is a part of PA and our country that really deserves exploration…but which you can be sure will never be overrun and overcommercialized. Really a great experience!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space is great! We loved the art and common areas of the building. The rain shower head was my favorite part.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was so cool. Really comfortable and interesting space full of art. I wish I'd stayed there longer!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sara was a great host, and her loft was a very fun place to stay! The converted factory had a very cool, artistic vibe, from the blacklights in the elevator to the artwork in the hallways. The loft was spotlessly clean, and beautifully decorated. I highly recommend staying in this loft when in Williamsport!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sara's space in Williamsport is unique. The building is home to all type of creatives. For example, the hallway leading to Sara's unit is filled with art and while we were there a TEDx event took place in the courtyard. Sara's apartment is spacious for two people. The small kitchen is perfect for making breakfast in the morning. My mom and I really enjoyed our stay."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can't imagine a better bang for your buck in Williamsport. Sara is a terrific host and her place was unique and cozy. We kept busy with her provided games, music collection paints and instruments instead of staring at screens, to fully utilize everything this loft had to offer. We explored the building after check-out and found some super interesting businesses and very cool people. Would stay again."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and very unique! I would highly recommend.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed here while adventuring around and hiking for a couple days. The space is super unique and very artsy. One of the coolest places i have stayed in. Sara is quick to respond and her air bnb has the cutest touches. Comfortable bed and people there are really nice!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second time staying at Pajama loft. Such a unique and cool place. Sara’s spot is super sweet and really nice touches.
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Sara’s apartment at the Pajama Factory was lovely! Just like the pictures. If you like loft style living and artsy decor this place is for you. Sara went above and beyond with extra little amenities like small breakfast foods, wine and water! She was very responsive and we would stay again. Check out Saw Horse Cafe while you are there for coffee and stellar breakfast."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sara's chic, cool studio in the Pajama Factory will make your trip to Williamsport that much better. A cultural oasis, her apartment is surrounded by wonderful art and beautiful gardens. Nothing beats the relaxing courtyard after a day of exploring and hiking. The studio is spotless and nicely decorated. It's comfortable and has the finishing touches which complete the package. We highly recommend this studio."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little studio with everything you need to enjoy your stay in Williamsport. Good location with plenty things to do during the day, and a comfy bed to come home to at night. Staying at the Pajama Factory is a neat, quirky experience that everyone should get the chance to explore at least once."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sara's apartment was lovely! We loved the decor and Sara generously included snacks and wine! The apartment is very clean and had all the amenities we wanted for a weekend! The only con is that the walls are thin, so we could hear the neighbors."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome. Thanks
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed a few nights at Camille's Little Yellow House while visiting friends in the area. The house is in pristine condition, exactly as described. The garden is lovely! The neighborhood is perfect for taking a stroll and quiet, close to stores and popular attractions. Camille is quickly responsive to any concerns. We had a lovely stay and look forward to staying here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The most adorable little yellow house built by host's grandparents. Loved the story behind the house and the special touches such as a picture of her grandparents in the kitchen. House is more roomy than appears from the outside. The backyard was beautiful and only wish we would have been able to enjoy but, it rained most of our stay. It was a very convenient location to a lot of places and very close to family. Camille was very responsive to any questions I had. Would not hesitate to book again."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an overall great experience at this air b&b! It was very clean, had extra toiletries, and was in a very beautiful neighborhood close to many convenient surroundings! The only confusion was that there was no driveway but we made due with parking in the street, in addition the patio umbrella was not set up but the owner told us where it was in the shed. The pillows on the couch were a little scratchy, but nothing we couldn’t handle. The chairs in the living room were slightly uncomfortable as well. However, the backyard was beautiful with flowers and beautifully manicured. The natural lighting was nice and appreciated the backyard being gated for our service animals which she so kindly accepted. The beds were very comfortable as well. Overall 9/10 experience! Thank you so much and would be more than happy to stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"In town for a family birthday. A great place to come back to and relax. Beautifully decorated especially the art. Clean, comfortable, convenient.Hope to return."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for us to stay- it met all my family’s needs as we came for a pre- Christmas celebration. Camille even decorated her place beautifully and provided a Christmas tree! The place was immaculate - and very well equipped- especially her kitchen. It’s in a convenient location on a quiet street.
Charming !
We would love to come back."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family had a wonderful stay at Camille’s place. We were in Williamsport for the weekend visiting my husband who works there occasionally. We spent most of our time in the home but did wander off to Reptile Land and had dinner at a local restaurant with our kids. The space was perfect! It was spacious and felt cozy sitting in the living room. The beds were so comfy my 2 year old managed to take a 3 hour nap and actually slept the whole night! It was great because that left time for my husband and I to watch some movies on netflix. We even played ping pong in the basement ! Overall a very special space that Camille has. It was nice to see a picture of her grandparents in the kitchen. The space felt like there was a lot of love there and certainly has character to it. Thank you for hosting us. We’ll be back soon 😊💕
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family of four loved staying at Camille’s cozy home. We loved the decorations, soft blankets and how it felt like home. Camille’s kitchen had everything we needed to make meals including a beef roast in the oven. We highly recommend this home for your stay!"

The house was so clean and we loved how the character of the house was preserved. So much to do in the area. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cute yellow house must be the cutest, cleanest and most comfortable place I have stayed in.
The house is exactly as described, located between “the strip” and peaceful St Ann’s. Cute back yard, quiet. The updates on the house took me back to my childhood.
Camille was excellent with communication, and you can tell how sentimental the house is to her.
I would love to stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great two week stay! Felt right at home. Less than 10 minutes from the hospital. Quiet neighborhood off the main street. Close to restaurants, gas station, and a Giant nearby. Felt safe the entire time. The place has working appliances, high speed internet, full kitchen, AC, basement laundry, smart TV. The bathroom shower has hot water, and good pressure. I enjoyed my morning jogs to the trail which leads to the Susquehanna river. The house even has a garden in the back with fresh vegetables to pick from: cucumbers, tomatoes, herbs, and spices. Camille was very responsive, easy to reach, and accommodating. Any issues I had were quickly rectified. Would definitely stay again =)"

The house was well-appointed, very clean, easy to find, and within a short walk of the town center and a number of fine restaurants. Leslie's directions for entering the housexwere clear and she was very understanding when we had to delay our departure by half an hour because of a minor illness. I would happily stay here again."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Generally, very good. It is very convenient to get to - right off the street with 1 parking spot right in front of the the apartment. Easy loading and unloading. Leslie very responsive to communication which is a big plus.
It is right on the street, so typical street noise, which late at night was tough with little kids sleeping.
Place was as described with 2 nice bedrooms. Living room furniture is small, not real comfortable. Beds were fine. Shower was very small but the rest of the bathroom was nice. Kitchen area was nice with available coffee, snacks.
Cost is high but if you would need 2 separate rooms (i.e. 2 hotel rooms) this works out a little better."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, quiet, and comfortable space. Two blocks to food and an excellent coffee shop."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Leslie’s place was exactly as advertised and exactly what we needed! Everything was just right for myself and my sister and anything we needed/wanted was within walking distance. I recommend researching the area better than we did because we didn’t realize most places around us we wanted to visit we’re closed Sunday-Tuesday, but there were still options for grocery shopping, restaurants, brews, coffee, and shops. We were thankful to have this option and would definitely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a gem in downtown Williamsport. Ideal location that's within walking distance to all of the downtown restaurants and stores.

Staying here allowed us to still visit family and bring our fir baby with us. And you are within walking distance to everything down town including some grocery stores.

The space was spacious for two people and a dog, there were plenty of temporary storage spaces for our things, and it was nicely decorated without going overboard. The location was perfect and was only a short walk to restaurants, bars, and the theater. I was hesitant to book due to having a parking lot next door, but it was surprisingly quiet and not at all problematic. This place with its amenities and responsive host should be a model for all airbnbs!"

2023-03-01,2.0,Stayed about a week,"Honestly, not impressed with this Airbnb (the previous reviews had me fooled). Upon arriving, the place looks run down with trash all over the yard/ in the bushes. Once entering, it’s dark and musty. Majority of the cute homey decor has been removed. Upon making dinner my first night, there was food splattered all inside the microwave and crusted onto one of the utensils I attempted to use. They provide one kitchen towel and no paper towels to supplement. I took out the garbage— tons of trash and I don’t want to know what in the bottom under the bag, so gross! Bed was fine (not sure why previous reviews raved about it), but you hear every car passing by with the AC unit in the window making it nearly impossible to sleep even with a white noise machine. Further, several items were advertised in the listing/photos and were NOT provided: printer/ workspace, salt and pepper, extra bedding/ blankets and most importantly a fire extinguisher. As a Airbnb host myself, I was quite disappointed."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and cozy house with great restaurants in walking distance

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Love the proximity of this place to all the things to do in Williams for it! We come once a year and it makes staying up there so much nicer rather than having to stay cramped in a house with all of our immediate family! Justin and Emily‘s communication is great! The location is walking distance to so many things and the neighborhood is quiet! We will definitely stay again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First, watch your head going up the stairs. I'm just shy of six feet and I will hit it every time if I don't duck. There is no cable or streaming so bring your own laptop or notebook and HDMI cable if you want to stream Netflix or other streaming. The WIFI is pretty fast. The A/C consists of two window units which can be a bit loud. But they both work efficiently. The bed is great. The kitchen is good and well stocked with the essential kitchen gear. There is no dishwasher nor any kitchen table, just a bar for two. It's a very old house but has been nicely updated and is clean and everything in the apartment is in good work order. Overall, we had a pleasant stay."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was just what we needed. It felt like you were staying in someone's home and that they would walk through the door at any minute. We enjoyed the memorabilia that was throughout the house, giving us lots to look at and think about the lives that lived there. It was a cozy, clean home and we loved all it had to offer, a great kitchen, a covered porch (it was rainy) and we all enjoyed playing guitar hero on the wii. We were there for my sons graduation from PCT, and it was a great place to gather the night before the ceremony to share a meal, some good conversation, lots of laughs and time together as a family. I think Skip and Tutty would have loved that our family had the chance to enjoy their beautiful home making memories of our own like many of the memories I am sure they made. Thanks for sharing you home with us."
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The way the family keeps the memories of this home alive is adorable.
It’s literally like a timepiece.
It was like walking into my grandparents home.
We had everything we needed and the house was very clean and welcoming.
Would definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,4.0,Group trip,The house was very nice and the stay was perfect for the two nights we stayed we just wish the stuff that was said was stocked more like the kitchen stuff but it was ok cause we can still cooked everything inside and went grocery shopping. All around it was perfect for 6 of us we just wish some of the stuff that was said was restocked with new stuff
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The homey atmosphere , well- stocked kitchen and responsive host makes this a great stay. We had everything we needed - and more. Every seat in the house is comfortable and the beds were great. Lots of room for a family. It is just as described and more unique than you can imagine. Do you like family stories and a big beautiful tree out back? Sure wish we had more than one night!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We felt right at home upon walking in; it felt like we were visiting family. We were in town to tour Penn College.

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Reasonably priced, very clean and felt like home. Lots of extra little things that were helpful and made it feel like home. If we're coming to the area again we will definitely see if this is available. We all enjoyed our stay."

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"this is really comfortable place and super clean and convenience.
All instructions are noted in each drawer, and the washroom upstairs is really surprising with luxury
and spacious. the family pictures in the wall tell the stories and books are every corner you can pick to read.
Todd is super nice and helpful, I forgot my necklace in the night table and when i realized it we already were two hours away.. Todd found it and mailed it to me.
So appreciate."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great! The house was clean and comfortable.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place.
Wish I would have known about the step into two of the bedrooms. I ended up putting my 80 year old mother in a bunk bed in fear she would trip over the step at night going to the bathroom. Other than that we loved the home!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was our second time staying here, I hope to get here sometime when the weather is warm to enjoy the back deck and yard. Everything was clean and convenient. There’s always nice treats to eat and the board games are fun. It’s a bit nostalgic staying here, it’s like being at Grandmas house. Safe, warm and comfy.. Thank you Todd!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Overall, recommended! This is a truly sweet family home turned nicely into an Airbnb. Pics of loved ones are still on the walls, but it's also chock-a-block with nice Airbnb touches — labels on everything, nibbles in the kitchen, clear instructions, etc. Cozy warm beds, good wifi, modern TV, friendly and communicative hosts — I was only there one night, but quite liked it.
Only two small caveats — the house is close to a major interstate-sized highway, so close the windows tightly if you value quiet, and it's facing a huge Pepsi warehouse, so you're not going for any scenic walks in that direction. But that said, if you're passing through town or planning to drive to an event nearby, this is a definite yes — it *is* quiet, it *is* cute, it *is* well set up... so I'd definitely stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,The home was very nice and extremely clean. Great location for our trip. Great experience overall and if it’s available in the future we will be back!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived to vintage Halloween decorations lighting our way to a home which takes you back to a simpler time. The home is exquisite in its’ attempt to preserve an authentic feel of being at your grandparents’ home. Warm and cozy with amenities galore! If you forgot anything, you’ll find it there. You will be overwhelmed at the little extras that are provided. Restaurant choices were many and minutes away. Choose Todd’s listing for next visit to Williamsport and you will be delighted and impressed!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tutty and Skip’s home was warm and welcoming, and we felt truly at home away from home. Being there we felt like guests in a loving family member’s home.

Thank you for having us in your home Todd. It was truly lovely."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is right off the thruway with a few minute drive to stores and restaurants. It is exactly what the pictures are and what is described. If you have forgotten anything It is there for you!

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Check-in was very easy and we had plenty of room to park our two vehicles. The house evokes all kinds of great memories of childhood stays with my grandparents. Todd was responsive and a great host.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very clean and roomy home. Todd was an excellent host. Would definitely stay again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Todd's Airbnb meant all the standards of being at home and then some. Lovely 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom home with plenty of space to accommodate a family. Easy to find in downtown central Williamsport, Pennsylvania, located in a quiet neighborhood. Todd's instructions throughout the home were easy to follow and maintain. He even went above board with stocking the kitchen with some grocery items and had labels on all the kitchen cabinets and drawers identifying where items were located. My family and I highly recommend this Airbnb for a stay in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. We will definitely stay in it again when the opportunity presents itself."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As always a great stay
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was exactly what we needed for conference attendance with 3 unrelated adults to have a comfortable stay with all needed amenities - close to town and yet also a very lovely setting. Rt. 15 is within view and we were only a few minutes from downtown and campus. The place is very nostalgic with a feeling of being at your grandparents again. It's very quaint. And there were rabbits and squirrels on the lawn area. The back porch is nice. And the hospitality - all the pantry items and even some other goodies and coffee - was a definite bonus.
2023-05-01,4.0,Group trip,"Very nice house, very well kept and cleaned. Decorated with family photos and other personal memorabilia which can make it feel very personal."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home was great and clean and perfect to have our dog with us! As the owner clearly states it could be noisy given its proximity to the highway. However, we were there on a Saturday and the home is older and solidly built so noise was really not an issue. The gracious hosts thought of everything! From snacks to breakfast foods and coffee (they even had milk waiting in the fridge!) to doggy waste bags! They clearly want their guests to feel at home!"

These hosts have thought of everything!! They even include breakfast items to complete the BNB experience with milk, oj and bagels - even cream cheese!
They have printed, clear instructions so that you can easily feel comfortable and USE all the amenities easily! And it was SOOOOO nice to have a coffee with real milk, a throw blanket on the sofa, extra white fluffy towels and even some eye makeup remover and peppermints!
Hosts were super responsive! Worked with us to get the stay booked QUICKLY when we needed to find a place on short notice because of an emergency.
Answered all our little questions right away too! Super Stay, Awesome Hosts!!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here while we visited the Little League World Series. It was so nice to be close to the ball park yet not amongst all the chaos of everyone else. We were able to come home between games to cool off and get a bit to eat. The fully stocked kitchen was awesome! My son got a kick out of the phone on the wall.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a fun little place!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really neat place! It’s almost a step back in time, lots of history there, while at the same time having all the modern conveniences we’re accustomed to.

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed to ride the pine Creek trail, the house was a great find! We loved playing boce on the beautiful back lawn under the amazing tree! A bonus was the lycoming trail that was right out the back door! Great find!! Excellent host!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Very very good apartment. Host is very generous to provide everything for a good stay. Highly recommended
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute house that has a ""Grandma's house"" vibe. Literally every inch of it was a time warp to my childhood. You can't pay for the level of nostalgia this place brings. it was quiet, comfy and a great place to lay your head!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was so cute! It really felt like a Grandmas house. Clean, cozy, and so many thoughtful touches like goodies, breakfast stuff, and so much more. It was the perfect place for a family gathering. We found an old town directory that gave us information about our grandparents! Amazing! Great host communication too. One of our favorite parts was meeting Wednesday."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice comfortable place and Todd was attentive to our needs. Loved that there was breakfast fixings for us in the fridge (milk, eggs, orange juice, bagels, etc.). Williamsport is a beautiful town and so is the surrounding area. Highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was great! Very home-y and stocked with everything you could want and need. We loved being able to bring our dogs with us and enjoyed sitting in the yard on the swing and then being able to relax inside on the plenty of comfy chairs provided.
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Clean, well kept and good value. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of the most charming AirBnbs that I've stayed in. It is a family home that feels like walking into your Grandparent's home where they have photos of their family everywhere, artwork from their children and grandchildren, and some really cool artifacts from their life. The space was incredibly clean and had the most well-stocked kitchen I've ever seen at an Airbnb. The yard is completely fenced in which was really nice since we were traveling with our dog. The tree in the front yard is easily 80-100 years old and it is simply stunning. The owner builds on the charm of this old tree by having a glider underneath with patio lights hung from the lower branches. It was a peaceful place to relax and unwind after a long day of travel."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay was like a weekend at Grandma’s house when we were kids, but with cable tv and no mothballs.
Everything we needed was there and then some. We were celebrating our daughter’s college graduation, so having a steamer for her wrinkly gown really came in handy.
She wanted a home cooked meal after the ceremony, and the labels on all of the drawers and cabinets helped me navigate the kitchen. Having two bathrooms also made it to easier for the four of us to get ready in the morning as well.
All in all, a very comfortable stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the best Airbnb homes I’ve ever stayed and we do travel a lot anything you could possibly need is available the host are fantastic Clean comfortable and affordable

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, organized, and convenient with lots of homey touches. Some different things from other places are the kitchen view of a wonderful tree in the backyard, homey sociable kitchen set up and a wonderful bathroom upstairs with a unique layout. The pepsi plant with trucks nextdoor is a little busy in the morning and the interstate is visible from window over the kitchen sink but all the other advantages and perks of this place make those two things minor matters. Really great place to stay and relax. And we had the luck of the leprechauns greeting us throughout our three day stay with the holiday decorations...definitely a nice surprise!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host. House was as described, and provided several niceties on top of the basics."

I would definitely stay here again, Todd was super responsive and helpful. We had a wonderful experience for our first time in the area."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time in Williamsport visiting family and Todd’s place made a great ‘home-base’ for us.
We traveled with 2 adults and 2 small kids so we brought pack-and-plays for the kids but I’m sure my son will love the bunk beds in the future!
The house was well equipped with kitchenware and even included some basic breakfast needs which we really appreciated since we arrived late at night.
Todd was great to communicate with because he was thorough and quick.
The host pictures are accurate and everything was clean and in its place.
We would recommend staying here to anyone with a family that needs a little more space than a hotel can offer."
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,So adorable

2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is literally like walking into nana’s house. Right down to the Halloween decorations, crooked floors, afghans, family photos and fully stocked kitchen. It is very clean and comfortable. It was also great to catch up on some laundry while there."

Like you are staying with family. And it’s so very clean"

spacious, clean house that offers the comforts and charm of being at grandma’s! Our party of 6 had a great time and did not feel squeezed together. Everything in the home is clean, and Todd makes the whole process from check in to check out a breeze. A lot of things in the house are labeled and have directions on how to use, which was a helpful tip I have not seen before. Definitely would highly recommend and we hope to be back again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Home was very comfortable and clean, very good location if youre looking to do some outdoor activities, pine gorge rail trail trailhead was only 18 minutes away. Was expecting traffic to be louder as it is located right off of the highway, but inside the house you can hardly hear it, had no trouble sleeping at all. Would definetely come back again for a stay 😊"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is an excellent Airbnb. Everything you need for breakfast was provided along with fruit and snacks. Todd was a great host. We got to meet Todd. Great family story behind the home. Excellent job on remodeling the home. Recommend staying here when in the Williamsport area.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This Airbnb is as advertised. Vey clean and well maintained. Nice touches on the inside. I met the owner Todd. Very nice guy. I highly recommend this rental.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was great. Such an adorable house and a great yard. We loved sitting around the kitchen table and being nostalgic about all the things in this house that reminded us of our grandparents. Way better than a hotel!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A really nice place, charmingly decorated. Upstairs bathroom is very roomy, modern,not very common for an older house. A very nice surprise is that Todd offers breakfast items, not other places I had been do so. That saved us a trip to local grocery to buy breakfast items. Nothing fancy, a few fruits, a few boxes cereal, English muffins, bagels, milk, oj and eggs. Plenty for everyone. Todd is very responsive host. Highly recommend"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, very homey. Highly recommend"

Truly a wonderful stay and the most thoughtful host."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, comfortable, and welcoming! We have a large family and just don't fit in one motel room. This was a much better way to break up our road trip.
As others are saying, it's just like staying at Grandma's.
A little tricky to find the main entrance off the alley (but we did arrive late at night, which may have made it harder.)
Overall, highly recommended."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"had the most amazing experience at this location! definitely a super host for a reason. very welcoming , friendly, and helpful. on top of being knowledgeable about the towns history and tourist spots. made us feel comfortable and at home. will definitely be coming back again soon and recommending friends 🙂"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was a nice last min stop. Took the dogs on the bike path. Nice and cozy warm feeling home.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great spot to split our drive from NYC to Pittsburgh. Our dog loved the fenced in back yard, and it felt like we were visiting our grandparents house. One note, the house abuts a Pepsi distribution plant, so there are large trucks driving about nearby. That said, we felt safe and inside was quiet as we slept."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We love the house and everything about it. Comfortable beds, nice bathroom and kitchen :) Recommended"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was an awesome find and very unique lots of history in this house. our family loved it and would totally stay again if we come back up to PA.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay here. Very clean and homely. Our dogs really enjoyed the yard. Much needed rest stop after a long day on the road!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house is like visiting grandma and grandpas with all the comforts of home! You can feel the love of the family there which makes this such a great option as a home away from home.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway! Location was close enough to everything we wanted without being downtown. Lots of little details thought of.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Skip and Tuttys was great! Like others
have said, it was like staying at grandmas house. Lots of personal touches and little things that made it feel welcoming and comfortable. The home was much bigger than we expected and the host provided so many great options for breakfast, which we really appreciated! If you’re looking for an ultra modern and sleek place to stay, this isn’t it, however if you need a place to feel at home and comfortable- look no further! We hope to be back! Thank you Todd!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"excellent stay, so comfortable and welcoming!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I had a great experience staying here. The place was clean and very spacious.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super clean and super comfortable, but truly unique in feeling so much like a home. If your grandmother was a meticulous housekeeper who filled her home with love, yummy goodies, and healthy food for breakfast, it’s like that, or you could just call it a time capsule with the story of two lives to be read in the memories hanging on the walls. There’s a noisy highway practically right next to the house, but it is so peaceful inside it doesn’t matter."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place, i have utilized airbnb for so much corporate travel during the pandemic, not only for me but for other employees, and this last few nights have been wonderful staying here. Great value too!!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Easily the best Airbnb experience I've ever had. My family and I were up visiting for Christmas for a week. Todd went above and beyond by decorating around the house, and even putting up a tree so we could unwrap presents around it. The home was spotlessly clean and was stocked with everything you could ever need. Full of thoughtful touches and small details that really made it feel like home. Very convenient location right off the highway on a quiet alley with plenty of parking. We would definitely consider staying again in the future."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at Todd’s place. The location is perfect for travelers going through Pennsylvania on 15. The house is appointed with everything one might need, from toiletries to a generous assortment of breakfast foods. The rooms were comfortable and our kids enjoyed the games. Thank you so much for a great stay!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the coziest Airbnb I have seen! I felt like I was staying with family, but they were just out for the evening.
There is a ton of space. I was just one person, but this place could accommodate a clan very easily.
FYI, the house and back yard/deck are lovely. The house is on an industrial-feeling alley and right next to the highway. VERY convenient access to get the next leg of a trip started (Rickett’s Glen and World’s End, in my case!), but this isn’t the spot for charm of the overall setting.
This place was perfect for my needs and exceeded my expectations. Thanks for the breakfast items! An English muffin with peanut butter and banana was a nice start to a full day of hiking!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time. It was great for traveling with kids, they loved the arcade, gaming tables and big tvs. It was super clean and very easy to find anything you might need. The host was also super responsive to anything we needed. Would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mark is a great host and very flexible! Definitely looking forward to stay here again for the future visits!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great stay at Mark and Maddie’s place. It was beautifully decorated with lots of fun things to do. Great TV’s, mirrors, appliances, even a full size washer and dryer. Designed amazingly and everything is brand new up to date. Mark was responsive and kind. We would love to come here as often as we come to Williamsport."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place!!! We will definitely be back!!!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was good, only issue (me peraonally) is the thermostat is remotely limited to 72. There is another thermometer just across the hall that always showed a few degrees colder. Front bedroom by game room is cold, need to bring your own extra blankets."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t even know where to begin, Mark was a wonderful host and has a great place that is very well kept and is tasty fully decorated. It was as described and we felt right at home from the moment we walked in. We will be staying here again when we are in town also Maddie was very responsive with any issues we had. I highly recommend this place."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Mark! We really enjoyed our time in your quiet, clean, comfortable, well appointed apartment. The game room was a lot of fun!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great spot! Very high tech and lots of gadget to make things easy and keep the kiddos busy!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed there last November and stayed again in December. It says it all! Nice and quiet place.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice house, clean and fantasy."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Who has a 86"" TV in their home? Not me, but Mark as it in its Airbnb! A TV in each room and the arcade room. Technology all around the place. All the appliances are brand new and you fill like home. Would definitely stay there on my next trip. Thanks Mark and Maddie!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My coworker and I spent 5 days here while we met with clients in and around Williamsport. Marks place had everything we could have asked for and more. But what stood out the most for me was the WIFI. Fastest internet I've ever experienced in any accommodations(outside of my own home) and I have traveled extensively over the past 15 years with my job position. I was clocking 340Mpbs on WIFI and over 400Mpbs with wired connection. I highly recommend using Mark's place if staying in Williamsport.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute perfect stay with all the comforts of home plus very modern amenities! The apartment is extremely clean and quiet! The bed, which is usually a complaint for us, was completely the opposite! Very comfortable and slept wonderfully! The hosts were above accommodating! Answered all questions very quickly and gave nice recommendations for things to do in the area! I would recommend this location to anyone. In fact… already have to friends coming to the area next month!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay with lots of space and modern amenities. The arcade room was great!

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay. Mellisa was very kind and helpful. The house was clean and cozy and was very peaceful.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at the river house! Great location and easy to get to everything.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Mellissa was extremely responsive and went out of her way to make sure that we enjoyed our stay at her home. When she found out that my grand children were traveling with me she even brought over supplies for us to make s’mores.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Felt like I had stepped back into my childhood with this riverside home! Very comfortable, clean, and well stocked. We came for the river and were not disappointed. We found it easier to drive across the river to the public launch, as the stairs down to the water were difficult with Kayaks in hand! Overall, a wonderful stay for two sisters ."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,What a wonderful place. Don’t pass it up
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Would absolutely stay here again. The home was exactly as described! You can tell that a lot of time and love has gone into this home. VERY comfortable and our decision to rent AirB&B versus getting a hotel for my son’s Penn College graduation was the best decision ever! Melissa was super responsive and made us feel welcomed from the start. Thanks again!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Melissa’s place was beautiful and just as described. The house was cozy and the beds were comfortable. The kitchen was beautiful with all expected appliances. Additionally it had coffee and tea available with both kuerig and drip coffee makers. We would definitely stay here again if coming to the area. Thanks, Melissa!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Melissa was a wonderful host and the accommodations were top notch!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Melissa is a great host. We had everything we needed at her home. We enjoyed fishing on the dock at the back of the house and ping pong in the basement. Melissa kept in communication with us to make sure all was well. She also helped us find great hiking trails in the area. We are happy to recommend this River House.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A real find! The house is as described- very clean, everything in great shape and worked perfectly and comfortable. Nice view of the river from the backyard. Melissa and Ray were excellent hosts. They communicated well with us and went out of their way to ensure that our stay was comfortable. We loved having the grill outside and the large porch. We had several dinners out there.
We came out to explore the area on both motorcycles and bicycles and found great roads, beautiful vistas and interesting places to eat. The house worked very well for us- private,off road parking let us keep the bikes off the street at night.
The neighborhood is good, very residential but close to restaurants (especially across the river in Williamsport), highways, supermarkets and the Riverwalk. Be sure to check out the Riverwalk, a cool way to explore the river and get some exercise."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing stay!!!!! Melissa thought of everything. I was in town for my sons high school graduation and I wanted to host a dinner for him. It really felt like a home away from home. The house was very clean and she had oil warmers through the house so it smelled really good. It’s was very hot when we arrived so Melissa had the central air on so it was nice to get out the heat. The beds were comfortable. There one plush, and two firm. One room has the adjustable bed which my daughter loved. I will definitely be staying again"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The loft was absolutely amazing! The decor was beautiful and modern and everything was extremely clean. The game room was a huge hit and Marisa was a very gracious host and very accommodating to our family. She had many personal touches throughout the space that made it very welcoming and we felt at home.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The loft was perfect for us. We were able to walk to my son's graduation. It was easy to walk to restaurants and had convenient off street parking. The house was really clean and the game room was amazing. The house is really big and the bathrooms were accomodating for everyone to get ready at the same time. I will definitely stay again!
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,It was a wonderful place to stay. I love the architecture. The living room is so big.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was HUGE - it was EXACTLY what the pictures showed - could not believe the game room! Everything was lovely, clean, and exactly what we wanted! It had incredible charm, was located perfectly, and Marisa was very easy to get in touch with. Highly recommend it!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unique, historic space that I was surprised to find in the area. Marisa’s instructions from booking through check out were clear and concise. The 2 dedicated parking spaces were an unexpected bonus. The loft itself is clean, spacious, and has a great layout that provides an open concept feel with 3 private bedrooms on the upper floor. The salon on the ground floor has business hours 7 days per week, but the noise is minimal. The downtown area is quiet all night and at times restaurant and bar patrons can be heard but nothing was disruptive or disturbing. The “city” feel is evident in the loft design, but the actual downtown is simple to navigate, whether driving or walking. I highly recommend Marisa’s space!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This loft was the perfect little slice of heaven for our weekend in Williamsport! It is a great location to all the restaurants downtown. ￼
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect downtown spot. Clean and huge with everything you need!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We used this space for a 13th birthday party and it was perfect! There were large spaces for all of the girls to gather and also plenty of small tables and areas to do multiple things in small groups.
The space was beautiful and spotless. We felt at home in such a big space! Definitely recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Marisa’s place was such an awesome and fun place to stay with family and friends! The space is large and had so many fun games and places to hangout! It’s in a great location, so many things were near by. Everything was perfectly clean… the kitchen, the bathrooms and all bedding. Bedding and couches were all comfortable. She had plenty amenities all stocked for your needs. I really couldn’t say better things about her place. Clearly she and the cleaning crew have an eye for detail. I would absolutely stay again, she earns her super-host status by far!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loft is spacious and clean. Plenty of bathroom space, nicely furnished and equipped. Can walk to get groceries or go out."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot in downtown Williamsburg. Marisa was an excellent host, very responsive. Very walkable to everything in Williamsburg. Private off street parking in back. Don't miss the farmers market on Saturday, get the fries, cheeseburgers and the whoopie pies."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"The loft was HUGE & absolutely beautiful. The beds were super comfy, and everything was extremely clean. Check in was so easy. It was the perfect spot for my wedding weekend. So glad we chose it! Would definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Marissa’s place was perfect for several families trying to find accommodations for the last weekend of the LL World Series. We tried booking her place for the entire 14 days - but it was booked before we knew if we would be victorious and get this trip. She helped me even find another spot to rent for my first 9 days and then reached out as soon as her place become available and we jumped at the chance to move into the loft. It’s a fun, sexy, totally in the middle of everything place. Thank you for your gracious hospitality and help during our 2 weeks in Williamsport."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was the perfect fit for our family celebration. Plenty of room, comfortable spaces, well stocked with everything we needed. The game room was the frosting on the cake. So fun playing corn hole right in our apartment! You will 100% not be disappointed."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Marisa's place is located in center of Williamsport, within walking distance to multiple restaurants, coffee shops, and scenic walks along the Susquehanna River. Access to the apartment is limited to an alleyway parking lot which is a little dodgy-feeling after dark. The place itself is cavernous - literally humongous - with thoughtful amenities for a small group looking to unwind, including board games, air hockey, and tabletop shuffleboard. The kitchen is serviceable, though not sufficient for cooking dinner for a large group of people due to limited preparation space and inadequate appliances. The bedrooms are large and comfortable, though the street-facing rooms are loud due to the fact that they face the main drag. All in all a great place!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marisa communicated very well! Our family felt so welcomed and comfortable at the loft. Beautifully appointed and great location!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is truly amazing. It is immaculate and pristine. Great space for a staycation. You will never want to leave!!

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Beautiful setting, peaceful and comfortable. Perhaps the best AirBnB experience I’ve had. We will absolutely be back."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay with the main highlight being the creek. It is huge and beautiful and provides wonderful entertainment for young and old. There are nice places to sit and enjoy time with family. Overall, would definitely recommend."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Another perfect trip to the Creek House. This was our third time staying here, and the Creek House is the perfect spot for our multi-family getaway. There's plenty of room in the house for both sleeping along with activities during the day. We spend most of the day down in the creek which is perfectly situated off the back yard. We also really like grilling up dinner on the back patio and eating in the sun room. Last but not least the two firepit options are great depending on what kind of campfire mood you're in or how much energy is left after a day in the creek."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home with rushing River in the back yard. Bedrooms are spacious and beds comfortable. Beautiful sun room and den with tons of natural light. Responsive host. The nearby gun range can get very loud and unsettling. The house is in a rural area - great for nature. I especially enjoyed walking in the river!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Creekside Manor was exactly as pictured and presented. Michael was a great host. We appreciated his call to ensure we had checked in ok and if we had any questions. It perfectly accommodated our family of 10. It had all the amenities we needed. The surroundings were beautiful and a highlight was our hike to Jacoby Falls, which was breathtaking. I highly recommend and would stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Michael’s home felt just like that, Home. It is a very peaceful space. The sound of the creek is something so wonderful to me. We were visiting with family in the area, so we hosted Easter dinner. It was a perfect day and stay. I highly recommend this place."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house right on the creek. Cozy fireplace and lots of gorgeous hiking in the area which is what we come for! Highly recommend

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful Christmas vacation at the Creekside Manor. It was clean and spacious, and accommodating for our wheelchair-bound granddaughter. Michael was very responsive and helpful, and we can’t wait to go back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Four people from our company stayed at Michael’s place instead of staying at a hotel near the conference we were attending in Williamsport. So glad that we did!! It was very peaceful and comfortable and has a beautiful view of the river. It was a great place for our team to bond and spend time together. Would definitely return again!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to stay! Welcoming, warm, and cozy. Close to family and town. Beautiful home right on the Creek were we use to live ten years ago.

Hope to be back again in the summer 2023! The Westover Family"

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is wonderful! Family from Texas to North Carolina gathered for our sons wedding. There was room for everyone, the beds were all comfy, the kitchen had everything we needed to make some family meals! The view of the creek is gorgeous and we enjoyed being able to explore down there. And the fire pit was the perfect relaxing ending to every night! Our host had wonderful communication beforehand, checkin was a breeze, and he even called our first day there just to check in to be sure we had everything we needed! Highly recommend!!!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at the creek house, and we were treated to another amazing stay. The house is perfectly setup for our group of 6 adults and 6 kids. The kitchen and outdoor grill make it easy to keep everyone fed. The TV room is a great in case of bad weather. The star of the show though, is the wonderful outdoor activities. We spent most of the days enjoying the creek and most of the nights enjoying the fire pit. Can't wait to return for next year's trip."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was a perfect size house for 7 adults and 4 kids. Most of the time was spent by everyone either down by the creek or on the patio. The gas fire place was hassle free and used every night. The host, Michael, was very quick to communicate and to check in to see how we were settling in. The location was perfect. Convenient location to the popular restaurant, Pier 87, an ice cream shop, and grocery stores. Within an hour of many activities such as Pine Creek Rail Trail, Ricketts Glenn, Disc Golf, and many other hiking and Mountain Biking Trails.
Nice water hole in the Creek where people were either flyfishing or reel fishing. Many Bald Eagles were observed. something I don't see often in my area of Michigan.
I'm looking forward for next year, and coming back to Pennsylvania."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Michael was a great host. He has everything well planned out and responds to messages very quickly. The house is amazing, very clean, and well equipped with things needed during the stay. The sun room and back patio overlooking the Loyalsock Creek was very relaxing. I would highly recommend staying at Creekside Manor if you are in the area. It is worth the stay even if it means you drive a little farther to your travel destination. Thank you Michael and we will be back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, peaceful home tucked away in the mountain along a beautiful river. Great location for Bucknell parents."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was the perfect balance of rustic chic and comfort. The property is very well cared for, clean and cozy, with many nice amenities. It is spacious and has easy to many areas of interest. We were happy to simply enjoy the immediate surroundings and appreciate the woodsy feeling. We would love to stay there again to listen to the relaxing sounds of the birds and the Loyalsock Creek as we admire the surrounding mountains. Every direction you turn - the view is beautiful. What a comfortable, clean, well stocked and well maintained home / cottage. It is “user friendly” for any generation.
Thank you so much for sharing it with us!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved my stay for the week, went up to visit family and staying here at this beautiful home really made it so much easier for me to see them all. Mike is very nice and always makes sure you are fine and don’t need anything throughout the whole stay. I would love to go up in the summer time so my kids could enjoy the creek, and if that is in the making I will for sure be back to this beautiful, comfy home. Thank you again Mike for everything the stay was amazing.."
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was absolutely wonderful. We have a hiking group that loves to enjoy nature and this house was right in the middle of it on the Loyalsock creek with 2 beautiful sunrooms and bedrooms with views of the creek. The inside is super cozy and comfortable and has everything you need to enjoy your time whether you ever leave the house or not! Very well equipped with everything you need and a wonderful cozy stone fireplace. Plenty of parking for a big group. Highly recommend this place to anyone and will definitely look to stay here again.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was amazing! It had everything we needed and more. A nice den in the front when you walk in where you can listen to some music , play board games and hang out with the family. My kids especially loved the rocking chair. Then another family room with a tv and the recliner was my personal favorite. Fire pit outside was also perfect. Everything was clean and accommodating. Didn’t run into any issues at all. Michael was very professional and on top of things. He made it so easy for us. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a perfect quiet getaway. Can’t wait to go back!"

The kitchen is well stocked with utensils and dishes salt and sugar and coffee. The house was immaculate and beautiful. The property is private and picturesque. We stayed in December and we had flannel sheets and warm comforter’s to keep us warm at night. And when we didn’t cook we headed down to pier 87 for some great food. Great house and great location!

This is the second time we have stayed here, and are already looking forward to another visit next year."
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,All 5 stars. My family and I stayed there for my wedding at H&L and we have a great time. Place is beautiful and very well kept. Pictures don’t do justice. We had to reschedule three times because of covid and Michael was so accommodating and understanding every time. I can’t wait to stay there next time I have to go to Williamsport.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a great place. We stayed here as our son was in the Little League World Series. It was perfect for our family who came from all over. We spent so many great nights hanging out at the fire pit and grilling out. Also Pier 87 right down the street is a great spot for dinner and drinks. Right on the Creek!
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a beautiful ,well kept and very well furnished home. The location is perfect, only 10 minutes from town but far enough to feel like the wilderness .

It was a wonderful time for our family and we will do it again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This house was the perfect gathering place for my bridal party on my wedding weekend and was also the perfect location. The sound of the creek was so peaceful! Michael was very responsive and accommodating!

2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a great place for a getaway. the house was very clean and organized. everything was right where it was supposed to be and there are helpful notes and instructions throughout the house. everything worked as it was supposed to and we had enough to do that our group if 10 didn't even turn on the TV for 4 days. the woodburning fireplace was a real treat and helps the home to feel like a quiet cabin. michael is a great host and quick to respond. all in all a great weekend
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, spacious ,clean and cozy place . My family and I had a wonderful time. The communication with the house owner Michael was great . Highly recomendable."

And getting the fire going in the fireplace was a real treat.
Michael is a great host and incredibly communicative. His local guidebook has great suggestions. We got some of the delicious sticky buns from Mr. Sticky’s and also hiked the beautiful Katey Jane trail in Rider Park.
Great house for families! We hope to be back!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a great time at Creekside Manor. The house was very comfortable and in a beautiful location.

I think summer will be also great place to stay. It was a great experience for all of us."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Michael’s place was beautiful and peaceful. The house was clean and welcoming and the beds were comfy. The picturesque river was just a very short walk from the back of the house. It was the perfect place for a family get away. Highly recommended!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb ever! We booked Michael's house for a ""Sisters"" getaway and it was absolutely perfect. Gorgeous fall leaves created stunning views from every room. We used all 3 fireplaces. The beautiful stone indoor wood burning one was my favorite. We waded in the creek every day, it was unseasonably warm for October. Every detail of this home is thoughtful and well appointed. Do not hesitate, go ahead and book this home! You will not be disappointed!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family spent a weekend together and couldn't have asked for anything more. Beautiful home and a beautiful, safe setting by the Loyalsock.

2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This beautiful home on the Loyalsock Creek makes a terrific setting for a family reunion. Our adult children joined us from three states. It's the kind of place where memories are created. Scenic beauty surrounds you, but you are only a few miles from Williamsport. The home is spacious with amenities that enhance your comfort. Michael is a conscientious host who responds quickly to any questions, then checks up to make sure everything for your stay is OK. Our family plans to return again next year."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! Ample space and direct access to the creek. Cell service was touch and go but the internet worked fine so no issues there. The gas outdoor fire pit was awesome. As a music junky I particularly liked the Bluetooth stereo. I did some hiking on the loyalsock trail and visited worlds end state park. Highly recommend for any reason.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, warm home with all amenities of your own home. Located in a gorgeous setting with amazing river views. Completely private retreat to sit riverside and be elevated to spiritual harmony in direct response to the landscaping."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely perfect getaway for our multi-family Labor Day weekend getaway. We had 6 kids with us, and the bunk bed room was perfect for the older ones and TV room perfect for the younger kids in the mornings. The creek behind the house is the main attraction with a section that's shallow and calm enough for kids to play in and a deeper section farther out with a current that's perfect for tubing or swimming. *Invest in some water shoes as the ground below the water is smooth but slippery rocks* There was plenty of firewood which we enjoyed for campfire cooked lunches and smores later in the evening. The house is well stocked with all the pots/pans/plates we needed to cook dinner, and the sun room has a folding table and chairs that worked well for our 'kids table'. All in all a great place and a great host."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Creekside is the most beautiful getaway retreat you could ask for. It just makes you feel like you at home with the nature all around you. As always it never disappoints. I can’t wait to return.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great week at Creekside Manor. The location can't be beat: right on the Loyalsock Creek and very close to Weis Markets and Walmart. We did an initial stock-up at Wegmans in Williamsport on the way.
This was a social distancing vacation for us. We hiked every day, from local spots like Rider Park and Jacoby Hallow, to further but totally driveable destinations such as Leonard Harrison State Park, Colton Point State Park, Ricketts Glen State Park, and Worlds End State Park.
Our adult daughter, whom we hadn't seen since November due to the pandemic, joined us from NYC for a workcation. She had her Zoom meetings in the yard, in the sunroom, in the tv room...someplace different than her apartment bedroom!
She joined us some days for hiking and every evening for our other favorite activity: floating on the creek. It was a most relaxing way to end each day.
We had excellent communication with our host, Micheal, both before and during our stay. His guidebook was very helpful to us in planning where to go. Creekside Manor was extremely clean.
We definitely would recommend Creekside Manor to anyone who wants to get away from it all, but still be close to grocery stores and outdoor attractions."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was our 2nd time tenting property. It was out first summer visit. We enjoyed the creek, we fished, swam, floated down the creek to Pier 87. The weather was perfect. The house has all amenities you need. We enjoyed the our door patio for breakfast and the fire pit in the evenings. The enclosed porch was great for entertaining. Great space! Close to town if you have to venture in. The kitchen is equipped with all utensils, makes it easy for preparing big meals. We love it here! Can’t wait until the next time!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The cabin is a beautiful retreat along the Loyalsock Creek. It had every amenity you could ask for plus more. There are alot of activities to do outdoors in the area such as hiking, tubing, kayaking or just sitting in the creek cooling off. We felt completely at home there and our family that lived in the area came over everyday because it is such a beautiful relaxing setting. Michael and Sherri were excellent hosts and we can’t wait to come back next year."
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Much of our stay was mostly spent outdoors by the creek enjoying the breathtaking views, the cool water, and the warmth of the fire pit. The layout of the outdoors was well thought out and aesthetically pleasing. We absolutely fell in love with the outdoor living space and will definitely be back in the future! Thank you Michael for being a welcoming host!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our family get together at the Creekside Manor. Loved spending time at the creek & sitting by the outdoor fire pit. We would return to enjoy it again
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a very relaxing time at Creekside Manor. We enjoyed grilling steaks creekside, and also sitting by the gas firepit. The creek offered good fishing and fun for our 2 year old grandchild. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The back windows of the manor offer amazing views of the creek and surrounding area. Thanks again Mike for allowing us to stay in your lovely Creekside Manor."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing trip. Amazing gateway with the family. It’s my first time staying away from home. I thought I wouldn’t like to be away from home or my kids but we had amazing time. I recommend to many who will like to stay away from home. Amazing place to be when you just want quiet.
2019-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a fabulous time at loyal sock that the home is charming. It accommodated us perfectly.
the kitchen was well stocked with tools dishes etc. to make meals.
We enjoyed the fireplace and the fire pit.!
The creek behind the property was a lovely added bonus."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Michaels Place is a beautiful home in a gorgeous wooded setting with a stream in the back of the home. It’s truly home away from home; clean, comfortable beds, full kitchen, laundry facilities, privacy and a gathering place. It’s our second visit and we will return again."
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Prepare to be amazed and relaxed. If you are looking for a peaceful retreat and Creekside Manor is available, book now. You can thank me later :)"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Creekside Manor! There were 11 of us with more than enough room. We brought tubes to float down the creek and caught dozens of crayfish. Creekside Manor is well laid out, labeled, and stocked. A great place for big family meals and relaxing!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Creekside Manor is a great location if you’re in town for a wedding at Herman & Luther’s. We were in town for our niece’s wedding and we were less than 10 minutes from the venue. It is a cute, rustic home and we enjoyed our stay. The only issue is that the house doesn’t have WiFi and there is very limited to no cell service so that made it tough to receive texts from other family members staying at other locations but the host does disclose that the home doesn’t have WiFi. There are two landline phones in the home and you are provided with the number so you can receive calls. Our kids enjoyed skipping rocks down at the creek. If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle, you’ll really enjoy Creekside Manor. Michael is a very responsive host."
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place for us when we work the LLWS every year.
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent house with amazing outdoor amenities! Easy access to the creek makes your day outside playing in the water a lot of fun! The house was very clean with plenty of options for sleeping arrangements.
2019-06-01,5.0,Group trip,My bridal party and I stayed at Creekside Manor in June 2019. We can only say great things about this place. This place is so beautiful and cozy. The view is amazing as there was the Susquehanna River next to it. The home was very well kept and clean. There was so much space to host and it felt like HOME during our stay! We are so happy to find such an amazing place to stay and we got such great wedding photos here! Definitely coming back!
2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,This is our second time staying in this home once in January and now in may . The houses ambiance in the winter is wonderful from the indoor fireplace to the views of the creek outside the windows . We were able now in May to enjoy the outdoor screen porch and the tables that we set up on the lawn overlooking the creek for dinner and games . The house accommodates large families beautifully. Plenty of space for everyone . We will be booking again in the fall . Great communication with the host very helpful with anything that we needed .
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at the Creekside Manor while in the area for our daughter's college graduation. We LOVED the location with the creek so close (the weather cooperated a couple of days). The house is modern rustic - the beds were comfortable, every room had it's own charm and the kitchen had a variety of spices available which makes cooking very easy. We enjoyed our stay so much that we were disappointed that we won't be heading back to that area. Sitting and relaxing on that wooden swing, watching our granddaughter try to skip rocks like her dad - it was perfect! We also enjoyed the Hibachi restaurant very much and the Eders Ice Cream was awesome - way too much ice cream for $3 - even a Lactose-Free option, which is quite unusual. If you fish, bring your poles - Walmart is just up the road for a license and bait. You won't be disappointed ;-)"
2019-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a great relaxing property! It has all the amenities you need and is close to town. You can enjoy the outdoors, and Entertain family as well. Beatiful view. Bedroom configuration allows for extra guests if necessary! We loved it!"

Great views of the creek. All the comforts of home fully stocked to be able to cook meals . There are 4 rooms for sleeping . We will definitely come back !!!!!!!!!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anyone wanting a beautiful, scenic, well equipped home on the Loyalsock will love this extraordinary getaway residence. It far surpassed our expectations. Thanks Michael for being a great host and letting Kathy and I stay and enjoy"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Expect your every wants and needs to be met by Michael and the Creekside Manor. This clean, spacious, organized family space is a perfect vacation spot. The kitchen has all the tools to prepare meals; a wood fireplace in the center of the family room offers an evening ambiance and seating for games/chats/relaxation/quiet reflection... whatever you need. Beds are comfortable and each bedroom warmly appointed. Laundry facilities in the basement were welcomed to keep up on laundry needs. The lovely home has a breathtaking backyard along the Loyalsock Creek. We will return."
2018-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Upon arrival we found the entire house to be spotless. The beds were extremely comfortable, the house was very well equipped and we felt right at home during our stay."
2018-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home nestled along the creek. Great home to enjoy outdoor family time yet close enough to town for shopping/entertainment.
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was an amazing house to stay along the river. We visit Williamsport once a year and after three years, this is the house we hope to stay at every year. Michael was a great host and easy to work with."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a fantastic stay our family of 9 had at Creekside Manor! The property is easy to find with Mike's clear directions that even included a few pictures of landmarks on the way. It was perfectly cleaned before our arrival and the check-in process was simple. A detailed note on the kitchen table answered any and all questions about the house itself and Mike was so helpful before and during our stay, providing extra info on the surrounding area and the best places to eat and visit. Our family is from this area but didn't know anything about Forksville (and their delicious steak subs) or World's End State Park with the cool Rock Garden and stunning views of the valley.
The house was spacious with plenty of room for our 2 families to stay and many friends and relatives to stop by for visits. There are plenty of spaces to sit around and chat or relax, (especially the family room, kitchen and outdoor backyard seating areas) play games and eat. There is a closet with a stack of games for all ages!
I loved the attention to detail throughout this house. Nice fixtures, any appliance you can think of needing, a large refrigerator, pantry and even a folding table and drying rack in the basement laundry room. To me, one of the best details was the ample supply of hooks and towel racks in the bathrooms and bedrooms! We've stayed at many vacation homes through the years and nobody seems to think about a large group of people all taking showers in the morning and having so many wet towels and washcloths that need to hang dry. It seems like a small thing but we really appreciated your forethought on this and many other things Mike and Sherri!
The Creek itself and perfect fire pit were among our favorite places to hang out with family, friends and relatives. There is plenty of outdoor lighting around the house also if you need it for night time activities. S'mores, Hotdogs and Jiffy Pop Popcorn done on the fire (built with the ample supply of kindling and wood provided), catching (and releasing) crayfish in the creek and fireflies at night brought our minds back to our childhoods and gave our kids a great experience they never get to have in Florida or Houston. I'm sure they'll remember this time far into adulthood!
The check-out process was simple as well. There is a list posted on the fridge noting the few simple things that need to be done before leaving.
We certainly will stay at Creekside Manor whenever we visit up in PA - Great House, Great Host - it could not have been more perfect!
Sincerely,
Sheryl, Lisa, Jim Rice and families"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful spot along the creek. Rustic, yet all the conveniences.
Highly recommend."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great Space!!! All the things needed to spend a long weekend relaxing with family. Great communication before, during and afterwards. Easy to get into the house. Lots of space to hang out both indoors and out. River was up but kids loved building dams, rock bridges and looking for critters. Kicking myself for not bringing the fishing gear. Would stay here again with my family!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I really enjoyed staying at the Creekside Manor. We found the home very accommodating and comfortable. The owner, Michael, demonstrated his hospitality by contacting us during our stay to see how things were going, and also had his property manager, George, drop by to welcome us upon our arrival. The pristine water and air that funnels down through the Loyalsock valley was very refreshing and rejuvenating, making this a perfect getaway. We look forward to visiting again in the future."
2018-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Location was awesome. We arrived at night and loved the little touches around the house. In the morning we saw the creek in the backyard and realized that we picked the perfect house. It is a little ways from the main town area but close enough that going into town everyday was no challenge. Would definitely stay there again.
2018-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"My group and I had a great time at the house, perfect place to sit by the fire and relax. Michael was very responsive and an excellent host."
2018-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"I stood at this place for a BD weekend getaway with a group of friends. We had an amazing time here. This is a great place for people who are looking to “get off the grid” and enjoy nature, the company you’re with, and be merry.
The house was quite big with tons of space and bedrooms. Great fireplace and the property is right off the river. It snowed during my stay so it was great to just unwind and enjoy friends and drinks.
I recommend this place to anyone."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We are very happy with our stay at Karl‘s apartment. The location is superb, right on the ""Millionaires Row"". Inside everything is very convenient and modern. As the apartment is facing South, when the weather is sunny, the entire place is full of light, cheerful and cozy. The beds are comfortable and the mattresses were exactly to our liking, which is important for longer stays. In terms of amenities and equipment, we were not missing anything. I also made a good use of the exercise bike while teleworking. Most importantly, Karl has been a great host - always reachable, responsive and caring."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Karl's place was much more excellent than in the photos, and the bedroom was clean and comfortable, while the living room was thoughtfully prepared to the extent that I wanted to stay longer, so overall, I was satisfied."

Don't judge a book by it's cover! This quaint older home has a view of the mountains and resides on a quiet street. The stairs lead to a large second floor apartment that is spotlessly clean and has everything you need to feel right at home! Two bedrooms, kitchen with full size fridge, stove, microwave and coffee maker, bath, living room, washer/dryer, large closets, A/C, television, WIFI.....

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a very nice and comfortable place. The air is fresh, there are hiking trails not too far away, and the neighborhood is friendly. For me, it was a good place to get away for a bit. The apartment itself is spacious and nice, and very well put together, with a kitchen (includes fridge, microwave, cookingware, stove, plates, etc., pretty much everything you'd need out of a kitchen), bathroom, little living area and dining area, and bedroom with a workspace and TV. The bed is very comfortable, and overall, everything was great.
For parking, you can park your car right in front of the apartment door, which is convenient. There's a small gravel driveway you can park your car down.
Matt is very friendly, and gave clear instructions for how to get in.
I had a dog and a cat with me, and they both were also able to live well in the space. Pet-friendly space, set up well for it.
Overall, great for the value."

We appreciated the tip about Mackeyville Greenhouse and Market -- we stocked up on homemade bread and Whoopi Pies! There are several covered bridges in this lovely area of Pennsylvania. The apartment itself had plenty of space for the two of us. We watched a movie before bed each night."

,,,My stay at this property was horrible. I was burglarize because of an extra key being left outside under a Buddha fixed so there was no forced entry. The owner claim to not know about the hidden key and this was separate to the front door that was never mention along identical to the key in the lock box. When confront the host said his ring cameras were off and he couldn’t help me at all so I ended up loosing all my birthday gifts and valuables. Worst Airbnb stay and host ever. Most likely an inside job
