Centrally located to shopping and restaurants."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The apartment was clean and nice. We liked the in-unit washer/dryer. Be aware that the host provides parking for one vehicle that is in a gated parking lot behind the building. We were able to park our additional car in a nearby free 24-hr parking lot. Free street parking is available for 2-hr time periods outside the building.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice and clean, we loved our stay"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Parker’s place was great! Right by Main Street so there’s easy walkable access to nearby restaurants and stores downtown. The room itself was very clean and the perfect size for 1 person such as myself. This would definitely be a place I would go back to!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Parker is a great host and extremely easy and responsive. I will stay here if / when I come back to Jonesboro.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely apartment with everything you need.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The location and the apartment were perfect. Instructions on how to get to the location and inside were very clear. The parking lot was a major plus as there is very limited free parking in the area - which other places did not offer. The apartment was very clean. It is located on the first floor on the back side with a view to the parking lot (which I enjoyed as the front side is right by the road). During the day we did hear the train; however, it did not impact our sleeping. The only thing that did not work was the remote to the ceiling fan so we were not able to use - could have been user error :). I would definitely stay here again and recommend this location."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Cozy
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean! Parker's attention and service was great!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great location very clean apartment building.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Overall we enjoyed Parker’s property for several reasons. The location was great for walking to downtown Jonesboro. The private gated parking was very convenient as there are times when street parking is an issue downtown. The unit was perfect size for two of us. The place was very clean and there was access to washer and dryer in the room with two detergent packs ready for us. Although we did not partake, there was a coffee machine and complementary kcups. The check in and check out procedures were clear and easy to follow. Parker was quick to respond to my messages when we locked ourselves out. And he was kind enough to accommodate our request for a later checkout. This place would’ve gotten five stars but for two reasons. The upstairs neighbors are quite noticeable when moving around although it wasn’t a major issue. Also the 15-20 foot windows are very nice but allow quite a bit of light through and given the open concept with the bedroom being open to the living space, I’d recommend bringing sleeping masks to block out the light while sleeping. All in all we would probably stay here again if we are back in Jonesboro."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,He was great all in all we we’re running late on check out and he was very understanding and overall just a great host
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I throughly enjoyed my time here. It’s within walking distance from downtown which has a few boutiques and restaurants.
Our place was nice, clean and Parker was really great at communicating throughout our stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Parker is absolutely the best. He’s very thorough and responds to messages very quickly. The only thing was it needs more insulation or something bc you could hear absolutely everything. It was quite loud at times especially at 2-3:00 am. I loved the layout and the huge windows. Bed and pillows were so comfy. We couldn’t get the overhead fan to work w the remote but the temp was perfect without it. Did not have a tv in bedroom.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was traveling by myself and this worked great for me. Very clean place. Very modern amenities. Easy check-in and the host was very responsive and flexible. I recommend this place for someone wanting to be near downtown.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean place to stay and close to downtown. Would stay again if ever in the area.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a lovely stay. We booked super last minute on our way through and only got to rest our heads for a few hours but it was absolutely lovely. Everything was so well communicated, super clean and beautifully designed. The town looks really sweet and we grabbed a lovely quick breakfast on our way out from the cafe in the building. Really recommend and hope we can stay again!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Parker was very helpful and responsive to all communication. This apartment was perfect for our brief stay in Jonesboro to visit family and attend a football game! If available, it will definitely be our first option when we come back to town."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The airbnb was clean, beautifully decorated, and in the perfect location right off main street. It's also right across from the Glass Factory too, so very convenient if you're in town for a wedding. Check in and check out were both very convenient. I'd definitely recommend booking this loft"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great downtown apartment!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very easy to navigate to this downtown location. Parker was very responsive to messages and greeted me with the keys as soon as I arrived. Just a heads up, there is only one private parking spot reserved for this location, but there are several public spaces within walking distance if you need an additional spot (the private parking was very much appreciated). Very clean, quiet area. Loved the coffee shop as well. Definitely recommend."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean efficient apartment with everything one would need. Close to all the activities down town. Private fenced parking area.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great space convenient to everything downtown.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The University Lofts are conveniently located in downtown Jonesboro within walking distance of all the restaurants in town. The place was sparkling clean when I arrived and was comfortable to stay in for an extended stay.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Parker is a fabulous host. He was always quick to help me out if I had a question. The space is perfect for one or two people and located in a great place if you want to be near downtown restaurants, the theater (post covid will be even better), and even St. Bernards Hospital. I don't think there were a lot of people staying there while I was there so it was nice and quiet."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This brand new building is located in the middle of historic downtown Jonesboro. plenty of private parking. Everything was brand new and spotless. Parker was easy to work with during a very difficult trip for me. I will stay again next time!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect space for a large group/family. They had all the essentials but we wished there were blankets, shampoo/conditioner, and coffee available. The beds weren’t very comfortable either. But, overall we had a great stay and it was a convenient location to shops, restaurants, and the A state campus."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really liked the house because it had plenty of room for my family of 12 to stay for a family reunion at Lake Poinsett State Park. I liked the fact that we could park in the garage making it easier for my 89-year-old Mother in-law to get out of the car during the rain. Also, the house was very nice and nicely furnished. Our grandchildren loved the basement, hanging out watching movies and playing games."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall it was a good stay for a large family gathering in Jonesboro. Neighborhood was good and safe; house was big enough and basement was huge and great for the kids. Water pressure was good; towels were plentiful and nice. Kitchen was good although not fully stocked. Beds were decent but would be better without the microfiber sheets. Outdoor areas were unusable as they had not received a Spring clean-up and had sticks, debris and spider webs all over.
I would still stay here again but request the outdoor areas be cleaned up and ready for use and I would bring my own sheets and pillows;-)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Good place. Worked well for our family. We only stayed 1 night and was what we expected from a B&B. It had rained a lot and the pool table room was l little musty but everything else was great, in working order and clean. I would stay here again. The garage won’t fit a full size pick up if that is important to you. A car should fit fine."
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,This house was the perfect spot for a large group. My family of 8 really enjoyed the pool table and large comfy sofas. There is ample seating throughout the house. We felt right at home. The house was childproof for the toddler in the group.
2024-04-01,4.0,Group trip,"Our family gathering in Jonesboro at Leonardo’s house was great. The house was comfortable and large enough to accommodate our family of 12. A few things could have been better for all our family but we still had a wonderful weekend together. The dining table only seated 4. It was good that extra chairs were available. Also we didn’t find extra bedding for the futons downstairs. Luckily We brought extras with us. All in all the house was good, close to many restaurants and places we needed. We would definitely stay there again when we are in Jonesboro. Thank you Leonardo for sharing your house."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was fantastic! Easy location and a safe quiet neighborhood. There was a lot of room and plenty of options for places to sleep for all my kids. A few extra blankets for the futons in the downstairs family room would have been helpful, but other than that we had a fantastic stay. I would definitely recommend this house and would stay there again if we were in the area. It is even bigger and nicer than the pictures in the listing."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The only glitch we had with this property was at check in. The host neglected to send us the code for check in. We messaged on the app at check in time, then again 20 minutes later. I was able to locate the host's phone number and called as well. We had to leave a voicemail. In the meantime, we were able to get in touch with AIRBNB customer service. They were also unable to reach the host initially. However, they advised us to go wait at a coffee shop (they would reimburse us for drinks) until they were able to reach the host. It was not very long at all before they were able to get in touch with him. He was able to immediately provide check in information and we were able to access property without issue. The host followed up with me and was very apologetic for the mix up. After that- all was smooth. The property was just as described- as well as clean and well maintained."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great stay! Were in town from Madison, WI for a collegiate disc golf competition and Deja Blue was perfect! Two separate living spaces provided plenty of space, and everything was very up to date and easy to use/access! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay very much! The house was clean and just as described. Very spacious.

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place!! Great location!!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice house in a nice quiet and safe neighborhood. The huge downstairs den with huge TV, pool table, bathroom and two bedrooms, was absolutely loved by my four teenage grandchildren. This also made upstairs quiet and relaxing for us adults. Perfect house for families. Lost Pizza is only minutes away and a 10 minute drive will take you to many nice restaurants. At my grandchildren’s request, I will be booking this home again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,The home was immaculate and conveniently located with large rooms and bathrooms to accommodate my extended family. It provided a home away from home vibe in a family friendly neighborhood. Mr. Leonardo was very proactive in providing detailed information regarding our stay before our arrival. We will definitely book again when we come back to this area. I highly recommend “DeJa Blue” for quality family time.
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great value, ideal for family & friends with plenty of space so not to crowded; nice basement with pool table & separate from rest of house-"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice home, host was very responsive to any questions we had. Would highly recommend staying here ."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Leonardo was always very responsive and helpful anytime we messaged him and he helped by being flexible with checkin and some other requests for our group with small children. There are plenty of bedrooms and beds as well as 3 full bathrooms. There was plenty of room for all of us and we were all able to be getting ready at the same time. Leonardo also made sure to let us know that there was an issue with the keypad for the garage the morning we were to check in so we weren’t surprised by anything when we got there. This is a great place to stay if you have a large family or group!

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, it was a great rental for the area. We did have an issue with ants, lady bugs, and silverfish. The house is located in a wooded area, and the trees/bushes were overgrown. It would have been nice to have a coffee maker and more cooking utensils/pans/bakeware for those guests who enjoy cooking."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,It was perfect for us. Plenty of room to spread out.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Leonardo’s home was nice, roomy, and clean. We enjoyed our stay."

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,q3q6
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great. Just wish the pool table was playable. Needs bumpers and leveling.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the first time we've stayed at an Airbnb. We had wonderful experience. The home was spacious and clean. It was also conveniently located close to a gas station, the Wal-mart and plenty of restaurant choices. We really enjoyed our time at the home and we're very pleased that we were able to communicate with our host. We'd love to stay here again if we're ever in Jonesboro. Definitely 5 stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ellen’s place was fantastic! She was very responsive! Unfortunately we got there later than we were anticipating past midnight due to our long journey. I messaged her and informed her and she was very accommodative. Super nice and clean room with a beautiful bathroom! Enjoyed the small details like the coffee maker and little snacks! Perfect place for a quick weekend trip! Overall we had a great stay for this year’s memorial weekend!

It was very clean and had everything you could possibly need on your trip away from home. The jacuzzi tub was amazing after a long day of travel. All of the bedding was comfortable and she saved me by having snacks available. I travel to Jonesboro several times a year to visit family and this will be my new go to. No more stuffy hotel rooms for me!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I booked Mrs. Ellen's house for my parents. Although they didn't know about too much English. Mrs. Ellen and her husband gave warm hospitality to them.

When I first arrived I was nervous, but she made me feel right at home with a smile and warm welcome. She continued to make me feel accepted at her lovely home by wishing me safe travels whenever I would leave for the day to explore the area. It was touching beyond belief. She helped make my trip another dream come true and I hope to stay at her establishment again in the future, thank you Ms. Ellen!!!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ellen was very responsive and kind. We enjoyed the stocked coffee and snacks that were provided. The jetted bathtub and spa products were much appreciated to use to soak and relax. The outdoor patio was a peaceful place to sit and enjoy being outdoors. Quiet and very nice neighborhood. Bed was comfortable and towels were extra soft. Plenty of closet/storage space which was helpful. Would recommend to anyone who tires of staying in hotel rooms and wants to feel right at home away from home.
2023-10-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"The area was peaceful and quiet, easy to check in. My kids and I were very disappointed when a fuse was blown while using the TV and microwave at the same time the first and second night of our stay. Almost every appliance was plugged into the same fuse and continued to blow whenever we tried to use more than 1 amenity at a time! When asked the host for a partial refund due to this inconvenience I was rejected, not offered an apology, and was told ""you used to many things at once"". Not a good experience representing Airbnb."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I believe I’ve stayed in 19 different airbnbs now and this was by far the most Comfortable and relaxing. I didn’t think that was possible at someone else’s shared home because of my anxiety but Ellen and her husband were very kind and gave us all the space we could’ve asked for while still being compassionate and attentive to our needs. The room and bathroom were over the top beautiful and the bed was the most comfortable place to be after a long 9 hour drive. The little snacks left in the room were perfect for a bed time snack and a drink of water before we hit the road the next day. Would 100% recommend to anyone considering staying here. We would’ve loved to have enjoyed some time in the back yard. Thank you for the wonderful stay

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ellen is a Superhost.
After a long drive, we were tired and felt at home when arriving. Ellen greeted us and gave safety instructions in case of a
tornado. Accommodated us with snacks, beverages, and a very quiet, peaceful, relaxing environment. The bed was inviting and comfortable. We enjoyed morning coffee while listening to the birds sing from our front door. Great value for your money. Book with Ellen, you will not be disappointed."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A welcome respite from a very long road trip from WV! My best airbnb suite ever!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely beautiful place even more than described. The amount of effort Ellen takes that goes into providing anything and everything you could think of I was blown away by how much she knocked it out the park. The place was quiet cozy and Iwould highly recommend. Thank you Ellen
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ellen was amazing!! It made my trip visiting my daughter at college so much more enjoyable then just staying at a hotel. She was so excited to take a bath seeing she don't have that option in the dorms:) lol. Ellen was so responsive with any of my questions and was so accommodating with a late check out. Thank so much for sharing your lovely space!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The best place we've stayed at in this area!
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The room is a 5 star plus. So, much so I was uncomfortable. Details for entering the property were sent the same day I was arriving, after I had departed on a 9 hour drive. Upon arrival I tried to open the email on my phone but because of reception in the area I could not. Had I received the instructions on entering the property prior to my arrival I'm sure the view of my stay would be different. The host was neither warm or welcoming. With that said the room and gardens are beautiful. I won't be staying again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are A-State baseball parents. This was a great place to stay for the weekend when we come in town. It is quiet, comfortable and affordable. Look forward to coming back in two weeks!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I would rather stay here than the Marriott any day. Ellen is a professional hostess dedicated to providing detail and thought to ensure her guests enjoy their stay. Traveling can be stressful but she exceeds expectations.
Each time I stay at an AirBNB I feel like it’s my favorite, but now this one is my favorite!
Thank you so much Ellen for your hospitality and generosity."

The place overall was clean, and all details well thought out! I would highly recommended this place and stay again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed at Ellen's guesthouse for for one night as a halfway point on a two-day road trip. Initially I was planning on staying in a hotel, but found this guesthouse on Airbnb, and I'm very glad I chose her place over a hotel. The price is lower than what you would pay at a hotel and you get a lot more space/amenities. It is located in a cul-de-sac, so it was a very peaceful. I am very happy with my choice to stay here! 5/5 stars."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was beautiful, Ellen was a wonderful host. Would most definitely stay again!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed staying at this Airbnb. We are an older couple with health issues. Ellen gave us clear and precise instructions to make check in easy. She had signs that marked our parking spot and route to our suite. We did not have steps to climb and inside everything was sparkling clean and luxurious. She seems to have put a lot of thought into everything a guest could want with candy by the bedside and a variety of snacks and drinks with a good coffee maker. We definitely recommend this Airbnb and will try and stay here anytime we are in Jonesboro.

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Our original rental had an issue and we were moved to another location a few days prior to check-in. The process was very smooth and Marcus was so easy to work with. We really appreciated that it was taken care of and we enjoyed our stay. This house had plenty of room and was laid out nicely. Would definitely recommend this location and this host.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Christy was great to work with and home was very nice.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,thank you for letting us stay and all the help
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Any house his eyes by Christy is a solid choice. We were at ease knowing we would be staying with her. I have been a o multiple of her listings and they are always presented well and fully accommodating. Thank you Christy
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The getaway was perfect and just what I needed to reset.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I felt like I was right at home. I highly recommend this house for anyone with a family!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a great place to stay! Only thing I will say is it was a little dirty when we arrived.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As with all of Christy's properties this house was enjoyable to stay at and very convenient to the surrounding area.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were visiting for Arkansas State Baseball opening weekend. We had a great time! The home was very nice. We will definitely try to book again on our next visit.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Christy is a great hostess. Her home was spotless with easy access. I would recommend her to anyone.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is perfect. Great location to everything. Very clean and very very well maintained. I will be back again. Christy is FANTASTIC!!!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at this house for 7 nights and it was nice. We really liked the house but nothing was provided, for example no coffee. Other Airbnb’s that we stayed at has always provided coffee and some other things in the kitchen like condiments, seasonings, and leftover food from previous vacationers. This house didn’t provide any of that. We also had a problem with the toilet backing up and there was no plunger. We had to go buy a plunger so we could unclog the toilet. The only reason I am giving 4 out of 5 stars for the rating is because there was no plunger and we had to buy one. Otherwise, this is a great house to stay at when you are in town."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great house in a great location, it had everything we needed for our stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The driveway was definitely steep (especially leaving) 😂 but Christy clearly stated that prior to check-in. The house was peaceful and quiet. We enjoyed our stay and will book with her again.
The house is close to anything you'll need or want, but out of the way enough to not have to deal with a lot of traffic and noise."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for a place to get better rest than at a hotel with thin walls and people going up and down the hall all hours of the night while in town at a conference. I was a little concerned about Christy's place being so close to the road, but it wasnt a problem at all. Was literally perfect. Easily accessible (I had no problem with steep driveway) and close to everything but still in neighborhood enough to be quiet."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a wonderful time visiting Jonesboro and staying at Christy’s place. She was INSANELY responsive and helpful through the whole process and the place itself was exactly as described, was perfect for our family. To top it off we had forgotten one of my son’s pillows that had a sentimental blanket inside, and Christy was one enough to mail it to us free of charge. Would 100% recommend either this place or any of Christy’s places to anyone looking to rent in the area, and can only imagine she would be a wonderful realtor to work with if purchasing."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,5 stars all around! Great host!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Christy was friendly and upfront about all specifics of the home. she was very responsive with questions and comments I sent. The area felt safe and the home was very comfortable. We look forward to staying with Christy again soon!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay for the price.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved cooking on the gas stove. Christy is a great host and really knows how to set these houses up. Second one of hers I have stayed in. Tvs in every bedroom and comfortable beds. A lot of Air BNB’s we stay in have tv in living room and master bedroom. None in the other two. This one has TV in all bedrooms which is the way it should be as cheap as they are. Thank you, Christy will stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would definitely stay again in the future!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as advertised! Great host. Would stay again!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,well worth more than the amount I paid truly enjoyed the stay and I will be staying at one of here places again in the very near future
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Host. place was as described. I will be using Christy Again. Thank you we enjoyed our stay
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Christy was very kind and super responsive. I had to change my reservation a few times due to scheduling issues and she was very accommodating. The house was squeaky clean and exactly as she described it. Would stay here again.
Couple things to know though. The driveway is SUPER steep so can be tricky to get out of so be aware. Also this location comes with great assortments of dishes and pans, but there are no body wash, shampoo or conditioner in the bathrooms. No hair dryer or clothes iron. Just things to be aware of if you are expecting this."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were attending a wedding in a rural area about an hour away. We could've stayed here or Memphis area. We chose this location as it was a full house, multiple bedroom and our whole party could stay for a reasonable price (versus a hotel which were most of our other options).
The house is exactly as the pictures describe and it was quiet. I really liked that they had ceiling fans and stand fans in EVERY bedroom. When I turned the stand fan on it provided enough noise that it blocked out the busy road in front of the house. We all slept great! Kitchen is VERY well equipped! Lots of plates, silverware, cookware and even a crockpot. Typically we cook on trips, but this one was very short with lots of driving so we didn't. However this kitchen is truly set up for it. Couches were also very comfortable for lounging.
Driveway was steep and narrow as Christy noted but it is manageable.
Host was very responsive! I had a few questions and they were all answered very quickly and politely."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at three of her places and all are very nice. She is my first choice when staying in Jonesboro.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean responsive would stay here again

Will definitely stay here again when we visit Jonesboro again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying at Christys place. Totally worth the price great location near everything .
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice townhome for sure. Clean, neat, and inviting. Minutes away from downtown. Driveway is a bit steep, but we made it work. Would definitely stay again 👍🏾"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"She was very responsive and quick to get back to me, especially when me and my coworker were in town early answered all questions, and the place was as described will be booking with Christy again"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great, the only minor thing was the driveway. Extremely steep and narrow. During the rain it was hard to get in and out of driveway without getting in the muddy yard.
There must be only 1 air conditioner/heater. Because it was like a sauna upstairs, but freezing down stairs.
But overall, it was a nice place to stay. Christy was extremely responsive to all questions."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,a very beautiful and spacious soothing comfortable house
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house! It was very clean and welcoming and Christy did a great job communicating everything about the property. Unfortunately our job got cancelled but if she has this available when we go back, we will definitely stay again!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place! Will definitely be back.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was relaxing and I enjoyed the split level home. I will return and super appreciate you being pet friendly, especially for those of us who have well-behaved clean animals. You’re a gem and priceless to myself & Bella. The house is exactly as photographed."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as described and any question I had was promptly answered. Excellent host, great home. Will stay again if in the area."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place worked well for us. We were in town for the Liberty Bowl and with all the water issues in Memphis this place was a dream! The house was clean and had plenty of space for us to sleep 5. We didn't have time to cook, but the kitchen looked well stocked.
The driveway is STEEP! We read the reviews and looked at it on on-line maps and thought is wasn't that bad, but once you get there it is very vey steep. With 2 cars in the driveway it did make it a little challenging. We just parked one car on the turn around pad and the other car on the bottom of the hill towards the house where it is flat. Reversing on that hill was challenging since the street is somewhat busy. Very minor issue considering the house worked well for us. But if you are planning to ""come and go"" a lot this might be an issue. We only had to deal with the driveway a few times.
Overall we liked the place and it was close to restaurants and gas. We would stay here again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The weather really had an impact on our stay but Christy was always supportive and flexible after our two days of travel. The house is as cute as can be and the location was just what we needed. Thanks, Christy!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,The place was perfect for our stay while visiting family prior to Christmas. We enjoyed our stay and would choose it again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this house is a cute starter home! my coworkers and i travel alot. and wanted to try airb&b out instead of hotels, since our experience was horrible in the hotels around jonesboro. this house was plenty and more for me and my coworker ! we will definitely back to this location!! we enjoyed it so much!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best experience we’ve had at an Airbnb. Christy was the best host ever! Immaculate home, great location with everything we needed. Highly recommend."
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"If your bringing service animals of any form make sure you make them aware, despite it stating that you don’t have to include them in booking if it’s a service animal she told me I was suppose to let her know prior to booking that I had service animals and requested the paper work which by law isn’t required and an act of discrimination in a very slight form but it is. The place is a decent stay however and it’s cozy. Did have a fly problem unsure of where they came from but that was an issue. She also attempted to charge me extra for cleaning sheets due to a small water stain on the comforter and extremely light colored stain that could be corrected with simply washing."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Christy's house is in a convenient location that makes going out easy. Her communication is quick and clear.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was so cute and she was wonderful on checking in & communicating!
2022-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"Has most things you need and clean, but two major problems:
The bedrooms are too hot to sleep in , even with fans on, while the living room gets too cold. We stayed in July. Basically no air flow in the bedrooms.
The living room is anything but private. One half of the sliding doors has no blinds or window treatment with a full view to the neighbors windows, not only that but there’s a camera (on neighbors door) pointed towards the living room. So we didn’t feel comfortable sitting in the living room for family time. The dining/breakfast area has barely enough room for 4."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Christy was a fantastic host for letting us stay at her home
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was cozy and inviting for our party of 5. Location was great with easy access to everything we needed. Christy was a great host, she responded quickly to questions and expectations were very clear. We would definitely rent from her again."

Christy was prompt and courteous with all communications, and made us feel like she really appreciated our business. We had a very pleasant experience and will definitely look up one of her homes for our stay, the next time we're in town."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect place to stay for our event. The driveway is really steep and very little parking. That was the only thing that was challenging but other than that everything else was great!!!! highly recommend 👌

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Christy allowed our church to book her property for a visiting minister and his family. They enjoyed it so much more than a hotel - having 2 little ones in a hotel room for days at a time would be difficult so this was a wonderful alternative.

2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a wonderful place. It is very clean and stocked with all the necessities. Mrs. Christy is very responsive and friendly. It’s a pretty steep hill but we didn’t have an issue with it. I like the house being back from the road. It is a great location a lot of places to eat and shop. Downtown is just 6 minutes away. This is our second time staying in the house. My family will be staying again.

The place is a bit tight in the living area, but having 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, and washer/dryer was so nice!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was fantastic, and everything worked as it should. The kitchen was stocked with most cookware/utensils, although do bring/buy a cheap baking sheet if you want to bake anything.
The appliances are great and very new in appearance, and the wifi was more than fast enough.
The neighborhood appears very quiet and safe is very quiet at night.
Stayed for business, and this was a great break from a hotel room (been on the road for a month straight). Kinda nice to cook my own NY Strip!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stayed in Christy's airbnb for almost a whole week and it felt just like home. I absolutely loved that there was a TV in every room. Living and dining room were intimate and cozy for family time.

2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,SUPERB! 💯
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stop looking!!!! This is the place you want to be if visiting Jonesboro! Jennifer’s place is immaculate! Nicely decorated, spacious, private, awesome scenery, great pond & only a 10-15 minute drive to stores/shopping. The beds were super comfortable & the view amazing. Every amenity you could ever need. Well equipped kitchen, which was important because I had to cook brunch food items for 65 people (for my daughter’s Baby Shower in town). The highlight is, of course, the LONG HORNS!! My husband kept saying, “This isn’t a trip, this is an experience.” My adult children were just as fascinated with the Long Horns as much as my 3 granddaughter, LOL. Hands down 10/10. You will not go wrong or be disappointed in choosing Jennifer’s place to stay! She & her family are super nice & Dixie will make you feel right at home!! I would definitely stay here again & again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved this beautiful home on the farm. It was so peaceful to sit on the front porch overlooking the lake and watching the cattle walk by. Very comfortable beds and the entire house is relaxing and very clean. Kitchen is the most fully stocked kitchen we have ever had at any of our previous Airbnbs. Our family loved our stay. Thank you!
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at this Airbnb! Overall, we liked it and would stay here again. It was easy to find, easy to check in, and it was a comfortable and enjoyable space for our family. We chose this one specifically because of the cows right on the property. They weren’t around as much as we had hoped, but in the evening both nights of our stay they did come and graze very close to the house. Our kids loved that and kept asking about the cows even after we left!
It’s very peaceful and a beautiful view of the countryside.
We appreciated the host who was quick to respond and give clear instructions. We would totally stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Would definitely stay again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I loved my stay at Jennifer's Airbnb. It was just a beautiful experience watching the cows in the morning while sitting on the porch. Thank you for your hospitality and that unforgettable scenery ❤️
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Longhorn View is an extremely homey, comfortable place to stay. I was there with four friends to see the total solar eclipse, and it was just the perfect setting. We loved the open floorplan inside and the open sky outside. Longhorn cattle walking by was a bonus and, of course, Dixie the blue heeler. Total sweetie. I would definitely recommend Jennifer's place."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything about our stay was beautiful! The kids loved seeing all of the animals and the lake. The home was immaculate. We enjoyed our stay!

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome place and scenery! Very well kept and maintained!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family stayed here for lodging for a duck hunting trip close by. The location was convenient and perfect for them. It was secluded so we felt very comfortable leaving the boat there while going to town. There was a circle driveway so it was very helpful with the truck and boat trailer. It was more beautiful than the pictures show and we will definately be back every year. The friendly dogs and view of the cattle and horses were definatley a plus! My son left his toiletry bag and she even Fedexed it to us the same day as checkout. Definatley recommend this place!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"I had booked this place with a few other friends for a duck hunt the first week of January. The Airbnb was beautiful inside and out. Jonesboro was only within a 20-minute drive. One of my favorite parts of this Airbnb was the ""no shoes inside the house"" request. A few others and I are Asian so that was normal for us. The carpet inside was extremely clean and it was something we appreciated. The beds were very comfy and clean. My favorite part was probably the living room. It had enough room for 4 or more guys to hang out and talk. The property is on top of a hill so with the blinds open you overlook the pond and terrain which looked amazing at sunset. After the early mornings and long days, it was a nice spot to settle down and make memories with the guys. I'll definitely be looking for this Airbnb first if we're ever headed back up to NE Arkansas."

It was in a great location, less than 20 minutes to both Paragould and Jonesboro! We will definitely stay again for another weekend adventure!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pictures don’t do it justice. Jennifer was easy to communicate with and was very accommodating and proactive. I’ve already told people about it and have recommended staying there.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was ideal for a weekend getaway. The views were stellar and peaceful. I enjoyed the friendly dog and lake access. I will definitely stay here again.
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"We loved the place. Very nice and peaceful. BEAUTIFUL land and enjoyed watching the horses and longhorn cattle. There were even fireflies in the evening near the trees. Flys we’re kind of annoying but I suppose this time of year (mid-June) they’re bad everywhere. We have the annoyance in New Mexico (where we are from). Traveling back to NM they were bad at every stop. The only reason it wasn’t a total 5 star ⭐️ review is because we wanted a place for family to come a go. We had 6 people staying but we’re only allowed 3 cars parking and with many people visiting because we had our matriarch (soon to be 89 yrs old) for families to visit with her. So I had to shuttle people back and forth from different parking lots in Jonesboro and Brookland. Jennifer (our host) said it was because they had so much rain. All things considered, we had a great time with family and would recommend Jennifer’s property."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a great house. Loved seeing the cows and horses she had. Great location for what we needed. I will be back

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was cute and close to everything you could want or need. We all slept soundly on the comfy mattresses. The options for coffee, along with sweet gifts (local honey and homemade soap) were much appreciated. The hosts were responsive, helpful, and kind. The whole place was spotless and felt like an upscale vintage house. We will be coming back next time we are in town. :) Thank you for the hospitality."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect spot for our family to Snuggle Inn for the weekend! Clean place, well-stocked, and easy to access. We loved the vintage decor and all the extra touches from the hosts. Blessings Jen and Grayson, thanks for your communication and having us at your beautiful space!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Snuggle Inn was exactly what my husband and I needed when we recently visited Jonesboro for a graduation. Easy checkin, great location and clean, mid-century small house, decorated with vintage furniture and decorations (felt like we were visiting our mom’s house).
We were greeted with a handwritten note from Jen, welcoming us and giving us some local honey and soap! Very nice!
My husband and I both worked remotely on Friday and the internet was crazy fast at 492 Mbps download. Internet not an issue!
The bed was super comfy and we slept very well. It has a memory foam topper on it that was incredible- in fact, I asked for the brand and Jen sent me the link. The shower/bath is brand new- looked like we were the first ones to use it, although I know we weren’t.
Everything is exactly as described online. I don’t know that we will ever be back to Jonesboro, but if we are, we’ll come back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Entering the front door of the Snuggle Inn was like walking into an aunt’s or friend’s house growing up in the 60’s. The furniture, the decor, even the patterned sheets on the bed were true to the era. The giveaway that we had not truly traveled back in time were the responsive WiFi , the incredibly fluffy towels, and most importantly, the super comfy mattress (best sleep of this 2-week road trip, thanks also to the quiet neighborhood setting)."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best hosts I’ve worked with in awhile! Private, quaint space and was exactly what we needed. Very hospitable hosts as well. Would recommend!"

It was really like a home away from home. Loved the soap, honey, and dog treats she left out for us! We would definitely stay again anytime we're going to be in Jonesboro. The place was great and Jen is amazing! Check-in was so quick and easy and the amenities Jen provides were great! One of the best Airbnb stays we've ever had."

I highly recommend staying here if you’re looking for a cozy home with an admirable vintage touch to it. The host Natalie was very communicative, responsive, and proactive to our needs and questions during our stay. If we pass through this town another time, we will definitely consider staying here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were very nice and communicative: when I had questions, they were very prompt in responding, and when I needed additional supplies, they brought them over quickly. The property itself is nicely set back from the main road: it’s a private, quiet unit. I am a solo female traveler, and I felt safe in the space. I was in town for a conference at Arkansas State, and did not have a car: it’s a reasonable 15 minute walk to campus. Lyfts/Ubers were easy to get: it’s about 10 mins to downtown and Airport. The unit itself is well kept up, clean, and nicely decorated. I loved the porch, and the living room and kitchen are sunny and spacious (the couches and chairs were cozy), and the kitchen has a nice fridge and freezer, coffeemaker, and microwave, all of which are clean and new. The bedrooms are spacious and pleasant, and the bed I used was comfortable. I appreciated having a nice, new washer and dryer, that was very convenient! The WiFi worked well, which was great. Highly recommend!"

Traveling solo meant safety and security were of utmost importance, followed quickly by the proximity to the A-State campus. It was a quick five-minute walk to my son’s dorm and the streets were well lit. It was a perfect spot! Perry was a super dee duper host. He or his wife communicated straight away from start to finish and even took care to send detailed instructions when they learned I would be checking in after dark.

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy little house in a great location. Privately located back from the road and surrounded by tree lines. With fall coming, you may be able to see other homes nearby, but with full blooms on the trees we could barely make out some rooftops. One morning a mother deer and her fawn visited.
We were surprised to have laundry detergent, dish detergent, cleaning supplies, plenty of paper products and Lysol wipes provided. Also some fruit and doughnuts which were appreciated. Kitchen is supplied with plastic plates and cups. Nothing fancy. I would suggest bringing larger pots and pans if you are cooking for a larger group. We only had 3 people staying, but with lots of out -of -town people in for a funeral, I wanted to cook for us all but didn't have large enough cookware/dishes for this. Just an FYI- may not apply to anyone else.
Beds were comfortable and clean as well as living room furniture. Bring a lawn chair and enjoy the small covered porch out front, but be careful! The door automatically locks behind you! If you haven't memorized the code or have your phone to look it up, you will get locked out! Also, there is grass now, so kids have plenty of room to play in the yard.
Would stay again in this older home that has been renovated for rentals. The host was very attentive and quick to respond to messages."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great location close to ASU campus but sits back off the road a bit so it’s very quiet. The home was very clean and had everything we needed! Very cozy and they even provided a few snacks for our arrival!

2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Jim’s stay was comfortable but for the price paid, the furniture could be a little more updated for a better experience. The kitchen and bathroom was very modern and enjoyable to use. The walkway to the backyard needs to be cleaned up as pillows and trash was laying on the floor. Location was spot on with nearby food and grocery shopping."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jims place was perfect for the few of us working in the area. We had inclement weather and had to leave early. Jim quickly adjusted our total. Would stay at any of Jim's properties when in town!

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place if you're in the area. I had come up to work on a job and by chance found this place. I was not disappointed! It had everything we needed. A TV in every room was a major plus since we all wanted to watch something different. We had accidentally locked the door knob (keyless entry) and couldn't get back inside. We was leaving for work, and I sent them a message at 5:30 in the morning. They instantly responded and got it unlocked that morning. I'm definitely going to be checking back next time I come in to see if it's available!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything about this place and our stay was exceptional.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was brand new and super cute! Cannot say enough good things. We had our own private suite while the kids slept in the main house. Our youngest fell in love with the bed under the stairs. We accidentally locked ourselves out and Samantha responded within minutes to help us locate the extra key. I’m an Interior Designer and very picky- they nailed it! Just lovely!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, had everything we needed for our stay. We enjoyed it so much we booked an extra day, which they made super easy!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful place to stay! We were so thankful they worked with us for a last-minute stay, and everything was perfect! We stayed one night in the attached cottage, and it was beautiful and exceptionally clean! The bed was so comfortable, and linens were spotless. The bathroom was also very clean, and well stocked. I felt like I was at a five-star hotel, but even better because it felt like home. Very private, and felt safe traveling with just my son and I. With the loft, my whole family could easily have stayed here. Beautiful property, and I wish we would have had more time to enjoy it. Great communication. And I’m hoping to take my husband back sometime. If you’re looking for a place to stay in the area, you won’t find anything better!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Samantha's place was perfect for our situation and she was a super host. We were in The area for a graduation and meet up with multiple family members. We shared the accomodations with other family members and other family members joined us for an enjoyable dinner and an evening of conversation on the front porch. The Cottage was the perfect setting.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is such an adorable home. The detached Master Suite was perfect! The kitchen is functional AND beautiful.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I found Mark's place for a quiet getaway and it was perfect. the little cottage is exactly like the pictures. I wish it was my own little house. The pond pool is wonderful, along with the rest of the property. Mark and Joni were great hosts. I brought my little dog with me and he made himself right at home immediately. He made friends with the chickens and with their three dogs. I wish I could have stayed longer and will definitely go back."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our third stay. It is again the perfect retreat after a long day of driving. We always feel the carriage house has the same feel of our own home. That is not something you usually find traveling.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here again on our way back home from vacation. It was another great stay! Our boys loved swimming in the natural pond. I will say, if you aren’t a fan of waking up to animal noises make sure to bring a sound machine. We knew there would be animal noises from the description, but they were up earlier than we wanted to be. Thankfully we had our sound machines and just turned up the volume."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was without a doubt the cleanest, most comfortable airbnb we have stayed at ( and we've stayed at many), and was super well stocked. Our dog was welcome, there were even treats for him. There is a natural pool which we didn't swim in but our dog jumped in. It is a hobby farm with 3 horses, 3 dogs, a cat, several chickens, ducks , and a rooster. Very cute, well maintained property."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We very much enjoyed our stay at Mark and Joni's lovely guest house. Everything was very clean! We loved waking up to see the horses and chickens right outside the window and the beautiful surroundings!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wish we could have stayed longer. Lovely home and property. Bed was comfortable and had everything we needed. Our boys loved playing in their living pond; it was a great way to get out their energy after being in the car all day.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We didn’t get to enjoy the outdoor much during our stay as we were just passing through on our trip, but waking up to the chicken, rooster, dogs, horses! It was beautiful and relaxing! The house was super clean and very comfortable we felt right at home! Will be staying again for our future trips!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful inside and out with comfortable beds and furniture and every imaginable resource and amenity. Charming decor and wonderful pastoral landscape.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice farm in the middle of the city. Very peaceful and quiet. Lovely farm with horses and chickens. Very beautiful home to stay in.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had the most wonderful stay at Clearly Hidden Acres. What a lovely retreat, and the best airbnb of all time! Mark was the kindest host and provided homemade cookies and farm fresh eggs. The property is pristine and meeting the horses was truly magical. We just could not have asked for a more beautiful and peaceful experience."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! What an amazing get away. I only wish we had had more than one night to stay. Animal lover’s paradise. Lots of charming things outdoors to explore like the pond, windmill, barn, horse stables, three beatiful, tame horses (Massah, Outlaw & Libby), natural swimming area/pond/pool right outside the guest house, chickens, dogs, a cat, basketball goal, pasture, etc. My Wife and I particularly enjoyed feeding the horses. Mark, the host was friendly and we really enjoyed conversing with him and walking around the property a little bit. The host’s home and the guest house are both beautiful. Everything in the guest house worked as it should and the place was well stocked. Huge walk in shower. Two toilets including one with a bidet. Sitting chairs outside on the front porch. King size bed. My Wife and I want to visit again sometime, maybe when it’s warmer and bring our 6 year old Son and two dogs. This was absolutely one of the top three airbnb’s we’ve ever stayed at!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My family stayed over night on our way back from Texas. It was a beautiful place and we got a great nights sleep for the long drive ahead of us. I would highly suggest booking this place. Absolutely beautiful!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This location is perfect for us because it breaks a long trip from Chicago to Houston in half. The lodging feels like a comfortable home of your own. Extremely well maintained and equipped it would be tough to find something not provided. This property is one it is worth going out of your way to experience. See you again soon Mark!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautifully done guest house. The craftsmanship in this home is really top notch. The bed is soooo comfortable!
I was traveling with my cat cross country, who loved watching the horses & chickens outside. I enjoyed walking the property and seeing the horses (Libby was my favorite) and the adorable turtle. Yep, I pretty much talked to animals for 2 days. I'm sure I'm not he only one.
Mark's place is a comfortable place and is stocked with coffee and all the basics and beyond! The homemade cookie was delicious surprise!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mark’s guest house was lovely! Beautifully decorated, fully stocked and a comfy bed! Just what we needed for a short stay. We would highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was wonderful. It is a great little oasis not far from the city and had all the amenities you could want. Our son loved the animals and our dogs felt right at home.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came to Jonesboro to duck hunt at our new lease and unfortunately the water wasn’t hooked up . So at the last minute I was able to find this beautiful place and it was only a few miles from where we were hunting. Absolutely beautiful, extremely clean, pet friendly , and Mr.Mark makes you feel right at home. I hope to visit again soon ! The natural pool was stunning!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful retreat for a peaceful weekend. The host did a wonderful job of making sure he's responsive and available without being overwatching or in the way. He let us explore his property on our own and we are grateful for his trust in the guests with his animals and land. His 3 dogs are well socialized, mannered, and even tempered. We brought our 3 dogs and all 6 co-habitated very well in the yard."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This cottage was amazing! I wish we were able to stay longer to fully enjoy it. It was what is in the description and much more. The cottage was very clean and inviting. Our little pup loved yard and a few new friends. Thank you!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My stay was a 10/10. I was looking for something calm, quiet and peaceful. This was all of the above and more. As soon as I walked in I felt instantly more calm and relaxed. Mark and Joni were very friendly. I had eggs in the fridge on arrival. They made sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. Brought my pup who isn't normally eager to be around other dogs and animals. She got along with the other dogs and she was entertained by the roosters and horses. I will be back soon!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had an excellent time during our stay! Beautiful home and surrounds!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mark was great, beautiful property, I would highly recommend!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family loved staying here. My kids loved swimming in the pond pool, even with it being cold this time of year, searching for frogs and trying to pet the tortoise. They loved playing fetch with the dogs and feeding and brushing the horses. The fishing pond was cool trying to identify all the nimal prints around the water, and the chicken eggs were delicious! Thank you for the wonderful stay! The peaceful relaxing surroundings were exactly what we needed to break up our long trip. Would pove to come back again."

Overall, we would absolutely recommend this place for a weekend getaway."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is probably the best Airbnb I have stayed. The beautiful surroundings and the cozy cottage is priceless. Joni and Mark are wonderful hosts.

Would definitely stay here any time we are in Jonesboro area!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had an incredible stay at Mark and Joni's rental. The cottage was immaculate and the property was absolutely beautiful! Such a treat getting to spend the week in this little paradise.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mark and his family were absolutely great host! I've got 10acres in Greenbrier, AR with a 6stall horse barn I might mimic this and not AirBnB it!! Great place if you're needing somewhere to stay around Jonesboro."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a beautiful and relaxing place! Mark made sure we had everything we needed and then some!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! Most incredible AirBnb we have visited! The place was incredibly clean, updated, and had everything we could have hoped for and more! The shower, bed, and view were heavenly. The BBQ restaurant the recommended could not have been more delicious!
The most incredible stay to also have the opportunity to meet their incredible animal family! Horses, dogs, chickens! All was well worth the stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 recommend Mark and Jonis place! This is by far the best Air BnB I have ever stayed in. Their place is quiet, peaceful, serene, and homey. Every amenity you could ever want is provided. It was a perfect place to unwind. Mark and Joni are so kind and gracious! Their natural pond pool is fabulous, and their pups were super friendly with ours. We will definitely return and will recommend their place to everyone!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,beautiful home and farm. loved watching the horses and chickens and my dog had a good time too!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome place to stay one of the hidden gems on Airbnb. If you are in the area or looking for a nice place to get away and stay this is an incredible option. Pool is super fun and has a turtle, can feed horses and relax. Very comfortable"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was absolutely gorgeous. Mark and Joni have thought of everything that we could have wanted. We were only sad we didn’t have more time.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough positive things about our stay. The location is beautiful, the house was so clean and cozy, and their doggos are so friendly! We brought our dog for a weekend vacation so she could run and swim freely inside the fenced in area. And she did just that multiple times each day, we especially loved it when their dogs played and swam with ours! My husband and I also found their guidebook useful when venturing in town for dinner. We can't wait to come back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our little family of 4 stopped in on our way through Jonesboro and this was the perfect little cottage! We loved the animals and swimming pond and enjoyed the fresh eggs for breakfast! Would def come again!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was one to remember. We cannot say enough great things about this space. Everything was perfect! It was a great escape from the hustle and bustle of Chicago. The animals and environment kept us engaged. The swimming area was immaculate and unlike anything we have experienced in the city. Mark and his family were extremely accommodating and kind. We definitely hope to stay there again when passing through and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a getaway.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect for a quiet weekend away. The dog loved swimming and having other dogs to play with! Craig head forest state park was close by and a neat place to see.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cottage is a gem and its hosts is very accommodating and helpful. The place is fantastically integrated into the small farm and you can use the grounds and pool and retreat at the same time. There are fresh eggs from the chickens and the whole terrain is a place to recharge and unwind. It doesn't get any better! Thanks for letting us being your guests.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We sold our home in Jonesboro and needed an “in between” place to stay before moving out of state. A hotel was not an option with 2 dogs and our length of stay. Clearly Hidden Acres was a perfect fit. Just enough space for myself and teenage son to spread out. Our 2 cockapoos loved meeting the “locals” and I appreciated the fenced in area they could roam. (Didn’t even have to use my doggie bags 🙂) The roosters did wake up early but after some time it was a nice background soundtrack. My gamer son had no issues with the internet and I was able to log in for some quality Netflix time. The location is private and secure. Easy drive to town and amenities. I would recommend this stay for anyone visiting Jonesboro. Would even be fun for area locals to experience the “farm life”. Thank you for a restful experience during a very crazy time of transition.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The property is beautiful and the house was very clean when we arrived. Pictures don’t do this place justice. I highly recommend this listing to anyone looking in the area. We had the pleasure of meeting mark and he was very friendly and welcoming.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautiful place to stay. The cottage felt just like home. We just stayed one night because we were just passing thru town, but may have to find a reason to stay in Jonesboro again for a longer stay.
We traveled with our doggies, and the area was fenced and we didn't have to worry about them at all. There dogs were very friendly and we enjoyed seeing our dogs interacting with them."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time at Mark’s spot! Our puppy, Charlie, got to run around and hang out with Mark’s dogs who were all very nice. The backyard is awesome and perfect for visitors with a dog. Mark and his wife were great hosts and we felt right at home."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cannot say enough great things about the space! It was a quick last minute overnight trip and we were so thankful to find this place. We cannot wait to come back again. Definitely our go to from here on out!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"In a word, cookies! They had cookies on the counter when we arrived!!!!! I mean, talk about hospitality! And farm fresh eggs in the refrigerator! Now, you know if there was that level of detail, everything else was just amazing! Amazing surroundings, amazing guest house, amazing shower and amazing mattress!!!!! If you are ever in Jonesboro, Arkansas, run, don’t walk to Mark’s place - you will have the best stay whether it is overnight or a few days!!!!! Just perfect!!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I have stayed here several times while working in Jonesboro. Always a comfortable stay! Great hosts!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mark’s Airbnb was a dream. We needed a place to stay for the night and I wish we got to stay for a week. The pictures online are beautiful, but walking inside surpassed my expectations. Mark thought of everything you could need, all the cabinets were stocked. The place was spotless and we loved the area. Mark also let us feed their beautiful horses carrots which was a great experience. One of the best airbnbs I’ve ever stayed at. Thank you for being such gracious hosts."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We fell in love with this place and have booked it on two separate trips. It is set on an idyllic horse farm. I could see horses out the bedroom window. Lots of warm touches like fresh farm eggs, lots of bathroom products and kitchen supplies and a comfy bed. Our dog loved it and loved swimming in the fresh water pool/pond. Highly recommend for city folks it's good for the soul."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mark’s “pool house” (the structure is the size of a small home) was extremely clean, beautifully decorated and furnished, and located on a beautiful piece of property. This property was extremely accommodating of my dog and would be a great place for kids with all of the farm animals and pool. Hands down a great experience and Mark was extremely helpful and responsive."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here as a little reunion for us after not seeing each other for six months and it was everything we could have asked for and so much more. Extremely easy to get to, instructions on how to get in were perfectly clear. Getting inside the cottage, we instantly felt at home and peaceful with such a warm feeling inside of the cottage. The cookies are to die for!! We couldn’t get enough of them. Mark and Joni were extremely great in allowing us to use whatever food was there for us to have/use up. The fresh eggs were an amazing touch. The bed is like a square of heaven that you sink right into when getting in, we felt tiny in it and we’re tall people! What stood out for us is all the little things that you would need but didn’t think to bring along with you, all right there for you to use. Our trip was perfect and we loved spending time there. Most friendly and kind people we have come across. And all the animals! We will definitely be coming again!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If this home is available, stay here!! Exactly as pictured— amenities, animals, and all.
Mark and Joni are responsive and make you feel right at home. They find a perfect balance between making you feel welcome and providing privacy.
Truly a wonderful stay in a little slice of paradise."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved staying here. Perfect size and good location. The area was beautiful and we felt right at home. The kitchen and bathroom were well stocked. Would love to stay there again!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was wonderful. Definitely will stay here again. Exceptionally clean and identical to pictures. Host very friendly and responsive. Beautiful place.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cottage house is clean, comfortable and well equipped. Being around the horses was a nice experience. Communication with hosts was flawless. Highly recommend."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing…had a fantastic stay. Slept great after a busy day. Amenities are amazing and will have you rebooking before you leave! Hospitality impeccable! Fantastic hosts!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have stayed here a few times now while in town for work. Excellent place! Clean, safe and inviting!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, beautiful and clean. Great host!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to stop over for the night. Made us wish we could have stayed longer. The cabin was well appointed, well stocked, and extremely comfortable. Thank you Mark and Joni for being kind and gracious hosts."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay as always. Mark and Joni are such wonderful people, you won't regret staying here!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place to stay!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was my first time staying in the area that wasn't Memphis. I was worried and not sure what to expect, but Mark and Joni's private haven felt secure and beyond safe. The fresh eggs? 🥹💙 I felt cared for at their guest house. Waking to a rooster and taking in the beautiful decor, views, and sunrise are the best way to start the day. Will definitely try to come by again in the future."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Better than home, a quiet little farmhouse get away! More like your “best friends guest house”"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One of the best Airbnb stays we’ve had! Highly recommend, especially if you have small children. Our kids loved seeing the chickens and horses! The accommodations were beautiful and would absolutely stay here again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My wife and daughter stayed here while visiting family so this review is written by them. This house was perfect, first as you drive up the grounds are just beautiful. It's very clear that Mark and Joni take wonderful care of their property and animals. When we arrived Mark was there tending to the horses and he was so nice chatting with us and letting my daughter pet and feed them, he even showed us where extra treats were so she could feed them anytime. Walking into the home it smelled of peppermint and was so clean and nicely decorated. They had cookies waiting for us on the counter, my daughter hasn't stopped talking about how good they were. The kitchen is well appointed. The bed and pillows were so comfortable, probably the nicest of any Airbnb we've stayed at. The shower is huge, the size of some people's bathrooms, and the master toilet has a warming toilet seat and bidet function. Everything about this home is just perfect. By far the best Airbnb in Jonesboro."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved the little farm house feel. Would definitely come back
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really appreciated all of the comforts of home and well-appointed cottage. Mark was very friendly and accommodating and allowed us to leave our pet in the yard while we went and picked up lunch and filled up our car for the long trip back to Texas. Our dog had the time of his life playing with the other dogs and it was a great stay for him as well. If ever back this way, we would definitely stay here again. Thanks for the hospitality Mark & Joni!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is AMAZING. If you are looking for a peaceful, gorgeous stay where details and kindness are never overlooked, then this is the place. We’re so grateful to have spent any time here because it is a true gem (and so are the owners!). Our dogs LOVED the place from the swimming pool to the horses. Well definitely be staying again when we come through the Jonesboro area!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, we highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best cookies ever
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my 2nd stay this summer at this property & it doesn’t disappoint. Great area, beautiful space, great hosts!
Janet"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was very beautiful n I got to ride a horse!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was absolutely the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in. The house and property are gorgeous. My two dogs and I had a fabulous time relaxing by the pool and enjoying nature. Mark and his wife were gracious and kind. I felt at home and was able to get some much needed R&R.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great host and great setting! Enjoyed our time there very much.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,this place is phenomenal Mark and Joni are the sweetest people felt like family I said will be our new place to stay when we come to visit family a home away from home
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mark and Joni's place was absolutely gorgeous and had everything we needed for our stay. Our daughter loved all the animals and especially enjoyed playing ball with the dogs. The location was easy to find and extremely private. We hope to visit here again one day when traveling. Wonderful stay!!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean, very cute, very pet friendly. My husband and I recently stopped on our way to see family and could not have been happier with this little oasis. Clearly Hidden Acres is easily one of the top places we’ve ever stayed. The pool/pond was a blast! Our 11 month old pup got to play with the owner’s dogs and conquer her fear of swimming (well, moderately). We will absolutely keep this place in mind next time we’re driving through!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was so spacious and gorgeous beyond imaginable! Mark and Joni were so nice and always just a message away. Their dogs and horses are the absolute sweetest as well as their cat. We absolutely will be back for another stay in the future. Everyday by the pool was such an amazing time spent with family and not to mention the goodies they left out for us and our pups.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clearly Hidden Acres was an incredible stay, Mark and Joni are two amazing people. I came in town for work and had my two pups with me, they welcomed all of us . When we arrived they had farm fresh eggs that were delicious, my pups loved the pool and were joined by theirs. The atmosphere was so peaceful, Mark and Joni had incredible communication and made sure we were very comfortable. This is probably one of my favorite places I have stayed."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mark and Joni have one of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve ever been to. If you love beautiful country, animals and a stunning guest house this place is for you!
Inside: You walk in to a 10/10 clean place, serving fresh cookies and fresh eggs from the chickens outside. The bed is extremely comfortable and the master bath is a dream.
Outside: Being surrounded by their horses, chickens, bunny and pet turtle that lives in their pool pond was the best. Our daughter swam for hours in their pool/pond playing with the turtle, and hunting for frogs and tad poles.
Hosts: I’ve never stayed somewhere where the host made feel like we were family members. Mark and Joni allow for total anonymity if you want or to hang out together. We gravitated towards hanging out. They blessed our daughter with a surprise horse back ride for her 10th birthday. Truly quality people!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We LOVED our stay here!! The house was clean, spacious, and adorably decorated! Meeting the animals was definitely a highlight of our stay, in addition to swimming in the natural pool. The farm-fresh eggs in the fridge were such a nice touch. We swung by the store to grab tortillas and cheese to make delicious breakfast tacos!! We'll definitely be back - thank you for the memorable stay!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful spot to stay that is both warm and functional. Has everything you need for a getaway or a short stay!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic cottage! Safe neighborhood. Beautiful grounds! Highly recommend ❤️
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was one of the best stays I've ever booked on Airbnb. Period! Mark and his Family were super welcoming and their guesthouse was just great for our small family and pet. It had more amenities than I could've thought of. It was spacious and the bed was very comfortable... If you enjoy nature or have kids, this would be a great place to stay. They have horses, dogs, chickens, a water turtle and some frogs. Also, the natural pool was a very unique experience. It was great swimming in the pool while the dogs were running around and sometimes even joining us in the pool. Whole lot of fun for the whole family. Finally, those fresh eggs that we were offered from the farm tasted outstanding!
Thank you for making us feel at home! We've had an amazing time!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful! Mark and Joni have a perfectly well appointed guest cottage on their beautiful slice of heaven. Fresh eggs are kept in the fridge from their very own hens and everything you need is stocked in this quaint little cottage. Most AirBNBs do not offer pack and plays which is a huge selling point for those traveling with a little one. The horses, natural pool and beautiful scenery all make for a wonderful stay. The huge shower and comfortable king size bed allowed me some of the best sleep I’ve had. Highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place and stay!
We felt like part of their extended family.
Our kids had fun as well … enjoyed the dogs, kitty, bunny, chickens, horses, and ‘Thor’, the turtle!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place gave us just what we needed for an impulse getaway trip. We grabbed supplies on our way in and only left the Acres once for a drive around. The rest of the time we enjoyed the scenery Mark & Joni built (and beautifully take care of daily), cooked in perfectly laid out kitchen, & snuggled in the AC on the amazingly comfortable bed & couch. Our bulldog (Ms. Baileys) got the chance to hang out with Harvey, Charlie & Yadi which was such a blast to watch.
Mark & Joni, we'll for sure be back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cottage was absolutely beautiful and the property it sits on is stunning. It was peaceful and tranquil with the lovely horses, chickens, and rabbits nearby.
The interior of the cottage is cozy and modern in design. The shower is huge! The hosts have provided so many amenities and helpful things in case you forget something.
We got in late on a cross country move and were so happy to have the fresh baked cookies that had been left out for us.
We hope to return soon for a longer stay!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was the best airbnb. Great location and a perfect setting. We made an overnight stay after a long trip and I slept the best I had in two weeks. The most comfortable bed and relaxing place. Enjoyed seeing the horses which were beautiful. My little dog loved all the new dog friends and loved the yard she could walk around in. I could write all day and not be able to give a review that does this place justice. A hidden jewel! We definitely recommend this airbnb if your in the area.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay here! It was the perfect weekend getaway for my husband and I. The whole property was incredibly beautiful and felt very secluded. We brought our anxious dog and he got along very well with their dogs and loved swimming in their pond pool!
So friendly and welcoming!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an awesome stay! Mark and Joni are really good people. The accommodations are superb. The horses, dog, cat, hens, and rooster are both restful and entertaining. This place is both fun and peaceful. Very close to A-STATE, Sam's, Kroger's, Downtown, and Walmart. It's expensive, but we will have a hard time staying anywhere else in Jonesboro. Nothing else even comes close!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Mark and Joni for opening up your doors to us! The cottage was perfect! The bed was comfortable, everything was nice and clean, the kitchen was stocked with more then what was needed and the fresh eggs in the morning were perfect! Yes; the pool is shared with the main house and their dogs; but that didn’t bother us one bit! We still had our privacy. We enjoyed the peace and quiet and will definitely be back soon! Thank you both again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is great! It is so peaceful and tucked away, yet so close to everything at the same time. I highly recommend it if anyone is looking for a place to stay in Jonesboro."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Clearly Hidden Acres is gorgeous with its fields, horses, sweet dogs, and chickens with tasty eggs!! The cottage is a very special place. It is beautiful and absolutely adorable. The entire cottage is updated, it is decorated beautifully, has lovely furniture, and the bed is comfy!! The owners Joni and Mark are nice people and very welcoming. They were easily accessible, but at the same time, respectful of my privacy. I was in Jonesboro for the birth of my grandson. I knew I would be staying alone and I wanted to feel safe and I did. As an individual with a disability, the one floor living and the walk in shower were so helpful. It made getting around so much easier. This was the best airbnb I have stayed at."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cottage was so beautiful and comfortable, but the best part (in my opinion) was the surrounding property! We loved hanging by the pond, and our daughter enjoyed seeing all the animals. The host was also super kind. A great stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Magical and fantastic! My husband and I stayed here with our 2 dogs. We loved the cottage and the relaxing atmosphere. The amenities and extras were lovely. Our dogs had a blast in the pool and playing with the host family's dogs. Everyone was kind and welcoming. I highly recommend staying here and will stay here again in the future!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I stayed a week to visit with friends and family. This quiet, somewhat secluded location, is perfect for relaxing and having downtime. The hosts were very accommodating and easy to communicate with for anything we needed. The bed was very comfortable. The host’s dogs are well behaved and my 2 yr old basset had fun roaming the yard and playing with their younger lab. We would stay here again the next time we are in town."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyed our stay. The cottage was spacious, clean and had everything you would need including fresh eggs. The host, Mark and Joni, were super nice. Would definitely stay there again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very beautful guest house and property, has everything you could ever imagine!! Very friendly host"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a last minute booking that we so appreciated. Everything was perfect. What a cute, comfortable and clean place. We definitely will stay again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mark & Joni were wonderful hosts. This was the PERFECT place to stay for us as we traveled cross country with our two labs. They have 3 beautiful labs who are so friendly & were constantly going in and out of their pool/pond to play fetch. The home inside was so beautiful & I felt like I had everything I could need inside. All the supplies (bandaids, dog beds, kitchen supplies, fresh eggs & chocolate chip cookies waiting for us!) that normally would never be in a hotel, we’re super handy. It’s a goal of ours to end up back here again one day. Wish we could’ve stayed longer!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay! The location was perfect and we loved seeing and interacting with all the animals. The dogs are super friendly. Check-in was easy. We wish could have stayed longer!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clearly Hidden Acres is exactly as described, a beautiful country estate with a natural pool. We did not get to enjoy the pool other than to admire It due to the cold weather. Loved seeing the horses, chickens, and dogs. We had our dog with us and he enjoyed playing with theirs. Fresh eggs anytime was a nice touch as well as “Delicious” home made cookies. Also, the bed was extremely comfortable.
Our stay there was great. Mark and Joni are very friendly and accommodating."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing stay, wish we had stayed longer! Best equipped bnb we’ve ever stayed in, the king bed was tough to leave!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mark and Joni provided the most beautiful homestay for us! Not only were they accommodating to our pets and guests, they went out of their way to ensure we were all comfortable. Dog beds awaited our furry friends when we arrived, fresh eggs were in the fridge for us to enjoy, and we didn't need to worry about forgetting anything because there were extras of all basic needs for us to use and enjoy. Mark and Joni were prompt in their communication and provided the most comfortable stay for us. We would love to come back to Jonesboro and stay here on our future trips!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wish we could stay here for weeks! This was the perfect stop after a long day on the road. Beautiful, calming, comfortable. We hope to be back soon!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic place! We loved all the unique touches this stay had to offer like the MASSIVE shower and the bidet toliet seat. My kids even thought the lift recliner was cool! The kitchen is gorgeous and very well stocked. The king bed was soft and cozy. Mark and his wife were very friendly and even let our kids feed their horses. 5 stars from us!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Clearly Hidden Ranch couldn’t have been more comfortable for our small family with dog. The guest house felt private and had everything we needed for our one-night stay, including freshly-laid eggs for breakfast, and horses to gaze upon right out the back window. Beautifully decorated, clean, spacious, and well-furnished. We would definitely stay here again, only maybe next time in the summer, when we could swim in the naturally filtered pool. Mark was a friendly, helpful host."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay. Comfortable and very accommodating. Special attention to details are wonderful! We highly recommend!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family loves this stop on our long drive home for the holidays. The front closet / office is perfect for a pack and play + the fold out sofa means our family of four can all sleep comfortably. The kids love seeing the horses and chickens out the window. The beautiful Christmas decorations made it an especially enjoyable visit. ❤️
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mark is such a great host
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mark and Joni were amazing hosts! The house was super clean, they give farm fresh eggs from their chickens in case you’re interested! you share the yard included with the homeowners, but they never make you feel unwelcome in the slightest! they even allow you to interact with all of their wonderful animals and only ask that you close the gates afterwards! i’m so happy i chose to stay here and will definitely return the next time im looking for somewhere to stay."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This stay was just fantastic! Really nice host, beautiful place with AWESOME backyard and 3 cool dogs. It was just a great experience in every way!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay. It’s tucked away and quiet. Mark and Joni were wonderful.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We couldnt have asked for more! Mark and Joni are wonderful hosts and they have an exceptional Airbnb. The cottage is privately located in the center of a tree lined gentlemans farm hidden behind a nice neighborhood with a shared back yard with our hosts and Yadi, Charlie, and Harvey, three friendly labrador-esque pooches, and includes a freshwater, plant filtered pool that houses Thor the turtle. The yard is beautifuly landscaped and is bordered by fenced horse patures with Mesa, Outlaw, and Libby, three lovely horses. Out your back door is a private bench overlooking the horses future barn, chickens, rabbits, and Marco the cat. We woke each morning to a roosters crow, pet the dogs with a cup of coffe on the front porch, even fed Thor lettuce, fed the horses apples and carrots. We slept each night in the quiet peace of far off country sounds in the most comfortable king bed ever. We became friends with Mark and Joni during our nearly two week stay, and with family in Jonesboro, we will never stay anywhere else. It was fantastic!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is very clean and well decorated! Mark was fantastic to communicate with and I booked this very last minute and he was able to accommodate me. Very beautiful place!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"5 stars across the board. Hosts were amazing. They brought us fresh eggs for breakfast. Setting felt secluded but was convenient to the Highway and town. Fenced in yard for puppies, modern clean house. We will be coming back!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Absolute fantastic and quiet place to stay! Highly recommended!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Just wonderful. We have already booked there twice and will book again when we head back that way!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay at this cottage! It was so cute, clean and fun! Highly recommend for a weekend get away. Our dog had just as much fun running around the fenced in yard!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage exceeds all expectations! The hosts go above and beyond in every way. Driving up to the property is absolutely stunning and just gets better as u get closer. The property is immaculately clean and you feel like you are miles away in your own world when in reality you are quite close to everything! The hosts are personable, great with communication, and willing to help in any way. This is definitely a repeat stay when ever possible!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My all-time favorite Airbnb! Beautiful property with so many thoughtful touches. And the hosts were attentive without being intrusive. Will definitely return!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect little getaway! So adorable! Owners were so kind and we loved all the little details. Our daughter loved the pond pool and meeting all the animals!

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, impeccably clean, and incredible hosts. Couldn’t have asked for better."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"this little cottage is right out of a story book. only cleaner!! very peaceful setting. the bed is comfy, the shower is amazing. all the little touches are there from the antique looking furniture in the office, all the comforts of home in the kitchen, the exposed beams on the ceiling.. I could go on and on. we didn't go out to the little pool but it was very pretty. this is the best little place in the area sure."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mark and Joni have an amazing property and provide wonderful hospitality. Communication is excellent. The pool is great. I would definitely stay here again.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Marks place is amazing!! Wish we could’ve stayed longer. Thor was chillin by the pool. The dogs and horses were very friendly. We didn’t get to meet the cat. Bed was very comfortable, one of the best of all the Airbnb’s we have tried. Everything was so well stocked. Our dog had a blast as well!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at Mark and Joni's truly felt like a once in a lifetime experience! What an incredibly beautiful and unique property, and with warmth and kindness that couldn't be beat. The space was immaculate and soothing to the senses. The tall ceilings, abundance of light, and high quality appliances, decor and furnishings made me feel like I was in a spa setting! The king bed was a treat, and I slept very well. The walk-in shower, well-stocked kitchen, parking right outside the door, and washer/dryer were also big bonuses. When I first arrived, I took my dog out to swim in the amazing pond/pool. It was so much fun to share that experience together! Do be careful if you use the pool, as it is slippery on the bottom. Joni eventually brought out with their three well behaved and enthusiastic dogs. The four of them had a blast swimming together and fetching tennis balls. I appreciated Joni's company and conversation. Clearly, Mark and Joni both have the gift of hospitality - they made me feel very welcome and forethought every need (and beyond!), yet were always respecting my privacy and space. I also appreciated their prompt and clear communication, and their spirits of generosity that seemed to go into everything. Don't miss out on this incredibly opportunity that is both a ""stay"" and an ""experience!"""
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It isn't often you get to wake up with chickens and horses outside your window... in a beautiful cottage that is comfortable, elegant and well equiped. Not to mention, the natural swimming with a friendly turtle who greets you with interest... named""Thor."" Add to that warm, kind and generous hosts, farm fresh eggs.... not sure how this can be beat. We hope to pass through again one day and highly recommend the stop whether it is your final destination, or part of your journey."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful place to stay - such a beautiful and peaceful location! Your slice of paradise is perfect for a respite or a weekend getaway! The beds were comfy, the pool and animals welcoming, the house was perfectly stocked, and the host (Mark) was absolutely delightful."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My daughter and I really enjoyed staying at this lovely place on our way to and from a wedding. I am so glad we got to go back a second time as the inside is amazing and has everything you could want. But the true gem is the lovely fresh water pool. We had great weather both trips so were able to just hang out in the pool for hours. Such a treat after a long drive! The location is great for travelers too as it is close to a main highway and easy to find. Thanks to Mark and Joni for being such lovely hosts.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place! Really enjoyed the unique setting and being able to bring our four legged friend. The farm eggs were fantastic and the place was very well stocked with everything you could need. Mark and Joni were very responsive and flexible for us as we were leaving. Really enjoyed the natural pool!! Brought a twin blow up mattress for our son and made the walk-in closet into a mini room for him. It worked out great! We will definitely be back!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super comfy bed!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazing place. My daughter and I loved the natural pool and the relaxed setting. The house is also incredible. It was spacious and clean and the bed was so comfortable. Mark was very helpful and we enjoyed the fresh eggs left in the fridge. Thanks so much and we look forward to staying here again on our return trip from our family wedding we drove to.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is fabulous. Exactly as described and more. It’s relaxing and beautiful with fantastic hosts. The kitchen is great, and they even offer a variety of snacks. The natural pool is wonderful - but bring swim shoes if you have them, as the bottom is def a little slippery. Hope to stay again sometime! Thank you for a fun “girls weekend” away from the city!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place is very nice, quiet and relaxing. It was nice to dip in to the natural pool. Even if the house is within the vicinity of the hosts’ house, we did not feel that they were there because they just respected our privacy. The house is clean with great amenities. Communication with Joni and Mark was easy."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so great. It’s located perfectly in Jonesboro! Right inside the city, but hidden enough to feel secluded and peaceful. These hosts do it right. So many extra gifts and amenities that really make it feel like you’re at home."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay! Home was clean, spacious, and comfortable. The bathroom was super nice. We enjoyed the pool both days. Downtown Jonesboro is a gem and only 10 min from the Airbnb. Hope to come back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Like a place out of a fantasy book! I was led to Mark's BnB by the cute farm animals, to appease my wife who is really into it. Little did I know I was about to go on a journey! Upon entering the grounds we went through what seemed to be a portal through arching trees, which felt like we were going to Narnia, to find ourselves on the grounds of Marks B-E-A-U-TIFUL Farm. We were greeted warmly by Mark's lovely wife and children, who gave us the rundown of the grounds and area. Next we stood in awe marveling at their three majestic steeds. Before entering our abode we were taken aback by the insanely well crafted pool/pond. It was not only uniquely set up but well maintained, a bit jarring considering I did not prepare swimwear, but I digress. The moral of the story is if you find yourself in Jonesboro AR, this stay will undoubtedly be the highlight of your trip and truly make you understand why anyone lives in Arkansas. Also they have a bidet, 5-stars all around! Thanks Mark, we will not forget our time at your place!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Mark and Joni have created a beautiful oasis of peace at their farm, and to be able to just plug into the calm and quiet and solitude is wonderful. The cottage has every possible amenity and was so clean and satisfying to stay in. As host, they are kind and responsive and easy to work with. You will be wishing you could stay forever !"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a wonderful place to stay. Everything was beyond expectation. We were on this trip not really knowing where Jonesboro was at and booked it to the proximity to Memphis. When we were talking with people at our first stop in Hot Springs we received the response of .. “wait, Jonesboro can’t be your final destination...” after some anxiety and second thoughts we could not of been more pleased with our stay."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Extremely comfortable and clean. It is a great “escape” and you feel far away from everything without being far away. My son loved the animals and the pool.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect setting. Perfect place. Everything was spot on! Kids 4, 5 and 16 loved everything about this place as did my wife and I. Mark and Joni are great hosts!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The guest house is beautiful just like the pictures. We loved our time there and hope to stay there again. Mark and Gina are great hosts.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Best Airbnb to date! The property and animals were awesome but good people make everything better. If we ever have a reason to pass through Arkansas again, we will definitely come back. 5 stars!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow!! If you’re looking at this place... BOOK IT! Absolutely beautiful and the host were wonderful!! Relocating for work and this place made me feel right at home!!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family simply can not put into words how wonderful our 3 night stay was!
We were on a road trip and were set to go from Springfield, MO onto Memphis for the weekend but we were having difficulty finding a pet friendly location .... so as we were driving I stumbled upon Mark & Joni’s farmhouse. After reading the impeccable reviews and knowing how much our dog and kids would enjoy the farm and space instead of a hotel... I quickly booked it.
The quiet neighborhood we drove through to get to their gates was manicured and lovely.
The first glimpse of the property we all had big smiles and knew we were set for a great stay.
The level of detail, style and cleanliness given to the guest house is incredible. They even had fresh cookies waiting for my children, treats for the dog and fresh eggs from their chickens in the fridge.
The fenced in area for the dog was amazing and the property itself is so inviting to just wander around, go visit and feed the horses, take a walk on the quiet lane, sit by the natural pool/pond searching for the turtle.
Mark and Joni somehow have that rare, magical hosting quality of welcoming you, connecting, making you feel right at home yet also giving you privacy and freedom To explore and relax. It’s incredible!!!
Whether you’re looking for a getaway or traveling through... our family would recommend their place to all!!!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful little place, easy access and easy to find"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is somehow even better than the pictures. If it’s available and you need to stay in Jonesboro, book it now before someone else does. Quite possibly the best air bnb stay I’ve had, and I have had quite a few. Horses, friendly dogs, the nicest hosts ever, and an immaculate house. I already miss it!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent place to stay! Very good host with a beautiful and clean home. Would highly recommend to anyone coming to the area.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Mark’s place! Definitely one of the nicest Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in. So stylish, super clean and cozy, and they were so accommodating and easy to communicate with. We will definitely be back if we are in the area in the future! Highly recommend!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay! Was in the process of moving back to Jonesboro for work and needed a place to stay with my dog for a week until my move was finished. Mark helped make that happen. Location is perfect, easy access to town but on the edge of town. Beautiful and quiet property with well set up guest house. If you’re in the area on business or just need to get away, can’t recommend this stay high enough."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique and special experience! We loved being with the horses and all the farm animals. What a wonderful treat to have fresh eggs. We enjoyed our privacy and relaxing while listening to the fountain. The guest house is very roomy, stylish and comfortable. Mark and Joni are outstanding hosts."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing stay! The way Mark and Joni went above and beyond to have everything we needed was so thoughtful. The house was a perfectpalce to get ready for our wedding. The decor is so very fitting for the style of home and the animals walking by the windows was an extra treat. The horses, cat, dogs, and turtle were all so friendly. I wish we had more time to stay and sit out on the porch or by the pool. We will definitely come back for a longer stay next time!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an amazing place! We were just stopping through for the evening and needed a place to sleep and let our two dogs run a bit. The house is spotless and the space outside is perfect for dogs to run and play. Such a beautiful setting. We got to chat with the homeowners for a bit in the morning before leaving and they were wonderful and warm and even offered some medical treatment for our dogs minor injury. Couldn’t recommend more highly if you and looking for a great place to relax and rest. Wonderful bungalow type cottage with master bedroom and bath, and adjoining kitchen and living area. Also a small adjoining office space and powder room. Even a nice turtle hanging out in the pool by right out the front door. We hope to go back for a longer stay in the future."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a great place to stay. Gorgeous decor, easy to find, and cozy!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful little place to stay. Was perfect for our passing through.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mark and Joni’s place is amazing. Not only is it beautiful but it was stocked with everything we needed for our trip. We packed groceries and necessities but it was like walking into a fully stocked home when we arrived. I’ve stayed at a lot of AirBNBs and sometimes it’s like walking into a cold and vacant property. Every thing here was warm and welcoming and comfortable. There is something about waking up, walking outside and seeing the horses and chickens and the beautiful field and just being at peace. It was close to local restaurants and we went to the museum at ASU. But really we kept finding ourselves back at the house relaxing and just enjoying the peacefulness of it all. It was too cold to swim but it was so beautiful to sit out back. Absolutely no negatives and only all positives about this place! 🥰 And Mark and Joni were so quick to respond when I asked them anything (like can I feed the horses apples lol). They are really sweet people. Thank you!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I LOOOOVED staying here. The space is so beautiful and so clean. The property is so serene and comfortable. It feels like you’re on a country retreat but you’re just five minutes from everything you need. I will definitely be back!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Mark was an excellent host and the guest house was perfect. Very clean and welcoming.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to spend a few days during the fall! The location was beautiful, house itself was spotless. They had a large amount of food/spices stocked for use. The property was beautiful, we loved seeing the horses, chickens, and their 3 sweet labs. Would recommend to anyone!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a fantastic stop on our road trip, a perfect space after a long car ride. It was clean, spacious, wonderful lighting and a shower that was insanely big! We would definitely stop here again and will recommend it to anyone passing through."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very unique, classy retreat from your every day stay! We had a totally private weekend yet felt like family at Marks. Loved the design of bunk house plus loved being so close to the animals! An added bonus of being a quest on this private property is the security! We felt completely safe the entire weekend! Jonesboro is a cool town as well!
*My cat was so entertained by Marks cat"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mark and Joni were so hospitable! We felt right at home! This place is more beautiful than we thought. Our dog loved it too! Would definitely recommend and would love to visit again!!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful stay! It’s incredibly clean, well decorated, and nicely stocked. We stayed one night and wish we had more time to enjoy. The backyard oasis was a welcome perk for morning coffee and separately, for our pup to run around after a day in the car. If you find yourself in Jonesboro, take advantage of this sweet retreat."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very welcoming and helpful
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cottage and farm is a wonderful place for a quick getaway, perfect for children and dogs. The location is close to parks and fun daytrips, and peaceful enough that you would be fine not leaving the cottage. Mark, Joni and family were wonderful (and gracious!) hosts - offering fresh eggs, horse rides, and friendliness at no extra cost. Excellent communication. So thoughtful they included a rooster for a wake-up call!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect one night stay for our family of four. We were greeted with treats for the kids to feed the horse and a cookie for each of us waiting in the kitchen.
The key code for the door made access quick and easy. The cottage is charming, clean, and up-to-date. The kitten had everything we needed for a making dinner.
We put our toddler in the bedroom and we slept on the sofa bed. In hindsight, we should have switched beds!
This was a wonderful overnight stop on a long drive. ❤️"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We would 100% come back here again! My wife is super picky about where we stay, mostly for cleanliness, and this was her first AirBnB experience. If we knew every AirBnB could be like this, we’d do it again. But our guess is that you have gone above and beyond because it literally felt like you were treating us like visiting family. No detail was missed. Perfect experience and absolute dream spot for a vacation during the pandemic. And the icing was getting to bring our dog, who equally felt at home. It was like a piece of country in the city. Worth every penny."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Clearly Hidden Acres for a second time this summer while on a road trip. It was so comforting to know we had a familiar, safe, and welcoming space awaiting us. Everything was impeccably clean and bright, and the hosts are so incredibly caring without being intrusive. Our daughter enjoyed seeing the chickens, horses, dogs, and cat on the grounds again. Truly a hidden gem, and once again we found ourselves wishing we could stay longer."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All of the family had such a great experience. This place is charming and Mark and Joni are so kind and welcoming.
We would definitely recommend this place and can't wait to come back."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible hosts! So sweet and kind!!! The place is amazing! Great experience to create a truly incredible weekend getaway!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Clearly Hidden Acres. The guest house is cozy, comfortable and welcoming. And it was wonderful that we could bring our puppies. The horses are beautiful and friendly and our dogs were very curious about the chickens! Thank you for your hospitality! We hope to be back."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I visited Clearly Hidden Acres for a brief retreat from life and could not have been more pleased with our visit! This was the perfect place to get a little R&R!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The guest house was beautiful. It had everything we needed for our stay. The garden/pool area was relaxing and perfect for our 2 pups to run and swim. Mark and Joni were wonderful hosts and I would highly recommend their place if you are staying in Jonesboro.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is INCREDIBLE! it’s truly special and one of a kind. The natural pool is amazing and being surrounded by all of their animals is so much fun. The only downside was that the mosquitos keep you from enjoying the outdoors at night which we didn’t expect. usually on a vacation we’d swim or sit by a bonfire at night but because of the bugs that’s not possible here. Don’t get me wrong- nothing to take any stars away and i would absolutely return to this airbnb. just make sure your family is prepared to find things to do inside every night! Luckily the inside of the guest house is beautiful and well stocked! The hosts were so warm and inviting as well! You won’t regret staying here!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome. They had absolutely everything; it was well stocked for a week-long stay. The property is beautiful, including the guest home. Massive walk-in shower and comfortable rooms. The pool is amazing, we enjoyed our time the whole week. Mark and Joni are the icing on the cake, very hospitable. From cookies on welcome day, to farm fresh eggs, even a quick jaunt on their horse, we couldn't have asked for better. Great stay, would definitely stay here again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mark and Joni’s place is absolutely beautiful. One thing I love about staying in Airbnb’s is that I get to experience furniture, appliances, decor, bedding etc that otherwise I would just see in the store and rely on other people’s reviews. This stay let us experience beautiful decor, comfortable furniture and bedding and a stunning bathroom with an amazing shower. So many little touches and beautiful things that I would love to someday incorporate into my own home. They also left such sweet touches for us; fresh eggs and cookies! We loved spending time with their animals (so did our dog) and took in breathtaking views of horses in the pasture and dragonflies above the pool. The kitchen was fully stocked, we made every meal in house and spent our days swimming, hiking and playing disc golf. We really enjoyed our time and hope to be back someday! Thank you for the great, welcoming hospitality and wonderful week!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. Spotless and relaxing. Fun in pool and watching all the animals.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A spectacular place! My puppy and I had the best time enjoying the guesthouse, pool, yard, and local spots (i.e., Craighead Forest Park). Mark, Joni, and their family were all so kind and welcoming! The hospitality was beyond lovely - Even the smallest touches like fresh eggs and cookies. The place was spotless and exceptionally well-stocked! One of the absolute best AirBnB experiences I’ve ever had and truly a relaxing getaway. The natural pool was unique and wonderful. Also horses!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the Clearly Hidden Acres cottage. The cottage was clean upon arrival and the scenery and natural pool were both amazing. Mark was an excellent host . He allowed us to interact with his horses, which our daughter especially loved. His labradors were also very sweet and got along great with our dog. I would not hesitate to return in the future!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful, unique stay! My family and I enjoyed this quick getaway for us and we enjoyed every minute. Clearly Hidden Acres makes you feel like you’re far away from everything; the pool pond, horses & chickens made us feel like we were on a farm stay, but with all the modern amenities to help us enjoy our time! It is also 10 minutes away from things to enjoy, like Craighead Forest Park or one of the many restaurants in Downtown Jonesboro. Highly recommend!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clearly Hidden Acres ranks as one of our favorite Air BnB’s that we have ever stayed in. Mark, Joni, and their children were incredibly welcoming and exceptional hosts. The property is stunning, the space is outstanding, the natural pond/pool was spectacular, and the animals were the icing on the cake. They even left treats for our dog. CHA is a must stay!"
,,,"Look at the photos and read the profile carefully. The pool is only a few feet away from the owner's back door, so you will not have any privacy in the pool. You can't tell that from the main profile picture, where the home is JUST cropped out of the left side of the picture. You can only tell from the one aerial photo that's (currently) the 14th of 22 pictures. The property is beautiful, so I'm sure this is a great place to bring the kids and play with the animals and whatnot. But it's certainly not a place for a romantic getaway with a significant other."
