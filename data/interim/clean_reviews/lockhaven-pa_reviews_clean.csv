2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect home and location for attending events at or near Lock Haven University. Easily walkable to all things on main campus. Shops and restraunts on Main St would be a longer walk, but definitely doable on nice weather days.
The home itself is great and had all of the necessary amenities without being cluttered. Everything was clean and tidy.
We brought our dog along with us, so especially appreciated having the back porch and yard area. Our pup also enjoyed walks to the LHU campus (sidewalk on both sides of street to and from).
There was an unexpected delay at check in time that was handled swiftly by our host.
Thank you to Zachariah and family for sharing your home!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall the stay was nice. I recommend parking in the back of the house instead of the driveway to avoid walking up the steps and possibly hurting yourself. The host was very accommodating and flexible as I was in town with a few family members for a funeral and needed to adjust our check out date slightly.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Just what we needed for our trip. A place to hang our hat overnight with comfortable surroundings. We walked our dogs on the nearby Lock Haven campus.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a place to stay close to Lock Haven University where our son will be attending in the fall and will be playing football. We knew nothing about the area, and we feel so much better after this weekend. We felt like we were exactly in the middle of where we needed to be!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is a marvelous home. Well maintained and furnished. Owner was easily to contact and quick with responses. Actually looking forward to returning there on our return trip.
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The good:
The house was clean and conveniently located. It was well stocked with useful items and more than large enough for our group.
The bad:
When we arrived at the house, which was later in the evening, the indoor home temperature was 85 degrees and the air conditioning was turned off. While we were able to decrease the temperature, it took until 5 am to do so. This made for a fairly restless night. Also, the home was advertised as having central air conditioning and it did not. One room, the one with bunk beds, was not air conditioned at all and only had a fan. Another room had a window unit and there were two mini-split units placed in other rooms."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Spent a month June into July 2022. Very comfortable and private. The song of the Wood Thrush greets the morning. Donated a couple of table lamps as they are generally lacking in Airbnb’s. Host was helpful and welcoming.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovey home with everything you need for your stay! The driveway provides ample parking and the house itself was clean and well maintained. All supplies were easily accessible. Check in and check out were easy! Highly recommend.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was perfect for what we needed. Would stay again.
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Overall good stay. Close to Main Street, Lock Haven University and things to do. Bedrooms were good with comfortable beds. Good kitchen amenities. The place could have been a bit cleaner, specifically the bathroom. Pictures in the listing do not show the close proximity of the homes on both sides. Zachariah was a nice host and overall I would recommend this Airbnb."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot, close to town and easy check in. Nice and clean, next time I’m in town I will look to book here again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house had a great living room set up. The pillow top beds were very comfortable. I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of supplies that are there for our use. The weekend we came it snowed 7 inches and they had someone there to do the driveway and the walkways 😁 Will be staying here again on my next business trip
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, host was very responsive. House was great, large bedrooms and comfortable beds. Living room was so nice to visit with family! Definitely want to stay again!"
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Easy to book home great for a brief stay in Lock Haven! Very clean interior premises and all necessities were provided. Owners are great on communication and rapidly respond to messages. My son left his glasses there and the owners rapidly located them for us along with shipping them back to our home -- many thanks for this!
The primary area that I would suggest improvement on is: more accurate depiction and description of what the back/sides of the property look like. From the listing photos it appeared that it was in a somewhat private location when in fact we were surrounded by many other homes. This really only mattered to me because we brought our two relatively large dogs (yes, they are pet friendly here!) and taking them outside was somewhat challenging and lacking in any privacy given the tight confines of the property lines and closely neighboring homes.
Overall though I would certainly recommend this home if you're in need of an economical (and again, PET FRIENDLY) lodging option in the Lock Haven area.
THANK YOU"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay…spacious and comfortable in every way!!!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Lock Haven. Close to all the outdoors.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication! We ended up getting there a day later due to weather and Zachariah offered for us to stay the next night to make up for it (we needed to get home, but appreciated the offer). We also had a last-minute additional person and he was happy to let us tack that friend on. The house itself is clean, full of everything you could need, and a perfect location for so many activities in and around the Lock Haven area."
2022-01-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,Convenient home in a good spot. Two of the bedrooms had overpowering odors. Good communication but lack of snow shovel made it difficult to leave during a snow storm. High price for what you get.

The home is a great deal, as it has 3 bedrooms and a decent sized living room with a very comfortable sectional couch. We enjoyed hanging in the living room and playing games at the kitchen table. Very kid friendly as there wasn't much that my toddlers could get into and either destroy or hurt themselves with. :-)"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful and quiet. Just what I was looking forward to as I work almost the equivalent of 2 FT jobs. We were in the area for a friend's wedding and this was the perfect place to stay. Went a few days earlier than the wedding to make the trip a mini vacation.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. It was exactly what we needed for the weekend.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brenda was an excellent hostess. She got the place ready and we had the option to check in before 3:00pm. We ended up getting a late start so we arrived much later than we wanted to. When I updated her on our arrival she wrote back and said she would turn the outside light and the kitchen light on for us.
Thank you for great facilities, amenities, and hospitality, Brenda!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"2 nights at Brenda’s place was great for visiting our son at Penn State for a long weekend. A little further out from campus than I’d like, but the small, clean & comfortable apartment (bedroom, full bath, full kitchen & living room) was perfect and much more affordable than being in a hotel close to campus."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place, when I had a mishap they were easy to contact response within 5 minutes 5 out of 5"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brenda and Doug were amazing host, they made me feel welcomed and I can say I didn’t feel like a guest I felt like family 🙏🏽 I pray God’s blessings on them and I look to be returning again in the future."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Went for the weekend for bike riding along the pine creek trail. The Airbnb was only a few miles aaway from “ the hub” of lock haven but so quiet.very close to a few very good breakfast places and the town was having an annual weeekend music festival which brought liveliness to Main Street .we love the surrounding area and found the space comfortable,quiet,clean and welcoming,we even saw a mama deer and her 2 fawns getting drinks at the pond behind the apartment, we are planning on making this an annual weekend and hope to come back to Brenda’s. Thanks for opening your home to visitors"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was very comfortable! The apartment had a very cozy vibe, all the sheets were clean & comfortable. The bathroom was also extremely clean. The location is great because it’s less than 8 minutes to a grocery store & has many local restaurants nearby."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great location for me to stay at to prepare for a half-triathlon at Penn State, about a 15-20 minute drive away.

I recommend this stay as a quiet, relaxing place to spend your weekend for any activities."

Saw a few deer, many turkeys in the area. Can only imagine the area during Fall foliage. Can't wait for our next trip back to Bear Pen."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love this place so much! We visit the area many times each year. This was our second stay at the Bear Pen and we’ll never stay anywhere else in the Pennsylvania Wilds again. Absolute comfort and peace at a home in the mountains away from home!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful space to stay—super comfortable, gorgeous mountain top views, delightful warm and welcoming host. We have been coming to this part of PA for ultra running, cycling, hiking, and more for over 5 years and can’t believe we only just found this heavenly spot. Have already booked again for our next visit and we only checked out today!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great weekend. Beautiful place

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Patti is a wonderful host. Easy to communicate with and very friendly. Her place is spotless and extremely relaxing. Just right for some quiet time in nature!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience. Great communication. Easy check in easy check out. All the amenities you might need in the kitchen. Beautiful views. Really a wonderful little gem in the middle of nature.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is clean and well stocked for two people. The pictures don’t do it justice!! Patti is a wonderful hostess.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,To anyone who is interested in renting this property for any reason I highly suggest that you do the price is very reasonable. Our host Patti was so very friendly informative and helpful that we highly recommend that you consider your stay there.We can't say enough good things about our experience we hope to return again next year.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Patti is a wonderful Host, the place and accomodations are top notch. Turkeys came in many mornings and beautiful deer both bucks and does came in every evening. It was a great get away not too far from town (about 8 mins) and many times when driving into or back from town we'd see additional deer not far from the road. The view is sweet. I bet when the leaves change and when it snows or snow is on the ground it is an even more awesome view. It is everything as advertised. Patti is very gracious and helpful.
I wholeheartedly recommend the Bear Pen Guest House especially for anyone wanting to be out of town but not too far and looking for just the right place. If I get back in the area it will, without question, be my choice location to be. You won't be disappointed!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time at the Bear Pen Guest House, Patti is an amazing host and made sure that even the small details were taken care of. We wish to return soon and will spread the word to our friends and family.
The location itself is on a serene mountaintop and one has a view of the valley from a point on the property, the night sky is amazing on a clear night and the dwelling itself is cozy with access to decent internet ( clocked approx 12 MBps download :) ) that is if you need it! Everything was spotlessly clean and we tried to leave it that way :)
Storm and Thunder are two horses and Romeo is a 4 month (at the time of writing) puppy, he is still in his training phase but so adorable and loving!
Do visit Hyner View State Park(not to be confused with Hyner State Park) for some epic views and Bald Eagle State Park for some fun time at the beach. Stella A's has some lovely dining options and we were treated to live music on a Saturday night.
I highly recommend the place if you are looking for some quiet nature time in a picturesque setting!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is wonderful ! Patti is an exceptional host :)
The property is incredibly special, and the guest house is perfectly clean and comfortable!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,very comfy and a quiet peaceful place would reccomend
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We may have had a rough start due to communication gaps (a day before the trip) but things were sorted out the same day. And once we reached there, we quickly fell in love with the place. Patti is an amazing host! It truly felt like a vacation home atop a quiet mountain with scenic view and farm animals like horses. My family felt well taken care of because the home was very clean, organized and had warm touches with great amenities overall. There were sweet and savory snacks, all kitchen essentials, personal toiletries, area maps and guides, magazines, games, TV - perfectly well stocked for a cottage. Plus point is the location as it is just 10mins away from all the stores and between 15 to 40 mins of drive time, there are several wonderful state parks to explore."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Whatever is described about this property and whatever has been written in reviews cannot truly state how beautiful and comfortable it is. If you want to be in the mountains but close to conveniences and so many out of doors things to do, this is the place. But beyond the physical property offerings the owners are even better. They respond to every need quickly and are simply fantastic people. My wife and I will definitely return as frequently as possible."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice quiet location. Away from it all. Very nice firepit with wood provided, big bonus for me.
Bed was very comfy and the Hybes state Park overlook is close enough for a day trip.
Patti is very friendly and her house is not very far mother in law Suite rental."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was super easy, well maintained and the level of care and communication was phenomenal! We will definitely be back again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was the perfect weekend getaway. Patti had everything perfectly arranged for us, from snacks to a warm welcome note. We really had a great time watching movies from the collection of DVDs she has, and the views from the mountain were amazing. Also got to see some bears in the area which was amazing!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,An amazing get away! So calm and relaxing. Patti was a wonderful host and the animals are a great bonus of the time you'll be there. The space was perfect for our 1st anniversary. Highly recommend

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time. There was one minor issue that they took care of immediately. Very clean, well - stocked kitchen, nice towels. Nice hiking on the grounds. Would definitely go back."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very pretty property, you will see animals around for sure! Loved that aspect"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti was a wonderful hostess. She checked in on us a few times during our stay and even asked if we needed food. She left a small gift for my son which put a huge smile on his face. The guest house was beautiful, peaceful and comfortable. I’m looking forward to more trips to Patti’s in the near future."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Bear Pen Guest House was exactly as advertised, tucked away on a beautiful mountain overlooking the valley. It was easy to get to from cities and towns in the area, but felt secluded enough to get away from the hustle and bustle. The home itself was comfy, and perfect for laying back and reading or watching some TV. It will be my go-to spot for planning trips in the area."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous hosts. Extra amenities- even Valentines candy! Very homey and warm. This is the only place I have gone and DIDN’T feel the need to clean or disenfect! Beautiful setting. Relaxation at its best! Definitely need 4wheel in February.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, super clean, and the Host is very nice. Would come back again!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice private place to stay.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Bear Pen Guest house, and everything exceeded our expectations, from the beautiful forests and trails, stunning views, warm, cozy, clean apartment, and Patti and Duane's warm hospitality. We had a memorable time, and this is truly a special place that allowed us to rest and recharge in a beautiful wooded retreat. The guest accommodations were immaculate and very comfortable, and the hosts were helpful and friendly. Patti obviously pays attention to details, and we appreciated the treats, and coffee she provided. We would highly recommend this place to anyone. I can imagine this place is beautiful in all seasons, Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. We visited in winter and we were treated to a coating of snow, but I can only imagine how beautiful this place is in Fall with the leaves changing, and in spring when the Mountain Laurel is blooming. One last comment, if visiting in winter it is best to have a 4 wheel drive vehicle as the climb up the mountain, and then the lane to the guest house can be a challenge if it snows or is icey."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place !! It’s so cozy and relaxing . The view is spectacular! We definitely are coming back . Bless the homeowner for letting us stay and experiencing the wonderful place :) and they are so kind
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very good
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The Bear Pen is a gorgeous place up in the woods. If you want a peaceful, beautiful get-away in charming central PA, you can't beat this house. It is somewhat remote, but the drive into town isn't long. The apartment had everything we needed and was very clean. We are already looking forward to our next stay."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Bear Pen was absolutely lovely. Quiet, beautiful scenery and wildlife abundant! Patti provides a wonderful stay. Everything you could need is there and she went out of her way to give us a personalized experience! We had a busy weekend of our stay and would love to go back to be able to truly enjoy all that the place has to offer."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Bear Pen Guest House is a great space and destination for a weekend getaway! We returned to The Bear Pen for our second stay to attend a Penn State football game (about a 50 minute drive) and plan to return again in the future! Patti was very accommodating, even warming up the space before we arrived! The space has all your basic needs and great views!!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place if you want to get away. Love the long drive way up to the place. The place is nice and quiet.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Bear Pen Guest House is absolutely beautiful . . . a lovely, comfortable and well-maintained house . . . great location with amazing views! No detail is overlooked . . . if you forget anything (my husband forgot his tooth brush!), Patti has you covered. From a fire pit and outdoor furniture to board games and a great selection of movies . . . snacks, bottled water and a variety of coffee and tea. Amazing bed(s) and linens (we slept like babies!), a washer and dryer, extra blankets and all the information you need to explore and experience everything the area has to offer . . . do a lot, or do nothing but relax. Clean, secure and so inviting . . . you'll feel ""at home"" right away. Every detail is attended to . . . this is one of the very best Air Bnb experiences we've ever had . . . we're already making plana to return! A truly outstanding and enjoyable stay."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Back for our 2nd visit and it was just as wonderful as the 1st! We had a great time, and Patti is always so thoughtful 😊"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Patti’s place was super clean! Very nice people with an amazing place on the mountain! Very peaceful and great views.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To Patti and Family,
We wish to profusely thank you all for the peaceful and beautiful respite at the Bear Pen on the mountain top. It was quickly apparent during our first stroll across the scenic view that we had made the right pick for a nature space to enjoy. Without a doubt, the Bear Pen experience was like having a slice of heaven served up for our relaxation and enjoyment. To those who might wonder, the pictures on the website are an understatement of the surrounding nature; the soaring birds, the whinnying of the horses throughout the days and nights, the bear peaking over the hilltop, walks through the woods and around the pasture trail ~ nature at its best. I truly loved my ability to sit down and talk turkey with my feathered friends on our last day. The turkeys taught me how to do the turkey trot as well as scratch the leaves for acorns. I think it was my scratching the leaves with them that made them want to sit, gab and gobble close by. We also treasured our many conversations with the entire family. Will always recall Riley handing us our arrival gifts. Mine was a small card that simply said “Younique.” Yes, the Bear Pen was a wonderful and “Younique” experience from beginning to end. Hope to return someday for more grand views, sweet smells of nature, and to once again interchange pleasant thoughts with our new furry, feathery and human friends.
Ramsey and Paula"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great place! It was just as described...comfortable and very clean. Would definitely recommend and come back if we are in the area again.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti and her family were great hosts. They made us feel very welcomed, both with their hospitality and allowing us to walk and explore their property (which is beautiful).
The Airbnb itself looked exactly like the photos, and was very clean. It’s a fantastic getaway location, as it’s surrounded by nature far from other houses.
I’d highly suggest this Airbnb. I know that we’d like to stay again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti's place was everything as described and more. The view from the mountaintop is exquisite, the apartment spacious, comfortable and very well-equipped. It was a tribute to the beauty of the area where she lives. We had a couple of great days biking parts of the Pine Gorge Trail and a relaxing and inviting place to come back to afterward. Communications with Patti were super-smooth. We would stay there again without hesitation and highly recommend it to anyone keen on visiting the area."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. We love the place and the views are spectacular! Patti is very responsive. We'll be back!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic place. We booked Patti's spot somewhat short-notice, and we are so glad we did! The surroundings are beautiful and peaceful, and we enjoyed our short weekend at the Bear Pen. Patti is an exceptional host - lots of thoughtful touches, including leaving us snacks and a blueberry pie upon arrival (yum!). Would recommend this spot highly to anyone looking for a quiet getaway - I know we hope to return!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, very friendly people, amazing view of stars at night."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend the bear pen. The accommodations are on the top of a beautiful mountain and are so comfortable and peaceful. We look forward to visiting again.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our first trip since COVID, as my husband is immunocompromised. Patti's house is extremely clean and we felt very safe. I cannot applaud her efforts to make us feel safe and welcome. She provided a cute honeymoon cake, since we got married in August and haven't been away (re: Covid). There were snacks and water for us, a definite for hikes.
Her home had many instructions and pamphlets available. There is central AC, 2 comfortable beds, and a comfy living space. The price is right for the place.
I can't begin to describe how beautiful this place truly is. The pictures do not do it justice. The outdoors are calming and soothing, mainly under tree cover. There is a bench that rests near the valley, where we (my husband and I) spent a bit of time just sitting and talking. There are so many hiking trails in the area, and some great vistas.
I am so happy we stumbled across this place. Only a short 3.5 hour drive from our home, but feels like a world away from the constant moving. I haven't been this relaxed in a long time. Restaurants nearby (~15 mins) offered both indoor and outdoor seating. The area also has small cafes, a grocery store, and pharmacy in case you forget something.
My only complaint, we had a short stay! I wish we could have stayed longer.
Cannot thank you enough for your hospitality. :) We will be back soon."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was fantastic and very cozy! Was ready to go and warmed up for us before we arrived. Patti even left us Memorial Day cookies as a surprise which was nice when we walked in! They had everything we needed in the kitchen and bathroom. Close to town and local hiking trails. Would definitely stay again.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti, our host was very welcoming and hospitable. The guest house is definitely a must stay. It is surrounded by acres of woodland and greenery. The view from the hill is impressive. The house is clean and spacious; perfect place to rest after a long day of hacking. There’s no traffic noise, all you can hear is the wind and birds chirping. It’s the perfect get away."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Quiet secluded location on mountain
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was great for us. It had everything that we wanted. it is well described. It sits on the top of the hill and has a great view down into the valley.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I recommended 100% Patti’s place. Patti is an increíble host. We will be back soon.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Nice place to get away from it all! Great view outside, and super clean inside! Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Instructions for check-in and check-out were very clear. The house was clean and had plenty of supplies. We were very happy with everything and would stay here again.
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great stay here at the lodge! My group had originally planned on hiking in the area, but we were rained out- luckily, there were lots of games to play in the BnB. It was spacious, clean, well-stocked, peaceful, and a great deal overall. Bedrooms and amenities were as-described. Lots of pots and pans were available for cooking as well.
Some notes for future guests: the driveway going into the address is a stone driveway that verges from the main road, so drive carefully! The lockbox is behind the main door next to the driveway. And finally, be careful climbing the stairs inside the lodge- they are beautiful wooden steps but they are slightly uneven and a little slippery.
Overall, I would highly recommend a stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The house and property were beautiful. We loved the outdoor area and all it had to offer from the firepit to all the seating options.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great, historic house. Nice location for visiting students at LHU. Comfortable beds and very clean. Outdoor space is fantastic. Would definitely stay here again!"

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town to celebrate my daughter’s graduation from Penn State and desired a location outside of College State with a walkable town. This place exceeded our expectations. The home is as described and it’s on a lot next to the water and park. We enjoyed sitting out on the porch listening to the birds and seeing an occasional fish in the pond. The town, Lake Haven, is a half mile away from restaurants. One evening we did a bar hop which enabled us to visit five bars. Everyone was super friendly and hospitable. Our favorite was Broken Axe Brew House. See Yelp for my review. I’ll conclude by thanking Angela for her hospitality and communication throughout our stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful location on the river, just across the short walk from Lock Haven. Easy access to the trail or the town.
House had a ton of great amenities and was very clean. Would definitely stay here again!"

Our family found everything we needed to prepare meals. Unfortunately the weather did not cooperate but next time we will definitely make use of the fire pit and grill.
Thank you Angela for sharing your little piece of paradise and for all the special touches that made this a perfect weekend!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time to stay at Angela and Chris's home. It has been a great location for our family to visit our hometown of Lock Haven and do the things that all those returning home do including OIP subs, Ice Shack Italian ice, Curt's smoking ribs beef brisket sandwiches, Nan's donuts, and a stop at Sheetz before heading out of town. Lock Haven is always a peaceful stopping place and this home on the river does not disappoint."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful historic house in lovely setting. Enjoyed our stay and plan to visit again. Angela was very responsive and helpful. House was everything we hoped for - great for a family weekend away.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"As described - a beautiful and unique property that was a pleasure to visit. Close to outdoor activities (e.g., biking Pine Creek Rail Trail, hiking state forests, paddling the West Branch) with all the amenities of Lock Haven. The property has river access, but we carried kayaks to the public launch next door, which has a boat ramp and a launch for canoes/kayaks. It is an easy walk/jog/bike across the bridge into the City, where there is a 2+ mile trail along the levee (no bikes allowed). On a rainy evening we went into town for dinner and a movie. Bike shops, grocery stores, etc. all close by. The house has plenty of parking and room to store bikes and kayaks. The basement has extra storage. The porch is a great spot for breakfast or just sitting next to the lock/pond. Patio would be great location for a bigger groups. AC worked well during hot days. Our dog enjoyed the property, including the crate in the kitchen, but he couldn't be off leash due to proximity to the road."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place has a beautiful view from each window but sitting outside on the back porch or lawn area is where it is at! We were blessed with wonderful weather to enjoy the sounds of nature and a brief storm to watch blow over the river front. Tiny little frogs on the lily pads were so sweet and added to the already beautiful flowers surrounding the pond. This is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy each others company. This place was very clean well decorated.
One bathroom as stated but looks like they are adding more to the house down in the basement. It does have a little off odor when walking in but nothing horrible and I am the only one of 4 that noticed. Dishwasher did not work and Angela was happy to have someone look at it to fix it. There are two rooms with ac units in windows upstairs leaving one room hot if door is closed.
Overall, We would definitely stay here again and love to stay in different seasons in the future. Well done."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful home in a really charming little town! Angela was communicative and responsive, and there were so many thoughtful touches in the home. They are obviously putting a lot of love and care into this historic house, and it was a sweet weekend retreat."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Angela was a terrific host and always there to offer restaurant references and things to do
House is newly renovated!!
Loved exploring the area"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Couldn’t have asked for a better host or a nicer place to stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place - private - clean and easy to take dog outside. Wood floors throughout house.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved this Lock Haven home. The view of the river, pond, and lock is so special, the outdoor landscaping and entertaining areas are amazing, and the home itself was beautiful. Such a unique and special place — highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a special place - the grounds are beautiful and the river view, relaxing."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a wonderful place to stay. The outside surroundings were beautiful. The home was so close to everything. We liked it so much that we have already booked another stay. Angela was very responsive and quick to answer all of my questions. We were welcomed with a variety of snacks and waters when we first arrived. The rocking chairs on the porch were our favorite hang out spot with a beautiful view of the Susquehanna River. We are from Lock Haven and feels like it is more beautiful than we remember.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Gosh. There is so much to stay about our stay, all wonderful. This house is located RIGHT on the river and the views are spectacular. The porch has several rocking chairs to sit outside and enjoy your coffee in the morning and drinks in the evening! There is a side area with a firepit to enjoy and we did! We had smores, mountain pies and hot dogs. The weather was incredible and having this area to invite friends over to was fabulous. The house has an awesome TV and two seating areas. The kitchen is big and spacious! Wifi is a little sketchy. Angela told me she recently purchased this awesome house so I left lots of suggestions for things we could have used for the week to make the stay better. No bathroom on main floor which made it tough for my elderly mother. But this place is really amazing! I can't say enough great things about it or the owners! If it wasn't for my mom, we would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"One of the nicest Airbnbs I have ever stayed at! Airy, bright, and pristinely clean. I would stay again in a heartbeat."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great time staying at this home. Everything was easy, clean, and so beautiful and peaceful. We definitely plan to come back another time!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The amenities at this AirBnB are simply amazing. No place within 50 miles could compare to the atmosphere and features here, both indoors and out. The hosts have thought of many small details to make guests' overall stay simple and easy.
If traveling with a dog, there is ample walking space both on property and at the adjacent park. Also, having a nice access point for playing fetch in the river was appreciated."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Angela made us feel right at home! The house is clean and well taken care of. Our favorite part of the property was the outdoor space. We started our mornings with a coffee looking out to the river and spent our evenings relaxing on the porch by the fountain and the pond. We were back and forth to Lock Haven University through the weekend and it is an easy one mile drive from the home. Would stay here again when in the area!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We discovered a hidden gem. This place is right on the river with a lot of out door areas to comfortably relax with old friends and enjoy a few cocktails. Lock Haven itself is a quaint town. If you have business in the area, or the ability to just get away for the weekend, don't miss the opportunity to enjoy this super spot."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We liked it so much the first time, we came back for a second stay!
Highly recommended.
Serious cooks, however, may find the kitchen range leaves something to be desired."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is fantastic!! The hosts do a great job maintaining it and are super nice!! We will definitely stay here again and hopefully soon!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had to find a place on short notice due to extended outpatient testing at nearby hospital. Angela responded quickly was compassionate and flexible to our needs. Without giving out too much information about the home and property itself until we have our future bookings set. Absolutely beautiful perfect for bridal showers, family reunions, college graduations or just relax ful weekend. Many dog friendly restaurants in town. We had our food delivered and I only left the property 1 time in 3 days. Local markets, drug stores, hospitals! This is. Secret gam☀️"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angela was a friendly, welcoming, and accommodating host, and her place was wonderful.
The location of the historic Lock House, just across the West Branch from downtown Lock Haven, makes it both beautiful and private, yet convenient and accessible.
The house was clean, well kept, easy to find and access, and had a wonderful yard with scenic views at all times of day.
We had no problem cooking simple and tasty 'two-pan' meals in the kitchen, though the range is a little dated and small. Oven works great.
Highly recommended for couples or a family!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Beautiful Lock Haven AirBnB upon the river... is beyond beautiful, magical and perfect. This was my fav AirBnB stay ever!! I look forward to visit again. The waters are so serene to sit upon the porch and meditatively enjoy the scenery..with a cup of tea. The coziness of the fireplaces and the comfy couches make for a perfect spot to connect...with whom you are enjoying the stay. Angela & Chris are magnificent hosts. This was the most perfect place for friends and myself to spend a weekend reuniting... as ol' Lock Haven University friends....Much Gratitude!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Both this property and Angela are standouts in our book as far as AirBNB’s go! From the setting and the home, to Angela’s warmth, kindness and attention to detail, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely book this location again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Angela was extremely gracious with her hospitality and very responsive. I will be back again when i’m in the area.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had the opportunity to stay at this beautifully renovated lock house with an amazing riverfront view of the water with mountains towering in background. Chris and Angela are amazing hosts providing a wonderful, relaxing retreat and have a wealth of knowledge about the local attractions and events. They made sure our check-in was effortless and our stay was memorable......even providing treats for our pets:)
I cannot say enough about the view, it is stunning! We highly enjoyed watching the ice flows drift down river. This truly is a grm of a place and if you are reading this review, just book it already, you will not regret it.
We highly recommend this stay if you are looking for a serine getaway from the hustle and still be within minutes of the city luxuries as well!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angela and Chris are wonderful, welcoming hosts. The Historic Lock House is cozy, inviting, and very peaceful. We loved having our coffee by the fireplace and enjoying an adult beverage on the back porch that overlooks the stunning Pocono Mountains and the Susquehanna River. We were able to take our dogs for a nice long walk along the banks of the river and enjoy the breathing views, even though it was chilly outside.
A bonus that we didn’t notice in the listing was the warm and cozy fireplace in the master bedroom. Nice touch!
Our dogs were very comfortable here as well and Angela made them feel very welcomed. She even made sure there was a dog crate available for us at the last minute.
Takeaway: excellent home, excellent hosts, killer views, unforgettable experience. Thanks Angela and Chris! We’ll be back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This trip went beyond expectations. Lovely decor, spacious and Mrs. Susan and her team were amazing host. We are already planning another trip.
Thank you and blessings be upon you."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Susan's place is charming and spotlessly clean, with a very well stocked kitchen and comfy bed. It is large enough for a long-term stay, too - and very convenient to the college and the river."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely worth every penny! A perfect little apartment with thoughtful touches that really made the place a home away from home. 100% would stay here again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent place! Very comfortable bed and immaculate roomy rental. Host was great to work with. We would definitely stay again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan’s place is immaculate. It had everything we needed and more!
They are lovely hosts and we will most definitely be back! ❤️"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time staying here. Love to stay here when visiting my daughters at Lock Haven University. I absolutely love the place. When I am planning a trip to LHU this is the first place I look to book. The surroundings. The cleanliness. The feel of security as well. Back porch was great and the beds were comfy. Will stay again for sure.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a fantastic place to stay. Feels like home.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little spot! Was there on a business trip at the college, would love to go back in the summer or fall as I'd guess the view of the river and surrounding would be amazing."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We found a amazing place of relaxation where we feel at home when we visit our family. We have been coming here for the last 3 yrs an hopefully many more! Thank you Susan for having us.
Greg & Liz Nc"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Oh my goodness. We love this place so much! We got to spend Thanksgiving here and it was just lovely! Susan's place was perfect to host family for my favorite Holiday! We had all the things we needed to make a lovely dinner. This B and B is so comfy and cozy with such great bedding and common areas. It is always spotless upon arrival. This is the second time I stayed here and I hope to stay here again. The back porch is so inviting for morning coffee. We even played a game out there one afternoon when this Floridian wasn't freezing! I can't say enough about the flexibility of Susan and her always responsive texts. You cannot go wrong at this location!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect! We enjoyed our stay, and the area is beautiful!
Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"In the area to do some hiking and check out a few breweries. Didn’t spend a ton of time in Lock Haven, but the house was walkable to the city and close enough to the Levee path to make it enjoyable. The room was extremely comfortable and everything felt updated and clean. Got to meet Jeff while we were there and he was delightful. Met a few people in town who spoke really well of Susan also. Altogether, loved our stay and would stay again if we find ourselves in / around Lock Haven."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Extremely clean. Wonderful location. Grounds were beautiful. Husband and I decided to take a walk. A botanist dream. Jeff and Susan had more plants than I could identify.
If canoe and kayak nationals returns to Lock Haven will likely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was very nice and updated. Susan is very sweet and nice. I would stay there again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was very nice, clean and comfortable. The location was convenient to Lock Haven University where I was working for a few day. The surroundings are beautiful. It was quite and peaceful yet close to the campus and town."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place to stay while we were in town for a family event. Susan allowed us to check in early since no one had booked the room the night before which helped us make it easier to get ready for where we needed to be. We didn’t need to meet up with her upon arrival or check out which was convenient for us. Hope to stay there again when we are in town. There was a keurig for coffee in the morning with sugar and creamer in the fridge. We didn’t use, but also dishes and pans and cereal and oatmeal in the kitchen."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for our needs. Bedroom has a bench seat (futon), large closet, and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom is appropriately sized with a generous shower. Both areas were very clean. Easy directions to the house and check-in was seamless. Highly recommend."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean Very comfortable room! We would definitely stay again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re on the fence, BOOK IT! This was our first B & B experience and it was wonderful. Susan greeted us immediately with a warm welcome and some brief instructions and we ever saw her again. The room was seriously IMMACULATE! Such a cozy, relaxing environment. Everything was wonderful, THANK YOU!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, amazing location and super clean"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Susan and Jeff are wonderful hosts, very welcoming and accommodating. their space is super comfortable, very well appointed, and peaceful. We stayed one night during a bikepacking trip, and they made space for our bikes in their garage"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great accommodations, though we had some difficulties with checkin procedures. There is no clear view of the river from the downstairs apartment, a minor disappointment. The suite and all details were great in nearly all respects. Note: However, there are three apartments in the house, and guests should be clear, upon or before arrival, about the name and location of their rooms within the building."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Susan really thinks of everything you could possibly need while staying here. The room and sitting area/kitchen are both immaculately clean and beautifully decorated, her communication with us was excellent, and I don’t think I’ll ever find anything comparable for such a reasonable price. We would definitely come back and stay here again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Super clean, host is very friendly, will be staying again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space. Great hosts. Quick responses when questions arise. Great spot close to river and town. Would revisit here if in the area again.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The River Room was perfect for the weekend for my husband and me. Excellent location and communication. The place was super clean, and the bed was comfortable. We never saw anyone else who was staying in the house. I would definitely stay again. We had a little trouble figuring out which driveway belonged to the place, so if you are looking at the house from the street, it's on the left."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! So close to campus! The coffee on the back porch was our favorite part!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very clean! 10/10 would stay again
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a wonderful stay here! Susan was very nice. It was our first time at a ABNB and my fiancé and I were nervous at first. Susan made us feel comfortable and welcome. The place was spotless, beautifully decorated, and the bed was also super comfortable. Best night of sleep I’ve had in a long time. Such a beautiful area as well. Will stay again for sure!!"
2021-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and very clean room as expected. If you enjoy a rock hard mattress, this is your place. Original spring mattress and box spring is in place in the river room. If you are used to a pillow top mattress with no springs involved, move on; this is not your place. Stayed there 3 nights and hardly slept at all. No concern was showed from the landlord when brought to her attention. I hope this helps."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely accomodations. We got in late & left early, but check-in was easy. Quiet location. 10/10 will stay again. Great home base for state forest/park adventuring."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The room was lovely, just like the picture. We enjoyed our stay a lot!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My friend and I booked the River Room for a small LHU reunion and the room was absolutely perfect for the short trip. The room and bathroom was very clean with a private entrance and a nice view of the River. Susan was so nice and helpful with anything we needed.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful place to stay! It was just what we needed!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was very clean and had everything we needed. Coffee and fresh fruit in the morning was wonderful. It was so nice to find such a wonderful place so close to the University for my daughters college tour. Will definitely stay here again!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful room with a private bath, private entrance. It is part of a house that has other lodging available and shared common areas. To be able to walk to the levy along the river was so enjoyable. It is also right by the LHU Campus. The room was super clean and the bathroom and shower was wonderful. A lite continental breakfast was available. I would definitely stay here again."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The river room is a great place to stay in the Lock Haven area. It is beautifully decorated and right next to the university campus. Susan and Jack provide wonderful hospitality with coffee and homemade baked goods for breakfast.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend Sue's Air BnB! Great location, very clean, and her hospitality is first class. I will definitely use her place again!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sparkling clean and well maintained. Easy check in and out process. Everything we needed and more
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and cute place! Looking forward to our next stay here
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I had a very pleasant stay here. I wish we could have stayed a few more days to enjoy this home and the surrounding area more. Thank you Susan for being a great host! Sincerely, Lou and Lisa"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was easy to find, close to everything, and extremely clean. It was perfect for my one night stay. The private room and private bathroom is perfect for 1-3 travelers. There is full size bed and a futon in the room and plenty of space. Private Parking behind the house. Lastly, Susan was extremely quick with responding."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay! This is the larger of the two rooms on the main floor of the B&B with a short hallway that connects to the private bath and the common area. There is direct access to the common area and also a door directly to the outside. I was confused at first because it didn't seem like the bedroom door locked, but then I realized that there is a door in that short hallway that separates the suite from the common area, and it is the one that locks. The key works for both this door and the door directly to the outside, which makes coming and going easy. The place was very nice, very clean. The bed was super comfortable. There is a futon in this room, too, for sitting or I guess for extra guests. The only thing that I didn't like was that the shower head is a bit low. I am 6 feet tall and barely fit under it. However, they do compensate for this by having a detachable shower head, so this is really not that big of a deal.
I booked this room kinda last minute, but Susan was very responsive, and we got all the details worked out. I actually met her partner, Jeff, when I checked in. He showed me around and then left us be. I didn't interact with either of them again. I'm sure if we had needed something, they would have been available, but we didn't. Personally, I like not having to talk to people, so this was perfect!
The only warning I would give is just to take note of the description: if you want the breakfast part of the B&B, the continental breakfast is an extra charge. I reread the description online in the morning before I partook because there in no indication of this in the unit itself. Overall though, I would definitely recommend this place, and I would stay here again if I am in the area."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot say enough good about this wonderful place. It was clean, peaceful and comfortable. It felt like....home! I would highly recommend this place. Susan does an amazing job!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you're looking to get away from the city and stepping into quiet nature surrounded oasis then this the place to stay. Jeff was super responsive the whole time. Very hospitable and kind. The house was just as described and pictured. Would stay here again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It was a great stay
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was clean with a great kitchen. The pool was the saving grace in an otherwise very unexciting area.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our second stay at Jeff's location made a perfect little family vacation with three boys 8 and under! It's private, quiet, relaxed, and so comfortable. The pool is a major hit. The entire process was incredibly smooth and Jeff's hospitality and generosity really made the trip a success for us!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our host Jeff was wonderful, responsive and friendly. House was great, in a awesome location. We would definitely recommend this place and would certainly return if we're ever in the area again"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jeff was great. We enjoyed our stay very much!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay! House was so clean with all the necessary essential. Jeff was always very responsive and available for questions. A beautiful home with a beautiful scenery. Would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely spot to relax and unwind. Kids enjoyed the pool and being able to walk to the river to fish and play. Jeff was very attentive and kind. Would recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time here as a jumping off point to explore North Central PA. What an amazing area if you love the outdoors! Jeff's place was great. The pool area was a blast. A perfect way to unwind after exerting yourself all day. An added bonus was a five minute walk away and you could swim right in the Susquehanna! Jeff was very helpful with a recommendation on a local canoe renting outfit. My only regret is that weren't horses in the stables when we were there! There is beautifully maintained pasture area right in the front yard. Maybe next time! Thanks Jeff!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a fantastic time in Lock Haven. The house is beautiful and true to the pictures shown. The house was clean and very spacious. The small bedroom does not have an air conditioner but there is a floor fan to use. We all had fun in the pool. It was big enough for all of us. The Susquehanna River is a short walk across the street where we fished and caught plenty of them. A boat launch is not far from the house so we were able to go boating and kayaking. We would definitely come back to Jeff's place the next time we are in the area. So much more to explore!!
Jeff was very responsive right from the beginning. He offered us helpful tips of what to do in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I really recommend Jeff’s place, it was super clean and beautiful 😍 such a peaceful place to stay & enjoy with family. Had an amazing time at the pool and Jeff was such a nice & responsive host. Thank you for the amazing experience would love to come back here again someday."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is beautiful I had a great time peaceful a fresh breath of air definitely recommend this beautiful house with pool host was very nice 😊 very helpful me and my friends would definitely book another trip !!!! Thank you so much 😊
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first family vacation with my 5 month old and it was absolutely perfect! Jeff was a great host, great communication, and quick to respond to any questions. It was a wonderful family setting and the accommodations were great! we loved watching a mama deer with her twin babies following behind her every morning & evening. The pool was great, we spent the majority of our time next to it when it wasn’t raining (the kids actually enjoyed it a few times when it was raining lol) overall, I would recommend staying at Jeff’s place, 100% :)"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall it's a nice place to go swimming either in the pool or the lake. Or just relax and listen to the sounds of nature and get a piece of mind, and if you like to go fishing it's just a walk away. It's home away from home at Jeff's house it's a nice place to be."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was absolutely beautiful, the house was very clean and such a great at home feeling"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jeff’s place was amazing had everything we needed and more! My family & kiddos
Love the pool the beautiful scenery and spacious home. We can’t for get the snack draw!! That was a major plus:)"

Everything you need is there
Snack drawers to the towels
This stay really thinks about it’s guest and making sure they are doing well"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great! Perfect location - off the beaten path, but close enough to “town” aka downtown Lock Haven. The home was very clean and the level of communication was great and very hospitable. My wife and I celebrated our 10 year anniversary with a weekend getaway to where we met in college, and we hope to make it back again with our kids - the pool will be a major selling point! This place is perfect for a couples retreat to seek calm and quiet…or for a fun young family vacation."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice large house tucked away in a beautiful setting. Pool is very nice and kept clean. Jeff is a wonderful host and always stayed in touch with whatever questions we had.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time at this lovely home close to LHU and downtown Lock Haven but nestled away a bit for a quiet and rustic retreat feel. Nice pool to relax and cool off was also a plus.
Jeff and Amy communicated well and we flexible and accommodating.
We plan to return again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, house & pool area. It’s about a 5 minute drive into town. Everything was provided including snacks."

The beds were very comfortable, the decorations were just so cute and coordinated. My kids loved the things the host left for them to play with. They also adored the dogs and were very glad that the host had some treats for them to give out.
The hosts were over the top thoughtful as we were there to attend a funeral and even gave us a paper with the obituary in it. Wonderful people, wonderful stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First, let me say Jennifer was one of the most responsive hosts we have had the pleasure of experiencing. All interactions were friendly (and quick!)

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you choose to stay here at Jennifer’s Joynt…you will not be disappointed. The entire apartment was immaculately CLEAN. By far the cleanest AirBNB we’ve stayed at.
The apartment has an old vibe to it and the interior design along with the attention to details are all beautiful. The different colored bath towels were a brilliant idea. No one in my group needed to wonder whose towel was whose.
All the amenities you think you would need are already here. I made homemade macaroni and cheese our first night here and all the necessary kitchen stuff was right here at my fingertips.

Jennifer was very kind and attentive when needed."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you Jennifer. We really enjoyed stay there.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Jennifer's place for multiple weeks - and we are so glad that we did.
It was all the things you hope an AirBnB to be - hosted by kind and caring people in a great location while being clean, comfortable, stocked with amenities, and to leave you feeling like you found a home-away-from-home.
I would like to stress not only how clean the space was, but also how friendly and helpful Jennifer and her family were during our stay. We came ""home"" from a long day to be greeted with flowers picked from the garden (left on our steps), and even found ourselves swapping some of my homemade biscuits for their homemade muffins.
Jennifer and her family have a good intuition for thoughtfully maintaining privacy, given that the unit is in a separate building on their property but shares a back yard with the family's main house.
Whether you are a solo traveler, couple, or family, I can highly recommend 'Jennifer's Joynt' and encourage you to book with confidence!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thanks for another great stay!

Lock Haven checked all the boxes. Jennifer's place was the best we could find. clean quiet and relaxing. A little walk from downtown center and close to great hiking spots. The question is not if we go back. But when!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful AirBnB, maybe the best one I've stayed at. It was my mom's and sister's first experience and they enjoyed it. My only qualm is that the single beds were too soft for me, but that's just a preference. The AC units worked well, and we worked them since we were there on the hottest days of the year so far. Recommend to anyone who is traveling near that area. We went to Pine Creek Gorge and Wellsboro, which are about 1 1/2 hrs away, but it seemed like the best AirBnB in the region, and Jennifer's Joynt turned out to be the right choice."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great space downtown Lock Haven not too far from the university. The air bnb had great accommodations.

There are several state parks and various outdoor attractions in the area.

For so many reasons but the best one as it's ethereal atmosphere was filled with art, creativity and Jennifer's talent of culture and eye for detail! (her visitor's guide for one, she covered everything!)
We were not lacking for one thing! We were so glad to find this place and we would certainly stay there again if we come back to the area. I think I would come back just to stay THERE! Thank you Jennifer for everything."

For those who may be traveling through on route I-80, it is an easy on and off. For those interested in a longer stay, there are many opportunities for outdoor activities in the State park nearby.

Our decision to change things up and get an Airbnb was certainly the right one. It was quiet & cozy, and extremely comfortable for the 3 of us visiting.

We’ll certainly be back to visit Lock Haven and hope this will be available again!"

Her place is within walking distance of several restaurants and shops and there is a parking pad she provides right next to the place. The apartment is beautifully decorated and was perfect for our family. Definitely recommend!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We didn’t get to stay long but would return in a heartbeat. This is such a well-laid-out and stylish place with everything we needed. Comfy beds, comfy pillows, great kitchen, room to dine, and a cozy living room where we unwound and relaxed after a long day of driving. Only regret is we couldn’t stay longer."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jennifer's place is wonderful! It's stylish, with fun decorations such as a light strand in the bedroom, vintage furniture and thoughtful touches such a a bluetooth speaker, laundry facilities, games, local information, a guest book and interactive map for guests. It was bigger than I needed but I did not regret booking it over a hotel room for one minute (the other air bnnb options in Lock Haven had enough bad reviews that I passed on them). It was so relaxing to hang out there and the kitchen facilities had everything you could need for cooking a full meal including oil and salt/pepper. l I had the pleasure of meeting Jennifer the next day who gave us an idea for a nice scenic drive to a park (it was a little too cold for hiking) and she even kindly allowed us to leave one car and our groceries there since no one else was checking in that day ! I would recommend this for anyone coming to the area. It's in easy walking distance to the downtown attractions as well, l and I look forward enjoying some next time once I am vaccinated. She is accepting single night bookings right now but I suspect this may change as her place becomes more popular in warmer weather! There is ample room for a small family or even a few friends/2 couples. I will definitely book here again when I come back to explore the area further! Thanks Jennifer!"

Plenty of towels, linens, kitchen items. Highly recommend!!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jennifer's is a really charming and cozy place. We only spent one night there as we were passing through, but we would recommend. I would also mention that the levee park about a block or so away is really beautiful. The only things I might mention are that there are stairs to get to the place and the queen bed is a very firm mattress. If you prefer a firm mattress for the night, you'll be in a good spot!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I randomly stumbled across this place and I’m so glad we did! It was such a unique experience! We just loved it.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Arrived at 4 pm (check in time). Entered the code for the door that was emailed to me. And we were in. Reserved parking spot steps away from the door was nice bonus. Caboose was clean, comfortable and quiet. In residential neighborhood so didn’t really see anyone aside from an occasional jogger on the trail that goes by the rail car. Good location. Out of the way but a five minute drive to almost anywhere in lock haven. Noticed on the drive back to DC that it’s about half an hour to the Penn State football stadium. Without game day traffic."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying in the caboose was a great experience. It was a comfortable atmosphere and Brady and John were very helpful with any question we had. Such a unique space and we were excited all week to tell our friends we were staying in a caboose. For two people, there was a surprising amount of space. We weren’t venturing too far outside Lock Haven, so this was the perfect location."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very special place to stay for a night. Of course it is a little smaller than other properties that you might get for that price but the experience is like no other and will make many lasting memories. Great location too. We got a little cold in the night so rug up!

I spent the evening quietly reading a book in the quiet, enjoying every minute. Wonderful place, highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Clinton County Historical Society's caboose Airbnb offers visitors a unique experience at an affordable price. The interior was clean, and roomier than expected.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent and unique stay! Loved it! Brady and John were excellent hosts and very responsive to messages.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"INCREDIBLE experience- with a bonus rail to trails walking area steps away to work off the Odd Fellas gigantic smash burger and fries ! Definitely more for 'train buffs' or fans of the rails, as the space is small, the toilet is in a quite confined/knees to the door kind of space, and the beds are of the twin size variety. That being said- it is a cozy, clean, well conditioned with air/heat source and most definitely for a couple rather than a fam of four .... It is easily accessed just outside of Lack Haven (which has its own charm). Definitely recommended for an overnight !"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a perfect stay. Everything we needed and more!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little Caboose worked perfect for our needs when we spent two nights in the area. Glad we found it.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The caboose was a great stop. Was on a road trip and just needed an overnight stay and it was the perfect spot.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have never stayed inside a caboose before, let alone a renovated vintage caboose, so this stay was very quaint and fun for me! I love the story behind the caboose and the history it has. I enjoyed my stay on a rainy evening, with old timey jazz playing in the background, while listening to the rain patter against the roof of the caboose - it was such a pleasant vibe! I also thought the area around Lock Haven was absolutely beautiful!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very unique experience to be in a restored caboose! Very cool!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Step back in time at this caboose! Although it might be cramped for a longer stay, it was the perfect overnight site for my sister and I. We also appreciated being able to walk a block up the street in the morning for a good breakfast."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had an amazing 2 nights in this fun Caboose! Everything was exactly as described. The check-in instructions were clear and worked perfectly the first time.

Channel is Kenny & Nell.
Could not recommend Brady and John’s place anymore. Well done!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can't possibly say enough about how wonderful, professional, and friendly the hosts were. Communication was fabulous. Directions were accurateand clear.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a unique place to stay, definitely somewhere I'd stay again if I had the opportunity. Check-in was easy -- there were clear instructions with pictures.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Caboose was perfect and added such a unique twist to our travels. If you are a train enthusiast, or just looking for quaint and quiet evening, this is definitely a great choice!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was my 4th stay at the caboose with my son. I gave him the choice of any vacation 1:1 with me this summer and he chose the caboose. We love swimming at Bald Eagle State Park and we always make a stop at Penn’s Cave. The fireflies at the caboose at dusk are amazing and we have contests to see who can catch (and release) the most.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My son and I were in the area to visit family, but we would have driven miles just to stay in this caboose! My son is a lifelong train aficionado so this stay was an amazing experience for us both. It was like being part of a museum exhibit. The space was very clean, quiet and private - easy to find, in a very well-kept neighborhood. Comfortable bunks, and good water pressure in the shower. Everything was safe and cozy. Another plus was the nice air conditioning system, which kept everything cool and dry.
Brady and John were great about communicating throughout!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had an amazing stay! this stay made our trip even more special, and I love that the caboose was restored but not stripped of the history. anyone who loves trains would adore this stay. can't say enough good things!"

The bike trail is right next door. We went mid-week but still saw a few people on the path. I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to return."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Looking for different lodging experience? Well this is one of your best opportunities. I highly recommend this location.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Unique stay for train enthusiasts! Not far off the highway on our roadtrip. Authentic lodging experience, truly restored. We didn’t get to spend much time while passing through, but also right by a train station breakfast spot for the morn. Super easy check-in and parking right out front. Would definitely recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very unique and enjoyable stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Many places are called ""unique,"" but this Caboose is the real deal! For Railfans, or anyone interested in history, few available places can beat an authentic caboose from 1941! This caboose has not been gutted inside and rebuilt to resemble and exude all the charm of a 1980's travel trailer. They lovingly restored it inside and out, retaining not just the ambiance, but the actual walls, windows, doors, floor, hardware, cabinets, cupola and more. You are actually living and sleeping in a 1941 caboose, lacking only the shakes, rattles, and clackety-clack of steel wheels on steel rails. Hidden amenities include shower, microwave, coffeemaker, and much more.
The caboose resides in a quiet neighborhood, adjacent to a beautifully restored railroad station that houses an active model railroad club. See the club and their HO model railroad in action on most Tuesday nights.
A round Information Center beside the caboose was built to the specs of a railroad ""water tower.""
We loved this caboose!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a wonderful stay!!!!! The train is so fun and cozy, and really is in a great location. The town is cute and Main Street Grill had delicious food.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The caboose is super cool. Easy to find, park, and get into. We arrived late and didn’t have to bother anyone! Everything was clean, the wifi worked great, and we watched the new David Attenborough doc on Netflix before sleeping peacefully for many hours."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After a hot and dusty day biking the Pine Creek Trail, all I wanted was a clean place with a hot shower, nearby restaurants and a relaxing place to enjoy a glass of wine (or 2). At the caboose, I got all this AND (being a train enthusiast) greatly enjoyed just being in this wonderfully restored vintage railroad gem. There's plenty of room and a nice gazebo nearby. This may not be for everyone, but for those of us who appreciate a clean, comfortable and memorable experience, it's perfect. I shall be be back! 2 Tips: Make sure your GPS is looking for Logan Ave., and not Logan Street (unless you want to go to the supermarket). Also, I had no problem bringing my bike inside —the entrance is plenty wide."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fun and unique experience! The caboose is super cute! I loved that there was also some history about the Pennsylvania railroad included.
The caboose has air conditioning/heat, a shower and bathroom with running water and an additional sink in the kitchenette. The location has a number of hiking trails and wineries nearby and is convenient for day trips all over Pennsylvania. Brady and John were great hosts!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place. Glad we stayed there. We were in town visiting relatives and decided to do something different for our stay. Why not stay in a caboose. It was clean and well appointed. Many members of the family knew of the caboose and now they know someone who stayed there. Hope this leads to more stays for our host. If we’re in the area again and need outside lodging, this will be high on the list."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome and unique place to stay. Loved the caboose as home!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Please do not second guess staying here! It is unique, comfortable, clean, cozy, and beautiful. My son and I stayed overnight in the caboose. My son is 13 and knows almost everything there is to know about trains. He was thoroughly impressed! The caboose is on the edge of a quiet neighborhood. We are nature lovers, so being very close to a trail was perfect. The weather during our stay wasn't too great, but we made the best of it and decided to hunker down and just enjoy the caboose. It was well stocked with all of the necessities. It's so special and we will definitely stay again. Hopefully next time we can stay a little longer to explore the area. Thank you SO much for hosting us."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time at the caboose… Last year, I just stopped over one night on a drive to the Midwest, and vowed that I would come back and just enjoy the caboose itself! My sister and I came to just hang out and do a little hiking. It’s such a cute cozy place!
The caboose was not made for cold weather living, so Brady and John were really thoughtful to give us supplemental heat (in addition to the mini split heater), and made sure we had extra blankets. We had a wonderful time!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Two things lend great charm to this property. The first is the Bald Eagle Trail. An added treat to the trail is a train spotting overlook. The other charm is the caboose itself. Thankfully it was left fairly intact as a working railroad car and we liked the railroading theme.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay! Communication with our hosts was ""top notch"" as we prepared for our historic adventure. The caboose was very clean, in a quiet location and what fun to travel back in time with vintage interior touches as well as historic reading material to better understand the many miles our caboose had traveled! From perusing the guest book we were not the only ones that would highly recommend this getaway! This was without a doubt the little train that could !!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay last week very much. It was relaxing and a cool town. A lot of little restaurants around. Especially enjoyed the breakfast up the street. When we checked in the door to the train station was open and we got a great tour of the building and it’s history. We especially liked the hour personal tour of the model train platforms.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a great stay! Everything was exactly as described, check in was easy, and the space was cute and clean. I've never stayed in a ""novelty"" place like that before and my friend and I could not get over the fact we were sleeping in a real train caboose. I definitely recommend it if you're looking for a fun, easy stay; it has spoiled me for regular hotels and airbnbs, and I would love to someday come back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay in the Caboose tremendously!! Ralph is a huge train lover and appreciated how the inside of the caboose was preserved!! A trip back in time!! It was a nice quiet weekend getaway. Every true train lover should do this!!!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great experience to sleep in an old caboose. the caboose is quiet and feels a little isolated (in a good way!) although there is people just around the corner and also the city is only a few minutes by car away. can only recommend!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed at the caboose while attending the LLWS. It was an easy drive to Williamsport and especially liked the peace and quiet upon returning at the end of the day. A nice getaway in a nice neighborhood with perfect hosts who have thought out everything about what guests could possibly need. And living briefly in a pice of history was a bonus!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay at the caboose was wonderful. My 8 year old son was super surprised and delighted to stay in the caboose. It was nice a cool when we arrived and everything was very clean! Main Street Grill was also delicious. And as a localTexan it was fun to eat at the Texas Restaurant.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cute little caboose was fun and comfortable. The shower was great, cold air conditioning, and the beds were wonderful.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a happy accidental drive-through on our way home from South Dakota to NYC. Well worth the 15 min detour off 80. Such a unique experience. Wish we had more time to explore the grounds. The charming town of Loch Haven is just a short 4 min drive away and worth a visit.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to come to this area for any reason, you have to stay here. It is clean, quiet, in a nice neighborhood and who doesn’t want to say they stayed in a train car? We had a wonderful time hiking in the area and enjoying great food. It was definitely a relaxing and memorable weekend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing stay! A memorable getaway. The caboose is beautiful and very peaceful.If you have the chance to visit this place you won’t be disappointed. We got to roam around the downtown area. Train station restaurant - pancake was big!
John and Brady, Thank you for sharing this place!"

It was very well maintained & stocked with amenities, more spacious than what we expected, loved the historical info. & nearby hiking trails & nature park, which was just a short drive away. Was disappointed to find the Train Station Restaurant closed on Tues. am, but hopefully it will be open during our next stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would recommend the Caboose to anyone looking for a fun and unique lodging experience. Brady and John have made it a very sweet place to relax and unwind.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is one of the best little getaways that you can find on Airbnb. Brady and John are great stewards for this 1941 classic railroad caboose that is comfy and modernized at the same time. My younger son and I have been going here for a few years now, and we always look forward to going here to spend a weekend together. I cannot recommend this caboose enough as a fun and unique place to stay in the Lock Haven area. Thank You Brady & John for making this a special place for us to go."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the best part of our road trip! My ten-year-old son was over the moon at how authentic it looked inside.

This is also an excellent spot for a train lover!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After a long day of traveling staying at the caboose was well deserved! It’s a prime location, set back from traffic, no noise, really a peaceful spot! The email I received with the arrival instructions were clear and we had absolutely no problem getting into the caboose!
Extremely clean, everything you need for a lovely stay! The beds are comfortable and they provide you with wash towels, the showering necessities, pillows, blankets! The water pressure in the shower….FANTASTIC!
We arrived probably around 6pm and unfortunately it was raining or else we would have gone exploring but from other guests reviews, it looks like a great walking/hiking area! Instead, we ordered a hot delicious pizza from “The original Italian pizza and restaurant” on E. Main Street. Went back to the caboose, watched a few movies on Netflix that Brady and John so graciously provide and the promptly went to bed.
Waking up was so nice, with the morning peaking through the blinds!
I HIGHLY recommend staying at the caboose, I REALLY DO! I look forward to returning with friends and family in the future!
THANK YOU Brady and John for being such wonderful hosts! A million stars ⭐️ from us!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a fun little place! I was worried about ceiling height and bed length as my partner is 6 ft 6in but there was plenty of room. Bring your bike for the bald eagle valley trail!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our one night stay in the caboose! For a smallish place, it had everything we needed, including a hair dryer. The hosts are very communicative prior to arrival so you know exactly how everything works and how to get in. There were lots of brochures inside the caboose on nearby attractions, which was helpful. Beds were very comfy. And if you are into geocaching, you can walk outside the caboose door and get started on your search for a mystery cache.
If you like unique experiences, staying in the caboose is for you!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love unique stays and this was definitely one for the books! We loved the caboose, and wish we had been able to stay for more than just one night. We booked it as a stop over on a drive through town and it exceeded our expectations. We went for a walk on the trail right next to the caboose when we got in which was lovely. The caboose has everything we needed for our stay and was cozy! Highly recommend staying if you are in the area, or if you like to travel for unique accommodations!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Unique and fun!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved Brady and John’s renovated 1941 Caboose! I’m a history professor and was traveling with my nine-year old daughter and we both thought the space was delightful and hope to stay there again.
We were on our way from Ohio to the east coast on I-80 and it was the perfect place to rest up from the road. Not far from the freeway in terms of convenience but a universe all its own. It was very nicely outfitted, delightful in its decor, and a unique and fun listing that we will always remember. Highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The caboose was lovely. There is a playground nearby. We had a great time

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Totally authentic caboose modernized with all you’d need for a stay
Tons of history in and around Lock Haven area
We simply lucked out finding this spot as it was the right driving distance between travel spots
My wife and I will definitely be back for a lengthier visit
The railroads, floods, locks, pine harvests off the mountain sides and down the river - a serious amount of history around the place
Happy to have found it"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Love this caboose bnb! I stay every time I come through the area. The new amenities (keyless entry, mini split, & linens) are GREAT."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this unique experience. My son was excited to stay on a real train but even happier to find it had Wi-Fi.
We spent the day on the beach at Bald Eagle State park and found all the amenities we needed to rest and recover from our sunburn. We appreciated having air conditioning, hot showers, a refrigerator and microwave. The beds are firm but comfortable, we slept well."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Totally unique! Would absolutely recommend this stay to anyone looking for a one of a kind experience!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Charming and unique stay
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Caboose was exactly as advertised. I am not a train enthusiast and still loved the wacky, fun experience of an overnight in a real caboose and enjoyed learning train history via the writings and photos provided. Lock Haven is a lovely town with lots to do-we rented bikes from Pine Creek Outfitters and had the most glorious bike ride along the creek enjoying the peek autumn colors, hiked to an overlook along the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania autumn, toured the Piper Aviation Museum and went shopping at the original Woolrich store. We ate dinner at Stella's and Main Street Bar and Grille, both were very good and brought food for breakfast to eat in the caboose. An added feature of the caboose is a lovely rails to trails walk just steps from the caboose's door (obviously). Overall quite a fun experience for a one or two night stay for two people. A warning to the faint of heart, the cabin is not luxurious, nor should it be, that would ruin the experience."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was great! Super unique and interesting while also being comfortable and cozy. I was in the area to hike Pine Creek Gorge and this was a bit of a trek from there but it was so worth it. Brady and John were really helpful/responsive and I'd highly recommend to anyone interested in history and looking for a unique place to stay.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute place! It's everything you expect it to be, it's very unique, and as comfortable as you need it to be. Hosts were very responsive, and a great location for hiking and an outing in town."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great Airbnb experience! John and Brady have done a fantastic job with making this caboose a unique part of any trip!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great experience. Everything was clean and comfortable. The Caboose is still filled with original features which makes this so interesting. Check-in was a breeze. There are lots of interesting shops in Lock Haven. There are some small surrounding towns with great things to see. Definitely a must do!!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hosts, Brady & John were quick to reply to each message from start to finish. The unique caboose stay was booked for our 3 year old grandson who loves trains. He didn’t want to leave. It’s extremely close to the walking trail (bring bug spray - mosquitos were enjoying us way too much, lol) - The accommodations inside were great! It’s a 5-10 min drive to the Airplane museum (although we weren’t fortunate to be in the area for it to be open at the time). The hosts have a letter from another previous guest in the binder - which was a hoot to read - made us chuckle. Also, it was interesting to read the guest book to see how far ppl have traveled and stayed in the caboose. (For various reasons). Enjoyed seeing the photos of history and the reading - tastefully decorated - overall definitely an experience - one to remember! Thank you!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fun unique stay! Very clean, no perfume cover up . Easy check in. The only thing to make note of is the bathroom, being that their working with very little room, you can’t really use the facilities and close the bathroom door.
But the inside is kept very close to how it looked when in service! We enjoyed the extra train reading materials.
Beds are very firm and clean."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super clean & great location for Penn’s Cave & PA Grand Canyon if you don’t mind a little (beautiful) drive!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a unique experience! This adorable place is better in person than the pictures suggest. Cute cozy and comfortable. We loved our stay here!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great place to stay! My husband is a train buff and he was absolutely thrilled with the authenticity of the caboose. Crystal clean and everything you needed.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was very cool with all the amenities you need and very quiet.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was the perfect stay at the caboose! It was a chilly night in October, but with the right pajamas we were just fine. Very short drive to main street."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fun place to stay!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is such a cool space at a great value. It might seem small in the photos but the amenities are plentiful and the hosts did a great job at providing what you need for a few nights away.
The beds were VERY comfortable and the area is quiet. I slept harder than I’ve slept in a long time. Hot water in the shower, great facilities, and a cool experience to stay in a piece of history. The hosts did a great job at providing historical context to the caboose and there is even a little visitor’s center next door. WiFi, TV/Roku, towels, toiletries, coffee were all provided. I walked in and settled down right away.
My only regret is not bringing my bike to ride around the town - but that’s on me :) If you’re a cyclist - bring your bike with you.
Would recommend to all my family and friends and hope to have an excuse to go back some day."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very responsive host.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great property. Stay in a piece of history. Beautiful area as well.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Whether you’re a rail fan or not you should stay here. It’s a great adventure, the rail trail gives you about 7 miles of possible hiking and on Tuesdays you can visit the model railroad in the station. It’s spotless and has plenty of hot water for the showers."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a delightful experience! Everything was tidy and neat. And the Caboose is actually much roomier inside than you’d expect! The water pressure was impressive in the shower. Brady and John have a provided a neat little getaway here. They really did a super job of renovating this place while keeping the heart of the original. Everything you might need is here for a great stay. Even had a nice walk on the rail trail in the evening. I look forward to coming back in the future.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved the caboose! Unfortunately, I was just there for overnight, on my drive from NYC to Michigan. I figured why not have some fun, and to me, staying in a caboose seemed like such a great time... The accommodations are basic, but pretty luxurious, for a caboose! I’m hoping to come sometime when I have a few days to stay there, and then go hiking."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Unique Airbnb! Located in a quiet neighborhood. Cozy and clean.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The caboose is awesome! Whether or not you’re a train buff, it’s a great piece of history, like staying in a time capsule except with all the modern amenities built in in a way that doesn’t break up the historic charm. WiFi, tv, toilet and shower, microwave, fridge, etc etc. and super clean. The railroad employees who slept on the caboose originally never had it this good. If you’re in the area and looking for a place to stay, be sure to take a “ride” on the Pennsylvania RR!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very cool experience and really clean! we felt like we were transported to the past. The space is well stocked with what you need. John and Brady were quick with communication and answered our questions swiftly. Would definitely make it back sometime!
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for hosting us!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a very nice concept bnb. Brady and John informed us about the things to do around the county in detail. Highly recommended for the people looking for a bnb experience in a train compartment.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic and unique stay. My daughter and I had a wonderful time staying here while on our way through the area. The no-contact process during covid was great, the a/c was cold, showers were hot, and the beds cozy. We’ll definitely be back!!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really cool place to stay!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,2nd Caboose we have stayed in through AirBnB and it did not disappoint. We throughly enjoyed our stay. Cool little touches and nice to have a TV with Netflix at the end of the night to watch and wind down. The one bed can squeeze two people in comfortably to watch the TV together too which was nice. My husband and I enjoyed the separate beds at night- able to stretch out and snooze away! Nice quiet neighborhood. Cool history all over the place. Thanks again! :)
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend staying in the caboose. My son and I really enjoyed sleeping in a bit of history. Also, the town of Lock Haven is not far away and is very charming. John and Brady have thought of everything when it comes to amenities and the guide book is full of useful information on things to do and places to eat. We found the space to be extemely clean and accurate to the pictures in the listing."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My son and I stayed here for a stopover on a long drive. It was so fun! All the kitchen supplies we needed to mix up a simple dinner (including can opener!) We loved the beds. They were very firm. It was hot in the caboose, despite the thermostat set at 64. We could feel cold air blowing out of the unit, though, and a box fan was provided so we were comfortable. It cooled off quickly with the door just cracked after sundown. Good water pressure, plenty of hot water. Absolutely everything we needed for our stay!
We also loved all the history decorating the walls. We walked the trail right beside the caboose, and checked out the really cool round building with more local railroad history. The mountains are breathtaking. Such a beautiful view all around.
Probably my favorite part was all the original pieces. The light fixtures were neat. So cool to open a metal locker to find the “cooking” area. My son loved it and now plans to live in a train car for his first place. :)
Many thanks to our hosts. It was a wonderful stay we have already told many friends about."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice stay. It was decorated very nice with old vintage photos. Definitely a unique stay, now I can tell my friends that I’ve slept on a train!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were pleasantly surprised at how the airb&b looked! The pictures were accurate but did not do the place justice at all!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,excellent place to stay
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My dog and I stopped over for one night on our way to Philadelphia from Toronto. It was the perfect spot! Easy to get in right off the highway. Extremely clean, well stocked and I appreciate all the little details Matthew put into the place. Also a really nice area to walk around with the dog.
Very quiet and bed was quite comfortable. Also nice to watch tv from the bed 😃"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Matthias hosts a wonderful and homey place with a very accurate listing. He was already welcoming, well before the start of the trip, and was graciously accommodating (providing clear instructions and leaving lights on for us) when I informed him of our late arrival. He was very prompt in his responses. The place was very clean and cozy. We will be back!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter attends Lock Haven and my fiance and I came up for the weekend. Avis was perfectly located, about 10 to 15 minutes away from the University.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a very nice and comfortable place. The air is fresh, there are hiking trails not too far away, and the neighborhood is friendly. For me, it was a good place to get away for a bit. The apartment itself is spacious and nice, and very well put together, with a kitchen (includes fridge, microwave, cookingware, stove, plates, etc., pretty much everything you'd need out of a kitchen), bathroom, little living area and dining area, and bedroom with a workspace and TV. The bed is very comfortable, and overall, everything was great.
For parking, you can park your car right in front of the apartment door, which is convenient. There's a small gravel driveway you can park your car down.
Matt is very friendly, and gave clear instructions for how to get in.
I had a dog and a cat with me, and they both were also able to live well in the space. Pet-friendly space, set up well for it.
Overall, great for the value."

Our host anticipated our every need, from a well equipped kitchen, plenty of hangers in the closet, to extra trash bags and toilet tissue. We appreciated the tip about Mackeyville Greenhouse and Market -- we stocked up on homemade bread and Whoopi Pies! There are several covered bridges in this lovely area of Pennsylvania. The apartment itself had plenty of space for the two of us. We watched a movie before bed each night."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great basement apartment that was exactly what I needed for the extended weekend. Clean, great decor, and far enough from the major roads in the area to be quiet yet I could be on the highway in 5 minutes with a Sunoco gas station conveniently on the way. This place is great!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Matthew’s place was just what we needed after a fairly long day of driving.

We were appreciative he is a pet-friendly host, and a fellow pet rescue lover. Matthew was also a very responsive host."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was great! I loved the retro kitchen and the way you could close off the bedroom.

The Liberty Bookshop is a GEM, with rare editions and an expansive, inventive collection.

Can’t wait to be back."

Thanks again Linda!!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda is a stellar host. I look for unique experiences with Airbnb and a room attached to a vintage book store in a former church? Bingo. FYI: If cat's aren't your thing, she has some (I loved them)."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything about Linda’s place was terrific. The cats, bookstore, and conversation were all great bonuses! I hope to stay again soon!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Not sure where to start! I stayed with Linda during my 10 weeks as a travel physical therapist in Lock Haven. The commute was about 15 minutes, peaceful, and easy. Linda provided me a welcome refuge after long days in a challenging season of my life. Linda is so much more than an Air Bnb host. She’s a listener, a guide, a mentor, and a friend. In addition to making standard accommodations, Linda truly went above and beyond to help make my time in Avis/Lock Haven a joy. Her kitties are sweet but will leave you alone if you want. This is not the place to stay if you’re looking for a 5-star hotel. Stay at a 5-star hotel if you want. Linda’s home is a home, a comfortable place to relax, gather, and break bread with old and new friends alike. She let me cook my own meals to save money while traveling, and even shared a few meals she made when there was a surplus! They were delicious, but the best part was the company. Eternally thankful for you, Linda! I’ll be back to visit one day!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay, perfect price, perfect host! Clean, comfortable, and cozy! Will definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda's place was great! The bedroom and shared bathroom was clean and bright. She supplied all the soaps and towels which was really appreciated. The kitchen and dining area was clean and there was fresh coffee prepared in the morning. Linda was also a very interesting host on a personal level. She gave me a tour and history of the church building and bookstore which was very engaging, and we had some really good, interesting chats on her wonderful porch. I would definitely recommend Linda's place if you want a quiet and comfortable place to feel at home. I would for sure stay here again if I was passing through."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda, it is very kind and sociable. She definitely enjoys being helpful. I look forward to staying again."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I am so glad I stayed at Lindas. I had unexpected post surgery issues the night I stayed there. She offered to help in any way she could.

Hubby and I got some paperback books to read this summer.
We will be back for sure!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at Linda’s was so much more than just a room to sleep for the weekend. We really enjoyed talking with her, learning about her bookshop and the history of her business, meeting her cats, and most of all how accommodating and flexible she was during out stay. Perfect spot to book if you’re coming to the area for a outdoors event (as we were / Frozen Snot!) in/around Lock Haven and Pine Creek Valley. Even bought a couple books before we left. Will be visiting again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Took a trip to the Corning Museum of Glass and decided to stop here on our way as a halfway point for the night.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We cant say enough good things about this stay!! We booked last minute and Linda went above and beyond to welcome us, even shoveling her walkway at the last minute in the dark and having our room ready in record time. When I discovered that I was allergic to the mattress, she graciously prepared another comfy spot for me to sleep. She visited with us and introduced us to her pets and let us browse her amazing book collection, a real highlight!! We had fun and a great time here, thanks again so very much!!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda provided warm and welcoming accommodations. After a backpacking adventure north of her place we were ready to relax and felt very much at home. Not only did we have a clean and comfortable room, semi-private bathroom access, but also access to common areas.
Linda offered us coffee in the morning and we enjoyed checking out her bookshop before heading on our way.
We highly recommend Linda's place!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. Really enjoyed the conversation, coffee, and cats. Linda provides valuable recommendations, and local information. Would definitely stay again when in the area."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda is a kind, welcoming host. We greatly enjoyed her hospitality all the information she gave us about the area. Our room was clean and the bed very comfortable. Both sides had reading lamps, which we used quite a bit.
Linda gives access to the kitchen and makes coffee each morning. You can cool if you want to but there is a great restaurant within walking distance.
All in all, we had a great time and couldn't ask for anything more!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Every convenience thought of. Stupendous bed and a gracious host! My experience was like hanging out with a chum. 6 stars at least!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed here for one night but we loved it! The room was small but very clean, we had everything we needed & the bed was very comfortable.

We absolutely loved spending time in the bookstore with the friendly cats & chat with Linda. We would love to stay again if we're in the area."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda’s accommodation is most comfortable and welcoming. I will stay there again if i come to the area.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Linda’s place is AWESOME!!! This is my second stay in two months and I couldn’t be happier. She is a great host with an amazing house. Definitely make some time to go through her bookstore. You won’t regret it!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great place for my wife and I to rest up for the balance of our 2-day drive from Wisconsin to Boston. We even heard some good words about your ""tidy, rustic room"" during our dinner at the Broken Axe Brew House in Loch Haven before we got to your place. The room was quiet, easy to find, clean, and the key-code check-in was smooth and uneventful - - even though we didn't get there until after dark. We will definitely stay here again on any future trips!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host and great place!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda's home felt like home. The room and bed were very comfortable. The shower had dispensers for soap, shampoo and comfortable which I found to be a great idea. Linda was fabulous host and great to talk with. Her book store was another added value as well. A fantastic stay for me and I will be a return customer."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay in Avis! Tidy, easy to access, and the bookshop was a plus :)"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Linda's was a lovely relaxed couple of days. Beautiful area to explore. Recommended.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Glorious place and people. Nothing describes it better than “home away from home”. I felt just as much a part of the house as Linda herself. She is humble and gracious, kind and loving. An honestly unbeatable experience. Thank you!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable bed, clean bathroom, beautiful kitties, and a very kind host who let me park my bicycle in a safe place. Great location next to laundry mat, gas station, and local tavern with tasty food!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda's place was super sweet: a great place to rest my head while passing through on a road trip. Linda's family and pets were all super nice and welcoming. Her 3 cats were great comforts while I'm away from my cats. I also enjoyed a nice sunset view dinner on the front porch. And the bookstore is incredible! Linda opened it up for me to browse, which she offers to all guests. I wish I gave myself an extra 3 hours to poke around, but was able to find some gems in the 45 mins I was there!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place and very comfortable!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great night in Avis. Check-in was super easy as Linda gave me perfect instructions and she was also there working in her bookstore. She recommended a place called Dave and Ruby's Oak Grove Tavern for dinner. It was a small place only 2 blocks away. Well....unexpectedly.....I had the best pork chop I ever had in my life. Almost bought a second! Ha. After dinner and some driving around, I went back and hung out on the porch. It is a quiet little neighborhood and was very relaxing. Linda ended up joining me and we held a great conversation for an hour or so. Such a nice person. The room is exactly as advertised and the AC was nice as it was a bit warm. Bed was really comfy. The house was very quiet even though someone else was staying in the other rental room. Never saw them. I parked my vehicle right outside the house where she has a couple spots available. I enjoyed the company of her 3 cats while I was hanging around too! All very friendly. The building was pretty cool and Linda's story behind it was very interesting. All in all I had a great night and the price is unbeatable! Thanks Linda! Oh...and I enjoyed the 2 giant skeletons in the neighbors yard! Apparently they love Halloween."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Need a great night's sleep? Choose this homey accommodation. And don't miss out on a few warm furry head pats from Linda's sweet felines.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved my (too brief--one night) stay at this Airbnb. A confirmed bibliophile, I cannot think of ANYthing better than an Airbnb room adjoining a secondhand bookshop. And with CATS to boot!!! Holy mother of wow. And in an utterly gorgeous area of Pennsylvania too... the mountains, rivers, and creeks are stunning. The room itself is comfortable and clean (and I found plenty of places open for meals in nearby villages even though my visit was on a holiday weekend). Morning coffee in one of the rocking chairs on the porch is The Best, second only to late-night browsing in the bookshop. Wonderful host, wonderful place!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Hello Linda! Thank you sooo much for going out of your way to help. You had the warmest welcome for me when I arrived & I had the most wonderful stay at your place. Hope to see you soon in the near future. I wish you well.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful place to stay! Linda’s listing is truly one-of-a-kind in the nicest way. An old small-town church that has been converted into one of the neatest (and well-stocked) bookstores I’ve been to in a life of enjoying bookstores. And Linda is a thoughtful and respectful host. A perfect place to get off Interstate 80 for a night. My nine-year old daughter, Kaya, and I loved our stay and would recommend it to all."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Second time back to this wonderful wonderful spot @ Linda's and the Liberty Bookstore. Linda's rooms were actually the first AirBnB plans I made before eventually becoming a permanent ""digital nomad,"" and as I would eventually come to learn in my now extensive time as an AirBnB'r, these are the types of spaces that keep folks like me finding it hard to quit this life! Truly a unique spot with the attached WONDERFUL second hand bookstore.
Really, it's a bookworm's dream, with floor to ceiling stacks to explore at your leisure, complete with the company of some wonderful (and dog friendly and/or tolerant) cats. I left my first stay with an ARM full of unique finds, particularly in the children's book section. And this time around was no different. Already planning on returning in the fall. And not just for the books!
I've stayed in both rooms now, both of which are clean, comfy, and cozy. I always sleep here so supremely well even as a terrible sleeper! (And even during a brief heat wave! There is both AC and a fan that keeps the already well insulated room very comfy in the heat of summer and early fall.)
For folks looking just looking for spaces passing through, this area of central PA is a great stop over between a number of east coast cities and locations in the midwest proper. Lock Haven (just a 10 minute drive away) is a charming place with a number of restaurants, shops, historic buildings and memorials, the University and the Susquehanna running through it, along with a riverside walk/trail. (I also love Highland Cemetery, a beautiful landscaped hilltop and resting place with views of the river and hills.)
The bathroom is shared between the two rooms available, and I have never had an issue with this. Always clean and well maintained and just as homey and cute as the bedroom.
Wouldn't hesitate to recommend Linda's rooms or the Liberty Bookshop to friends--and in fact, I have, many times! Hope to be back soon!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay, as usual. You are a real blessing. I look forward to coming to my room at the end of my long days. Always peaceful and just comfortable."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"You'll come for the price, and stay for the books. Linda's books can enhance your life. As a reluctant reader, I appreciate Linda's depth of titles provide just the right recommendation. The home is cozy, comfortable, and clean. Light shines in every room. Please note, there may be other Airbnb guests besides yourself."

Linda was very easy to communicate with and made you feel at home. Her house is connected to a very cute bookstore. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to a friend as well.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough great things about my stay here. Linda was wonderful and accommodating and communicating was a breeze. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was kept clean with plenty of clean towels and all the toiletries you might need. When Linda opened the door to the bookstore I just stood there with my mouth open, it was amazing. After a day of hiking it was awesome to come back, snuggle with some cats, and wander the store. This was a unique and delightful stay. I have already recommended it to several friends."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Linda and her place was lovely

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value for this room! My dog and I stayed a few nights with the intention of hiking in the PA Grand Canyon which is just a quick drive away. The weather was not so accommodating so we ended up staying in a lot of the time. Linda is a great, friendly host with lots of local tips and suggestions. She definitely made our trip worth it!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend, our puppy and myself had a great stay at Linda’s. The room was very comfortable and clean, with an air conditioner for temperature control. Didn’t spend much time in the bookstore since we were running around, but I’ve been there before and can say it is one of the COOLEST I’ve been in. Lots of unique books and a cozy atmosphere. Linda is very kind and made us coffee in the morning. Definitely a lovely place to stay for animal lovers, book lovers, or anyone looking for an affordable and comfortable spot!"

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda offered the best experience we've had with Airbnb – there's nothing else like it! Her hospitality is top-notch, and the perk of being able to explore the bookstore is truly wonderful. Linda thought of everything we might need, from directions to find the house to a list of restaurants in the room. The living area was warm and cozy, with very friendly cats, and the bed was so comfortable. Everything was tidy and clean. I can't recommend this enough for a unique getaway!
A few more thoughts, from my partner: ""Linda had a sense of curiosity and a desire to explain the work she did along with providing a fantastic service from the moment we stepped in the door. Her book knowledge is paralleled only by her hospitality."" Five stars all around!"

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very unusual location in a quiet place surrounded by lots of nature. it gives a separate airbnb area and Linda's cats are super cute and she herself is hospitable and very helpful especially when it comes to tips on excursions.

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Among the half dozen rentals we have booked through AirBnB, this is one of the better ones for its convenience, quiet area, and full amenities. Although the bathroom is shared with a second room rental, the two rooms are separated by the bathroom, and so we had full privacy on the first floor, and uninterrupted sleep. The two ladies who were our hosts are very friendly, and intelligent. We enjoyed conversations with them about the area and their bookstore in the old church. They were very discreet and not intrusive. We highly recommend this rental, and will surely return another time."

The town is pleasant and quiet with many older homes to admire."

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great hospitality. The space was exactly as advertised. Nothing flashy but a great option if you are looking for affordable and friendly place to stay!

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cool home as it is attached to this used bookstore/library. It is affordable and they even had coffee in the morning! Myself, my dog, and my cat were all very comfortable during our one night stay. Thanks!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda was amazing! I arrived a bit late but she was still willing to let be browse around the bookshop for a bit. I ended up finding a great book to help with my studies this year. Everything was very clean and welcoming, and was even complete with a list of things to do and places to go in the area.

2018-05-01,2.0,Stayed one night,Very basic accomodations.
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place, location, and hosts were excellent! All i was seeking was a place to sleep for a night, and I got a warm friendly welcome, loads of local history, and a book store to get lost in. It was pretty great. As this was my first airbnb experience, i wasn't sure what to expect. But i feel i got way more than I paid for, in the short time i was there. It made my trip that much better! If you are anywhere in this neck of the woods and seeking some shut eye, i highly recommend stopping by. And if your plans get tossed to the side by rain, simply hang out on the porch!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,so clean and quiet. great place to get some peace of mind. would definitely go back again!
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best evenings on my cross country trip! Super nice hosts and incredibly helpful ppl when I had a flat tire in the morning. Beautiful little town off the beaten path and well worth visiting!
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I spent one night at Linda's amidst two days hiking in the nearby area. I couldn't have been happier with my experience. The room and adjacent spaces were exactly as described and immaculately clean. The living spaces available to guests are warm and welcoming. The bed in the bedroom was comfortable and the bathroom was modern, clean and stocked with basic essentials.
Linda provided excellent communication in terms of check-in time and check-in details. If I am back in the area, I would stay here again. Thanks for a great stay!"

2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my second time at Linda's. It's halfway on a longish drive for me, and it's a good stopover point for my trip. The house is really cute, and Linda and her family are very freindly and accommodating. You also have access to a bookstore, which is nice!"
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed for 2 nights in this nice home. Linda and her sister are excellent hosts. They are well prepared and can recommend tours, e.g. to the PA canyon and along the Pine Creek Trail. A lot of maps are available."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda's place is as one-of-a-kind as the listing makes it sound: two private rooms and a clean, spacious bathroom steps away from a well-stocked used bookstore you can access without going outside and at all hours. Drinking our morning coffee that Linda had made before we woke up while browsing titles and petting the four cats is how we like to wake up. Linda and her sister were laid-back, authorities on the town and the area, as well as being book and feline aficionados. In short, this place is as good as it sounds, possibly better."
2017-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and welcoming. Linda goes out of her way to accomidte her guests.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were thoroughly impressed by the great price for such a unique experience. The functionality and unusual design in the heart of beautiful nature by the river were outstanding. Thanks to Brady and John for the opportunity to expand our minds with their mastery of interior design, refined taste, and skillful combination of each unique piece of furniture. Two days weren't enough to fully enjoy all this magnificence.
Moreover, it's not just beautifully decorated; it's super convenient and functional. Everything you might need is easily and intuitively accessible. You guys are truly excellent hosts who know how to create a high-quality, aesthetically pleasing getaway. Bravo!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a wonderful time at the Barndominium! It was a perfect spot for us as a getaway destination from NYC and to just relax and be at peace with nature. After our daily family hikes, we found the Barndominum a quiet place to relax by the outdoor firepit or at a nook indoors. Plenty of inside space to spread out. The kitchen was well supplied with different seasonings and had everything we needed to cook family meals. Brady was in the area and introduced himself as I was sitting outside by the firepit with my daughter. He told us about a trail that led down to the river, approximately 200 feet South of the house and along the tree line. Unfortunately, the trail was overgrown with grass, but worth checking out if you do stay at the Barndominum. Will return in the future for another family trip."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The barn served as the perfect launch off point for the surrounding motorcycle paradise and throttle therapy that was needed. Barn sits on a beautiful area along the river. a wonderful location and establishment. Be sure to visit Hyner lookout. Thank you for allowing us to enjoy your facility. 5 stars. Hope to return.
-Your friends from Ontario Canada."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for a getaway in nature. A ton of hiking spots near by. We can’t wait to go back.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my third time staying at the Barndominium and it was such a peaceful stay! The entire property is beautiful this time of year. I love the fully stocked kitchen and we completely took advantage of it, cooking both nights there. Can’t wait to come back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of my favorite airbnbs yet! It’s always a pleasure to arrive at a space and feel that it was meticulously crafted to make you feel relaxed and at home. The beds were so comfy and we loved opening the garage doors. The river running right alongside the property was amazing! 100% recommend.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I decided to go away for a few days on a music-writing trip to be by myself. I went through hundreds of places on the app and this place stood out as a cool looking spot (looks like the setting of a TV show)
I was able to play and record music loudly without worrying about anyone hearing me/bothering me. Easily the coolest feeling place I've ever been to. I want to come back already, and plan on coming this fall as well"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely spot and very cool living space.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful beautiful spot. We arrived late at night so had an even better sense of wonder waking up to the river and views. The barn is very cool. Very well equipped. And just a fun spot.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is AMAZING. Brady and John are great hosts and thought of every detail. The kitchen is fully stocked with anything you may need! :) I am very picky with my water, so I would recommend bringing water if you’re picky like me. The water is completely safe, but it has more sulfur than I’m used to. That definitely didn’t take away from the experience though! It was so great. We hope to come back in the summer/winter! :) The view is beautiful."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful views! We were in awe of the river and mountains. Highly recommend stargazing down by the river!
House was clean, easy to find, well maintained, completely as described. Hosts provided very clear and direct instructions which were incredibly helpful in making everything run smoothly."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed my second stay at the Barndominium! This place is so beautiful, can’t wait to come back again. I had the chance to cook during my stay and the kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed. We will definitely be back!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect Gem of a place!
Brady and John were kind and helped me navigate everything!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had an amazing time...one night was not enough. It was so peaceful and the amenities were great. We cooked dinner there and the kitchen had everything we needed and more! It was warm and cozy inside which was great because it was very cold and raining outside. Unfortunately we could not make use of the fire pit due to the weather but we did spend some time on the porch enoying the view of the river. Next time we'll definitely stay longer and bring the the rest of the family.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time renting this space. We have had a fabulous time both trips. We definitely want to come back!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of life, coming here is the best place. Such amazing views of PA right outside this remote cabin. Would 100% recommend this place to everyone :)"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a relaxing stay at this beautiful airbnb! The hosts were super accommodating and very communicative with me. The entire property was gorgeous and peaceful. The only complaint I had is that I wish I booked for more than one day! I’ll most definitely be back to visit!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Bardominium is outstanding. We liked it so much we’ve already made another reservation to return for two night.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When we walked into the barndaminium, we were immediately impressed. This is the nicest air bnb we’ve ever stayed in! My husband said this is something out of a magazine! We wished we could have stayed longer! The kitchen is fully stocked, tv is easy to use, beds are insanely comfortable, and all the natural light pouring in through the windows had me smiling as I sipped my coffee and relaxed. It’s private and secluded by the water. The instructions and house rules are clear. We had a great stay! Thank you so much hosts for this little slice of heaven! I’m gonna tell everyone I know about it!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved the Barndominium! Stayed here very briefly for a work trip slash getaway from our children. This place was lovely, fun, and beautiful!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! Exactly as described. We loved checking out the restaurants they recommended. So many big windows to look out at the river and woods! Would definitely recommend staying here.
Just a note- the bathroom door slides shut, but there are cracks at the side so sound travels through the house lol it was fine for me and me husband but might’ve been weird if friends were along.
We also went out and bought jugs of water. Their water is fine to drink, but just has a little bit of a taste and we are picky with water taste"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed with my boyfriend for his birthday, and it was the best stay we could have asked for. The barn-odium is secluded with beautiful surroundings. Plenty of games were provided and the house looked exactly like the pictures. I could not have asked for a better staycation and will definitely be back!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really cozy home off the river. Clean and feels spacious for its small size. I would come again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our time here! Our family LOVED it! The home was so clean and well kept. Outside was beautiful even in dreary, cold PA! The hosts were so responsive and informed us of everything prior! It was smooth and peaceful!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was absolutely awesome the pictures don’t do it justice. There was some construction going on next to the barn but otherwise super secluded. Loved it
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was beyond amazing, I went with my husband and my son for New Year’s Eve and it will be one of our best memories.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful secluded spot and a peaceful and beautiful view
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is AMAZING! I chose it based only on location for aurora viewing during a big solar flare, and barely looked at the photos before booking. I was shocked when I arrived because it is such a great setup. It looks very cool, was spotless, overlooks the river, and was totally different than anywhere else I have stayed. The aurora didn’t happen before the clouds rolled in but I was able to stargaze out the huge windows right from the bed! I would absolutely come back when I had more time to explore. 10/10 recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The barndominium was very nice and up to date with modern appliances, the area was very nice with scenic views very small town vibes."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Place is very nice. Cozy and clean.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and stunning view of the river. Definitely a highly recommended place.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Barndominium is truly one of a kind. It looks just like the pictures. However, the surroundings are more than can be imagined. Brady and John were very responsive. If you go, check out the Live Thy Neighbor Craft House just a few minutes up the road."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place and beautiful views, especially during the fall!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brady and John’s place was a pure delight, not only was there amazing mountains and the beautiful Susquehanna river running beside the barndominium, it was also serenely, peaceful, and a gorgeous furnishings. This place was very aesthetically pleasing. So blessed to have spent the night there on my way back home on my travels! Thanks again Brady and John hope to stay here soon, next time even longer to enjoy all those trails around the area! joy to you!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a relaxing stay in a beautiful , spacious place. Views were peaceful and majestic. We can't wait to come back."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay! The fall colors were very beautiful, and we really enjoyed the fire pit and being by the river. We would recommend bringing bottled drinking water with you since there was a bit of a mineral taste to the water during our stay. Highly recommend for a relaxing get-away! We hope to come back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was phenomenal! I’ve stayed at many Airbnbs and this by far was my best experience. Not only because how beautiful the Airbnb and and surrounding views are but you can tell the hosts really try to go above and beyond for their guests.
The Airbnb was so cool and exactly like the pictures. I joked to my friend saying it was like an eye spy game because everywhere you looked there was something that caught your eye in awe. There was just something about all the windows and doors letting so much natural light in and being able to enjoy the views from inside that truly will help you recharge.
After posting a story on social media all of my friends were asking where I was and for the information on the Airbnb so they could book it. This place is truly a gem!!
We actually brought our officiant and eloped here. We really hope to visit every year for our anniversary.
Many kudos to the hosts for this amazing place."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had an incredible stay at Brady and John’s place. Everything was spectacular from the property to the interior decorating. Wish I could’ve stayed for more than 1 night!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely last minute getaway! Booked the morning of on a free Sunday night and had a great time.
You won’t regret coming here for a sophisticated, relaxing stay in a beautiful barndominium!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Funky and fun, I loved the beautiful decor and how easy it was to feel comfortable in the room. If you have a large party, there is probably not much privacy except the bathroom but I love how it was fancy but still embraced the beauty of nature."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cool place! Enjoyed our time there and the river and mountains are beautiful.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place to enjoy a relaxing getaway!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wish we had more than just one night at this peaceful and gorgeous getaway! Thanks so much Brady & John— we will be back!
Their home was so lovely and welcoming, and the location offers privacy and a serene setting. We had a nice dinner just down the road at Good Neighbor Craft House, and enjoyed a hike at Hyner View state park, also nearby. Plus exploring the property, views of the river and relaxing by the fire were all just what we needed for our romantic getaway."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A serene picturesque getaway
This stay felt like a fantasy. The wander land feel was matched with an artistic interior. It’s location couldn’t have been better. The home is well designed. It is super clean, safe, luxurious, and earthy.
I’d recommend this over and over to anyone who loved nature or wants to get out of a city.
Thank you. Had an amazing time."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place to stay and relax by the river. Great views and very peaceful. GPS did try to tell us we had arrived several houses before the right location, but the house is very well marked with huge numbers making it easy to locate. Everything was very clean, kitchen is well stocked with pots/pans etc for easy cooking, and the provided coffee was a nice touch. The beds were very comfortable and clean. The stairs up to the loft area are pretty steep and took some getting used to but that's completely expected for loft access. Only minor drawback as someone used to public water, the water is a bit sulfur smelling. Again something completely expected for the location, but bring bottled water if you don't care for well water. Absolutely great place to stay and would happily return."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time, the place is exactly as the pictures."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were searching for a much needed peaceful & private getaway and this place was absolutely perfect for it! Loved the unique decor and beautiful scenery.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hey guys, wonderful little place quite a nice surprise for us since we have a seasonal site in Rhode Island. Love what you're doing there!
Great grounds and really cool cabin, being a design build contractor myself I appreciate what you've done with the place and it's decor!👍"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m inspired by this place. Had a great conversation with the host about the building process and design of the spade. I even got to visit two other cabins that are under instructions.
Impeccable tastes in furniture and meticulously designed. We drove four hours from NY just to stay here and would do it again in a heartbeat.
Forever grateful to our hosts."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little gem in the middle of the woods! We are locals but were looking to get away for the weekend and this was a great place to relax. Plenty to do between Lock Haven and Pine Creek, lots of good dining options. House was very clean, we felt right at home. We will definitely remember this spot for our future needs!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Short and sweet stay at the Barndominium but it was a lovely little getaway. Fun and funky furniture, beautiful river views, peaceful place for a fire pit and stargazing. We loved it!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"When we found this listing, it almost seemed too good to be true. The photos look SOOO COOL and the setting looks SOO BEAUTIFUL, it almost seems like it can't be as good as advertised. After renting the place twice, IT IS REALLY AS COOL AS IT LOOKS!
It is one of those AirBnBs where the hosts have thought of everything, and provided so many little amenities like games and dishes and spices and bathroom stuff, that you just feel right at home.
My wife is a home designer and we both LOVED their modern designs in a rural setting. It was so comfortable and so lovely.
I work for a nonprofit that makes wildlife videos (ForgottenFriendReptileTV on YouTube) and the hosts made sure to recommend some local nature spots. There was a minor issue with the fridge and they made sure it was taken care of. Definitely great hosts. The setting is beautiful and we enjoyed drinking coffee overlooking the river, playing in the river, watching eagles fly past, seeing deer grazing, etc. Great spot!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was perfect my family and I had a great time 👍
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We used every chair, table and game inside and out. Everything was so thoughtfully appointed, making us was to experience it all : ) We loved the flexibility of having wheels in the heavy furniture.
We will be back to see what else they come up with! Thank you so much Brady and John 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we loved the barndominium! the location was perfect, we loved being able to fish right from the property. the inside inside was spotless and inviting, creatively decorated and open but cozy at the same time! john & brady were very responsive with any questions or concerns that we had. would definitely recommend to a friend! (="
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place and great location, very peaceful and by the river. Stairs make it a little hard to get to the loft but overall we had a great stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was perfect 👌
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I decided on a last-minute getaway to take our children to this beautiful get away before school began. This property exceeded our expectations and we already cannot wait to go back again! Brady and John were incredibly responsive, made us feel at home and made the check in and check out process as seamless as possible. The house was such a amazing space and the views were exactly what we are looking for. Thrilled with our experience!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came to escape a busy lifestyle and celebrate our 10year wedding anniversary. This was the most memorable weekend we could have asked for. Enough to do in the surrounding areas if want to be busy yet secluded and quiet with amazing scenery if want to remain private. This place is meticulously clean, well equipped with any essential needs (and more) with attention to detail to rave about. We loved to Walk on the property to the river at our toes with amazing Mountain Views, enjoyed the nearby town in Lock Haven, local restaurants and breweries, a peaceful Campfire and scenic Mountaintop Views at Hyner State Park. Thankful for a beautiful weekend here and highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"WOW!! We have stayed at over 100 air bnb’s around the world and this was by far one of our all time favorites. The pictures don’t to it justice. It’s peaceful, extremely clean and is SO well stocked. It had every kitchen item you could think of with a bonus of nice spices and other thoughtful amenities like hand sanitizer packets and eye glass cleaners.
There were a range of nice seating area options depending on what you were doing and the time of day, which was also so nice. We will absolutely be returning and looking up their other properties to try too!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,First airbnb experience and the barn hit everything I was looking for. It was quiet and calm. The river right out back is such a great background. And the roads are absolutely amazing to drive on. Not a bad view anywhere you look.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best time here. The pictures really don’t do the place, or the property justice. The property is so beautiful. We loved being right on the river."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house is beautiful. The surroundings are amazing. We loved walking down to the river and wading. I would recommend water shoes if you want to walk/ swim in the river. The fire pit is great and perfect for s’mores and hanging out. Inside all the furnishings are beautiful. Everything is really comfortable. I would say if you have small kids or anyone older with bad knees they will want to sleep downstairs as the staircase is a little tricky. I would absolutely recommend this house and would stay here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best place I’ve been to!! It’s in such a beautiful place and the interior is filled just perfectly. They do amazing at making you feel welcome/safe/ and prioritized. They always answered quickly and gave awesome recommendations for things to do /eat around the area, without even asking. 10/10 recommend and will definitely be staying here or another one of their properties again !!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay on all levels. The barndominium was beautifully decorated and clean, felt just like home. You could tell they put a lot of thought in detail and making this property the perfect little get away.
It was incredibly peaceful whether I was sitting by the river with my morning coffee or on the porch swing listening to the birds.
We would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get away!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, and a very unique place!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Most beautiful and amazing bnb we’ve ever stayed at!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The barndominium was gorgeous and just as described
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a weekend get away with friends. Very comfortable and clean.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at the Barndiminium. Eclectic and so clean on a wonderful spot right on the river. Great fire pit with plenty of wood. Beautiful view of the river. Very cool spot, def not your average AirBnB. We were there to ride the river trail but some great exploring near by as well. After a long day of riding, it was wonderful to come back , pop a bottle of wine and sit by the firepit. Very secluded and quiet. Had a wonderful time,"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay!! The river was beautiful and the wildlife was plenty!! Awesome place!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great experience.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place looks super cool online, and it is EVEN BETTER in person! Also, there were many thoughtful touches throughout the place, like mints and coffee creamer and wheels on furniture and spices in the kitchen and almost everything you could think of like that. Just dripping with hospitality and great ideas. My one complaint is that the WiFi is lousy, which stinks with almost zero cell service. But I am guessing it's the best internet they can get in a remote area. It's a trade-off when visiting a mountain paradise.
Also, finding the WiFi password was like solving a DaVinci code riddle! It was not posted anywhere that we could see, and it was super long and complicated when we finally found it on the back of the router. But we already booked a second stay here, which should tell you that we were very happy with this truly one-of-a-kind spot. Great job to the designers who dreamed up this place, and executed the design so perfectly!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Aaamazing! My husband and I came here for our anniversary. The barndamonium is as beautiful as the pictures and the view is magical! State of the art appliances and such a creative use of the space. We loved it here!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. Me and my friends enjoy this place so much, is really secure and beautiful, I definitely want to comeback."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was an amazing stay! Very cozy and peaceful!
I really liked the style and the layout of the spaces overall. Very close to many wonderful destinations like cherry springs state park (for stargazing) and others.
It has a beautiful view of West Branch Susquehanna River!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful surroundings and a great place to stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Took my Mom here for a unique one night getaway for Mothers Day. It is such a wonderful place. The property inside is perfect and had everything you need. You can tell they put in all little extra details when decorating the place. The outside surroundings were so peaceful and relaxing. It was nice to see all the green beautiful trees. This place is perfect spot and you wont be disappointed. This was my first time renting from Airbnb and very happy all went perfect. The owners were very quick to answer any questions I had which was very appreciated. Thank you again for everything.
Monique"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was absolutely beautiful! Everything about was outstanding! Loved waking up to the sounds of the river and the view! We are planning on coming back next year. Highly recommended!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ten years ago, my wife and I started a tradition of taking our two daughters (who are now 18 and 15) away to a cabin over Easter weekend. This year we chose to stay at John and Brady’s Barndominium for our annual getaway, and it did not disappoint. The location offers great views of the surrounding landscape, including the beautiful Susquehanna river, along with easy access to the bank of the river. And while we thoroughly enjoyed the grounds of the property, the “barn” itself is the real gem. We have typically stayed in more traditional cabins, so this was a break from the ordinary, but we LOVED it. The openness of the one room floor plan along with the gorgeous live edge furniture pieces, tasteful decor, and those amazing windowed garage doors creates such a unique experience. It was the perfect way to celebrate a decade of our tradition of unplugging and soaking in time with the people we love the most. Thanks, John and Brady, for providing such us with such a memorable weekend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic stay! The loft space was perfect for the kids with 2 extra beds. Lots of room to move around and spread out. The abundant seating and tables was especially nice to have dedicated areas for games and hanging out. The outdoor area offered a lot of space to hangout and enjoy the view.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is amazing. So peaceful and relaxing. It was exactly what we where looking for.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely perfect. It is right on a river and has the most beautiful views. My girlfriend and I cooked great meals and the wonderful kitchen because they had anything and everything you needed. Loved the bed and slept great. Lots to do in the area if you love to go hiking. I strongly suggest you stay here and the host are super nice and responsive to every thing!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,For two single traveling women we would’ve liked a lock on inside.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. The place felt welcoming and was very clean. Sad we couldn’t use the fire pit since it rained during our stay but will definitely try next time during better weather.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wi-Fi was poor wasn’t able to watch tv but it’s amazing for some alone quality time with your significant other. Amazing area , amazing views , great little creek to take pictures , fire pit , swing , amazing kitchen to cook, amazing morning view , a lot of space felt right at home."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I recently stayed at Brandy and John's and had a wonderful experience. The accommodation was clean, comfortable, and well-maintained. The hosts were very welcoming and friendly, making me feel right at home. I highly recommend Brandy and John's for anyone looking for a great place to stay!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a unique and amazing place ! Very modern looking . Everything was great and the host was very responsive and fast. This place is definitely a hidden gem .
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Brady and John’s place is beyond amazing !!!! We had a great time from the moment we arrived and wished that we stayed a little longer. Brady and John were also very good with answering any of our questions in a timely manner. The whole concept of the house is amazing!!!! Especially the heated floor!! I definitely recommend this place and look forward to possibly booking it again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at the Barndominium. It's a peaceful, beautiful setting nestled right next to the river. There were two things that could have used a little attention in our opinion. One was that the water in the shower didn't get super hot. The other thing was there were no blinds in the windows or on the glass garage doors. But the place was squeaky clean, the kitchen was well stocked, and the live edge furnishings were beautiful and functional. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and everything was as good as the pictures portrayed!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Brady and John’s space was beautiful. They have great attention to detail within the space and everything needed was available. They are responsive to any requests. I would definitely stay here again!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the Barndominium! The space itself is beautiful and was the perfect place to spend a weekend away. The kitchen is very well-stocked and the views of the river and nature are fantastic. We only wish it had been warm enough to enjoy a fire and stargazing
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our hosts were very responsive, helpful, and friendly. The space was clean and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Thank you!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! The place looks just like the pictures and together with our cats we felt right at home. Would recommend this space if you’re in the area!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little place. Can be very noisy late at night. Luckily the ac/fan unit did a good job of blocking some of the noise. Shower water temperature was finicky. Overall, it served us well for the weekend."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay! The studio is cozy and clean and we felt right at home. We appreciated the fact that it is pet friendly. Would definitely recommend and stay again in the future ￼:)
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We just came for a quick little weekend getaway. The space was really nice, we joked about wanting to permanently rent it. Loved the exposed brick, the rain shower and the wood beams! It was quiet especially for there being other tenants in the building. It’s a dog friendly Airbnb which was the main draw to renting it for the weekend. It’s located in walking distance to a lot of great bars, restaurants and cafes. Close drive to other places as well, about a 20 min drive to an awesome lake that we spent the day at walking the dog and scoping out some campsites to come back to in the summer! The hosts were very responsive and friendly and we really appreciated how clean the space was. I honestly am forgetful with reviewing spaces I stay at but I made it a point to remember to review this one because it deserves it. It really was just the perfect space to relax at for a snowy weekend. Thank you!!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apt to rent for an Airbnb. Had a great stay and will look to rent again if I come back. The apt is right above Odd Fellas too, so very convenient location."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying at Josh's place - I think it is a great space for a great price and will most likely be back a third time! I stayed once in the summer and once in winter, and I was comfortable, happy, and content both times.
I also noticed that the suggestions I gave Josh from my first stay to improve the cooking experience in the kitchen were taken into consideration! It seems fair to describe Josh as an empathetic host who is genuinely interested in the needs of his guests, and I commend him for that.
Thanks, Josh!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Lots of local restaurants and shops within walking distance. The loft was spacious, had cool vibes, and made for the perfect weekend getaway."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"As always, Joshua and Sarah’s place was perfect. I love staying with them when I’m in town. Thank you for always being so warm and welcoming."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So grateful for Joshua and Sarah for being such great hosts! We were enduring a bad winter storm during my stay and they were super accommodating with my check in and check out times! A very comfortable stay as always!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A pet-friendly space surrounded by restaurants and shops in a picturesque small college town. The unique, immaculate apartment is easy to find and Joshua is an ultra-responsive host. Take a few minutes to stroll the nearby river walk. Look to Lock Haven as a weekend getaway or stopover under three hours from NYC."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Joshua was a great host and made sure our check-in went smooth. The space is very cute and cozy with a lot of historic charm. It was also well stocked with extra toiletries just in case you forgot something. The only issue we had was the noise both inside and outside. The tenants in the building were not loud or anything but everything seems to echo in the building. There is also a bar on the same block which can be very loud outside at 2am. The noise machine they provided was helpful.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As advertised. Good place for the price.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The hosts were communicative and friendly, instructions for check-in were easy and clear, and the apartment was just as described! We were grateful to have a spot to rest after visiting with local family during the day. We had a great to go meal from The Main Street Grill on our first night. If you are a light sleeper, the activities of neighbors and/or street noises may be an issue for you. If you are a deep sleeper (like me), then it is less likely to bother you. The heat worked well despite being cold outside and we had no issues with the plumbing. Parking wasn’t an issue overnight and we left early before meter monitoring started. Overall, a good stay and would stay again! Would love to walk the town when it’s warmer and explore more shops and restaurants outside of a holiday weekend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Classy and very clean. Thank you for the wonderful crash pad on our way to NYC!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As always, Josh and Sarah are extremely accommodating! Loved my stay at this Airbnb. Such a relaxing experience!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and spacious studio. We will definitely stay again when in the area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Another great stay. As always, Josh is a wonderful host and very communicative! Can’t wait to come back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is our second time staying at this location and just as the first time it was wonderful. such a cozy space that makes you feel right at home with some great restaurants nearby as well as a laundromat and grocery store. walking distance to walking distance to the levee
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the little apartment vibe of this place. It was cozy but also modern. It was a great location, close to lots of restaurants and hiking trails. Joshua & sarah were very easy to reach when I had a few issues with getting inside (of my own doing, their instructions were very clear!). The place was exactly as described, better even! I will say though, like another guest pointed out, that the neighbors were noisy Friday night, until about 3am. Sounded like they came home when the bars closed and had a raucous party, however, they sounded like they were having a good time haha! We only cared because we had to be up early Saturday for a race, otherwise, it’s just the typical apartment building & street noise. The white noise machine helped though and it didn’t detract from the place at all! 5 stars, highly recommend, will definitely stay here again when in the area!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was unique, clean and great location to downtown activities. Would recommend to anyone who doesn’t want just a hotel experience."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I stayed one night while passing through on my drive from Michigan to NYC. It was the perfect spot for me and my dog to sleep peacefully and quietly and do a little work online in the morning. We enjoyed an early morning walk along the path by the river nearby. The beautiful scenery was such a treat! The place is spacious and comfortable with unique features and charm. The hosts were extremely responsive and accommodating. I would absolutely stay there again and would definitely recommend both the space and the hosts!

Joshua was very quick to reply when I had a quick question.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay while we were in Pennsylvania for the Little League World Series - it was a simple and easy commute. The location is right downtown which was great to be able to explore the city and there was a great river walking trail at the end of the block. Joshua was super quick and responsive when we had a few questions. We would stay again! Thanks
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay as always!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stopped in Lock Haven to take a work call before going north to go camping. Some bad weather rolled in and we decided it'd be safer to stay in town for the night. Josh was able to accommodate us within 30 mins of our initial outreach to ensure the Airbnb was prepared for us to arrive on short notice. It was a neat old space and we felt very comfortable there. There are lots of pretty old houses in the neighborhood. Would definitely stay again if we ever find ourselves in the area again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As always- another great stay! Both Josh and Sara was super communicative and accommodating! Had the opportunity to utilize the kitchen to cook and it was well stocked with all the pans needed! Can’t wait to come back.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"perfect for visits Lock Haven, located right downtown, with plenty of places to dine, and shop.
josh was a great host, super responsive, even for my last minute reservation. the apartment is well appointed, and very urbane for a small town. a great adaptive reuse of the old oddfellows hall.
can highly recommend.
(one note, pay attention to parking signs on street, as some sides of the street have no overnight parking for street cleaning.)"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Joshua's, and recommend it for any individual or couple looking to stay in downtown Lock Haven. The kitchen has the basics, the A/C kept me cool during the warm summer nights, and parking/access was a breeze. It was nice and clean, too.
A nice place, and a nice host! I wouldn't hesitate to book a second stay."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great in-town location! Great for a weekend getaway! Has plenty of surrounding food, entertainment, adventure, etc etc!! Great old restored building! It is in the town itself, so there is noise, but it wasn’t overwhelming! I do recommend the place. It is on the 3rd floor with no elevator, so keep that in mind! Also, pet friendly! 😁"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was actually cool. It is an old building but has been updated and had a very eclectic feel. The only issue was the noise outside and from the people below us. The The bathroom and counter space were spacious and easy access to different eateries were a bonus.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a cute Airbnb! The town was really quaint. We got in late but there was a good little bar and grill still open called The Corner Street Bottle Shop. It was really good. The parking is on street and there are meters. They are free after 6pm.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Once again, another great stay! Host is super responsive and accommodating. Great location and proximity to restaurants and shops."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was good! Good communication with host, but weekend is a louder stay due to location understandably! Would recommend."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed in this location now twice and both times it’s been perfect, and one other time at another one of Joshua’s listings. Each time, Joshua is communicative and easy to work with. Thank you for making each trip to LH easy and pleasant. Looking forward to my next visit."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a terrific find! It was charming, roomy, clean, and beautifully furnished. I plan on staying there again. Joshua was friendly and quick to respond. Definitely my favorite place in Lock Haven!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"perfect for my one night stay. super comfortable, clean and conveniently located to lots of great restaurants. Joshua was super helpful, flexible and responded promptly when i had questions. Thank you both so much for offering your home! will definitely recommend to a friend/be back myself the next time i’m in town."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was neat and clean. Had everything you would need. Location is very good, but the neighbors were very loud until 3am. So, hard to get good sleep when you can clearly hear someone yelling at all hours of the night."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joshua’s place was great for us after a long day of driving and before another long day of driving. I wish we had more time to explore the area—maybe next time!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a awesome space in downtown Lock Haven! Close to everything. Joshua was a great host. Directions were clear, the place was clean and cozy with a comfy bed. The space is very cool and is set up very nicely. Joshua reached out a couple times to make sure everything was going well. I didn’t have any problems but if I did, I’m sure he would have handled them quickly.
There is a bar next door so it gets a little loud after midnight. Not a problem for me this trip but something to consider.
Overall , a great place, one I’d go back to again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great loft right in the center of downtown!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We chose this place because of the location. We go to a great tattoo shop called Pinch N Poke. This place was right across the street. When I saw our room we just loved it! We love old buildings and lots of woodwork. Anyway, thank you Josh, we will be back."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice space. Easy to walk to shops, restaurants and bars. Parking is in the street but host gave feedback that meters are not checked in evening or weekend. There was noise from the street until early hours of the morning"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Didn’t get to stay due to a sick pup. But the hosts were amazing and easy to communicate with.
Will be staying in future"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice efficiency apartment with plenty of room and a comfortable bed. Convenient downtown location. Parking is metered, but we weren't there during the day, so it didn't impact us.
This was my first stay at this location, but my second time staying in downtown Lock Haven for a weekend. People can be very loud late at night on the street, and you will hear if they are out there. This has been true at the two different locations. Just be aware if you think it will impact you. It's the trade-off for the convenient location."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Josh was a great host! Very responsive and friendly, would definitely recommend if staying in the area"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy place and is located downtown and walkable to many restaurants and stores.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another gem in downtown Lock Haven. Perfect spot for a solo traveler or a plus one. Great location with Main Street Grill and The Old Corner (two of my faves in town) within walking distance.
Everything was neat, clean and prepared when we arrived. Easy self check-in with the key in a lockbox on the door. Very responsive and friendly host. I’ll definitely book this one again."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,the loft was clean and well stocked. did not need to contact the host for any reason as every thing was ready and I had no issues. would recommend.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, loved the town and nearby bike path and Piper Museum! Very comfortable, cool loft apartment."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love the experience i had and host was wonderful ave very attentive and made sure i was comfortable. Definitely will stay again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and just what was needed for our stay! Very quick communication!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"From check in to check out the process was just easy! This loft has a great location. You gotta try Odd Fellows burgers downstairs. You are walking distance from many shops. There is a Dollar General within walking distance if you need something. Several little bar/restaurants in town, a grocery store. Laundromat on the ground level next door. Hangar 9 is delicious right up the street. Broken Axe had good local brews and live music.
The loft is trendy, up to date and so cozy helping you to feel right at home. It has all the little touches you could want/need. I was able to cook there and we even had a dinner date at the big island with family. Fully functioning kitchen. The bathroom is spacious. Soft towels. The bed is very comfortable with nice soft linens. A desk if you need to get work done. A nice lounge chair and loved watching TV from bed on the big screen.
I had read a couple reviews that people thought this place had street/bar noise. We didn't feel that it was out of sorts. Saturday nights were the only times we could hear people down on the street from the bar. The first Saturday we joined them and the 2nd Saturday we just turned on the AC/fan and it created just the perfect amount of white noise that we didn't even hear them so don't let that deter you. The other days of the week were very quiet. No problems at all.
I would recommend if you are staying during the week to go to the little city building on Church Street and buy a parking pass otherwise the meters in front only go 2 hr 15 min. Behind the building I believe you can feed the meter to last up to 8 hours and it's $0.25/hour vs out front $0.50/hour.
We come out here yearly and will try to stay here again in the future. It beats a hotel/motel any day.
Thank you for a wonderful stay. 💛"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a fairly unique, spacious, interestingly historic and very well setup and maintained studio apartment AIRBNB. The building is right in Lock Haven center so you get kind of a cool ""city"" feel but in an easy, low key, charming small town. It's got exposed brick and a lot of open space, a very usable large kitchen area and a great bathroom. You're 1 min by foot away from some shops and food places and 5 mins from more places. It's a few min walk down the side street the place is on- Vesper- to the raised up dike overlooking the very pretty Susquehanna River, where one can walk on the path and see the rolling mountains all around. Great deal, great place!"

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I had a good stay at the apartment. The apartment was clean and very nicely set up.

2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great loft right in the heart of this quaint downtown area. I loved the riverside walk nearby, but unfortunately visited on a Sunday when nearly all the local businesses were closed. The area itself looked a little neglected and though there’s not much to do, it’s a scenic stopover with plenty of natural beauty nearby for those on long road trips."

To top it off there was unexpected snow and our hosts had the path shoveled and around our car cleaned out before we were ready to leave. They even provided a snow broom to clean our car off.

Nice atmosphere, but a bit small with a functional bathroom. You’ll enjoy your time on the porch the most.
WARNING, DO NOT USE YOUR GPS! It takes you to the wrong location and not even close to the actual place. Christina is very nice, will warn you and give you directions. Not far at all from Lock Haven. (Google maps &Waze doesn’t have this one right) But it is very nice once you arrive.

For two nights, we drove up to Cherryspring State Park for the meteor showers which was over an hour away and a bit of a tough drive, but we're still glad we picked this location over a closer hotel. Definitely would recommend!"

2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and after staying with Christina and her husband, I can see why everyone loves it!
Christina called me the day before to let me know that the GPS would probably lead me astray and gave me some tips to make sure I found the place successfully. She was also kind enough to answer my questions about food in the area and even gave me some tips on where the best places were. I really appreciated her input and I felt much more comfortable about driving up after speaking with her. (This was my first AirBnB stay)
When I arrived, I was greeted by her husband and her family dogs/cats. I felt right at home immediately since I have pets as well. They have a beautiful home and made it clear that I was welcome to stretch out and relax wherever I felt comfortable.
The room itself is very clean and exactly as described. Christina set out some snacks, and her husband provided all the necessary information to make my stay as comfortable as possible (WIFI, property description, TV guide.. ect).
All in all, I had a wonderful stay and would absolutely recommend that you stay here if you have the opportunity to!"

2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We would have liked to have seen Christina's house in the daylight. It looked beautiful. We arrived at night and left early in the morning. Bed was very comfortable and all instructions were accurate. Nice place to stay after a Penn State football game!
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Saddleback Ridge was simply a fantastic experience. Christina was in constant communication leading up to our arrival. The location took our breath away and the room was fantastic. A bottle of juice for each of us in the fridge, a small array of crackers, clean room and bath and simply a beautiful home and property. I can't wait until we return again!!!"

2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my first airbnb experience and it exceeded my expectations. The room was perfect: spotless, quiet, with private bathroom and frig, and niceties like plenty of towels, cups, and snacks. Bed was uber comfy. The private entrance was very handy, as my agenda kept me out until later in the evening. Really enjoyed chatting with Christina over coffee in the morning. I had hoped that the ""people"" experience would elevate airbnb over a typical hotel visit -- and that was certainly true! I expect to book Saddleback Ridge again in the future and hope to have a little more time to explore the incredible views and property."
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location in the mountains of PA! Thoroughly enjoyed Lock Haven and surrounding area, and Christina is a very welcoming host! A+"

We had such a lovely night at Saddleback Ridge and wish we could have stayed longer.
The bed was sooo comfortable and the house was set in lovely grounds! The pictures do not do this place justice!
Christina was very hospitable and we could have chatted to her all day! She recommended a lovely place for dinner in Lock Haven which we went to which was really nice and well priced.
All in all a lovely experience and would certainly recommend Saddleback Ridge.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"2nd time staying at this Cabin with my family for my nephew's birthday. We love the more remote location. The nearby walk to the waterfall.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin exceeded our expectations. It was even nicer than the pictures. Plus, Cathy had lots of little touches to make us feel welcome and at home.

Cathy was such a gracious host and really goes the extra mile to make this place a notch above the rest! Thank you very much Cathy and I can’t wait to take another trip to the cabin. There’s so much more to see that I didn’t get too!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We rented Cathy’s place for my wife’s 40th birthday weekend and had a fabulous time. We stay in many Airbnbs but hers was top notch. All weekend we kept saying how the picture don’t even do it justice. The attention to detail cannot be beat. We arrived to a fully stocked snack basket and a case of water in the fridge and the cute little coffee bar had everything you needed. She reached out prior to our arrival and even offered to get specific creamers for us. We loved the peaceful location of the cabin and the location of the fire pit. While we were out at the fire pit on Saturday night the coyotes were insanely howling in the distance. It was so cool yet eerie. The only thing that would have made our stay better was a longer stay! We most definitely will be returning with our children so they can experience this beauty themselves.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was our second year staying here, and we couldn't be happier. The house was clean and welcoming. Cathy even spoiled the kids with treats and drinks, which they loved that little surprise! The porch was my favorite spot, even when it rained. We ate and played games on the huge picnic table every day. The road is beautiful to walk at any time. And there's a fun little hike to the waterfall, starting at the hairpin turn. Regardless of our day's activities - counting deer, hiking, swimming, DelGrosso's, the Amish, or just being lazy - Cathy's place was an awesome place to crash at day's end. It felt like home."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cathy was a great host. The cabin was very nice and exceptionally clean. We were surprised by the snack basket and some water and couple cans of soda in fridge.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cathy was a very kind host and there were little touches that made us feel at home. There were donut holes and kauai coffee ready for us and it made us feel welcome after a long drive! It was also super clean and cozy. Outside there was a firepit we used at night and on the side, horseshoes to play. We saw deer several times and took a walk to the waterfall down the road. My daughter was coming from the city so this was a welcome retreat! We’d definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came up from Florida for our stay for our nephews 5th bday. What a great place! Kids loved the loft area and the games and books provided. Short distance to a hiking trail and waterfall. Cabin had all necessities plus some added extras. Absolutely beautiful location, quick response and super helpful. We are hoping to make this an annual trip and this will be our place to stay!"

I would definitely recommend! Thank you Cathy!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Staying with Cathy is always a treat. This is the fourth time we have stayed with her and it always feels like home. Nothing but great things to say.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cathy was awesome. We had a belated Valentines family getaway for the weekend and the description matched and the house came with anything we could ever want. (Especially by cooking!) The gas fireplace was a warm homey area we got to play games (one we brought and one there) in the evening. We saw Penns Cave and did some hiking. Will come back for Christmas time! 😉

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Cathy’s cabin during the week between Christmas and New Years. Honestly, the cabin was probably the best outfitted Airbnb that we have stayed at during our travels—Cathy really thought of everything! (For example, we forgot our toothpaste, but Cathy had that on hand in one of the bathrooms!) The cabin was warm and inviting, impeccably decorated with Christmas decorations that excited our three-year-old son. The kitchen included everything that one would ever need for cooking, and Cathy added some delicious treats, coffee, beer, and wine. The towels were fluffy and there was everything we needed to do laundry during our stay.
The location of the cabin was perfect with hiking available right outside the front door, including gorgeous waterfalls and actual state park trails a short drive away. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again if our travels brought us back this way!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was exactly what we were looking for. It had all of the modern conveniences we needed, felt like we were in the middle of nowhere, but had easy access to highways. No wi-fi, but we knew that going in and we were able to get data on our phones without issue. Cathy seemed to anticipate our every need. We fixed 4 excellent meals in the kitchen. We were able to build a campfire despite the constant rain on our trip as the wood was kept dry under the porch. We were able to watch world series and soccer games. After perusing the materials that Cathy left about ""what to do in the area"", we ended up going to a chainsaw art festival, that was one of the highlights of our trip. Would definitely recommend!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome cabin! Very clean and great ambience. Well-stocked kitchen and perfect hang out spot for the weekend. Quiet and relaxing!
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cathy’s home was nothing shy of outstanding. Fantastic location right off of I-80 close to everything you could possibly want in the PA Wilds.

2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This cabin exceeded our expectations. It was extremely clean and well organized. It offered many comforts over other places. The tastefully decorated cabin was well stocked with every necessity for cooking and eating-in. The coffee/tea bar was well stocked and offered many choices. Having a washer/dryer was big bonus. Cathy was helpful in finding activities and dining options. We loved our stay. The kids played games and loved hanging out in the loft. This location was ideal for relaxing and enjoying nature.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cathy was the best host ever! Super good communication, sparkling clean property and soooo cozy. This place is magical, in the woods and perfect if u want to unplug and relax with friends and family.
Would love to visit again."
,,,Very rude host. Tries to rip you off
,,,"Caboose was adorable but a health trap for anyone with chemical allergies or asthma. We spent barely 2 hours there & had to make a quick exit when my daughter had a reaction to fumes. The AC / heater not in use September or October meant no fresh air coming in. Blinds are attached to sills with note not to open them. The old stove & fuel lines give off diesel smell. Hosts said they never had anyone mention it before. Untrue! Sept 2020 review & Oct 2020 reviews mention it . See what their response was in the Oct review. Couldn't recall they were told the month prior? (Just search ""smell"" in reviews. ) They didn't respond to our email until next day & refused to refund. Stay away from this if you value your health."
,,,"This is a beautiful place in a very quiet area but the house should be checked for ticks. Beds in the upper area had ticks and we were bitten by multiple ticks. I wish I would give 5 star but I just simply can’t. Other than ticks, the house is beautiful and host is very responsive."
