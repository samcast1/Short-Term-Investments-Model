2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our third time staying at the apartment and each time we feel safe, comfortable, and welcome. Communication was excellent as always and we look forward to our next visit."
2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Don‚Äôt really feel like it was well worth our money. The bed was awful. The kitchen was tiny, the dryer took 3 cycles to dry!! The shower had great pressure. Wish there was a small table to eat. Would have been nice to have a mirror in the rooms. Only mirror was in the bathroom and a tiny one. Would have been nice to have a toaster, maybe some pans that weren‚Äôt old and over used w scratches which made everything stick. Only had 3 small trash bags. Expect more when staying 7 days. The stairs to go upstairs are awful!!! And there was no dresser in the rooms for our clothes. We had to live out of our suitcases. For the amount of money, I expected more."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Couple of small items, place smelled of stale cigarette smoke."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Andrew's place was adorable, tidy, quaint, well designed, with all the things we needed. The back deck has plenty of space to sit and enjoy a late drink or early coffee. The laundry facilities are fantastic. The bed was quite comfortable. We were very please with our stay. And it's not far to and from the Red River Gorge. Thank you Andrew."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was BETTER than the photos show. The neighborhood is well taken care of - some nice airBNBs come with sketchy surroundings - this was not the case here. The neighbor‚Äôs places were just as nice as ours. It felt safe and private. The inside is updated and beautiful - way more space for than we needed for just the night‚Äôs stay. We tried Apollo Pizza in the evening, and Purdy‚Äôs Coffee in the morning - both were cute and served delicious food."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the East apartment! The apartment was very pristine‚Äî I loved how it was decorated! Andrew was responsive and helpful when needed.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful stay! This place was everything an AirBnb should be, and the host was great. If this spot is available, it‚Äôs the one to choose."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was gorgeous and well maintained. Will definitely come back one day!!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"You can tell hospitality is one (among many) of Andrew‚Äôs life's passions; he‚Äôs thoughtful and intentional with his furnishings. I loved the dimmers in every room! It truly felt like every detail was considered. I only stayed for one night, but everything was immaculate when I got there, the bed was very comfy and the shower pressure was the best I‚Äôve had. Next time, I want to take advantage of the patio, soak in the tub, and walk downtown. Also, I was fortunate enough to chat with Andrew when I arrived and he‚Äôs such a kind man! I‚Äôve never stayed in an Airbnb twice, but there's a first time for everything!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Beautiful place!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is so much better than getting a hotel room for the night! Beautiful, great location, and super clean. Have stayed here twice and highly recommend!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,great price for a good location!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"At the risk of sounding mawkish, Andrew's Airbnb in Richmond is one of my favorites in the world. I've stayed several times, and I always look forward to it. 5/5 stars!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew‚Äôs airbnb was perfect! Super clean and their space was perfect. We loved the area, it was super quiet and beautiful. Anytime we had a question Andrew responded pretty quickly. This is definitely a recommended spot to stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice place, clean and plenty of space.
Hope to return and stay again.
Thank you"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are thankful to the hosts for a beautiful stay. The fireplace was lit when we got there and was the best start to our anniversary getaway. We spent a day at nearby Keeneland (even though we know nothing of horses or horse racing), and loved it so much we plan to go back! We spent each morning and afternoon at Purdy‚Äôs coffee shop. It and other shops are walkable from the Airbnb. We also went to Chenault winery nearby multiple times. Delicious food and seriously the most phenomenal sweet wine flight I‚Äôve ever had. The stay has an amazing tub that one can relax in each night. While not technically a soaker tub, it‚Äôs antique and deeper than most modern tubs making it the perfect end to the day (for those tub connoisseurs out there). In short: I am glad we picked this place as the base for our relaxing and fun weekend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew's place is the perfect spot for us in Richmond. It's always impeccably clean and beautifully furnished, making us feel at home. The basement plant Oasis is an absolute dream and provides a relaxing escape from the hustle and bustle of traveling. We love that multiple TVs are in the house, making unwinding easy after a busy day. It's spotless, and the complimentary Keurig coffee is a bonus that we genuinely appreciate. The multiple parking spaces in the back are also a huge plus. We have stayed here twice now, and we can confidently say that it's our go-to spot whenever we visit Richmond. It's made our trips so much easier to plan now that we have found our home away from home."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are locals to Richmond, but needed somewhere to stay while our house was getting worked on.
This place was super cute and very clean. You can tell they put a lot of work into updating everything and keeping everything in great condition.
It‚Äôs in a great location close to down town but also EKU. We were very pleased with the stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Terrific place to stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a beautiful & immaculately clean Airbnb with so many beautiful plants
Andrew was an excellent host and very gracious We will visit again when in the area !"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little spot for the price. Communication was great & check in was simple. The home was quaint & stylish, perfect for 2 people. The internet was a little slow when working from home, but could have been due to the storm. Overall a great location & stay. Definitely recommend if you‚Äôre traveling through the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was absolutely beautiful! Clean and decorated very well. Very impressed! Excellent place for parents to stay visiting their kids at EKU!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great little spot on Tybee.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Comfortable stay, no frills. Enjoyed all the houseplants at the back entrance"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful!!!! Andrew‚Äôs place is clean, comfortable, and welcoming.
It is one of my favorite Airbnbs ever! The space is absolutely beautiful with comfortable, clean furniture, quality lighting and gorgeous plants. It was a great place to decompress before my conference."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"To be honest, most of our Airbnb experiences have been disappointing. This is the only place that EXCEEDED my expectations. Andrew's home is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. The parking is convenient and easy. The home looks just like the pictures, but even prettier. It's a historic building that has been updated where needed while still keeping the charm intact. It's incredibly clean....spotless actually. I usually go around doing a quick swipe with lysol wipes, but I didn't here. It really is that clean. There are plants throughout that lend a peaceful feeling. (The laundry area is not to be missed!) I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else when visiting the area."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Definitely lots of space for 2 people staying. You can walk a few steps to the bars or restaurants. Liked the furniture and sort of vintage-modern style.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a great time at this property.... Well maintained and all around fab! Highly recommend.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was better than described. Great location
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved the place! Great location. Parking is steps away from the entry. Super easy entry. Extra touches in the kitchen and throughout. Adorable place! Host communication was fantastic. We were very comfortable here and will definitely stay again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve stayed here 5 times now, great spot! Only spot to stay at while in Richmond for me"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We love this air bnb! And will continue using it in the future!! A great place to stay on date nights and way more relaxing than a hotel.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home. Enjoyed my stay thank you so much.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property. Enjoyed my stay.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We only stayed one night at Andrew's apartment in the middle of a road trip, but it was exactly what we needed: very comfortable, very clean, and pet-friendly; and, included private parking, a full kitchen, a lovely soaking bathtub, and comfortable bed. The gas fireplace was already lit when we arrived, making the experience even more cozy. We hope to find it available the next time that we are passing through the area. Thanks so much, Andrew!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This is my 4th stay at Andrew‚Äôs place and I‚Äôll come back again because it‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre looking for.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I appreciated staying here and enjoyed the beautifully updated apartment.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Whenever we visit Richmond Ky we make sure to book with Andrew. His properties are immaculate and he's a great host.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"was coming from out of town and found Andrew's place as a last minute booking... and honestly I'd rather stay here than my multiple family members' homes.
do you remember when staying in an air b n b was pleasant? like a hotel, but not a hotel? WELCOME BACK. relax, and welcome home away from home.
the structure is old, but updated where it counts: kitchen, bathroom, paint, door locks.
the charm of the home is maintained and paired exceptionally with mid century style furniture.
we spent the day visiting a hospitalized family member, and a couple of distilleries. we were super excited to spend a cold, rainy evening by the fireplace with some bourbon.
easy to find, lots of parking.
Andrew is lovely. And a fantastic plant dad!
to note:
- structure is old, and has four separate living spaces. we heard no one, but if you're sound sensitive please keep that in mind. maybe a sound machine or a box fan."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,What a beautiful place to stay. Right on Main Street close to everything. Loved the beautiful rooms. Exactly what we needed. Will definitely stay here every time we come to Richmond!!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved the feel of this stay with all the care taken in the detail as well as the tremendous amount of greenery that was all immaculately cared for. The space was clean and perfectly suited for a night on the town. We‚Äôd definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"As usual. An excellent stay with at one Andrew‚Äôs places. Clean, updated, cozy. Cannot complain at all. Thank you again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Exquisite in every respect. The space was beautifully decorated in a mid-century style that worked wonderfully with original hardwood flooring throughout. The furnishings were exceptionally comfortable...don't be fooled by the initial appearance of the sofa! It's extremely comfy and great for a nap by the fireplace. Likewise, the queen bed is a dream. The linens are buttery soft and the pillows are exactly right. The kitchen is wonderfully well stocked for preparing any meal...there's even a wine fridge underneath the coffee bar! The bath features subway tile and a deep tub perfect for a soak. The water pressure for the rainshower shower head is excellent, plenty of hot water and towels. If you need to do laundry, the basement has an outrageously nice complimentary facility with multiple machines and supplies. Even if you don't need to use it, go downstairs and check it out. It's filled with beautiful plants and lets out on to a wonderful back deck"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed my stay. Wonderful building and the apartment was cozy and well thought out.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place, and cool location around historic buildings. Loved my stay, thank you so much."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful comfortable place to stay in Richmond. Good walkable location, great shower and comfortable bed. Andrew responded quickly to a question and we were glad to meet him in person. The washers and dryers are in the basement and not within unit, but the large space filled with plants made it feel like a spa. If you're going to the Richmond area, definitely book Andrew's place!"

There was also a mini car garage where you can fit a car‚Ä¶trucks and SUVs won‚Äôt fit‚Ä¶but there was parking available.
I stayed for only one night so it was bit expensive, but enjoyed the stay. I highly recommend and will make future plans to reserve here if available."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Andrews place was a welcome haven after a difficult day of travel. The gas fireplace was on when I arrived so it was warm & welcoming. His place was very clean & pristine. Beautiful oasis of indoor plants in the basement area. I‚Äôd enjoy going back to explore the area & wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book his place again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Some Airbnb hosts just ‚Äúget it‚Äù - Andrew‚Äôs spot was spotless, well-appointed, with care for the details, super comfy and a great location. If you are looking for a warm and inviting place to stay in Richmond, it‚Äôs perfect. I‚Äôd go back for sure."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at Andrews place. It‚Äôs super cozy and we enjoyed being able to walk to the shops on Main St. Even though there were guests in the other apartments it was very quiet.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was everything we needed it to be...
The property was quiet and peaceful, a wonderful way for us to disconnect and simply be. The unit was beautiful, spacious, very clean, and fragrance neutral.
The hosts have done a great job keeping tenant needs in mind. We loved soaking in the bathtub and cooking in the fully stocked kitchen. Also, don't sleep on the outdoor space as there is a great deck with impressive landscaping. We thought it was very easy to relax here!
We found the property to be conveniently located to the local farmer's market and highly recommend checking it out if that's your thing."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,4th stay here as I travel to the area every few months. Great place and I will be back again.

Honestly there is nothingI I would change."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This house was beautifully decorated! Everything was there you would expect in an apartment. We only stayed for one night but it would be great
for a longer stay!
The USB Chargers at the side of the bed were not plugged in/ working. I'm sure that's an easy fix but people would appreciate it."

Would definitely stay here again if the opportunity arose."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Andrew's place was the perfect overnight spot for my husband and I while traveling, but would have been perfect for a much longer stay.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely delightful place and it was as clean as could be and beautifully appointed. So many live plants both indoor and out! We only stayed one. night but the back yard patio was lovely and was sorry we didn't have time to sit back and enjoy it. There was only a taco place within walking distance but that is no fault of the host. We didn't feel like driving after a long day traveling so it sufficed. Everything else was exceptional and if I travel that way again will definitely book again. Andrew was always quick to respond and we highly recommend him.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Andrew was very responsive when we had issues checking in (this was my error). The place was extremely clean and so homey! We loved it.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My stay at Andrew‚Äôs place was cut short due to a technical/booking issue. While inconvenient, Andrew was accommodating, kind, and very apologetic. He gave me a full refund, offered to pay for a hotel, and refunded me for activities I had planned in Richmond. I would book again as Andrew was so helpful and the home was beautiful."

This apartment building is in a nice area. Please note that to access the apartment, you must use stairs at either entrance. You might want to bring a sound machine as well since this apartment is downstairs and on the main street. Host responded promptly with some questions and needs that arose."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy to get just about anywhere. The area was very quiet and clean. I‚Äôm a huge plant lover so seeing lots of plants for decor was refreshing. The common area (basement) had a TV with 2 washers and 2 dryers which was very convenient. The home was super clean and tidy and I absolutely loved the bed and comforter, sooo comfortable! Only thing I‚Äôd recommend is to get in the building, see which unit you‚Äôre in, and then bring your stuff in as there‚Äôs 4 units in total with stairs. Definitely would recommend staying here. üòä"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Main Street house was a stylish treat for me and my pets. The apartment is casually elegant and brightly inviting. Very clean, with warmn and welcoming staff. Andrew was very kind when I had a hiccup in my day. I wish had time to get to know the area‚Äîthe downtown just up the road looked interesting.

The place in located in the nice neighborhood, with easy parking and cozy atmosphere. Highly recommended!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was in town for a conference and needed something close to EKU. Andrew‚Äôs property was absolutely perfect. It felt both luxurious and cozy‚Äî a well-appointed kitchen and local recommendations made me feel right at home. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I take long weekends at Airbnbs fairly often - this was one of the best we‚Äôve stayed in! Maybe THE best. As soon as we opened the door the mood was set with dimmed lighting and the fireplace was on! That was especially nice considering it was in the teens when we arrived. It felt very much like being at home. Everything was VERY clean and comfortable. The bed was comfy and the bathroom towels were nice as well. The kitchen is stocked very well if you like to cook while you‚Äôre away. It is very close to restaurants and Richmond is a cute town. We will be staying here again for sure.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I've stayed at Airbnbs around the world and am difficult to please. I found Andrew's place to be absolutely FLAWLESS. It's even better than the pictures. Located on the ground floor with just a few steps, checking in to the apartment was easy with the keypad. Gorgeous historic building with midcentury modern d√©cor. Located in a beautiful neighborhood with good sidewalks along Main St to a great coffeeshop and pub. Ample parking in back lot and enormous square footage inside. Staying at Andrew's was one of my best Airbnb experiences. I would love to return."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay. The apartment had everything we needed. We especially liked the fireplace at night.

It felt like a little slice of luxury amidst our otherwise really busy trip. Thank you so much, Andrew!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay and host is very accommodating.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The apartment was really beautiful and actually bigger than it looked in the photos. We only had a quick overnight stay to break up a long road trip, so didn‚Äôt get to settle in and really enjoy all of the amenities, but we would definitely return. The place is beautifully and simply styled, cozy and a step up in thoughtful design. I really loved those details of style. My husband is recovering from total knee replacement surgery, so I was concerned before booking about finding the number of steps up to the various apartments. I was not able to get that information until AFTER booking, as those specific details aren‚Äôt in the descriptions (only states there are stairs to climb, but no details). Fortunately, there are only four steps up at the entrance, and from there no more steps to access this specific ‚Äúground level‚Äù apartment. Worked out great. Just want to mention a couple of the apartments are not ground level and are upstairs on 2nd level, which could be important for some guests to know ahead of time if they have physical limitations. Nice neighborhood. Walkable. Safe. Gorgeous, charming accommodations. Thank you!"

2021-06-01,5,,"This was our second stay with Andrew in the same unit (he has four in the same building). Just like last time, check in was simple and easy. Everything we needed in the kitchen and otherwise was available. The bed was extremely comfortable. It was perfect for us- will mention that if there are mobility challenges there are just a couple stairs to navigate to the front entrance and more at the back. Overall, couldn‚Äôt expect a better experience. We wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay again!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here over Memorial Day weekend for a private off the grid getaway and it was the most relaxing and right at home feel we have ever experienced on any getaway we have taken! The home was extremely clean and cozy, the views were breathtaking, the atmosphere was nothing short of a sense of peacefulness and like all your worries in the world have lifted! It was exactly what we needed and more! They truly cover all the bases when it comes to taking care of their visitors and making sure they have an easy comfortable and private stay with a home away from home feel! Ronald and Phyllis both are very nice people and are quick to respond if you need anything! We locked ourselves out by accident(totally our faults) and they were there within minutes to let us back in. This place is so gorgeous and breathtaking in every way, it truly is a hidden gem and worth staying at! It‚Äôs far away enough to be private and off the map but still close enough to the city for your needs!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful space! It was clean and the pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. It was exactly what I needed for my weekend trip.

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It is such a beautiful, little place to stay. Overall I‚Äôm supremely happy with my stay. The bathroom was the largest, most beautiful bathroom I‚Äôve ever been in. That shower was worth every moment I spent in it. Wow.
The kitchen is rather small and doesn‚Äôt have much space to put meals together.
The laundry room was clean, well put together and large enough to maneuver around.
The bedroom was amazing!!! Large, quiet, doors for every walkway, comfy and super dark. It was so easy to fall asleep.
Parking is abundant and easy.
There is a cat on the property and he was the best thing, other than the bathroom, that this property had to offer. Such a beautiful cat, very friendly.
There are a lot of nice views and green fields for days. There is a small pond that is nice to stare at.
Ronald did not message me and did not respond to my messages. Also, I think I left something there and he won‚Äôt message me to inform me of it. Disappointing host.
All in all, I recommend it."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This guesthouse is very comfortable. The personal touch is found in the rocking recliners, lovely floor rugs to massive TV to the cozy kitchen to the perfect size computer desk to the spacious accesible shower. The modern receesed lighting along with table lamps provides a bright yet cozy feel.
I loved staying here. Don't forget the sunrise view from the patio to start the day. Best of all for my stay was my wonderful host, Phyllis."

The owner is on site in a separate house and very friendly to talk to. The setting is very rural, quiet and I felt comfortable leaving my tools in the bed of my truck. Got a visit from a friendly cat every morning while I put on my shoes outside."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean, quiet, spacious, and simple. My only regret is I didn‚Äôt get to enjoy the place longer. So glad I chose this place rather than a tiny apartment on a busy street in Lexington."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to relax and get away from everything. You can relax and watch a movie on the big screen TV in the living room area. When your ready for bed get ready for an excellent experience sleeping. The bed is wonderful. I have back problems and have difficulty sleeping in beds. But not this one. So, get ready to have a very restful sleep. Wake up and have a nice relaxing shower. The shower is one of my favorite parts of this place. The kitchen area is just enough to have a nice meal. And definitely go outside and enjoy the country air. You can catch some amazing sunsets as you sit and relax out front. Furthermore, if you need anything just message the host. They are amazing people and will be right there to help you with whatever you may need. I felt so comfortable there. I will definitely be returning. This place will not disappoint you. Give it a chance and enjoy."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is the perfect get away. The bed is extremely comfortable. You just melt into it. The living room area has such a warm welcoming feeling. Perfect place to cuddle and watch a movie on the big screen TV. And if you need a roll in shower, you couldn‚Äôt ask for a more perfect shower. To me this place was exceptional. I would rather stay here than a hotel any day. The host made himself available when any issues arose. He was just a text away. I feel very blessed that me and my father got to stay at this cozy retreat. I hope to return in the future."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time meeting our friends here. This location was very conveniently located for all of us - 6 hours for everyone.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perhaps the cleaning place I have stayed. VERY nice and quiet too. The communication with Donald was excellent when I had some additional questions.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful guest house, designed to be extremely handicap accessible, which made it super comfy and roomy when lounging around the house.
Bathroom is fabulous with huge walk in shower with two shower heads, and heated floor. Kitchen has essentials for cooking, and some basic condiments are in the fridge.
Big TV in living room is awesome for movie watching, and smaller bedroom TV is nice for lazy mornings or watching late night TV.
Bed was very comfortable, with great fluffy pillows. Huge closet space, if you need to use it.
Stylishly decorated with simplicity in mind, unique architecture finishes of the space were a wonderful touch.
We will definitely stay again when we are back in town!"

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a beautiful quiet place to base a Kentucky stay, look no further! A super comfortable, pristinely clean private space in the green rolling countryside was just what we'd hoped. Just perfect!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the absolute perfect vacation rental for my family for our week stay! It is classic modern furnished and was way more comfortable and classy than I was expecting for the extremely affordable price. We traveled with our daughter who slept in the living room on a queen pull out couch. She was able to watch Netflix on the large TV. My husband & I had the bedroom and slept so well. It is both quite and the property is picturesque. We were coming from California and our time zone is 3hr behind Kentucky, the blackout curtains were such a blessing. This rental is a hidden gem!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed our stay.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Guest House is a wonderful gem! Roomy and very clean. We loved having the opportunity to relax at the fire pit or hang out inside and watch TV. I would highly recommend the Guest House.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,The house is comfortable and spacious. Well decorated and welcoming. Loved being ‚Äúin the country ‚Äú. Beautiful sunsets. Appreciated that they provided outdoor seating so you could enjoy the scenery. Overall it was an excellent place to stay and I would stay there again. We never met the hosts but hopefully they were enjoying a little vacation!üòä
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely accommodating!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ronald‚Äôs place was a gem! It was about 12 minutes away from EKU. One downer is it‚Äôs not super close to food, but again you‚Äôre about 8-10 minutes away so grab some food as you head in. It‚Äôs was SO CLEAN! The bathroom was awesome! Heated floors a huge shower- also all wheelchair friendly and easy to access. This wasn‚Äôt a need for us but you could tell Ronald takes great pride in this place and clearly planned and intended for guests with varying needs. There were K cups for the coffee maker (also a regular one in the cabinet), basic kitchen needs- oil, salt/pepper. There were plenty of towels and wash cloths. Also, the bed was WONDERFUL! Tempurpedic pillows as well. I was slightly worried about sharing the bed with my daughter but it was so comfortable and all was well!
As this place isn‚Äôt really meant for large groups, you could if needed bring an air mattress for children, plenty of space in the bedroom or in the living room.
Ronald was clear on arrival instructions and even salted and shoveled the driveway and entrance area where we would be. There is also a washer and dryer for a more extended stay.
If my daughter ends up at EKU, we will be keeping this place in our back pocket for our future stays.
We weren‚Äôt able to really look around until we were leaving but it‚Äôs nestled back on their farm so in the spring and summer I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a beautiful sight to see- the rolling hills of Kentucky!
WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was exactly as described, only better! Beautiful space, great host, super comfy! Absolutely would recommend."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sparkling clean and stylish, this place is bigger than it looks! The bed is super comfortable, the TV is awesome, the wifi worked great, and having a washer/dryer on hand was extremely convenient since we ended up stranded for two extra nights due to a winter storm. Our host was kind and understanding and took care of everything we needed right away. Absolutely A++ recommended for comfort, cleanliness, and perfect homey touches. It felt private even though it's close to host's house and the view was gorgeous. Easy to find, the kitchen is well stocked with pans and dishware, and overall we couldn't have been more snug for an unexpected extra-long stay!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, nice & peaceful"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was very clean with a homey atmosphere. Would stay here again!

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The guest house was very lovely and private, Ronald and his wife are very pleasant and welcoming. It‚Äôs a great value for the money and the rural setting was a huge bonus as it gives quiet rest to the soul especially if your seeking for a time to relax and refresh."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place. Within 15 mins of Berea and Richmond. Cozy with ceiling fans to help air flow. Shower is AMAZING!! I appreciate the removable shower head.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful. Clean. Great amenities! So peaceful and quiet!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay from the very beginning was amazing! We were traveling from Pennsylvania so we arrived really late, but Ronald made it super easy leaving the light on for us!
Once we got there, it was easy to find, the house number right on the mailbox and signs back to the guest house. The only issue is be alerted that the turn back to the guest house is a little sharp and you may have to back up once or twice. :)
We unloaded our vehicle and immediately explored the place. It was MUCH LARGER than we expected from the photos and incredibly pleased!
The host gave us permission to meet with two of our friends on Sunday there and give them a small photo shoot on the property. It was absolutely gorgeous!
We very much enjoyed the scenery and watching the cows in the nearby pasture! And the house is in a very convenient location with lots to do around the area.
I could go on and on about the place being beyond our expectations, but I must say- our favorites was the super comfy bed/pillows and the shower!
The entire stay was like being in a 5-star hotel!
Thank you so much Ronald! We hope to stay again if we can return to Kentucky in the future!"

2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This small little guesthouse was perfect for our family vacation and was a great price! Everything from check-in to check-out ran smoothly and everything was so well prepared for our arrival and stay that I didn't need to contact Ronald with any concerns or needs during our entire time there. With how great our stay was, I would have willingly deep cleaned the place myself for him, but he only asked that we put our towels in the hamper. There was plenty of information about what to do in the surrounding areas as well as a binder with important information regarding emergency services, restaurants, and places of interest.
The house was well furnished and had plenty of room. The spacious shower with dual shower heads was by far one of the best parts!
We got to see some cows and a newborn baby calf up close which our two boys loved and we felt like we had plenty of privacy; the space felt like it was completely ours for the time we had it.
I would HIGHLY recommend this air bnb for any trip out this way and will definitely look into visiting again!"

Ronalds's place was so quiet and so stylish. The bed was very comfy, the shower is the best I have ever had. We will definitely stay here again when we go to Fort Boonesborough. And the Kroger 6 miles away has everything you need. This is a very nice place."

Great for multiple families as each floor has a full bath. Up-to-date appliances, simple but comfortable beds (bring your own pillows if you‚Äôre picky), thin floors/walls, VERY hot water. Living room furniture was a little tired, kitchen was very nicely appointed except for the saucepans (just kinda cheap). Bring your own non-stick spray or oil!
Awesome back yard. We didn‚Äôt get to enjoy it due to the nature of our visit, but it would provide for some peaceful evening dining and relaxation!

We were in town for UKs graduation and chose to stay in Richmond to avoid the traffic and congestion of Lexington. In the evenings we enjoyed sitting out under the gazebo and having a crackling fire. It was quiet and peaceful in a lovely neighborhood. The bathrooms are clean and look to be newly renovated with beautiful showers and good water pressure. We didn‚Äôt use the kitchen, but is also newly renovated with a table we used for game playing. We also really appreciated there was very little for us to do at checkout‚Äîother places we‚Äôve stayed charge significant cleaning fees but then require you to do laundry and sheets, etc. Here we straightened up (we weren‚Äôt asked to but that‚Äôs just the polite thing to do) and took out the trash before saying goodbye and heading home. 10/10 recommend this is sweet home."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay at Alex‚Äôs place was warm and felt like home! The amenities were great and the house has everything that was needed. It was a wonderful visit and great place to stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Family-friendly and safe home. My 23-month-old son felt right at home on our arrival. The bassinet Alex/Jordan provided for him was just like the one he had at home and the transition was seamless. My daughters gave a 10,000 star rating of the place and I promised them I was going to include their 10,000 star rating in my review since the maximum rating is typically a five.
Overall we were satisfied with how clean the place was and how clear the information/instruction provided. It was home away from home for us and I guess we will always have a home in Berea when next we visit Kentucky and that will be Alex :)."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was wonderful
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely fantastic stay at the Sapphire Hideaway! The attention to detail in every aspect of the accommodation was impeccable, from the stylish decor to the thoughtful amenities provided. They had really great snacks! The highlight of our stay was the hot tub! Perfectly maintained and positioned to enjoy the breathtaking views, soaking in the hot tub at night under the stars was an unforgettable experience. We brought two rambunctious toddlers with us and they especially were so sad to leave. It was the perfect getaway for families. We couldn't have asked for a better experience.
Highly recommend Alex's property to anyone looking for a five-star getaway!"""

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very close (walking distance) to downtown and the best park ever. Lot‚Äôs of sleeping space and the rooms were very big. Especially great if you are traveling with little ones. The room with the kids loft bed even had toys. The owner thought of everything to make a family trip complete.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was a nice, older house that reminded me of my grandmother's home. It was very clean. Thoughtful touches like coffee, sugar, breakfast bars, and Cascade pods in the kitchen and thoughtful items in the bathroom, like toiletries, if you forgot to bring something was great. The home was just like the pictures. The host was a great communicator. The neighborhood was nice, within walking distance to EKU, and it was easy to drive to shopping and restaurants. The house really met our needs."

No kitchen towels were provided
Other kitchen necessities were available
Sheets on queen sized master were too large, they were probably king sized sheets
Squeaky, soft bed in upstairs bedroom to the right, might need to be replaced
Otherwise, comfortable beds
Nice sleeping loft for a young person"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Me & my family visited for Thanksgiving and this place was just perfect! We loved it & will definitely be staying here every time we visit the area if it‚Äôs available! The home had everything we needed & more! The extra perks like tourist information, toys for the kids, desk for doing a little work‚Ä¶ we had more than we could ask for & felt right at home!

We would definitely stay again! Thank you!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wellington was the perfect stay while visiting my hometown! Normally I stay in a hotel, but this time I wanted something different.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We found our new favorite place to stay in Richmond! The house was so cozy and clean. Love that the location is so close to EKU. Will be booking this house again in the future for all our EKU baseball trips.

Multiple bedrooms.
First floor bedroom and full bathroom were convenient for my senior parents.
While we had full privacy upstair bedrooms and a full bath.
Kitchen, living room, dining room, outdoor seating and fire pit were perfect family rooms for all of us to enjoy together . ‚ù§Ô∏è
We had a fabulous time! Love the artwork too!"

Very comfortable and clean.
We will return and stay longer"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of my best AirBnB experiences
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed having a four bedroom home that we knew would be clean. It gave us plenty of room to spread out. Also, appreciated being able to have my daughter and son in laws dog too! Loved the hardwood floors because of allergy reasons. We were all very comfortable. Would stay here again. Thank you for letting us stay in your comfy home."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, friendly hosts. Needed a 4 bedroom for a golf/bourbon trip and this was perfect. Thank you!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cute house and exactly as pictured. Perfect for our family of 5+ pup. My daughters loved the tree swing and my husband and I loved the walkability. Apollos pizza was great. Wished more was open to explore on Saturday evening-Sunday, but that‚Äôs not the fault of the rental. Perfect place to break up our long drive."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second stay at this location and it was as great as the first.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wellington was an awesome experience. This was my first experience selecting an Airbnb, and I must say everything was absolutely wonderful. The rooms were spacious, and provided a perfect location. My son and granddaughters joined me for part of my stay and the girls loved the ""loft"" bed. My son was happy with the accomodations as well. I do plan to come back next year. I was amazed at the accessibility for my other son who is disabled. He will be here next year. The amount I paid was within my price range, which was wonderful.
Thank you Lisa and Harold for the opportunity to stay in this lovely home."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed at the Wellington home for one night on a long road trip with my brother, 2 kids, and 2 dogs. I was so relieved the house was easy to find, looked just like the pictures, was incredibly clean, and super comfortable. As a bonus, it was close to various food options (we went with Apollo‚Äôs for pizza and Purdy‚Äôs for morning coffee). I‚Äôd definitely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a nice place in a central location. I will stay with them again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Wellington has become our home away from home. Great backyard. Great family reunion venue. Looking forward to our next visit.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa‚Äôs home was lovely‚Äîcolor scheme, furniture, manicured yard were all attractive. The floor plan was well thought out and everything was labeled in the kitchen (and beyond) for easy reference. There were enough towels provided for our group of four to use and enough coffee, tea, etc in the kitchen to enjoy each morning.
I appreciated having a fully stocked kitchen in terms of dishes , glassware, etc. It made it convenient to order delivery & eat in from one of the many nearby restaurants.
Lisa‚Äôs place was also so truly walkable-to RAAC where our mtgs were held as well as restaurants and coffee shops!
We were in town for business purposes: having space in the dining room to plan, comfy seating at the back patio to start or end our day, and the bonus of the fire pit-complete with supplies, made it easy to unwind.
Lisa (owner) and Harold (local co-host) were timely in their responses to any questions I had.
This listing was reasonably priced & perfect for my group‚Äôs needs."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,To say I was pleased would be an understatement. We loved Wellington and the house was just so cute. I was apprehensive at first with it being in a neighborhood but it was peaceful and we weren't disturbed at all. It was close to some main streets which made it easy to get around Richmond. We visited Purdy's coffee a couple of times which is just a block and a half away and had pizza from Apollos. You have to get their pizza. It was awesome. I would highly recommend Wellington for your next stay in Richmond!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome little house...very clean, beautiful landscaping & felt like a very safe, older neighborhood...within walking distance of downtown Richmond, good pizza, a ""home-cooking"" restaurant & an awesome coffee shop! I will definitely be back!"

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Great for families!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cute little place, very close to EKU. Nice little backyard with rope swing and fire pit. Honestly it was even better in person and had even more rooms and beds than I thought. Perfect place to stay the night for a concert. I called the bunk bed!!! Haha!!!Thanks a bunch!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We love staying at AirBNBs for the no place like home experiences. This one was point on! Comfortable bed, very clean, friendly, cozy, responsive, good location, quiet neighborhood, great parking spot in front of house, easy door locks, nice appliances, great internet connection, basically everything you could want! We loved this home and will be back. Thanks so much for sharing your home!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wellington was absolutely wonderful! We really enjoyed our stay and felt right at home. Lisa‚Äôs place was very clean, had comfortable furnishings, and was appointed with many thoughtful extras throughout the house. The decor was lovely and very pleasant. We were in town to visit our son at EKU, the airplane themed bedroom was perfect for him (he‚Äôs a flight student), it was walking distance to the campus, and about a 30 minute drive to Lexington where we also did campus tours for our other son at UK. Our poodle also enjoyed walks to the nearby park. We hope this adorable home will be available the next time we visit our son. Thank you for creating such a sweet place to stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wellington was a fantastic place to stay! My folks and I enjoyed our stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Super clean. Comfortable with everything you need. A+ for coffee.

Thank you for all the effort you put in to this home.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cozy, southern home in the heart of Richmond. Walkable to restaurants, bars and campus. It was the perfect place for our family to stay while visiting our EKU student."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect except the remote for the master bedroom TV was missing so couldn‚Äôt watch TV in there. Only suggestion would be to make sure all remotes are available before guests arrive. All rooms were very clean and nicely decorated. Firewood was already in the fire-pit and even a duraflame log was provided. Lots of nice touches and good parking! Thank you for the hospitality! Would stay here again if they find that remote. üòÅThank you Lisa and Harold.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Party of six all ages loved it. So many nice touches and attention to detail. Cozy and comfortable!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay at Wellington. The home was super clean, comfortable and homey. We hope to visit again in the future. Our hosts were always quick to respond and answer any questions we had."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a short stay on our way home from Florida. The location is great for that, very close to I75. I think it would also be great for anyone visiting the university or university students. We walked into town and ate at the local Irish pub. The home itself was very 'homey' and clean. We'd stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is impeccably clean and comfortable. All the comforts of home. Comfortable beds, extra blankets. Well-stocked coffee bar! Comfortable furnishings. Bright cozy interior. Easy parking. Hosts are extremely responsive and flexible (our flight time got us arriving about 45 minutes before check-in and we were accommodated with early check-in without any problem). Upstairs bathtub drained pretty slowly, and host offered to send someone to fix it immediately. Very close to EKU and cute downtown. Host provided brochures of the city. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a super cute home. Loved all the special touches. Very comfortable. Close to EKU and the quaint downtown area.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just a quick overnight for a work event at the University. Great location close to campus. Comfy beds, and plenty of room.
There were three of us (each had their own room), so a great value. Love having the whole house. Host is informative and non-invasive."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I have stayed at this house. It is charming, well kept, and in a great location. Close to downtown Richmond and EKU. I will continue to stay here when I return to Richmond."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very comfortable and clean and had all the amenities we needed. It is on a pretty, quiet street and is walkable to a few restaurants and lots of parks. It was too cold to enjoy the back yard, but that will definitely be a big plus for anyone visiting in warmer months. Lisa was very responsive to questions and friendly. It was just my sister and me in the house, but there is room for lots more without it feeling crowded. We hope to be able to stay again next time we are visiting our mom in Richmond."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, host very responsive and accommodating!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Wellington was one of our favorite stays in the last few years. Everything was better than it looked in the listing. The kitchen was well stocked, nice appliances, really nice bathrooms, nicer than most, and the beds were super comfortable. Sqeeky clean house. The downtown area was less than a ten minute walk. I could go on and on about how great this Airbnb is. I recommend this over any other place in the area for sure. Lisa was very accommodating and quick to respond. 11 stars for her. Thanks for an outstanding stay!!!"

A great selection of complimentary pods were available so there was something for everyone."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Wellington. The house is as described. Great location close to everything. The host was quick with communication and very accommodating when we had changes in our plans. Would recommend, and will stay at Wellington again."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wellington was everything that was portrayed. Fantastic location! The toddler toys provided were a big hit with our grandson. We would definitely stay there again.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place. Great location. You will feel right at home. Be sure to eat at Jackson‚Äôs. A very short walk.
2022-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The space was fine. We chose this space because of the number of travelers we had that would want a room to themselves. The biggest reason I cant give 5 stars is because there was old coffee in the pot upon arrival and the trash outside was so full that animals were eating from it each night. When I messaged the host about these two issues I received no reply. Another thing guests should be aware of is the house next door is undergoing construction and the workers were there from around 8am to as late as 11pm. While the hosts have no way of controlling this, I have been contacted by other hosts in the past and been given a heads up. The house was clean and check in was easy. Overall our stay wasn't awful but it wasn't great either. The price for the number of rooms/beds was reasonable."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"This adorable house held our group so well! The hostess has thought of lots of little things that you might need, which helps as stuff comes up! Our bed was comfortable and nice sized, there were blankets and fans for different temperature preferences, both bathrooms are clean and well-appointed, coffee bar was ready for our coffee addict. It was just a lovely home and we enjoyed our time there! Also, super close to EKU meant I got more sleep before our 7:30 AM start. üôÇ"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home, close to plenty of restaurants, shopping and fun things to do. Tons of space for a family with a nice backyard fire pit. Comfy furniture and beds and a great kitchen. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"9 Wellington Court is a cute, clean, well maintained home in a wonderful location. Something that we were not aware of until our arrival, was that the washer and dryer are only accessible to those staying 4 nights or longer. We stayed 3 nights, but had traveled to Mammoth Cave KY from OH 4 days prior, working our way back to OH and planned on washing some clothes. Our hosts did grant us access to the basement to use the washer and dryer after contacting them, which also came in handy since there was severe weather and tornado sirens going off during our stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is very clean (first priority) and thoughtfully set up for guests. It is a cozy older home with comfortable furniture and lots of room. The long sofa table in the entrance is a great idea - so helpful to have a place to put important belongings. The kitchen is great - even coffee provided! This owner cares.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely top notch! Would absolutely stay again
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"A lovely, clean and well-appointed home just a couple blocks from restaurants and cafes. The owners were very responsive and helpful."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Wellington was a perfect stop for us on our drive to my parents‚Äô house. We appreciated that we were able to book just hours before we checked in and that there were toys for our toddler! We loved being close to campus and to Purdy‚Äôs Coffee. If we ever need to stay in Richmond again, we will choose the Wellington!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really nice home. Lot of rooms and features
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay at!

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home with tons of unique elements only an older house can bring! My little cousin loved exploring all of the nooks and crannies! And Lisa deserves an award for answering her phone so late at night and making sure we were taken care of!!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had an excellent time at Lisa's place. Was the perfect place to relax and still be close to everything in Richmond. Thanks!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's house is a warm and inviting place with many added touches (window birdfeeder) to make you feel at home. Lisa was very accommodating and had great communication with us throughout our stay. The beds are very comfortable, the bathroom is stocked with just about every necessity (hydrogen peroxide, Band-Aids, Q-Tips) as is the kitchen with cookware and utensils. There are many windows in the house that allow an abundance of natural light to flow through. Quick walk to local parks, restaurants, downtown and EKU's campus. I hope Lisa will allow us to stay again when the need arises."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Wellington is a great home in a great location.
This is how an Airbnb should be. It is cozy, clean and homey. The home is a cape cod style, very comfortable, well furnished and inviting. The kitchen has everything you would want or need to stay and enjoy cooking and serving for four to six people. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are great. The host has gone the extra mile to make guests feel welcome and providing: a guest book; a household guide; local menus; brochures from local attractions and free coffee service. Our family loved it and will return."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice place. Clean with good amenities. Nice location close to downtown, campus, and a good park for kids. We had a nice time staying here."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,We had a great weekend. This is a wonderful place to stay. It is close to EKU. The beds are comfortable. A very homey space. The games and puzzles in the cupboard were a big hit. The layout of the house was great for people doing different things and still being able to hold conversations. I would recommend Wellington to couples or a family.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a cute and comfortable house! We stayed here while working in town and it was absolutely perfect!! Will definitely stay here again if it is available.

Cute decor and sweet touches such as a welcoming candy dish, assortment of teas/coffees, and 2 lap throws in the living room. Loved sitting on the front porch in the evenings and the deck for morning coffee. Quiet neighborhood. It is a wonderful place! Hoping to return in the Fall!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay in Richmond. Convenient location to stores and restaurants. Clean and cozy. Family of five for wedding weekend and plenty of space for everyone.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stellar experience in this charming and spacious home! A last minute change of plans had us looking to accommodate the Holiday weekend with my sister and her family while closing on a home in Lexington. Hosts were extremely accommodating, excellent communication and the home was perfectly as described. Highly recommended!"
2021-05-01,2,Stayed about a week,"Rather than draw any conclusions about the stay, I‚Äôll just describe the events that took place during our stay exactly as they happened and let users decide for themselves.
1. At 8:50 PM the night before we arrived, the host called us and left a voicemail stating that a concrete driveway and front porch was going to be poured and installed while we were there. She wasn‚Äôt asking if this was ok; she basically just told us it was happening. This was problematic for us for two reasons: 1) we have an 18 month old and needed the house to be quiet in the morning and while she napped, and 2) I planned to work all day during our stay and needed the house to be quiet. Of course, the house was not quiet during this construction. Construction began at 8:00 AM and extended into the early afternoon for several days.
2. On Day 1, we found that the windows in the bedrooms had bugs on them. We informed the host. She said she would tell her cleaning staff to do a better job next time.
3. On Day 2, we discovered that the property was infested with ants. I took numerous pictures. We contacted the host and let her know. She offered to have an exterminator come while we were staying there. We told her that we did not want anyone applying chemicals while we were staying there, especially because we had a baby with us. Instead, the host agreed to give us a discount for the ants and concrete noise. That discount was never paid to us. After we informed the host about the ants, her property manager arrived unannounced to put out small Terro ant traps. The property manager indicated that she was aware there were ants at the property.
4. For the next few days, people arrived randomly at the house to do maintenance. One day, a man showed up and entered the basement from the outside, unannounced. He started drilling and making noise while I was trying to work. I went down and asked him what he was doing. He said he was installing curtains in the basement, which was odd, since the host does not give guests access to the basement. We asked the host why someone was there in the basement. She claimed that no one was there. My wife sent her a picture of the man‚Äôs car showing that he was there. On another day, the host randomly texted us telling us that people would be coming by to install cameras outside. Overall, it felt like the host didn‚Äôt really care about making our stay quiet and comfortable; she continued maintenance at the property as if we weren‚Äôt there.
5. Halfway through our stay, we found a roach near where our daughter had been sleeping. I took pictures. We decided that at that point, we had had enough and checked out.
6. We contacted the host and informed her that we would be checking out early. We also asked for a refund. She denied the refund, but said she would credit us if she was able to rebook the property for the remaining portion of our stay. The next day, she refunded us for the nights we did not stay there. We never received the discount for the ants and concrete.
7. One final note: The house is very, very old and creaky. The upstairs got extremely hot, even with the window A/C unit running. This is a problem in the spring/summer."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an ideal location if you want to be near some fun little towns but really be in the countryside. The barn is renovated and spacious and there is a great view both in the back and the front. We enjoyed seeing deer nearby in the evenings and wild turkeys in the mornings. The kitchen is fairly well equipped for basic cooking. We brought our own food and only ate out once in four days. The wifi is pretty weak, so don‚Äôt plan on steaming anything like Netflix or Amazon Prime on your computer. If you like a firm mattress, you won‚Äôt sleep well. The bed is creaky and bouncy and the mattress sags. Despite not sleeping the best at night, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Check in couldn‚Äôt be any easier. Directions are spot on. The pics don‚Äôt do this little country oasis justice. Everything was so clean and up to date. Also just a quick 15 min drive to Berea or Richmond. We ventured into Berea and explored the Pinnacles‚Ä¶lots of hiking options. We also checked out the local farmers market‚Ä¶def worth the stop! My favorite thing is the screened in porch off the bedroom‚Ä¶great place to sit in the evenings or enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a very beautiful location and nice and quiet. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it. Perfect for a get away! Only 15 minutes from downtown Berea as well!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I chose this property for it‚Äôs location (very close to event we participated in). I was blown away by it‚Äôs overall feel. The pictures does not do it justice.

There is a work station that worked out Great for my husband that had some work responsibilities he had to get done.

The host went out of his way to work with us when we had to cancel a previous trip, and then to reaccomodate us for a trip for a memorial service. That extra level of kindness meant the world to us during a stressful time. We would 100% stay here again."

The decorations were so detailed and made you feel right at home, there was a throw blanket for every room, snacks, waiting for us in the kitchen, water bottles in the fridge, and complete coffee bar. The beds were so comfortable, each bedroom had a sound machine, and fan. Our kids loved the play area downstairs! There is shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the showers- she did not miss any detail! During our stay, we walked to insomnia, cookies, and dreaming Creek brewery.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All I can say is that Harold's Airbnb felt like I never left home. Very spacious, stocked with breakfast item, coffee, spices, water, juice and other food items. These items were great since you don't go to the grocery store right away. Plenty of room for me, my husband, my daughter that visited us while we were there and 3 dogs. Very quiet outside of traffic and you really didn't hear that often. This is a great place to stay as we will be staying again in the future since our daughter attends Eastern Kentucy University.

The driveway leads to the back of the house keeping your car more secured, rather then being out in some parking lot or street.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Harold's home is a wonderful place to stay. We had 4 adults and a 7 year old and there was plenty of space for everyone to spread out or be together. Harold provided so many wonderful snacks and a variety of foods for breakfast. He even added the kind of bread we liked and bananas and eggs. There were plenty of pans, plates, utensils, etc. for us to cook our own dinner there. He said to feel free to use and eat anything in the kitchen! He had small bottles of OJ and Starbucks Frappachino, and bottles of water. Our grandson loved sleeping on the futon and the fact that there was a tv ""for him"" there!. There is also a tv in the bigger bedroom. We didn't get to enjoy the outside but there is a nice bench swing in a side porch. His house was really clean and homey. Besides a dining room with table and chairs, there is a small table in a nook off the kitchen with 4 chairs, and nice for breakfast. There were just so many great things about this place. The only things to be aware of are that the driveway can be difficult to find in the dark and that the space between a corner of the house and a metal fence pole is narrow and you just have to be careful when pulling to the back of the house. But our daughter handled our big car well! We did not get to visit Richmond as we were visiting our grandson at Berea College. Harold's house is only about
15-20 minutes away, and mostly on Route 75, so fairly convenient. Harold answered each of my messages within an hour of me sending each one, which was great! We highly recommend Harold's house and hope to stay there again when we visit our grandson next time. He really is a Super Host!"

But we were really pleased to find Harold's listing, and even happier on arrival. The house was spotless, and big enough for us to spread out and relax. We'll definitely look to stay here when we return to Richmond, and wish we could have stayed longer. And it was so incredibly nice to have a few goodies in the kitchen so we didn't have to immediately run out and find a grocery store. Of all the many AirBnB's we have stayed at, this is definitely one of the very best. Thanks, Harold!"

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We stayed in Richmond for our daughter graduation from EKU. We had family come into town to join (they stayed at local hotels) and this was the perfect landing place for people to gather and hang out. The home was so comfortable. The kitchen was nearly perfect for all of the cooking we did ‚Äîwe served four meals to all the family‚Äîthe host even bought a new crockpot to accommodate us! By far one of the best homes we have stayed in over the last several years! Honestly couldn‚Äôt name anything that needed to be changed about this home!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Samantha‚Äôs place was perfect for our week long stay. We planned our trip late so most places in Lexington were booked for the 3 day event which led to us booking her space in Richmond, the drive was not bad and our entire party agrees that the house itself is very worth the slightly longer drive. The host was very responsive and when there was a small inconvenience, they came and fixed within an hour of us communicating it. We hope to be back!"

Five hearty stars!"

Spotless linens, pristine decor, and impeccable trim and moldings made the space feel newly renovated. All the pillows and couches and chairs were clean and not worn and really lovely. The proximity to the university and a park, along with a dog-friendly policy, added to the appeal. Samantha was an outstanding host‚Äîfriendly and attentive. We especially appreciated the full control over the home‚Äôs temperature during the chilly weather. The kitchen was well-equipped with high-quality amenities, adding to a comfortable and memorable experience.

Eventhough it was just 2 of us, it would be a perfect place for a family to stay. Each bedroom had its own bathroom. The kitchen was huge. We will definitely seek this house out again when we visit our daughter."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was incredibly clean and welcoming. Tastefully decorated. Beds were comfortable. Little touches everywhere (like small fan available for background noise in the bedroom and snack at the entry). Property was beautiful and back deck amazing place for a night cap or morning cup of coffee
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the house is amazing.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to land while in Richmond visiting with our daughter at EKU. This was graduation and move out weekend and the house and hostesses made everything so much easier on us to stay in town instead of trying to do everything at once. We loved the respite
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at John & Davida‚Äôs home. It was very spacious, clean, and comfortable. The views from the kitchen area and back deck were beautiful!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"we were welcomed with warmth and hospitality that made us feel right at home. The attention to detail in the accommodations, along with your thoughtful gestures, truly made our stay memorable"

2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"The house was very clean, the neighborhood was peaceful and private but with several stores and restaurants near by. The Host was friendly, helpful and responsive. The value was excellent. The sheets were incredibly soft and smelled fresh. My only complaint would be the mattress was bit too soft for my taste. Would stay again"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you We enjoyed our stay
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,This was the perfect location for us to visit Richmond. The house was spotless and very inviting with a lot of extras that you don't usually find at AirB&Bs. Having access to outdoor space was a huge bonus. I would highly recommend a stay at John and Davida's!!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great stay. Lots of room and a beautiful view.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a lovely stay and felt right at home! We loved how close it was to the EKU Center for the Arts.

Updated kitchen and a play room our granddaughter loved. It had all the little touches and amenities needed for travelers. We didn't spend much time there but would definitely stay again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an awesome place to stay. We found the house clean, comfortable, well stocked, and very nice. The hosts live on the bottom level, but we never heard anything. It was as if the whole place was ours. We hope to stay there the next time we travel to SC."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Have stayed a few times only for the night. Perfect place to stay . Easy to find and get in and out. Inside is pristine and everything you need is available.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"While we only stayed 1 night, John & Davida‚Äôs place was everything as advertised and their proactive & responsive communication was awesome. The couple that we travelled with could not believe how low the price was relative to the overall quality of this Airbnb. Its location, close to I-75, just provided the finishing touches on what was a great stay for us."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Second time staying, holds the whole dang crew very comfortably. Perfect for the local family to come visit while we stay. Thanks again!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,My family and I were driving from Chicago to Gatlinburg TN and needed a place to stay overnight. We thought finding a hotel near Richmond wouldn't be too difficult but apparently everything was booked. We found John & Davida's place and didn't know if we'd be able to book it since it was already after 9pm on the evening that we needed the place. Within a minute or so of reserving the space I received a message from John & Davida. They we quick to communicate and their home was in perfect condition and ready for my family to use in very short notice. I would highly recommend their home to anyone!!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The hosts were so kind and generous even when it became apparent that I messed up the reservation. Their flexibility was so appreciated. The home was comfy and perfect for families with small kids.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Best Hosts! Very family friendly atmosphere
2024-03-01,4,Group trip,This is a cute and quaint house just far enough from the hustle and bustle of campus. It has nice outdoor seating and plenty of cozy spots to sit and hang out with friends.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a great place and location. An addition of laundry would be nice.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my second time staying there and I‚Äôll definitely stay there again, if it‚Äôs available, whenever I come to Richmond. (About every 4-8 weeks or so to visit my son, daughter-in-law and baby granddaughter). The house is beautiful and very clean. Even though John and Davida live downstairs, you wouldn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre there unless you need them. They‚Äôre very responsive and friendly with the check-in and check-out. I didn‚Äôt need a thing because everything was perfect, but it‚Äôs good to know they‚Äôre there. The back deck is peaceful and very relaxing. The house is bigger and more accommodating than my son‚Äôs, so we tend to hangout there instead of his house. We all love being at the house and everyone is amazed at how nice it is."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home! Will definitely be booking again! Very responsive & friendly host! The peace is impeccable! Kid friendly/ Baby proof home üòÑ

It was the perfect place to stretch out and relax on our way down to Florida from the north.
Our 2 year old grandson especially loved the playroom and it certainly helped him release some of his energy:)
We found this home very clean and super comfortable.
I would happily stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice cozy peaceful stay as usual
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean room, beautiful scenary from the back yard."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We only stayed overnight but wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer with how nice it was. Even with the short stay the amount of fun my toddler had in the toddler room was well worth it!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at John and Davida‚Äôs! It was beautiful and very clean. The little signs with additional instructions throughout the house were very helpful. Parking out front was very convenient and the deck in the back was perfect for the smoker in the family. The decor was very pretty and made it feel like home. We visit Richmond often because our son, daughter in law and 1 year old granddaughter live here. We were there this time for her first birthday. The playroom was an added bonus, along with the travel crib since whenever we‚Äôre in town, she gets to have sleepovers with grandma and grandpa. We would definitely stay here again‚Ä¶hopefully very soon and for longer than just a weekend. Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in for a week long training. John and David‚Äôs home was conveniently located to the training, some restaurants, and shopping. We‚Äôll be back if we have another training in the area."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really beautiful place! Would highly recommend if you have kids! Free of clutter and a great play room. If staying for a longer stay was alittle hard without a washer and dryer. Overall a great stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We continue to return to this home. We stop four times each year on our way back to visit family and friends. This home is comfy, beautifully decorated too."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very nice and comfortable home. Larger than we expected. Very comfortable beds and very well kept.
The house does sit very close to the road and you could hear the traffic but it did die down later in the night."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great short stay at John and Davida's place and would gladly stay again! Our kids were delighted with the kid room, with all the books and toys and accommodations just for them. Great renovated kitchen, comfy beds, and love the darkening curtains! The home is on a busy road, but it wasn't a problem for us at all."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful house with all the comforts, huge and spacious, but also cozy and well organized. We will be happy to host our wonderful hosts again."

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We felt right at home at John and Davida‚Äôs. The house was perfect for our family of 6. We got in late, check in was very smooth and so was check out. Close to the highway. Great find!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"this property is perfect. home away from home. It was cozy, clean, and perfectly decorated. The beds and linens were very comfortable.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We reserved at very short notice due to a bad experience at a different location. This spot was a huge blessing to us. The playroom for the kids was amazing, the sleeping arrangements were fantastic, this was just a great experience overall. A really flexible space that would be great for families, but also couples or individuals."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just a few minutes out of town. Felt right at home. Perfect for a weekend trip with my sisters to visit our Mom! We had an early Thanksgiving dinner together.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to land for an overnight while traveling with others. Crazy convenient to Interstate 75, five minutes from the sprawl, yet privately offset on a serene, lovely property within driving distance to some gorgeous KY natural treasures. The large, extremely clean living space, two large, equally well-appointed bedrooms and full baths make traveling with another adult couple uncomplicated. The circle drive close to the entrance handles unloading/loading two cars effortlessly. And it impressed my world traveler, air bnb-guru sister, so high praise indeed!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Host was friendly and responsive to messages. We would book with them again. Highly recommend.

Our whole family slept like babies and felt very comfortable in the home right away. The kitchen was stocked with all the basics and there were plenty of extra linens including super soft blankets. Probably the comfiest mattress I‚Äôve experienced in an Airbnb to date. Communication was quick and clear. It‚Äôs obvious why they have so many great reviews - and we‚Äôre happy to add yet another! Thank you!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"John & Davida's place was stellar, especially for the price!

The house was perfect otherwise and we were very comfortable. Would recommend to anyone visiting central KY."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Everything was as described and met the needs of my family for night we stayed. I would come back again if I am in the area!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location- very close to EKU. House was clean and comfortable for two couples traveling together. Kitchen is currently unusable due to a remodel, but we had access to a kitchenette downstairs. Hosts were clear in communication. We would stay here again."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home was close to food, the interstate, Walmart, and the hospital, which we unfortunately had to use. The hosts were quick to respond, and we loved the home. I would love to stay again when passing through!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids aged 7yo, 5yo, 7 mos) needed a place to stay for 1 night to take a break from a long family roadtrip(Michigan to Georgia). We prefer to stay in airbnb's over hotels for the extra space and the kitchen due to food allergies for 1 member of the family which makes eating out at restaurants difficult. A day before check-in John and Davida communicated that the kitchen wouldn't have a sink or countertops due to some recent repairs that needed to be made and opened access to the lower portion of the house to us. That was kind of them, but I'm glad it was only for 1 night and essentially 1 meal as it was tricky going between the upper and lower level to gather and make everything for a meal. Once the kitchen is complete, it would be perfect. The rest of the house was very nice. Our kids loved the playroom and we had a hard time getting them to leave. The view from the back deck is lovely and we enjoyed watching lightning bugs at night."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"WOW! Stunning backyard views. We felt like our stay was the ultimate Airbnb experience. It felt like we were right at home. It was set up properly and professionally for an Airbnb and had lots of little things that make it nice when you‚Äôre away from home. Lots of space, comfortable bed, gorgeous deck, kids loved the toys. Nice pack n play. Host communicates promptly and transparently and is kind. It was just a few minutes away from the freeway. Even with the kitchen renovation, we had everything we needed with the mini kitchen they set up in the basement. We would definitely stay here again if our travels brought us to the city. Thanks for the safe and comfortable stay!"

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Our stay was great! There had been some work done on the house that limited access to the kitchen however they offered us the additional floor of the home so we could cook and have some extra room. They were also nice enough to let us enjoy the hot tub downstairs. Overall very relaxing and clean space.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was very well organised house. I loved the back scenario. It would be great after completing the top floor kitchen. However, they informed us about this before going there, and they offered downstairs kitchen and living room. We enjoyed staying there."

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place and great people!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,This property exceeded my expectations. The location was great! We had 6 of us traveling together to visit family in Richmond Kentucky. There was plenty of room for all of us. The outside space was beautiful with a huge deck and the host provided an outdoor grill which we used to cook all of our meals. The communication with the host was great making the entire Airbnb experience run smoothly. We will definitely try to stay here again if it is available!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"John & Davida‚Äôs home was a lovely place to stay. It had a great outdoor space and the hosts were responsive and accommodating.
Will definitely seek out this spot when we return to the area!"

You made our stay most delightful.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John and Davida were fantastic, attentive, lovely hosts who took great pains to ensure that our stay was absolutely as smooth as can be.

Would highly recommend to anyone!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and very responsive and helpful hosts!!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location. Beautiful view behind the house. Right near highway and lots to do. Place was clean. The hosts communicated well after we purchased. The price was excellent. I do think the price was dropped due to the kitchen and kids room being under floor construction which was fine with us . That was not communicated prior to purchasing but the host made up for this by making the lower level completely available to us (without us asking) and made the bedroom up for us since we needed the room. We had the whole place for ourselves. It ended up being perfect for what we needed. Would stay again. Great for families.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We specifically booked this airbnb due to needing 3 bedrooms, kitchen, and the incredible play room. Unfortunately, there had been a recent flood from the ice maker so we were unable to use the kitchen and playroom; however, Davida and John communicated this to us prior to arrival but after booking and ameliorated the issue by allowing us use of the basement for extra space and use of the kitchenette. They were very quick to communicate, were honest and extremely accommodating, and kept the place safe for our 3 small children by putting up baby gates and locking the playroom. They left some toys/books out for our kids and toddler bed which were all much appreciated. I highly recommend staying here and would definitely stay again! No musty smell or mold at all."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The house was amazing, it looked exactly like in the photos. Despite the inconveniences that arose in the house, the host did everything to make us feel comfortable. The house was clean and had everything we needed! The host communicated with us and advised us on everything right away. üòä"

Our stay was great! You can really tell this place is very well taken care of."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you have a family (especially with a small child), this is the spot to settle down and feel right at home. The location is extremely convenient to lots of shopping, dining and the Interstate. Everything that the listing says it is... It is. If you have reservations about sharing a structure with the hosts, this place is very well configured to separate the hosts living space from the guest areas and it is no different than if you had an entire single-story home completely to yourself.
Thank you for a great experience and we will be back in the future."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"WOW! Great house, fabulous hosts, and the value is amazing!!

The home was perfect for my toddlers- they enjoyed the playroom and I enjoyed not having to ‚Äúbaby proof‚Äù the house before letting them explore the space. There was a great playground about 15 minutes away that we visited as well. Highly recommend for families with young children!

Comfy beds, a deck, great kitchen and bathrooms too plus a room for little kida to play. It's perfect for us. Plus the owners respond quickly and let us know any issues before we go.
