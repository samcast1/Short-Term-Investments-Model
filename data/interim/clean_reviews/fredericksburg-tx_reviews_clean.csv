2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House provided everything we were looking for. Great location to downtown.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Jennifer's house was in the perfect location for our experience - we walked to most shops and restaurants in town. The house was beautiful to stay in and well equipped for our girls weekend (6 women). The furniture and beds were comfortable, the house was well lit, and super clean and had odds and ends for cooking. They only had enough dinner plates and glasses for 6 - so serious about 6 guests maximum. One full bath is en suite and one is off the dining area. Great air conditioning - super important in the summer heat, especially for those who slept in the loft. We would stay here again - we thought it was very reasonably priced considering the location, convenience, and accomodations.
One call-out: The house address has ""East"" in front of the street name; be sure you plug that into your GPS or you may end up at the same house number on the West side knocking on the wrong home's door. That is not on the homeowner, but it happened to us so it could happen to others."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay in Fredericksburg! It is so close to everything but also very quiet. The accommodations are excellent. Nice amount of space and the mattresses in the bedrooms downstairs were very comfortable. (We did not use the beds upstairs because we only had 3 people). The bedrooms are very roomy and the bathrooms are large and were spotless.
Thank you Jennifer for providing such a nice house.

2023-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,The location was great! The house was nicely decorated. It was clean and well stocked. One negative was the second floor being unsafe because of the low ceilings. There should have been a warning of low ceiling. Another negative was the coffee pot would barely drip. After we called they worked on it and it was better the next day. We would have preferred a Keurig. The owners were responsive and easy to contact. It was an overall good experience.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a super cute house and very convenient for walking to Main Street. There is an issue with the temperature control in the house. The living room and loft do not have adequate airflow and temperature control. There are no hangers in the house and in the 2nd bedroom, there is not a dresser or place to unpack. The coffee maker took a couple of hours to make coffee. We called and let a message, but we didn’t get a reply, even by the 3rd day when we left. Hopefully, they will get some of these issues resolved and then it would be a fantastic place to stay."

You won’t be disappointed!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was PERFECT! It is gorgeous and the perfect location for town. The only complaint I have is the AC is apparently on a timer and takes a while to cool but once it starts working it works great. Make sure the fans are on in the bedrooms. Other than that, perfect spot. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"The location is AMAZING! A short walk to Main St. - close by to a coffee shop, tons of shopping, and great restaurants.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at this property was a lovely experience. My mom and I visited Fredericksburg for a fun mother/daughter trip. As soon as we walked into this property, we literally were giddy. It has so much original character (original colorful tiles around fireplace, old fashioned telephone still on the wall, etc.) but looks like Chip and Joanna Gaines remodeled it. We had so much space and it was a restful getaway from my busy home life with little kids. We also really enjoyed happy hours in the evening and coffee in the morning in the back yard. The location is great for walking to shopping and restaurants. I would recommend this property to anyone!"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,It was a pleasure to stay at Jennifer's home. The check in and out was incredibly simple and the location simply cannot be beat.

The aesthetic is fantastic and furniture, beds, etc were all comfortable. I will say in temps where youll have to use AC/Heater on full blast (ex it was super cold when we went) the bedroom upstairs gets insanely hot but other than that everything was comfortable. Fun fire pit too!"

We were able to cook a fabulous dinner in kitchen. It’s obviously been remodeled recently and was a real treat to cook in. They also provided coffee grounds in the house from the local coffee shop and it was delicious.
The backyard was perfect for our morning coffee on the patio and even had a tv outdoors. All TVs were set up with roku devices and several streaming services were available. We were able to listen to music through the TVs in all rooms while we were enjoying th house.
The bathrooms and bedrooms were very spacious and gave us plenty of room to get ready and not feel like we were on top of each other.
We loved how close it was to Main Street! Such an easy walk to the shops, restaurants and the 290 wine shuttle, so we didn’t have to drive all weekend.
The communication with the owner and property manager was great and made check in and check out extremely easy. We will definitely be back and plan to stay here again."

The bedrooms and kitchen are spacious. The living room and loft are cozy. The bathrooms are luxurious. This home is a traditional Fredericksburg “Sunday House” with all the modern conveniences we needed, including a washer and dryer and good internet. My kids were delighted to discover that one of the municipal swimming pools was a very short walk away. We will book this property again if we have the opportunity."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay at here at Jennifer's place was perfect for us! We needed a place to evaluate Fredericksburg because we were thinking of moving here for our family. The place was close to everything which is one of the reasons why we wanted to move here.
The best thing about this home is the kitchen and the cozy, clean bedrooms. While the home kept it's charm, the kitchen was clean, uncluttered, modern and white. The dining table us large enough for our large family.
Oh, and the chandelier was charming and bright for the living area with a very comfortable couch!
Great stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was perfect for our trip to Fredericksburg! It was a beautiful home with a great location. It is spacious and also thoughtfully set up, providing everything we needed! You can’t beat the location with the ability to walk to all of the shops on Main Street and a close walk to our favorite place - Otto’s. You can tell the hosts put attention in care in to making a great experience for their guests. We will be back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment you walk in, the house feels like a warm hug. The thoughtful placement of cool white furniture, with warm wood tables and matte gold fixtures was a perfect pairing.
And the bed. So comfortable that I peeked at the make so I could buy one.
The location is perfect, near to Main street (2 blocks) so easy to walk to shops and restaurants. And then the outdoor patio and firepit area was perfect for star gazing or watching your favorite show on tv.
Love this place and would book again in a heartbeat."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a fabulous stay at Jennifer’s house. The house is beautiful, clean, and communication with her was great.

We hope to get lucky enough to stay here again on our next stay in Fredericksburg!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"This is a beautiful, comfortable home close to the heart of town. We enjoyed our stay here and will definitely stay here again when we visit Fredericksburg. Jennifer was helpful and quick to answer all of our questions. I would recommend this home to anyone."

it would be nice to receive check out instructions with check in info"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just as beautiful as the photos, with plenty of thoughtful details. Though the inside is small/cozy for 2, there’s plenty of outdoor living space below and above. The lower deck, staircase and entry face the parking area (quiet and shared with only a few other houses) but the brilliant orientation/design means all windows and the upper bathtub deck face into wooded natural areas - relaxing and great for getting away from it all!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved this place! Beautiful and peaceful.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic stay here for our anniversary! Can’t wait to come back!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I went here on a romantic getaway and this place was absolutely gorgeous! The rooftop bath was my favorite! The bed and pillows were very very comfortable. They had everything we needed and the design of the place was beautiful. It was private and quiet and overall lovely. 10 min from Fredericksburg. Worth every penny!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This tree house was THE BEST! The driving instructions he gave us were spot on (don't use the ""physical address"" that is sent to you, follow his instructions he will send you. Arriving there are 4 tree houses in this circle drive area just outside of Fredricksburg (only maybe 10 min or less to downtown shopping) but the tree houses are set up to make it feel more private. The inside was done so perfectly, seriously I loved this place! The top story is a covered private deck that faces the trees with a large tub (yes OUTSIDE!) and a large couch/bed. If it was not so cold outside I would have filled that baby up and read my book for hours! Instead my husband and I sat on the couch/bed with the small fire pit going just enjoying the silence and reading our books. We will for SURE be going back out to stay here!
Thank you for the incredible experience!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,perfect for couples or a solo trip. I loved that there was no temptation to turn on a television. I read in the bay window and really enjoyed the outdoor bathtub. I drove away feeling calm and refreshed. will stay again!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! We had a wonderful time. Well thought out space with fun details.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Jacob’s place should be the blueprint for how airbnbs function. It was even more beautiful in person. The already amazing photos don’t do it justice! Had everything you could think to want (or forget to bring). Worth EVERY penny.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,amazing stay ! it was very peaceful and 10 minutes away from town. it was the perfect getaway from the big city

Bells was so sweet and friendly! We loved being greeted by hom. We saw deer everywhere which was a nice bonus for us cityfolk. I was so sad to leave The Leaf when it was time to go home. This was a wonderful setting to relax, reconnect, and celebrate our anniversary."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The treehouses are a magical place to stay. It is only 10 minutes from town but nicely tucked away so you feel like you are far away from everything. The treehouses are decorated perfectly and Bells the cat is a purr-fect host!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is even cuter than the pics. A real gem of a place and you can tell how intentional they were with designing it and setting it up. Conveniently located as well. Will be back!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful spot for our honeymoon! we are big beach people so the peace & quote with the spectacular views was exactly what we needed!
all the hosts&co-hosts were very quick to respond & so kind!
we can't wait to come back & try out a different house!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay! The treehouse was easy to find, yet tucked away behind the trees so you felt secluded from everything else.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfection! An oasis for anyone needing a getaway. Close enough to the city that u can get to it quickly but secluded enough that if you don't want to talk to or see anyone at all, you can do that as well. This place is amazing."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here. The treehouse looks JUST like the photos and the hosts responded quickly and were friendly. We drove in with an electrical storm going on but it was still easy to locate the treehouse with the directions and once we were inside we felt like the structure was sturdy and secure. The cat is maybe the best part !! (If you like cats). I would stay here again and try one of the other properties. 10/10 recommend.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Such an incredibly magical experience. One day is simply not enough. Celebrated my partners birthday and we were both so sad to leave. Thanks for sharing this space with us!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We booked this for a last minute getaway with our son, who is under 2. Jacob and his cohosts were extra communicative and easy to reach if we had questions. The whole space was well thought out with amazing details.
The drive into town was short and easy. We found ourselves wanting to stay back at the treehouse and listen to the storm come down around us. It was beautiful. Bells, the owner’s cat, had breakfast with us on the patio every morning.
We can not wait to stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was honestly a slice of heaven! The owners thought of everything my sister and I could possibly need (and more). Everything was as described! We had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners, Jourdan, who was very responsive and helpful! We also met Bells (the resident feline) and he was the most chill cat I’ve ever met! We left the Treehouse very relaxed and happy… will definitely be coming back soon! Thank you for sharing your wonderful place! ❤️"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I stayed here and it was such a nice and private homey place! I love the concept of the tree house, I like how excluded and private everything was. It was very clean and the basic essentials were there like the shampoo, soap and some kitchenware 👍🏽😊 already recommended this to others and will be back!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Truly a unique place to stay! It's fun to drink your morning coffee on the deck upstairs. It's dry enough in Fredericksburg that it is comfortable in the morning to be outside. I did not see any pests considering the house is built in a tree. The music provided for the record player was well done.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The treehouse was so amazing. The wife and I really enjoyed and was the perfect little get away for the both of us. Will stay here again. Loved it

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend this place. We loved our stay and the host made everything very easy for us. It’s a very beautiful treehouse and was well worth what we paid.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is our second time staying in these treehouses! We enjoyed the views, beautiful interior, the peace, and everything about this place. Next on my bucket list is the Live Oak!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've always wanted to stay in a tree house and this place was it! Everything was so cute and charismatic. I love the vinyl record player. Even though the hot water didn't work and the fire pit was not able to be lit, the Jacob was quick to respond and helped out. They even got rid of a spider and its web while we were on Main St. If we were to stay again, it would be in the winter because it was a little stuffy for me. And I'm glad they had a net over the bed because of the bugs!
Cute place!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place! loved our time here!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and peaceful. It was secluded but easy to get to stores and restaurants.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the second HoneyTree property of Jacob’s we stayed at (stayed at the Acorn last time for our minimoon) and our 1 year anniversary experience at the Leaf was just as beautiful. All of the photos are accurate, but what the photos didn’t capture was the privacy and peace you feel at these treehouses. In the morning, we spent some time quietly reading on the roof deck and we’re visited by a cardinal, and it was such a serene experience. My favorite part this time was that we finally got to meet the owners cat Bells! Bells ran up to us for pets as we parked and was so friendly and cute. Will definitely be back to explore the other properties next year on our 2 year anniversary."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a perfect stay. The room had everything we needed and some fun surprises too. I would definitely stay again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd time staying at one of Jacob & Jourdan's properties and it was just as amazing as the first time! We love how peaceful and serene it is, while still being close enough to town to enjoy all Fredericksburg has to offer. We would love to stay again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came to celebrate our anniversary and wanted something a little different,this place met all our expectations and more,loved the cat who always greeted us and kept us company 😀"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at the Honeytree Leaf Treehouse - the place was private, relaxing, and we loved the visits from the cat. It's clear that a lot of attention to detail went into in the design and functionality - it was the perfect retreat and wish we could have stayed longer."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Honeytree Leaf was an awesome experience. We just loved watching the birds, deer, and other wildlife from the peaceful seclusion among the tree canopy. This will be an annual occurrence for us!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The treehouse is beautiful and has such incredible attention to detail and functionality. The hosts are so nice, helpful, and responsive!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at Airbnbs all across the world, and have rarely seen one as beautiful as Jacob and Katie’s. It was such a lovely little retreat at a time when I and my fiancée really needed one! The construction is inspired, and every detail has obviously been considered with attention. Plus, Jordan was incredibly responsive and helpful.
10/10, will be staying here again, and also trying out the other tiny homes on property."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The experience was relaxing and peaceful. A plus was the cat that welcomed us and checked on us frequently!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This treehouse was the absolute best place we’ve ever stayed! It was MAGICAL, comfortable, cozy, convenient but secluded, romantic and casual all at the same time. We spent our 5 year anniversary here for 2 nights and will absolutely stay here everytime we are in Fredericksburg. There is a resident kitty who is very social! I’m sure she/he has 1,000 names given by guests; we went with Oliver 🤪. The weekend we were here a good ol Texas thunderstorm blew in including high winds, hail, lightning, thunder, the whole shebang. The treehouse stood strong and was sooooo cool to be in during a rain storm! We went down Main street, purchased local ingredients and goods, and had a charcuterie spread back at the treehouse. BOOK THIS PLACE STAT! Next time we go I wanna stay in another one of Jacob’s treehouses but idk how you’ll beat The Leaf! The 3rd floor is breathtaking."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great, relaxing stay in the Leaf treehouse for my birthday! Beautiful location, private, and wonderful amenities. And so close to all the wineries!
Thanks for everything! We’ll be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed in the Leaf Treehouse for our 15-year wedding anniversary, and it was perfect! The treehouse is so unique and peaceful. We loved all the little details from the decor to the record player. The bed was very comfortable and the small kitchen had everything we could have needed. Great location, close to town, but still far enough out in the country to feel secluded and private. Thank you for a wonderful weekend. We look forward to coming back!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to feel out in nature while still being very close to Fredericksburg.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This treehouse is magical and the owners have great attention to details! 2 nights is not enough!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an absolutely wonderful time & loved the Leaf treehouse. A very unique experience & the hosts have thought of all the details to make our stay comfortable & carefree. You’re a short drive from Main St. 10/10 would recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This stay was exactly what we needed! My only complaint was one night was not enough!! We should have booked more! Haha
The tree house itself was exactly like the pictures. Loved the attention to detail. Everything was super clean. We made friends with the cardinal living in our tree. He peeked through our window and entertained us all morning!
So many great restaurants and shops near by. Natural Grocers if you need snacks. The only thing we were bummed about was not getting to hike enchanted rock—make sure to make reservations!! We plan to come back and stay again and will most definitely make reservations so we can experience that also!
Thanks for sharing your place with us! Such a great get away!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful and so very peaceful!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a dream come true, staying in this magical tree house. Every detail was thought of, the tiny beautiful kitchen had everything we needed, we put on some records and enjoyed lounging in the window seat. Absolutely lovely to stay in."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at the honey tree farm and it was just as amazing as the first time! We believe the ""Leaf"" is now our go to treehouse, it was so charming and the bathtub on the third floor patio was one of the best times we've ever had."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful space! Absolutely would go back and have recommended it to so many friends and family. Went for a baby moon and enjoyed every bit of our stay. The space is so well designed and aesthetically pleasing. I didn’t need to reach out to the hosts for anything, but they were extremely proactive with recommendations and letting us know they were just a message away if we needed anything."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely Amazing Stay! Jacob was an absolute delight! Super helpful and constantly checked in with us during the winter storm! Lovely stay! Perfect honeymoon location for my new husband and I! Can’t wait to come back & stay at the perfect peaceful treehouse again! Thank you Jacob!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Treehouse was whimsical and unique. My wife and I enjoyed it because it was ""something different"". The hosts were responsive and friendly. The location was a short 10 min drive from Fredericksburg and surrounding wineries so that was convenient. We wish the balcony had a space heater so we could have enjoyed that space more than we did because it was chilly during our stay which made that area a little uncomfortable. All in all, we had a relaxing time hitting the reset button in this unique getaway experience."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space , with basic kitchen necessities needed so I was able to make breakfast for my family and enjoy board games . Over the beautiful patio views . We fell back in love with our family here.
An affordable slice of heaven , book it !"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay! 5 stars across the board even without an a/c unit on our last night (this was NOT the fault of the host, who offered to come look at it but we had too much going on. The weather was amazing and with a cracked window it was truly magical sleeping in the trees!
Would definitely book honey tree farms again, it was an absolute pleasure! 10/10!
Ps if you go look for the sweetest kitty that hangs out around the tree houses. He totally made our stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had high expectations but even those were exceeded for my stay. The Leaf is so cozy- I didn't even want to leave to go do things. I just wanted to soak up the ambiance. So happy with my stay!! Cannot emphasize enough how wonderful the place is. ♥️
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome private little suite and not to far from Main Street! We loved everything about it can’t wait to book again or another one if his properties
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay! This was not our first time in a tree house, but it is definitely the most beautiful and stylish one we've ever stayed in. Claire was so friendly, accommodating, and responsive. The grounds are peaceful and private but close enough to city center. It was the perfect get away for the holidays! Thank you for making our stay so lovely!"

Highly recommend packing a book… you won’t want to leave the window reading nook! :)"

Highly recommend staying here while visiting Fredricksburg or surrounding areas. We’re looking forward to returning. Thank you for everything."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The HoneyTree house was absolutely magical and even more beautiful in person.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I booked the leaf treehouse for our anniversary and I must say it was one of the most romantic, peaceful, and cozy spots we’ve ever been to. From the exterior to the interior, there was no detail missed. I’m thankful for a getaway such as this. It’s the perfect break and serenity we need from the chaotic world we live in. We will definitely be telling our family and friends about these properties. And besides the extra fees, the price is so affordable! I do wish there were properties closer to Austin, but the stay was amazing. We especially enjoyed the hot tub up top and the cutest cat who accompanied us. Host was responsive and the place was clean. Don’t hesitate to book. I highly recommend 10/10!!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, Relaxing and Peaceful. A little gem. Wish we could stay longer. Great place to unplug. Highly recommend a stay here! The space is very clean and cozy. All the details were thought out and everything was beyond expectation."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfection to a “t”-ree!! (did ya catch that?)!! Oh my! Surpassed all of our expectations! Clean, comfortable, quiet, totally zen!! And super close to Fredericksburg so getting groceries was just a 5 minute drive into town. BONUS was the adorable and friendly cat who greeted us upon arrival!! Can’t say enough good things about our first experience in a tree house!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This treehouse was the most magical experience. Best honeymoon we could have asked for!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Host was very responsive to questions pre-stay. Treehouse was just like the pictures. I appreciated the thoughtful abundance of hooks & adequate bathroom counter space considering the small space. Charming home. :)
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot to get away from the metropolitan area. Really tranquil and unique. It’s perfect for a nature lover. I enjoyed the fact it was a short drive to town. It sits on a beautiful piece of land
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was so perfect, that I can't think of anything that would have made it better! Clean, tidy, cute, and cozy!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This treehouse is absolutely darling!! Jacob was great to communicate with, and everything was clean and exactly as pictured. And the wildlife!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for our honeymoon and it was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!! The space was designed so thoughtfully. Our favorite was the rooftop bathtub overlooking the nature. So peaceful and romantic!!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at the Leaf treehouse for our honeymoon!
Really conveniently located and such a peaceful getaway. Lots of wildlife easily spotted and so many spots designed for relaxing (reading/napping nook), hammocks, outdoor tub, etc.
The owners really put a lot of time and details into ensuring optimized space without sacrificing design/style.
We would happily book again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED our time in the Leaf Treehouse - it’s even more gorgeous than the photos. We especially loved watching the deer, squirrels, and birds in the morning while we drank our morning coffee. We’ll definitely be coming back💕"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The treehouse was exactly as pictured and described, charming and private and quiet. As recommended by another reviewer, we took the Garrison Brothers Distillery tour on our way out from Austin, which was entertaining. Then we brought food and spent the evening enjoying the candlelight and the woods from the third floor porch. The design and decorations are very well-thought-out for relaxation and comfort, with plenty of places to sit on all three levels and twinkle lights, blankets, candles and the record player."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I stayed here for our 25th wedding anniversary trip. The location was perfect, just close enough to town, but far enough to see the stars. The home was beautiful- the lights, decor, layout.... everything was just as we expected! The Keurig stopped working while we were there, so my husband used the french press to make us coffee, but before we could finish our cups, Jacob's wife sent over a new Keurig. Thank you so much for making our trip peaceful, memorable, and relaxing!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great property. We enjoyed our stay. One of a kind experience.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We could not have been happier with our stay! The host's were great. Very helpful and went out of their way to assist with any questions. It was very clean and laid out thoughtfully. We look forward to our next stay and share the experience with our son.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Leaf and Honey Tree Farm is such a special place! It is so quiet and peaceful, and the wildlife is plentiful. Everyday we were able to watch the deer from the treehouse! Although there are several other ""treehouses"", it feels extremely private, and the space is so cozy and romantic. It was the perfect getaway for our 25th anniversary. There is a bath on the top floor deck that is lovely and so many places to sit an enjoy nature. Check-in was a breeze, and our hosts were able to provide us with restaurant recommendations which were spot on. The communication was excellent! The location is amazing, close to town, but not too close. It is a true oasis and easily the best airbnb we have stayed at. We can't wait to go back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed here for our 10 year wedding anniversary and it was amazing! I just wish we could have stayed longer to fully enjoy the house and surroundings more. The house is exactly as advertised and is a wonderful place to enjoy a romantic trip for two. Highly recommend!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was outstanding! Even better than what we could’ve hoped for. It was clean, charming, and oh so cozy. We especially loved seeing the deer running around in the morning right outside our window. The tub was such a nice treat after a long day and the hammock and swings were fun to relax in. Easy to get to and ample parking. They had everything we needed for our stay. We can’t wait to book our next trip with Jacob!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Treehouse was amazing and immaculate! Exceeded our expectations! Had everything we needed! Such a relaxing stay! Location was fantastic.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,What a fantastic place to get away for a romantic evening to focus on our relationship. Can’t wait till we can get away again.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an incredible space! So peaceful and relaxing and close to Main Street! It is exactly what you want when visiting Fredericksburg!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So impressed by this beautiful place! We had never stayed in anything like this treehouse before, but it looked so cool in the photos and we wanted a peaceful place we could escape to at the end of the day and this treehouse did not disappoint! It’s as beautiful in person as it is in the photos. We will definitely stay here again and I am already recommending it to our friends. Made our 15th anniversary all the more memorable."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best vacations I’ve been on
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Literally the perfect vacation spot! I will definitely be back! Amazing vibes!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was magical! First of all, I appreciated Jacob’s directions, they got me right to the treehouse with ease. The location is PERFECT. It’s secluded but not isolated and you feel like you’re entering a hallmark movie (bonus points if you spot the mini horse on the drive in!). It’s 10 mins to downtown Fredericksburg - could not have asked for a better spot. The treehouse itself was stunning, so much more quaint than the pictures can capture. It was very clean, there were dishes, glasses, utensils, cookware - everything you could think of! And you cannot miss the upstairs tub, it’s phenomenal. I had a small check in issue because a lightening storm had knocked their remote key system offline, but Claire responded within 10 minutes, was SO SWEET, gave me a working code, and small refund for the inconvenience.
I’m turning on my insta notifications for them so I can stay here again and again. One of the best trips I’ve had - thank you so much Jacob and team!
Also, do yourself a favor and do the Garrison Bros Bourbon distillery tour. Other than this absolutely darling treehouse, it was the highlight of the trip."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely my favorite sty yet. Beautiful location, absolutely everything I wanted. Will be staying again"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"When we arrived at the Leaf TreeHouse at 5:00, the electricity was out due to a lightning storm. The power was out for about 5 hours. In the mean time we sat up on the upper deck drinking wine and listening to the rain and even took a nap. Jacob contacted us several times to make sure we were ok and made sure we didn’t need anything. It was so peaceful and the property is absolutely amazing. We wished we could have stayed a few more days but we will definitely be back."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin has exceeded expectations: not only it looks like on the pictures, but also is extremely clean, and all the details are thought-through. There are deer roaming around the property, and the atmosphere is very tranquil and romantic. A perfect getaway for a special occasion!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely can’t wait to stay here again!! It was so peaceful and beautiful. I loved the record player and the bath that was upstairs. The other houses aren’t too close by which is nice, we had privacy. You’re not far from town at all it was perfect!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing place. Had a great time. Jacob is a great host :D Helped me jumpstart my car in the 1 pm heat(Thanks for that). Very cool stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Incredible experience! It's the perfect place to spend a romantic weekend.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a Fabulous time in the treehouse!Just minutes from Fredericksburg, but very private also. We celebrated our 13th anniversary there, very romantic"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot to stay for a few days. It was private, quiet, but still close enough to town if you wanted to take advantage of it. We only left for food - that was how much we didn't want to leave. Would definitely return in a heartbeat. The hosts were communicative as needed and left excellent instructions for us as guests. We absolutely loved it."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, wonderful hosts!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were looking to get away for our anniversary and disconnect from the world for a few days. Our stay at Leaf was perfect. I love the decor and the vibe was so perfect for what we wanted. Main Street was just a short 10 min drive.
Jacob was a superb host. Check in was so easy and was available for any needs throughout our stay, nothing was needed but nice to know he was just a text away.
Would recommend to anyone, we will be back again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great. We loved the space which is a perfect little tree house for couples. Everything looked new and functioned new, no issues at all with anything.
The outdoor space on the ground floor had a hammock and some space to chill, 2nd level was the indoor living space with good A/C and the 3rd level was a beautiful balcony with couch, gas fire pit (too hot outside right now to need) swing chair and bathtub with plenty of privacy.
The 2nd level indoor space was plenty big for a couple, had a beautiful circular window with a lounging area where we sat to read and recoup from walking the town all day. There is even a record player in there!
Loved it 10/10"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay couldn’t have been more perfect. Every detail in the treehouse is exquisite and the location can’t be best. The only problem was that we loved the treehouse so much, we never wanted to leave!!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rarely is anything more impressive than the pictures, and the Leaf certainly exceeded expectations. 100% we would recommend this getaway (and we have…to everyone we’ve run into)!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were celebrating our 20 year wedding anniversary and my 10 year cancer free anniversary. This place was so much fun! Jacob and his wife were amazing and very helpful if we needed anything. I would highly recommend a stay here.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful weekend getaway. The Leaf treehouse was so relaxing, cozy and convenient to downtown. The space had everything we needed and the outdoor deck areas were perfect for enjoying the peaceful surroundings. 10/10 would stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for a retreat from the stress of life, this is it.
My wife and I use our phones and computers a lot, but the Leaf treehouse pulled us away from it all. It almost felt wrong to do anything other than enjoy the peace and quiet.
Everything we needed was provided and it was also extremely clean. There’s nothing bad to say and we will definitely be returning in the future."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little place, it was super clean and had everything we needed. I loved how close it was to everything in Fredericksburg, yet it was remote enough to be quiet and feel remote. We will definitely be back."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay . Go you will enjoy it so much .
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a unique property! Very relaxing and enjoyed watching the wildlife from the trees. Loved all the little details. Super convenient to downtown Fredericksburg too.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, this is our second stay at a different tree house and loved it of course! Will stay again for sure!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The honey tree farm leaf treehouse is the absolute cutest, most unique, coolest place I’ve ever stayed! The rental has everything you need for a comfortable stay and just when you thought it couldn’t get any cooler there is a top deck with a tub and bed in the top of the trees!! The location is perfect when visiting Fredericksburg, you are close to main street and everything in the area! Jacob and Claire were quick with replying to any needs and just the nicest hosts! I could go on and on…. I promise one step onto this property and you will be just as blown away!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I honestly believe that this moment of perfection has spoiled us to other properties. Time stood still and we couldn’t get enough of every unique touch. This quick get away was EVERYTHING we had hoped for - especially for a last minute booking that became available! I wouldn’t change anything. Beautiful space , perfect location, and most thoughtful touches. I’m going to say that you should not miss this opportunity, but also- leave some dates open for us, please!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Leaf treehouse was perfect! ❤️
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Worth every penny! The location is percect - far enough off the beaten path to feel surrounded by nature/away from it all and just 10m of Main St Fredericksburg if you want to venture out. We especially loved how private each treehouse was, each nestled into a wooded area heavily frequented by birds and deer. We also walked a short nature trail they have on the property. We enjoyed coffee on the rooftop patio each morning and playing records at night. The outdoor bath tub and hammocks were perfect for relaxation. Bedding was like a cloud, we both slept in several hours longer than usual. Can’t wait to go back, our new favorite spot in Central Texas!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cool unique treehouse bungalows. Loved the experience. A bit on the pricey side, but you are in the trees."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is such a fun idea and this had everything you need to cook out, microwave, fridge, etc. We only slept there because our activities were so much going on, but we will plan another time to hang out there more next time. The little trail we did do, and there are Deer everywhere out there! So peaceful and fun!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful and Relaxing is All I can say about the Leaf Treehouse. This was just what my husband and I needed to get away. The treehouse as everything you may need.

We needed a break from our urban jungle lifestyle, and to come stay at the leaf treehouse was such a welcoming monotony breaker.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came here for quiet get away and I was blown away! The pictures do not do it justice. It’s close to Main Street for food/drinks, but I never wanted to leave the actual tree house! Can’t wait to come back."

Jacob’s craftsman on the homes was also something to admire, you don’t see this just anywhere!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I loved every minute of our stay here…Felt super private throughout our entire stay. Got to listen to the thunder and rain on the top deck while sipping on wine and whiskey without a care in the world. Layout and design was was perfectly in sync with our expectations.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first time visiting Fredericksburg and we were so fortunate to have chosen Jo's adorable cottage. The location is easily walkable to great coffee places and restaurants, only one block off the main street through town, but in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood. We experienced this cottage as being better than pictured, and found it very clean and spacious. The decor is wonderfully eclectic, a charming blend of modern and antique furnishings. The bed is very comfortable, and we really liked the rain shower in the bathroom. We appreciated having a full kitchen with new appliances and sufficient cookware to make simple meals. We enjoyed spending time on the back deck, as well as the use of the hot tub. It's a five minute walk to Caliche Coffee (recommend their avocado toast on GF bread) and Hill & Vine is about a 10 minute walk (excellent farm-to-table meal and a great atmosphere). We look forward to returning to this gem of a cottage!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jourdan’s place was absolutely perfect for a quick getaway in Fredericksburg. The space was clean, welcoming, and comfortable."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best weekend trip at the most quaint and relaxing cottage house. We really enjoyed the vibes of the place and how serene it felt.

We were able to walk over to Main Street and got to explore local coffee shops, souvenir shops and even a super cute crystal shop! I highly recommend staying at this beautiful location!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great stay! The home is a nice getaway for 2! Walking distance to Main Street!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect location to walk to everything on Main St! The hot tub and sauna were much needed after a day of wine tastings. Perfect for an anniversary weekend.

It was also in such a great location to walk to town, coffee shops, restaurants etc. It’s apparent that Jourdan puts a lot of love and care into this sweet home. Thanks for a great trip!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot close to town that’s walkable but far enough to feel like it was our own private space. The hot tub and sauna were great bonus features that were easy to use. We especially loved the coffee bar with so many options! Jourdan was amazing from the day we booked - proactive and great recommendations. We had a small issue with the tv — she went above and beyond to resolve quickly! Overall highly recommend staying here for anyone looking to explore downtown Fredericksburg with a nearby place to relax and call your own when you’re ready to enjoy a quieter spot off Main Street.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing for me and my wife and I couldn’t have asked for a better weekend to spend it at. This place felt like we were at home and almost didn’t want to leave. We were also close to everything on Main Street which is where all the restaurants and little wineries are in town. Now the vineyards are about 15-20 mins away but it’s definitely worth going to see during your stay because there’s about 20 plus to choose from. We went to grape creek vineyards and had a great experience on there tour of the whole facility. Next time me and my wife come to town we will be staying here!!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great wakeable distance to Main St. We were provided with everything we needed to feel at home. I would definitely come back to the same location again. Hist was super friendly, communicated all the boundaries for our stay in a timely manner. 5/5"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our stay at Jourdan’s in Fredericksburg was wonderful! The house was centrally located so we could get up each morning and walk to the coffee shop. The area was quiet. We brought our dog and she enjoyed the fully fenced backyard. We loved the hot tub! It was great after a day of rock climbing at Enchanted Rock. All in all a great stay and we would stay again if we’re ever in the Fredericksburg again.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a fantastic time here over Christmas weekend in Fredricksburg! First - the location is fantastic! It’s one block from Main Street, with tons of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, etc.
The house is really cute and cozy, and we loved having a fenced in yard for the dogs. The hot tub and deck were really nice for relaxing, and the bed was also very comfortable! The kitchen is well stocked, with a nicely set up coffee bar.
The only downside is there is no TV in the master but it wasn’t a problem for us. And the fireplace is such a nice touch!
Jourdan was extremely communicative and flexible and an amazing host overall! We definitely loved our AirBnB experience vs. staying at a hotel!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cute little place. Love the minimalist vibes and vintage decor. We really enjoyed the back porch and hot tub 🥰
Would definitely stay there again!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed in many AirBNB’s and this one had, by far, the comfiest bed we’ve slept in! Aside from the comfortable sleeping arrangements, the house was within walking distance of Main Street and all things Fredericksburg. Jourdan’s communication was thorough and proactive. I would highly recommend her place to others. It was a great value."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location in Fredricksburg! Easy to walk to main street. Loved that they accepted dogs and had a fully fenced in private back yard. Would definitely stay there again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a great stay! We enjoyed the private, fenced in yard for our pup and the two different patios for outside lounging. We wish we had more time to take advantage of the grill or fire pit! It was a block away from coffee shops and restaurants on Main Street - so it was easy to walk every where. We also appreciated the off-street parking. Little things like a super super comfy bed with a cozy space heater fireplace, a logged-in smart TV, and a welcome bottle of sparkling wine made the staycation special.
The only things to note as you select this spot: It may be a better fit for a couple or very close friends as the bathroom has a curtain on the outside of the door and adorable up-cycled barn doors which are not sound-tight/private."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location and comfortable space. Would definitely recommend!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jourdan’s place is perfect for a quiet getaway. We loved the hot tub and patio. So private and quiet. Yet close to everything Fredericksburg has to offer.

It is right off main street so everywhere in town is easily walkable. The hot tub and sauna were amazing amenities and enhanced our stay. The home is exactly as pictured, and is set up perfectly for a romantic getaway. Jourdan was incredibly responsive and helped with anything we needed. You can tell Jourdan put a tremendous amount of love and energy into creating a warm, inviting, and ""homey"" Airbnb. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved Jourdan’s place! We stayed with our dog and would come back again. Great location to walk to Main Street, and the sauna was a great bonus!"

House includes all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. Loved the decor! I highly recommend Jourdan’s place and look forward to staying here again on another visit to the area."

We both agree this will be where we always stay when visiting Fredricksburg!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We decided to book this house to celebrate our anniversary in Fredericksburg and we were so pleased with our choice! Jourdan was so incredibly helpful and accommodating, she was also extremely quick to respond and let us know what changed on her end to allow our stay to be as flexible as possible. She was so kind to make herself available should we need anything. It was a close walk to main, only a 10 minute walk from my favorite restaurant, and so quiet even though it’s a couple blocks from a live music venue. Parking was so easy, checkin was a breeze, and the house was absolutely beautiful. The entire house was kept super clean and felt so cozy! I wish it were cool enough for us to have used the hot tub, we’ll just have to come back in the winter time! The bed was incredibly comfortable and the sheets were so soft, we slept so well while we were there. I’m sad to have to leave, but very excited to come back! Thank you for being such great hosts!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! The location was great and the house was so cute! It was perfect for a short getaway to Fredericksburg.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely awesome!
The very best location, the ultimate host and super comfortable. Jourdan was not only quick to respond BEFORE our stay but very kind and went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable.

Loved this home and it was close to everything but far enough to be quiet and peaceful. Definitely recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved !!! Beautiful Home!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a fun weekend in Fredericksburg and really enjoyed the house. There was plenty of space for our party of 3 adults and we loved the plunge pool the most. It was really hot during our stay, so the pool got a lot of use! It was probably a 6 block or so walk to the Main Street, but in the heat it felt really long. Once on the Main Street there are tons of great restaurants, tasting rooms and shops. The house itself is beautiful and minimalist. The concrete floors are a bit hard on bare feet, but wearing our flip flops around helped. The beds & pillows were comfy and the towels smelled fresh & clean. I would stay here again if I’m ever back in the area!"

This was the perfect place to call home for several nights. We enjoyed the hot tub after our daughter went to bed, and it was so nice to watch TV while we were in the hot tub too! The location was amazing (about a 3 minute drive to downtown!). The house was fully stocked with everything you’d need during your stay, the beds were SO comfortable, and we loved the local recommendations! This was our first visit to Fredericksburg, and we definitely plan to return! We’ll most definitely be staying here again…look no further for your home away from home!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to find, great property. Good communication."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the Guest House on Elm, it is the perfect home away from home!  The neighborhood is quiet and just minutes away from Fredericksburg main street.   Ashley provides everything you need for your stay including a well equipped kitchen, quality coffee, and some bottled water.  There is also a washer & dryer should you need it.  The hot tub is a great perk that we enjoyed during our stay and the set up is great with an outdoor shower and easy access bathroom!  Ashley was a great host and provided special touches including a bottle of wine and some snacks which we enjoyed and appreciated!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect home-base for a weekend in wine country. Would highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home which is well maintained. Kitchen was well equipped and beds were comfortable. Pool and hot tub were nice, area was convenient. Really thoughtful and lovely space.
Little trouble locating the house as it is an accessory dwelling, but no real problems.
Fredericksburg , in general, was underwhelming. Not much here but cutsie shops. Yuck. Texas , in general, is underwhelming and overhyped. The west coast of the US is far superior.
But full of nice folk and has good weather."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great gem in Fredricksburg. would highly recommend
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay overall for the price that we paid. It was very well done and spacious with a private pool and hot tub—can’t complain! The only caveat was the $100 per day charge to heat up the pool.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in Fredericksburg to celebrate my husband's birthday this weekend. I agree with so many of the comments before me that the house was even more charming and beautiful than the pictures. Very well appointed and Ashley was the best host. We had chilly weather so the hot tub was wonderful! This was our first time in Fredericksburg and we will definitely be back. Highly recommend this property.

Even though the weather was cold and rainy with temps in 40s and 50s, the pool and spa warmed up quickly and provided our family a nice reprieve after hiking at enchanted rock. Ashley provided a lot of extra touches including water, snacks, a bottle of wine, coffee, and plenty of guidebooks. She was also really responsive whenever we had any questions. The space was open and airy, clean, and comfortable. The two king bedrooms provided plenty of space for my family of four. In the winter, I’d recommend bringing slippers as the concrete floor can get cold. The bathrooms were clean and the half bath to the pool was a really nice touch. I would definitely stay here again."

It's a new home and beautifully appointed. The pool was perfect for cooling off after a morning of shopping on Main Street and the hot tub was a great way to unwind after the day. The host book had plenty of recommendations for local restaurants. We chose all our meals based on her suggestions and none disappointed! The house is close enough to walk to Main Street if you want, although with the heat we chose to drive. While we didn't need to reach out to Ashley for anything, she did check in and felt very accessible. Overall, it was a perfect home for what we were looking for. Will definitely stay again!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’d like to start off by saying I have never felt more relaxed than I did when we left this guesthouse. My fiancé and I booked a trip here and found ourselves right at home. The home is well built with a beautiful kitchen, high ceilings, natural lighting, cute furniture, great pool area, cozy bedrooms and comfy linens. Ashley has thought out every last detail. I normally bring my own supplies but she had everything I needed just incase I forgot anything. Provided snacks and complimentary wine upon arrival. The hot tub was easy to work. The pool was CLEAN!!! The house felt like ours with so much privacy. Ashley provided great recommendations for places to go out on town. Nothing felt cheap. The mattress, bedding, linens and pillows gave me the best nights sleep I’ve had in a while.
She is a great host with great communication.
We are definitely looking forward to booking again."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the house and very fast responses from Ashley! Will be staying again
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The Guest House on Elm is the quintessential Texas hill country Airbnb. The style is airy and light. The design is lovely with cement floors, gorgeous atrium-like living room and floor to ceiling tile showers. Both bedrooms are about the same size with king beds and similar bathrooms. The blackout curtains in BOTH bedrooms were much appreciated!
The location is great. About a 2 min drive to Main Street.
Our hosts were very responsive, but we ran into a few hiccups.
The fridge wasn’t cooling and therefore unusable. The owners brought us a mini fridge and an over sized ice chest but with only one small bag of ice.
The owners also had construction going on in their backyard (adjacent to the guest house). During the days, the construction noise was so loud we were unable to enjoy the patio and spa when we wanted. However, the time we did get to enjoy in the spa was great!
We probably won’t return to this Airbnb, but overall, we enjoyed our stay in Fredericksburg!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay - extremely comfortable, well thought out, well equipped, new build with great host that I would have no hesitation recommending to people who want to visit Fredericksburg"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley's place was the perfect weekend getaway for me and my husband. My main goal for this trip was to unplug and spend time relaxing in a pool. We loved the privacy and amenities of the backyard with the heated pool, hot tub and outdoor tv. The location is very close to downtown Fredericksburg and an easy drive for going to/from restaurants and wineries. I'd definitely return and stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ashley was a fabulous host! She made us truly feel like we were on vacation with her attention to detail!

The guest house is exactly as pictured and was extremely clean/nicely stocked with towels (including some for the pool), laundry supplies, toiletries, etc. The pool/hot tub were just the right size as well and heated up quickly!
It was a bit far to walk into town with young kids (although definitely doable for a couple/group of adults). That being said it was only a 2 min drive to main st. Would definitely stay again! Can’t wait to come back."

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great except for one major issue....there weren't any curtains or shades or blinds in the main living areas and the blinds in the bedrooms didn'tcover the entire windows so that is something I think should have been mentioned in the listing along with, there are no TVs aside from the one outside.

We appreciated the thought that went in to preparing the home for guests. Little touches like tissues in several rooms, charging devices right next to the bed and labels on light switches. The back yard was an oasis after a day of exploring. The neighborhood itself was quiet and safe. I enjoyed my daily walks and seeing all the interesting historic homes in the area. Main Street - where all the shops and restaurants are - was also a short walk. The host was extremely responsive to all questions. Truly a 5 star stay!!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts. Super communication from the beginning to the end. Great home with plenty of space. Just a bit further than most would walk for dinner etc but on a quiet street with plenty of wildlife (Fox, deer, cardinals, blue birds).
Would stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. This home is lovely and cozy. perfect for two couples.
While main Street was within a walkable distance the main shopping and eating establishments were still a ways away.
We stayed during the week and some businesses are closed odd days. Still plenty to do and see.
Quiet evenings on the back patio we're the perfect end to our days."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough good things about this property. This is by far one of the top three airbnb's I have ever stayed in. If I could give it 10 stars I would. You will not find a cleaner, more well stocked or better decorated home in all of Texas. I personally was stunned at how well it is managed. The responsiveness of the host was also amazing. Oh and can I just mention the absolute luxury of the towels and bedding?! It is truly a one of a kind find in the airbnb world!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"At the west end of main street, two blocks south, with an empty lot across the street. We sat on the front porch and watched the deer in the evenings, it was relaxing and quiet. We needed a base of operations for a week project for work and Joe's place was ideal. We were able to cook meals, wash clothes, and do all the ""creature comfort"" things after a long day of working. It was one of the most comfortable places I have rented in Fredericksburg and with two bedrooms with private bathrooms it was a perfect fit for what I needed."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, walkable to Main Street but far enough away to be quiet at night. Would stay again!!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to explore some wineries and couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay. It felt like our home away from home. It was quiet in the evening and even had a fire pit where we made s’mores. The kitchen was fully stocked with pots, pans and a coffee machine, which was so helpful after a day full of wine tastings and in the early mornings. There are so many details that I appreciated, like nightlights, coffee, toiletries and the outdoor rocking chairs! Will come back again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rhonda was a gracious and helpful host. providing excellent communications throughout our stay. She made us very welcomed. The Alley Bett was perfect for our 4 day stay in Fredricksburg, TX. It's layout and furnishings were very comfortable. We enjoyed the access to the covered patio and grill. Restaurants and attractions were within walking distance, and the neighborhood was charming. We would highly recommend Alley Bett for those visiting the Fredricksburg, TX area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don't typically leave many reviews, but Rhonda and the Alley Bett gave us such a perfect stay that I have to give her praise. Throughout our planning process, Rhonda was incredibly responsive and communicative. She was also understanding that we needed a late (11pm) check in, and her instructions were so clear that we had no difficulties finding and getting into the house even late at night. Once there, we saw that the posting's pictures and description really didn't do it justice -- it's charming, cozy, and pristine. Rhonda went above and beyond and had the kitchen stocked with K cups, coffee creamer, some orange juices, and snacks, and whenever we needed some additional necessities during our stay, they were there promptly. We would (and will) absolutely go back to Alley Bett -- one of the better Airbnb experiences we've had. Thank you Rhonda!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our 3rd time to stay at Rhonda’s place. Very nice and quiet and we were very comfortable. This feels like our home away from home.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our time at Alley Bett! The pictures just do not do it justice, it is so cute and was decorated for Valentine’s Day which was such a nice touch. Although it is in an alley, Rhonda’s instructions were so helpful for finding it. We so appreciated the bottle of wine and breakfast snacks left out for us, as well as ample coffee and tea options for the Keurig. Being just a fifteen-minute walk to Main Street made this location the perfect resting place. We made a stop in the middle of a day to put down our shopping bags and rest for a bit and it wasn’t too far to walk back at all. Great location, thoughtful amenities and dazzlingly clean. This was our first trip as a couple and we are so happy we chose Alley Bett for our Fredericksburg stay! We can’t wait to come back already."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time to stay and we loved it just as much as the first! Highly recommend!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! We actually greeted Rhonda and she was so warm and helpful. She allowed us to check in early, which was appreciated as we had a weekend full of wedding festivities. It is a very small place but suited us great. Bathroom was small without any countertops so was a bit challenging to get ready but not a big deal for a few days. Cute kitchenette. Only challenge was the AC/heater is right above your head in bed and so it did wake me up when it would turn off/on. Rhonda was super responsive when we could not figure out how to operate at first. I would recommend some kind of signage by the roadway as its set off in an alley and at night we passed by it several times. But we really enjoyed our stay, very reasonable for what you got and I appreciated all the special touches! I would highly recommend it. Thank you Rhonda!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I really enjoyed staying at Rhonda’s place! It was clean and so cute! I would definitely stay there again!

We cannot wait to visit again!!!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Alley Bett! Rhonda was very helpful, even providing restaurant recommendations before we got there. We go to Fredericksburg several times a year and having some new recommendations from a local was really nice. The place was very cute and had everything we needed. The outdoor area was an extra perk we did not expect. It was relaxing to sit there in the quiet of the early morning and then again for a glass of wine in the evening."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this was such a lovely place to stay, explore the city, and relax. I would highly recommend it"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I’ve stayed at Rhonda’s place severely times over the years & have always had a great experience. The bed is comfortable & the quilt bedspread is just enough to keep you cozy. The little kitchenette has utensils, plates, cups, towels, a microwave, refrigerator, small stove and coffee maker. She even has a Keurig & several choices of coffee. There’s even water, juice & banana bread in the refrigerator. The washer & dryer are handy to stay caught up on laundry.
And, a small table with 2 chairs to use while eating or working.
I highly recommend this quaint place for your next trip to Fredericksburg!"

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Rhonda communicated proactively and effectively. We didn’t need an follow up questions. The room was neat and clean and the bed comfortable. However, the decorations were a little tired and the AC unit was a challenge to get the temperature right and was noisy. Unfortunately, it was right over the bed."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful, cozy place. Rhonda thought about everything her guests could possibly want or need, and then some. It was very nicely decorated and very comfortable. We liked the fact that it was away from the craziness of downtown and very private. We definitely would stay here again on our next visit to Fredericksburg. Great job Rhonda!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent couple's weekend getaway. Rhonda was very responsive and friendly, and communicated to us clearly before arrival. We were pleasantly surprised to arrive with complimentary local wine and homemade banana bread, both of which were outstanding...not to mention a nice, cool, air-conditioned space with country music playing on arrival. All were a welcome touch, especially on a hot summer weekend! Her place was very comfortable, clean and cozy. We also enjoyed the complimentary juices, water and coffee selection with the K cup maker. We loved it here and will definitely plan to return again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect place for a short getaway. Ms. Rhonda was responsive to questions and even left my bread, banana nut bread...she had us there! Great size for the two of us and near downtown. We'll be back!"

I asked about specific places to go and immediately got a wonderful list. Rhonda had plenty or supplies for cooking, and there was coffee, snacks and a welcome bottle of wine which was a lovely surprise.
Her cottage was about a 20 minute walk from restaurants and shops. We loved Fredericksburg. Such a cute area with a lot to do.
We visited 2 other areas of Texas on this trip, but enjoyed Fredericksburg the most."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first stay at Alley Bett and we truly enjoyed it. It is quaint and very comfortable. The accommodations were clean, and it had everything we needed. Although it is very close to the main street with plenty of shopping and restaurants, it is located in a quiet, residential neighborhood. Perfect for two people, we were impressed by the use of space. We were grateful to have the carport since there was a hailstorm while we were there. We appreciated the bottle of Becker wine, bananas, and candy snacks. Great place to stay!"

I will 100% stay here again when visiting the area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Rhonda’s place. The house is exactly as described, the space is on the smaller side but SO we’ll organized and planned out that it’s perfect for two people and doesn’t feel cramped or small at all. My husband was working from the house doing video work meetings using the Wi-Fi and had zero issues. The location is great for walking or biking into town and the use of the bicycles was a fun treat. If we ever find ourselves visiting Fredericksburg again I would definitely try to stay here again! :)"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rhonda's place was easy to find, and to check in to. It was very clean, but more cozy than I expected. She has a fully equipped kitchen, very compact. So compact that I wouldn't try to cook more than 1 item, if cooking is your thing.
We enjoyed our stay"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable place to stay while in Fredericksburg. Rhonda was very responsive and the lodging had many small touches that made it an above average stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rhonda was extremely helpful: went out of her way to share good places to visit in the area, baked fresh banana bread and delivered upon arrival, and left us some other treats in our perfect lil bungalow! It’s close enough to main st to walk, yet far away enough to feel like you have your own quiet, personal space. I highly recommend Alley Bet ❤️"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rhonda was a wonderful host. Very friendly. Gracious. Personally checked in with us to make sure everything was satisfied. Virtually every attraction in Fredericksburg was within a 10 minute drive. A walk doing certain times of the year could be a little much. Temps were in the teens and low 20’s much of the time we were there. A walk in the heat of a Texas blast furnace summer wouldn’t have been pleasant. My wife and I went there for the Christmas holidays and we found an excellent restaurant open for an Christmas Eve dinner. We cooked our own Christening day dinner and the kitchen met all our needs. All-in-all, we had a great holiday during our stay there! Thank you, Rhonda!"

Thank you Rhonda for the superb experience.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rhonda’s place was a beautiful romantic hideaway in a magical town. The complimentary wine was the icing on the cake!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay we had was very nice. It is quiet and very clean. Enough space for my husband and I. Rhonda gave us a lot of tips to go around town. Very convenient to go to downtown. We enjoyed our stay

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable, super clean space with lots of little thoughtful touches in an adorable area of town. You don't have to bring your own conditioner. ;-) We received OJ, bananas, candy, water bottles, and a bottle of wine. An FYI for newer couples, the bathroom doesn't offer much privacy but the bathroom fans are loud. ;-)"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great amenities and accessibility. Enjoyed our stay. The stay was amazing and the host is very informative about what the town has to offer.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, cozy place to stay. Enjoyed the banana bread and bottle of wine. Rhonda goes out of the way to make everything right."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect & This place ‘Alley Bett’ was our best part of our Fredericksburg experience. Our host was sweet, quick to communicate & very helpful with recommendations."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in Fredericksburg a few times and this place was by far the best! Rhonda’s place has everything you need, is wonderfully located, and is clean and cozy. We will definitely be back on our next trip."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rhonda goes the extra mile to make sure you are taken care of for your stay in Fredericksburg! She is a great HOST.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and the hospitality was out standing.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Attractive and convenient, this is a self-contained unit attached to a private residence. Wonderful hospitality and great little extras made for a fantastic stay. Definitely will try to rebook on our next trip to Fredericksburg."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rhonda was a great host—prompt friendly communication. Alley Bett was a lovely cozy little spot for two. Super clean, king bed (yay!), covered parking, and all the nice extras. Good deal for Fredericksburg—less expensive than a hotel in a quiet neighborhood spot. We will be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I stayed here for a week for our honeymoon. Everyday was perfect and Rhonda and her daughter next door made sure everything went smoothly. The wine, chocolates, and snacks made us feel right at home. The cottage is close enough to town to where you can walk if you want, but still a short drive in. We recommend going during the week if you can as it was much more enjoyable without so many tourists. Alley Bett is a wonderful getaway from the big city."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect stay as we came from New Jersey to celebrate our son’s engagement. The cottage is perfect for a couple and we enjoyed the banana bread immensely!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Close to the main street and everything you could need. Cozy, clean, and comfortable. King sized bed is probably the most comfortable I've ever got the pleasure of sleeping on at an AirBnb.
Great coffee and snack selection too!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful quaint place walking distance to the main area of Fredericksburg. We greatly enjoyed our stay and wished we could have stayed longer. Rhonda was an excellent host and very hospitable! Very clear on instructions and check in.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alley Bett will be our first choice whenever my husband and I visit Fredericksburg alone as a couple! It is the perfect size, perfectly clean and perfectly convenient in every way. The king sized bed was so comfortable and having a covered parking spot in the Texas summer heat was a blessing. The kitchen may be small but it has everything you need. Unless you are planning to cook a big meal that needs lots of prep space, this kitchen is really all you need. The TV is on a wall mount that pulls away from the wall so that you can see it from any place you are sitting. Rhonda is the perfect host, too. She left multiple treats to be enjoyed during our stay and she was so very kind when I told her that I broke a dish. The neighborhood is quiet and we slept soundly! When the heat tired us out, we even enjoyed a long nap in the middle of the day. The large, modern shower was also very inviting at the end of each day. My husband was impressed with the space and appreciated the number of outlets (multiple phones, watches and iPads to charge) and the speed of the wifi. We both agree that there is no place that we would rather stay when it’s just the two of us."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely visit to Alley Bett and would absolutely book it again! This adorable little studio was exceptionally clean and well-appointed. The bed was comfy and the air conditioner was effective - important when it was 100+ outside! Rhonda left us a bottle of birthday wine and a delicious homemade banana bread in the fridge, along with yogurt, water, orange juice, and granola bars. We didn't have to eat breakfast out either morning! The bathroom was clean, modern, and had everything you could need - even makeup remover wipes. Fair warning for friends or new couples staying, there's just a sliding door between the bathroom and bedroom, so not absolute privacy. Not a problem for us, just throwing it out there. The location was great - covered parking, easy walking distance to town through an adorable historic neighborhood, and chickens next door! We really did enjoy our stay and would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy weekend in Fredericksburg."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little place to stay In Fredericksburg, close to Main Street and very comfortable! The room is quaint, cozy and very clean. Perfect for a couple’s getaway!!"

Although I appreciate the keurig and abundant supply of coffee pods, I am a tea drinker. I usually bring my own tea because we tea drinkers sometimes get overlooked. Not here! Plenty of tea pods and tea bags. Snacks, cold bottled water and a bottle of Becker wine were special treats.
Rhonda is extremely quick to respond to any inquiries. It was a lovely weekend and I would stay here again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alley Bett was perfect for our short stay.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Alley Bett is the perfect cottage for a visit to Fredericksburg. I traveled alone for a cycling vacation and it was just right for my needs. Rhonda thought of everything you might need. She had banana bread and and a bottle of wine waiting upon arrival and the breakfast she provided was perfect! It was nice to be able to wash clothes with the washer and dryer in the cottage as I was there for about 10 days. The location is great to be able to walk to Main Street for all the shops and restaurants. I will definitely want to stay there again should I visit Fredericksburg next year for the same cycling trip.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rhonda is the perfect host! We loved our visit to Fredericksburg and especially loved the accommodations. Rhonda adds all of the little touches to make Alley Bett a perfect getaway. We enjoyed the daily walk to Main Street. We will return!

Rhonda made us feel so welcome with a bottle of wine, homemade banana bread, fresh flowers, and myriad other touches that are sure to impress! Excellent proximity to main street attractions. Easily within walking distance. We will be back on our next trip to Fredericksburg! Thanks for making our 5th anniversary so memorable!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alley Bett is just a wonderful place to get away from the hustle and bustle of downtown and yet it’s close enough you could ride a bicycle to town with ease. The little cottage is all that is advertised and more. The cleanliness of the residence is top tier and can top off a nice restful sleep on a king sized bed with a blazing hot shower that you could stay in forever.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect! The private cottage was everything and more. We didn’t want for anything! Loved all the special touches; fresh flowers, banana bread, juices, water and the wonderful bottle of wine! Will definitely be back!"

The A/C kept the place cool & crisp. We weren't successful at getting the fire pit to light, but wrote that off to user error! We would definitely recommend Alley Bett"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're coming in to Fredericksburg for a wedding, a romantic getaway, or just to shop and sight see, book Rhonda's cottage if it's available! My wife and I were in for a wedding and we could not have been more pleased with our choice of locations. It's a cute little cottage in a quiet area not far from Main St. It was spotless, tidy, and had all the amenities from home. A bottle of local wine was waiting for us upon check-in, and the fridge was stocked with bottled water and coffee creamers (there is a Keurig coffee maker complete with K-cups). The host dropped off fresh fruit as well. There is a cool little covered patio out back with a gas fire pit and some bikes available for use if you are so inclined. Bed was comfortable, and there were plenty of towels, soaps, and everything else you might need. The smart TV and high speed internet both came in handy. Rhonda was super fast to respond when we had a question, and the check-in/check-out process is about as smooth as you can get. Highly recommend!"

Alley Bett was the perfect private quaint place to stay for my husband and I to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary (first ) trip to Fredericksburg! This cottage for 2 is so very inviting and accommodating. From the pretty landscape and precious little peach door inviting you into the complete kitchen all the way around to the spacious shower . The king size bed and bedding were very comfortable. The presentation was neat and perfectly clean. My husband was particularly impressed with the cleanliness of the tile in the shower.
When you arrive, you are greeted by a bottle of local wine to enjoy while you are staying in the cottage. The kitchen includes a small stove, microwave, refrigerator and utensils and dishes to fix a meal when you may want to have a lazy morning and eat in. A few times we came back and made a lunch before going back to do more shopping :) . This cottage is centrally located to go to restaurants , shops , Enchanted Rock , the Museum of the South Pacific War, Willow City loop and Old Tunnel state park (summer and early fall for the bat emergence).

Thanks again Rhonda!"

The personal touches really add to the experience, bikes, fire pit, snacks, water, wine and homemade banana bread. Close to main street but far enough to not hear all the noise. Thank you Rhonda for another perfect getaway! See you again soon!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed this stay in town - the room was clean and really over delivered on the little things like bottled water, snacks, etc. A great location too - quiet and secluded, and just blocks from Main Street."

Really enjoyed our stay."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place to stay! Rhonda has so many special touches. A lovely place to call home.
Just a note if you plan to cook - bring all the spices, cooking oil, etc you need. Every Airbnb is different. You will find plenty of dishes but there are no kitchen staples."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Alley Bett was perfect! The photos and description are very accurate. Rhonda's place is cute and cozy, very clean (and she provided plenty of cleaning supplies and sanitizer), had all the amenities (toiletries, towels, well-stocked kitchen, wifi, heat/AC, washer/dryer, etc.), and Rhonda provided us with local recommendations on what do, where to eat, etc. She also provided some breakfast foods and snacks in the fridge, and her mom makes the best banana bread I've ever had. Best of all, she had a Happy Birthday sign and wine for us upon arrival! Checking in and out was easy, communication was great, the location is perfect (walking distance to Main Street and bikes were provided), and it was overall a great value. We appreciate her thoughtfulness and graciousness in hosting us, and we will definitely be back again. Thank you, Rhonda and family!"

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rhonda provided a very comfortable and welcoming place for us to stay in. The house provided all the amenities we needed and much more (for instance, I forgot to bring oil to cook with and the house had cooking spray). It's a short, safe 10 minute walk to Main Street and the fridge inside the house will have plenty of room to accommodate your leftovers and then some. Rhonda was very easy to communicate with, either through text or a phone call. I highly recommend her as a host and to stay at the Alley Bett!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rhonda's thoughtfulness and attention to detail were superb. We had such a wonderful weekend. We went to Fredricksburg with the intention of getting out, but your space gave us the option to stay in when we wanted. It seemed that Rhonda anticipated anything we might need. The bottle of local wine and the banana bread were a great personal touch."

Loved the decor and the bath and kitchen were immaculate. Perfect for two!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ally Bett was perfect for my husband and me. We were very comfortable. Rhonda is a great hostess she provided so many thoughtful extras. The location is perfect; a nice walk or a super quick bike ride to Main St. Everything you need is close by. When we return to Fredericksburg I will book this cottage again (if available).
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place for a weekend getaway! Quick 15 min walk to main st, great amenities including homemade banana bread, OJ, wine and even K cups with coffee creamers! Everything was super clean and the washer/dryer was perfect for a quick pad of laundry during our stay. Outdoor grill and beautiful patio for a relaxing night of grilling too! Couldn’t recommend this guest house more!! We would definitely return :)"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute and cozy place! Sparkling clean and had cute personal touches like fresh baked banana bread, coffee, wine, cold bottled water and some snacks! The location was perfect and Rhonda was so very helpful on giving us local tips. Will definitely return!!"

quiet neighborhood, in a peaceful country town."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alley Bett was a great choice for my birthday weekend in Fredericksburg.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely weekend getaway at Rhonda's cute and cozy cottage. We especially appreciated the extra thoughtful touches--like the bowl of fresh fruit, homemade banana bread, and bottle of wine. We also enjoyed having access to the bicycles to cycle around town."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, close to everything, & responsive & kind host! We had a great stay & would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Fredericksburg. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very spacious place - lots of room to spread out. We were in Fredericksburg for some bike-riding and we had safe and easy storage for our bikes right outside our door. The pool was an added bonus, especially relaxing after a hot day riding. We also had easy plug access for our EV, unexpected but great. Overall, a real pleasure to be in a place well-loved."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place would definitely stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a lovely place, with plenty of room for my friends and I to have our own space but also be together when we wanted to be. I would definitely stay there again!
One thing to note is that the front bedroom of the Asher house is *right* on the highway and has lots of windows. The curtains are solid enough that I didn't feel exposed, but they don't block out much light. I always travel with a sleep mask and white noise machine, so I was fine, but just something to know if you're a light sleeper like me."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My fault for not reading the tiny print but this house is sectioned off into several airbnbs and will be shared by others for the common areas, such as the pool, backyard, courtyard, and parking. The house is beautiful and fun but no laundry available and is located on a very busy street. It has a perfect location for walking distance to Main Street but you will hear traffic day and night. Beautiful and fun home full of natural light."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We felt right at home and stayed several days. The kitchen has everything you will need to make yourself at home. The beds were very comfortable. We enjoyed the courtyard area every day.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brought my family on a girls trip and everything was lovely. Very spacious and clean. Would definitely come back, wish we had planned our trip to stay longer!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"It is on a busy interstate road, so you do hear cars all night. But, the house is great! Clean, cute, cozy and the beds are so comfortable! Lots of space! Great place!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay here! The home was lovely and the grounds were as well. The only cons were that the rooms facing the street were noisy at night due to the road traffic. Also the master suite does not have blinds only thin curtains, so the light came in pretty early. Everything else was wonderful and I would recommend staying here!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Lovely group of homes set around a beautiful pool and hot tub. Location is a bit noisy due to the busy road out the front of the house but the inside is decorated stylishly.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful Place! Great location close to the Main Street. It can get a little loud but you are so busy enjoying the pool and hot tub that you forget about it.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful host and beautiful place!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great place! Excellent host! Very responsive! The bed was so comfortable! Price was very reasonable. Wish I had longer to stay! Came to town for a funeral so only stayed one night but I’ll try to stay here when I come back for a longer stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Rachel was very helpful from start to finish & we had a great stay.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This place is pristine! As family decor lovers, this home has a beautiful and unique touch. Has it all and much more! Large spaces to gather, convenient location, well equipped, clean, comfy mattress, and easy access close to all shops and restaurants in town. definitely renting The Asher Haus again!. Highly recommended."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,We stayed in Asher and throughly enjoyed the accommodations. Great place for our group to relax and enjoy the pill and hot tub after the days of exploring the town and wineries. Would totally recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place!! Excellent service
2023-08-01,4,Group trip,"A great cute stay, we were in Fredricksburg for five days and it was very comforting to come back every night to a cozy house. The beds were nice and spacious, the one thing I would say about the rooms was that the fans didn't circulate enough air. The kitchen was perfect, as was everything else. There was enough seating for my family of six, would reccomend to someone else."
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,"Rachel’s place was cozy, beautifully decorated and spacious for our group of 6. It’s right off a busy road so it got a bit noisy at night, but it was fine. The pool and spa were wonderful and easy to use. Rachel and her team were quick to respond to all our messages. Beds were super comfy and kitchen/bathrooms were fully stocked with essentials. Would definitely consider staying here again!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in The Asher for a girls trip and had a great time! The pool access was easy and essential in the summer, we used the kitchen for a girls night in, and the place was located very central to Fredericksburg. Would come back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rachel’s place was beautiful and peaceful. We loved the pool and backyard. The main house was spacious and had everything we needed for our 3 night stay. 3 king beds were so comfy and roomy. The linens were clean and comfortable and when we needed additional towels we got them immediately. She was very responsive to questions. I’d imagine that the area is walkable, but we drove everywhere without issues with parking. We had a great time here and will be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a little retreat with my friends and this home was absolutely beautiful! The check in description was exactly as it read and the home was not too far from Main to all the local restaurants and shops. The pool and hot tub were so great! We had great walks in the mornings and enjoyed our stay so much we will definitely be returning to stay here!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay overall. The house was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Great location! Very responsive host, although we had to correspond more than I would've liked. The washer and dryer were not accessible and the toiletries were of the wrong denomination (I think we only had lotion and shampoo). The pool and hot tub were a nice treat with this Texas summer heat. Parking is a little tight with their being 4 ""units."" Clear assignments could have helped. Would stay here again and Any inconvenience during this stay was indeed minor which is reflected in the rest of my ratings."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great stay. Pool was amazing. Felt almost like a private pool. Only had to share with 1 other set of guests. Fun get away!

2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice house and very clean. Nice bathrooms. Location good to many places. Cute patio. However, traffic loud at night and too much outside light. Plenty of room and close to the city"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful, relaxing stay. We thoroughly enjoyed the outdoor patio with the fire pit. We had the main house which was fully stocked and clean. I will mention that they were short on bath and kitchen towels but promptly brought us more.
The only drawback is the house is located on a noisy busy road."

We had a small issue come up and the host was very responsive and had everything sorted in less than an hour. Such great communication and customer service!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stunning home with tons of amenities- excellent decor- a lot of space for large groups!! Close to everything we needed and the pool /yard is an entertainers paradise!! Grab family or friends for the perfect get away spot in Fredericksburg Texas style!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most amazing Airbnb we have stayed in! The home is seriously perfect! The bedrooms are huge, and beautifully decorated. It’s fully stocked, and the pool was an added bonus in the Texas heat. Check in was easy, and communication was on point"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time with our family at this home!! It is beyond beautiful and the perfect house for a little retreat in Fredericksburg. It was very close to great coffee shops and restaurants. We loved the pool/spa area. The built in amenities are perfect. We plan to come back next time we stay in Fredericksburg. I highly recommend!!
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"This property really hit all the right notes for us. A quick weekend family getaway to a historic town and property with a pool... what a winner! We really enjoyed the house (The Asher) and found it even bigger than the photos showed.
The beds are all equally comfortable. There's various standing AC units to customize each bedroom to your liking. The kitchen was extremely well-stocked with equipment - as that's how we mostly ate during our stay.
The property is on a bit of a busy road, but they offer sound machines to dull the noise (there's not much traffic at night anyway). But others would call the location convenient.
The pool and amenities were awesome and very welcome in June/July!
Good, clear communication and check-in/check-out policies.
We'd be happy to stay here again."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"The house is in a great location, is beautifully decorated, and was perfect for a mom’s getaway! Couldn’t be happier with our experience!"

It’s a great place to visit!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful place to stay! It’s so well decorated and the beds are super comfortable. The cleanliness is top notch. The property is great for multiple families, we were blessed enough to have the place to ourselves.
My only knock is the accuracy of the location, it is off a busy 4 lane road that has semi trucks going by at night. The host does provide sound machines.
The spa is amazing! Plenty of space to roam out back and lounge around."
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,Jennifer’s place was absolutely perfect! So adorable and perfectly clean and homey. The backyard was super nice! We used the hot tub every night! We loved staying here! Also a close location to town.
