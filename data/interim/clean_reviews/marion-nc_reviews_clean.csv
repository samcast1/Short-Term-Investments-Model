2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie‚Äôs cabin was beautiful, comfortable, and clean. We will be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,The house was beautiful and very clean! The view was even better than advertised. My family and I had a wonderful time and stay! I would recommend this house to anyone looking to stay in Marion.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot and great host! Thanks for the hospitality Stephanie.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The most wonderful stay in the most BEAUTIFUL region! We arrived at night & found it with host instructions. We gasped in morning when we saw the view. It was BREATHTAKING! And the Cabin was more beautiful than the pictures.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Thanks, Stephanie! You made my family's scape to the mountains an awesome experience!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house, They really thought of everything! filled with lots of games and kitchen items. View is amazing! host was very responsive, only wish we could have stayed longer!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My Family and I had a great time at Stephanie‚Äôs property. It was a home away from home. Very spacious but cozy at the same time. The views are worth a million dollars. Stephanie was very responsive to all my questions and concerns. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely beautiful cabin with veiw of the mountains...beautiful location and very peaceful...perfect place for a relaxing vacation and plenty of close by restaurants and places to visit...perfect cabin for our next year vacation...also was very clean and has everything one needs...
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect house for a relaxing mountain weekend with family! The house was as pictured and clean. The bedrooms did not have a tv but Wi-Fi strength was great so our kids were able to watch their tablets to settle them down to go to sleep. Beautiful Mountain View-thanks for a great weekend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"AMAZING experience! House was clean and comfy. Very responsive host, early check in was available. Feels like home away from home!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great Memorial Day weekend at the lil cabin!
The cabin is well equipped, clean and in a very peaceful and safe environment. We fell right at home.
We were out and about during the day and would come back for a relaxing time at the cabin for a nice hot tub and some grilling.
Would definitely pick that place again if we have to opportunity to go back in or around Nebo!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A clean cabin - hosts were very communicative! It should be noted this is a 30min drive south of Nebo's downtown area, so plan your travels accordingly."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wow!!! This is by far one of our favorite Airbnbs we have stayed at. You‚Äôre in a gated community about 3 miles past the gate. Super private with only a few neighbors by. Right in the middle of the woods with great outdoor amenities! The kitchen was well stocked with pots and pans - bring your own foil and bags if you wanna take leftovers home though! Comfy beds! Couch was nap worthy! And the bathrooms were perfectly sized! Every window had a new beautiful view to check out! As it says in the listing there is zero service which was absolutely perfect! We will definitely be back! ü§ç
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous huge cabin on big lot in a beautiful gated community. Thoughtful touches throughout. Go to the grocery store before you get there- you won‚Äôt want to leave again once you arrive. Home is located appx 10 min from the gate. Quiet, peaceful, a Luna moth sighting and 2 early morning bears strolled through the property. The hot tub was easy to use and feels very private. Also the dvd collection is impressive: Twilight AND MST 3000?!?!? We want to be friends with y‚Äôall! 20 stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tranquil haven for my mother and I, we really enjoyed our short stay and would love to come back. Absolutely stunning gated community was nice and quiet and neighbors were friendly"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was great, we really enjoyed our time. The hot tub was perfect and the fire pit was so nice. The place was spotless and the bed was so comfy. We felt right and home and had a wonderful time.
I wish there was bug spray because a lot of mosquitoes were around since it‚Äôs in the woods; and check out was at 11 instead of 10 (especially since check in was after 4).
Other than that, we loved everything about our stay. Will definitely return."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place!!
Super friendly hosts and went above and beyond!! Thank you guys!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great stay, Would stay again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay at lil cub cabin! The house was great and host was very quick to respond to all questions we had. We will definitely book again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to unwind and enjoy nature, the cabin was spacious, clean, and well stocked. The neighborhood is quiet and secluded with lots of surrounding woods and mountains and the hot tub was a perfect place to relax in the evening. I will say that cell service is basically nonexistent, which can be either or a pro or a con depending on your point of view; texts usually went through with Wi-Fi though, but just don‚Äôt expect to be able to have phone conversations. But if you‚Äôre looking for privacy and relaxation, this is the place for you."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place for a couples get away. We loved relaxing at the fire pit in the evenings. It was very well kept and cozy. Carrie was a great host.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend staying at Mini if you are looking for a rural, tranquil, private setting. The accommodation was just as our host described. It truly is ""mini"" but it is also cozy, comfortable, clean, well-organized and feature-rich with a shelter and fire pit, large porch, and gorgeous landscaping. The extras included yummy treats to have with the superb coffee and tea plus all the sweeteners and creamers.
Plenty of towels and washcloths are there along with generous shampoo, conditioner and body wash. We overpacked!
Nice touches were the large screen TV with HBO/Max as well as a Bluetooth speaker system, which were great to have during a multiple-hour downpour one afternoon. Not the host's fault!
All in all everything was spotless and well cared for.
Another nice feature was the proximity to downtown Marion with all it's restaurants and shops.
Our host was easy to contact and answered within minutes each time we updated her.
We loved it and wish we could have stayed longer."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a neat & peaceful setup! Easy to get to, large clear parking right next to your unit, driveway is shared only with the other listing in the back of the property.
Wonderful path to your front door & porch & fire pit sitting areas, all private & facing nature, which is a large hilly lawn with huge trees.
Awesome for listening to & watching birds (get the free Merlin bird song identifier app!)!
The inside is just as good! Well decorated, with lots of nice personal touches, blazing fast dedicated wifi internet, comfortable sitting chair & bed, the kitchenette & bathroom are very well designed, with an optimal guest experience in mind with every detail.
Unit built on mounts for airflow: no radon! üëç
(maybe avoid walking the listing's road: several assertive unleashed dogs are a few blocks away)
Marion is a great town to park downtown & walk east or west on the main drag to/through their historic cemetery & back into town to see/enjoy their many shops/establishments.
Helpful host!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie‚Äôs place was perfect! We visited for two days, and it had everything we needed to relax and attend a wedding nearby. Carrie was very responsive, friendly, and gave us tons of suggestions for things to do in the area. Will stay here anytime we‚Äôre back in the area!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at Mini, and it was once again a great experience. Convenient, clean, comfortable, and relaxing. I‚Äôll definitely be back again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful first anniversary and she made it so special. I only have two small critiques. Multiple times we wished there was a clock in the tiny home, searching for our phones was sometimes an issue üòÇ also we wished we had two snack trays instead of sharing one."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was by far our favorite airbnb that we‚Äôve stayed at. Carrie is such an awesome host! She was so responsive and helpful during our stay. The space is so cute and looks exactly as the pictures show. We had some changes to our booking due to unforeseen circumstances and she was more than understanding. This will definitely be our go to place when staying in town again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Mini matched the description perfectly. It is a beautiful, cozy space. The bed is incredibly comfortable. The refrigerator holds a lot for its size. Carrie filled the water pitcher and ice trays as well as left some nice little treats. I did not have the opportunity to use the fire pit, but I am sure it is wonderful. Carrie's detailed instructions for everything made it seem like home. I needed an AirBNB in a specific location. She was very helpful with providing me needed information during the planning phase. She was very responsive during the entire trip. I would definitely recommend and would stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,‚ÄúMini‚Äù is a fantastic getaway spot! A modern but cozy feel with speakers in the ceiling! 10 out of 10 would happily recommend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the best time on our mini vacation! Carrie was a wonderful host!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful little getaway! Perfect place for couples, we mostly stayed at the tiny house, stayed warm by the fire & enjoyed the pizza delivery ü•∞ we had an amazing Valentine‚Äôs Day & we can‚Äôt wait to book again in the future"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at ""Mini"" was a dream come true for a romantic getaway. It offered a unique blend of privacy, comfort, and charm that made our time together memorable. The tiny home design blended rustic vibes with modern comforts in a way that felt both inviting and luxurious, and its gas fire pit provided the perfect backdrop for rekindling romance and enjoying a peaceful escape. Everything was impeccably clean, and the little amenities were greatly appreciated. We left feeling refreshed and connected, making it a place we would love to return to and recommend to any couple seeking a special retreat. And Carrie was an excellent host that was very responsive and always ready to help !
I would give it a rate of 4.8 only due to issues operating the shower temperature and making sure it was cut off properly. Everything else was perfect, with no issues!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was absolutely wonderful and everything we thought it would be! Definitely would stay again!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host and perfect spot for a weekend getaway!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at Mini for the weekend. We mostly cooked on site so we didn‚Äôt really venture out too much. Carrie was super responsive, very friendly, and made sure that we were comfortable our whole stay. Would definitely recommend to friends and come again :)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie was absolutely amazing and on point with us! She helped us with everything to as far as leaving clear instructions to giving us perfect recommendations. The list of her recommendations for the area was mind blowing for me!! Greatly appreciated from us both!! The mini was Beautiful and perfect space for two! Although it was cold outside, we had a blast hanging at the fire!! The mini DIDNT have a stove to cook food but didn‚Äôt stop us one bit, we brought a little electric stove top and used that for our stay. Everything was perfect for us by far!! I left my favorite pillow and Carrie helped to send it back w ease!! We are for suuuuure coming back to check out the other property ü´∂üèΩ"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie was excellent and all I could expect out of a host of If anyone is on the fence, go for it! You won‚Äôt regret it!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mini was a great couples getaway. Carrie really thought of everything. Cute cups of coffee, tea, and chocolates. 2 of everything. instructions were easy to understand and the diagrams to help were clear and concise. Mini provided us with a peaceful and relaxing place to wind down after a day of hiking and the cold. I would recommend it to my friends and would go back again for a trip myself."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved everything about our stay. Wonderful get away in the mountains!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The stay was peaceful. It was easy to find, private, easy to check in (she even let us check in early if we wanted) and clean upon arrival. Carrie had a lot of great recommendations of things to do in the area and surrounding areas. She made sure we were taken care of during our stay and was very responsive and helpful."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed in Mini for a peaceful and private babymoon. Mini met and exceeded our expectations- couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay. A comfy and cozy place with beautiful scenery. Since it is in a small town, everything is near by. Our host was amazing!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute and cozy little tiny home! We really enjoyed our stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed mini for 2 nights while I was in town for a wedding and it was great! It was modern, clean, and comfortable. It is a quiet area, but very close to downtown Marion. I thoroughly enjoyed the time to myself! Everything you need to be comfortable is there-really comfortable bed, tv with Disney and HBO Max for evening relaxing, microwave and mini fridge, coffee, creamer, fire pit, shampoo, conditioner, soap, soft towels-everything is covered for you to enjoy yourself! The Spillway Bridge and Co. is a bar/restaurant nearby that has local beer and great live music regularly. There was a nearby quick hike with a waterfall called Toms Creek Falls and neat shops in downtown. I will be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and cozy tiny home, nicely decorated and we had everything we needed. Loved sitting by the fire as it was cool in the evenings."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable tiny house. Love the gas fire pit. Close to great hiking.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mini was an absolutely incredible place to stay for our quick weekend getaway for a wedding! While it was a bit more remote than we were expecting, Carrie was extremely responsive in trying to help us get transportation to an event. We were able to find an Uber pretty easily, who took us to and from the event. I was very impressed with Carrie's willingness to help on a Saturday afternoon/evening! The airbnb was in pristine condition and everything we could have asked for was available to us. We hope to be back one day!! Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a great little place! It was peaceful and calm and easy to find. The Mini is adorable. It‚Äôs well thought out and better than a hotel ANY DAY! I will definitely stay again next year!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"mini was beautiful, comfortable, and just perfect for our little weekend getaway! Carrie was a wonderful host, always responsive, flexible, and kind!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can‚Äôt say enough about this place. It was amazing. Has a yard to run around in, at night the fireflies come out, the picnic table was a great place to eat and relax as well as the fire pit. It has everything you need in close proximity to downtown Marion.
We used it as a touch down spot to sight see and explore the area and I think we were so comfortable at the ‚Äúmini‚Äù that we spent more time there than expected. It certainly didn‚Äôt disappoint and we will be back during foliage."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was clean, had all the amenities you could need, and is in a beautiful part of North Carolina. Food and shopping less than 10 minutes away, and a very peaceful setting. Not much more to say‚Ä¶.would definitely stay here again"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carrie communicated in the beginning and throughout stay. Wee needed location close to family at Lake James. The Mini was perfect and only 12 minutes away.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mini was small but clean and well organized. I would say 2 people is the max for this space. The house itself is hotel quality in cleanliness but has a ""homey"" feel. The host clearly cares for her guests and thinks of the little things like instructions for the shower, restaurants and attractions nearby, fully stocked bathroom with first aid kit, and much more! I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mini was a great base for a visit to see family and go to a reunion. It is a few miles from Marion, but very easy to get to restaurants, tap rooms and hikes. And it is very peaceful and quiet- perfect to relax at the end of the day.
Carrie has a number of great recommendations for restaurants, coffee shops and taprooms. Or just wander around in town and do your own investigations. And Carrie‚Äôs enthusiasm for Western North Carolina and Mini is infectious.
Mini does have a few quirks, as it is a Tiny home, but follow the instructions provided and all will be well.
Enjoy!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mini was a great visit! For a tiny home, they utilize the space they have really well! It was really clean, quiet and relaxing. Carrie was very responsive, friendly and proactive. She generously offered early check in and late check out without us even asking and she provided so many great recommendations! I would highly recommend staying at Mini, and we might even try to stay at Mac in the future with our kids (Mac is a little bigger than Mini). Mini was located right between Black Mountain and Boone so we had plenty to do. I 100% agree that Carrie is a super host!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! Property was well maintained. The house was beautiful and clean. Outdoor sitting space was wonderful and the communication from the host was excellent! Overall a terrific experience!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie was an amazing host. Very attentive. The ‚Äúmini‚Äù was perfect for our getaway. So beautifully decorated. She took the time to personalize our visit, and all our needs were more than met. The outdoors space was so peaceful and relaxing. We were close to downtown, which offered a variety of restaurants and cute shops. So much to explore including lake James, Morganton, blowing rock and of course the beautiful views from the parkway. We definitely will be returning."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best host yet!! Y‚Äôall need to give her a visit when y‚Äôall can!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved it, it was beautiful unique and cozy. They have everything you need and was very clean. The bed is extremely comfortable, which is always a plus! I enjoyed the outdoor space and the peaceful nature. Also it is located in a great area, about 15 minutes from Lake James and 40 mins to Asheville."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carrie was super helpful. She was an excellent host. They were small details about our anniversary and she left a beautiful note to the two of us. I highly recommend staying with her.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mini was a wonderful place to stay. Carrie is a fabulous host who considers all the details with such thoughtfulness.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time . Was very cute and romantic for us. We loved it üòä
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie was a top-notch host. She was easy to contact, her place is super cute, clean and comfortable. She made us feel like long lost friends that needed a place to stay. Very welcoming. Highly recommend."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie is an excellent host! She responded to us anytime we needed anything. She has written instructions for any and everything you might need.
The tiny home is very cozy and a great one room option. The only issue for us is that we wake up at different times and it was raining and cold outside both mornings, and the covered fire area still allows a few drips through, but that‚Äôs on us for our own personal issues üòâ
The only reason this isn‚Äôt 5-stars has nothing to do with Carrie or the tiny home, because none of it was under her control. Friday night we had a few loose dogs force us inside, and the local gun enthusiasts began target practice for a few hours, the neighbor across the street stood outside talking on the cellphone for a while very loudly while we were trying to enjoy our romantic getaway.
Then Saturday evening, there must have been a nearby concert of some kind, so our romantic, quiet evenings we hoped for were different experiences. But it was adventurous üòáüòÄ"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our experience with Carrie was one of the best host I‚Äôve experienced in the many air bnbs I‚Äôve stayed in. She was friendly and accommodating and Mini was a super cute perfect tiny home. So inspired we want one of our own. We drink a lot of coffee and it was stocked. There were personal touches like welcome sign with our names and chocolate left to enjoy over watching tv after working an event in the area. I couldn‚Äôt be any happier that how we were treated in this sweet little town and home.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie was so responsive, friendly, and accommodating to my friend and I during our short stay. She went above and beyond with recommendations, answering our questions, and making sure we were comfortable. The mini was so cute, modern, and clean. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Definitely recommend
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie was great! Mini was amazing :) I cant recommend this place enough! It was close enough to downtown Marion to go enjoy all of the restaurants and shops, but felt secluded and peaceful."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very well kept and scenic place, also budget friendly. Carrie is friendly and responsive."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay in mini! The details made for such a great experience!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mini was everything the listing said it would be and more! We enjoyed our stay. Carrie was a great host!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie is so kind! And Mini was the perfect spot to get away from the city. Admittedly, I'm an absolute nut when it comes to cleanliness, and you guys- when I say it was *spotless ü§å I've rarely ever felt so comfortable. It's a perfect little spot for a vacation, and I'd highly recommend staying here to anybody that asks. We'll definitely be visiting again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay. Carrie was very nice and helpful. I love tiny homes and this made it better. Definitely will be coming back and might stay at the max next time!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I selected Carrie's location for a solo writing retreat. Not only was the setting peaceful and tranquil... which was great for thinking, Carrie left me a thoughtfully inspiring note. I felt like I wasn't just another guest, but she was genuinely interested in my stay. And I can't say enough about how beautiful her space was. Thanks Carrie, I will definitely be back! I have more writing to do. üìñ"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mini was adorable and spotlessly clean. When it comes to amenities, Carrie has thought of everything. She was the perfect host‚Ä¶easy to reach, responsive, and she checks in with you to make sure everything is okay. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Carrie!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful tiny house! Was very easy to check in, and great instructions! Would rent again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was the cutest little place, clean cozy and thoughtfulü§ç"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre in Marion, this is definitely the place to stay! Carrie was super helpful with recommendations for the area and just checking in on how we were doing the whole time. The place is super cute and has everything you would need! Her sweet personal touches made the trip!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time, it was just the perfect get away that we were looking for. Carrie was extremely helpful and wonderful!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute little home away from home! It was just what I needed after work! Carrie was very personable from checking in with me periodically to a sweet welcome message on the chalk board! Definitely a sweet touch! I plan to stay again soon!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little place, wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the outside space!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Went with my 12 year old daughter for a girls getaway and we absolutely LOVED it!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, would definitely recommend!! Looks just like the pictures and felt very clean and safe. The welcome sign, the Christmas lights, and all the comfy details she added really made it stand out. Would for sure stay here again:)"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful stay quiet east drive , very good communication 100% would recommend !!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"such a lovely experience. i loved staying here and felt so at peace sleeping here. definitely a perfect place for a mini getaway.
such a sweet lady <3 will most likely book with her again in the future!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Let me say, our stay was fantastic. She was so communicative, helpful with recommendations, and even added personalized little touches that was so kind. Marion is a sweet little town and the airbnb is located close to everything but just far away to where you have peace and quiet. Mini is mini, but is exactly as the pictures describe. It works perfectly for one or two guests. Marion is close to many local hikes and Asheville is just about a 40 minute drive. If I ever come to the area again I would absolutely check to see if this airbnb is available before searching for others. It felt like a home away from home and truly exceeded all expectations! I can't recommend this airbnb enough!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mini had everything we needed. It was easy to find and all the personal touches made us feel welcomed. Highly recommended!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little hideout in Marion! Nice central location to a lot of the best Western NC has to offer. Check in was easy! Carrie was super helpful! Mini is definitely small but that‚Äôs what we were looking for! Overall, great stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I went here for our anniversary and we have nothing but great things to say. This was our first air bnb experience and I can say with confidence it will be hard to beat anywhere else. Extremely clean and cozy perfect for a weekend get away or extended trip.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love it here great time glad I was able to stay here
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This house was awesome and perfect for our stay. Marion was a very fun town and the hikes nearby were fantastic. We would love to stay again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We‚Äôve gotten to stay in the Mac during another stay, and our time in the Mini was just as enjoyable. The outdoor set-up with fire pit and chairs is such a great way to make the most of the peaceful environment. We will definitely be back."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay for a quick work trip.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I loved our weekend getaway at the mini! Cozy place with everything you need. Carrie was a great host and checked in with us via app during our stay. Great stay!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely fell in love with the Mini. Everything was exactly how pictured and it‚Äôs beautiful. The mini is in the perfect location, it was very clean, and I felt safe. I can‚Äôt wait to visit again, and the host Carrie, made my stay that much better."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mini was the perfect tiny home for me & my boyfriend to get away for the weekend. Carrie is a great host and made everything so smooth. Mini is so cutely decorated and a very neat/tidy space. We thoroughly enjoyed spending the evenings around the fire pit area. Mini is in a great location with a quick 15 minute drive to Old Fort- highly recommend Hillman Beer & Headwaters Kitchen! It‚Äôs also only about a 30 minute drive to the Black Mountain area. I highly recommend checking out Louise‚Äôs Kitchen, Black Mountain Brewing, and Lookout Brewing. We also went to Oak & Grist Distillery- lovely experience & yummy cocktails! We also loved Burrito Bros & the Feisty Goldfish which were only a 6 minute drive from Mini. This trip was awesome and Mini is definitely one of the nicest tiny home we have stayed in! Thanks again Carrie!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This mini house was amazing, had a great time!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We liked it so much the first time, we came back for a second trip. Everything is exactly as described."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Second time staying at the mini and loved every second of it again! Everything about the place is perfect and Carrie is a wonderful host!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic mini!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quaint little tiny home with all the amenities you need! Carrie was great with communicating and the property exceeded our expectations! Very clean, quiet and great location in Marion. I would highly recommend staying here!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great hostess with good communication as well as great little thoughtful touches. Would come back again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little getaway to a small town in the mountains. If you're looking for a peaceful place with a little bit of cuteness, the Mini is perfect! It's in a great location, within 5 mins drive to downtown Marion, 40 min drive to downtown Asheville, 20 min to a small waterfall hike at Tom's Creek Falls and 15 min to Lake James...all of which were on my itinerary during my 3 night stay.
It was easy to find & while I was initially concerned when I saw a few ppl walking along the main road with bags omw to the Mini, I am a single female traveler & felt absolutely safe here. Entrance is signed and you can leave the Mini well lit outside if returning in the evenings, as I did almost every night. I was undisturbed & it was wonderful.
The space is small and perfect for solo travel. Water gets hot, WiFi was great (and needed for my Verizon service lol), the Bluetooth speaker was amazing to have my audible app playthrough and the outdoor space is adorable. My only small complaint was more of a preference thing. I have a bad back so the soft bed didn't do me any favors but again, that's a preference thing so not really a complaint imo. I'll bring my back brace with me next time :)
Carrie is a sweetheat of a woman, an amazing communicator, and has detailed lists of everything you need to know. She responded very quickly to any questions I had & was a joy to have as a host.
I loved my time here and recommend to anyone looking for a cozy peaceful stay. I'll definitely be back!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved it! The place was perfect down to every little detail. The place was spotless and well-decorated, the bed was super comfy, the bluetooth speakers were a nice touch and easy to connect to, and Carrie went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed. I wish I had read the info on how to work the hot water before my first shower but I read it after and it worked fine. I‚Äôd definitely stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved my one-night stay at Carrie's cute tiny home. The best part was how helpful Carrie was! When I asked her for local recommendations, she went above and beyond.

The place is very nice, it‚Äôs in a quiet area but just minuets down the road you can find a lot to do! 7 minutes away they had skating and a movie theater not to far from each other. My favorite feature of mini is the speakers and the firepit they are very convenient when you and your spouse want to listen to some Jams with some wine and relax. She has laminated instructions for anything and everything you might have questions on and I thought that was smart and it was cute ü•∞ I absolutely loved it and could not ask for a better host or place to have stayed.

On top of that, she went above and beyond when the fire pit wasn't working, and I really really appreciated that. Her places are adorable and only five minutes from downtown Marion.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Carrie is such a wonderful host. You can see all the love that she puts into mini as soon as you step foot on the property. The personalized message she left on the chalk board was a wonderful touch. My husband & I left Disney World and checked into Mini the next morning. They say Disney is magical so it was only fitting that we booked Mini. She was even more magical. We had such a relaxing time there. This place felt so peaceful & inviting. Carrie does an amazing job keeping Mini up and added lots of special touches to the space. There's everything you need there. We didn't want to leave.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mini is a great little place for an individual or a couple to stay for a few nights. It is large enough to not feel cramped, but if you have a lot of luggage for a longer trip, you may consider a larger place. The WiFi and TV worked very well, and the Bluetooth speakers in the ceiling were a cool touch to the room! The fire pit was nice to sit by, but the nearby street light does take a little away from the ambiance of sitting by a fire. The shower temperature was a little difficult to control, but reading the instructions that Carrie provided was very helpful.
Overall, it is a great property, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a little place in the Marion area!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay out in the country, but close enough to town if you need something. Definitely will look into staying again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We felt at home on this beautiful property. So much to do and explore. Everything you need to relax and enjoy the surroundings are right at your fingertips.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb, was one of the best we have rented.

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"House was great. Couldn't have asked for a better house. I do wish that the lack of cell service at the house was put in the listing itself. The wifi is listed as spotty but it's barely usable. With that being said, it did not detract from the stay all too much. If you're looking for a getaway then this is a great house."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time. What was very coincidental was that my cousin who I hadn't seen in over 50 years had rented your place back in February and had a very good time as well. Loved it! Will definitely keep this in mind for future visits.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful stay. We were pleased to arrive and find a very clean house. We were greeted with snacks and smore fixings. We enjoyed walking the grounds, sitting by the campfire at night and the beautiful location. Thank you!"
2023-04-01,4,Group trip,Had an amazing time with my disc golf team there. The area was enough for all 8 guys and quiet enough for us to get outside and do some practice. The only downside the team has was that the wifi could not keep up when 4 guys were home at one time. Outside of that everything was great from the amenities provided to the responses I got from the host
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful home that was great for our budget! We felt spoiled. Michaela and Jaden were incredible hosts! We will definitely be back.

2022-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Very nice place if your wanting a place that is sort of ‚Äúoff the grid.‚Äù There is barely any cell phone signal, Wi-Fi or cable television. Other than that we had a fantastic time."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place tucked in a beautiful surrounding. It had everything we needed. Our hosts were really responsive to our emails and there were lots of little touches that made it so welcoming. Snacks for when we arrived, all the makings for s‚Äômores for the fire and so much more. When we head back down to NC we would love to stay here again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is beautiful and extremely clean. It is the perfect set up for a family reunion. They have board games and plenty of seating everywhere.

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent weekend getaway. Plenty of Space to relax and unwind while still being close to the city. Super Clean.
Would Highly Recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of the best Airbnbs that I have personally ever stayed at. The house was spotless when we went in and the pictures do not do it justice. We had a lot of of fun just hanging around the creek, and the property.
The location is pretty good too. You‚Äôre about 30 minutes to Black Mountain and 45 minutes to Asheville. Downtown Marion is also very close by, but I would note there isn‚Äôt too much to do there.
If you are into disc golf, there is a resort course that‚Äôs only 20ish minutes away, and a private course, Sugaree is 45 mins away and is absolutely incredible. You can definitely use this Airbnb as a home base for a disc golf centric vacation.
Of course, there‚Äôs also a ton of beautiful trails nearby.
I highly recommend this Airbnb for any family vacations!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We were here for a quick trip for a wedding and it was amazing. Very clean and super cute touches everywhere. The check in was seamless and the location was beautiful. Highly recommend!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent accommodations. Very clean, the sheets were great quality, plenty of towels and the best part were some snacks left out for us upon our arrival. We didn't have a chance to go to the store before we got there so it was much appreciated! It's a lovely house and the land surrounding is gorgeous. There are great walking trails and exploring the property is a delight."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved staying at Little River acres! It was fantastic with the kids, and they even had a playpen in one of the closets and outside swing for our little one. We will definitely be coming back for more family adventures"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Michaela & Jaden place was a wonderful. Loved all the thoughtful amenities and were as mentioned. The addition of a child swing added extra touch. My family of 8 throughly enjoyed the stay. If it was possible we would have stayed one more day.
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Great spot!

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! We‚Äôve stayed multiple times. Hosts are very nice and helpful!
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,Very clean house and great location. It is very private and the scenery is beautiful. Great place to get away
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy and a perfect getaway, no phone service gives everyone the chance to disconnect from the outside and connect with each other. The amenities provided were perfect for spending time with family and friends, outdoor and in."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A special home on a beautiful property. Clean, private, beautiful. There were special gifts and extra touches that made our stay even more enjoyable. The kitchen was well stocked and we appreciated the night lights too. :) We enjoyed exploring the property and dipping our toes in the creek. Loved Christmas decor in the home. Excellent communication with hosts. I would definitely stay here again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was awesome and had anything you might need, it exceeded our expectations. It was nicely decorated for Christmas and it felt like home. Great family memories were created, will definitely be back!"

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,This was absolutely one of the best experiences we‚Äôve had in an Airbnb. Everything was perfect. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!
2021-10-01,4,Group trip,"Lovely place. Fire pit supplies and setup is amazing! Very peaceful and secluded. Important note, though: Save the directions and especially the lockbox code to your phone in advance! We arrived only to realize we had no signal and couldn't pull up the lockbox info : ( Had to drive back towards town until we had signal."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,We liked the house! Beautiful and peaceful location. Would like to come again
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Little River Acres is an amazing place for a mountain get-away. The property is big, beautiful and very private. The location is great and the facilities are top- notch. Great place for a family gathering."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a Great Place!
when we arrived, check-in was super easy and the place was spotless clean! Everything was as described.
Morning coffee on the porch while listening to the rain was just what I needed. The kitchen is stocked with modern amenities and there are plenty of places in the home for your family to gather.
Although the property is ""remote"", you are within an hour of Chimney Rock, Lake Lure and Little Switzerland.
Also a great place to unplug. We did not have any ATT service on the property, but did within 1/2 of the home to check in on things. The home does have Wi-Fi, but not the high speed you may be used to having available. This kept my college aged daughter off of her device for the most part (which was great).
There were some weather issues prior to our arrival. The hosts kept us in the loop of any accessibility issue, which there were none. Great communication!
would definitely stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful home near the mountains. So quiet and peaceful around. It was very clean , well stocked and had everything as described. We had a great time and will be back sometime."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,My friends & I absolutely loved this stay!! Everything you needed & some. I recommend Michaela & Jadens property to anyone. Any chance I get to make it back down to the area myself I‚Äôd love to stay here again!
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful property, awesome home, very clean. Very well equiped with everything we needed. Including the S'mores kit and fire starter. We will stay again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful property, quiet location. It was a perfect stay with an awesome fire pit and s‚Äômores fixin‚Äôs. We will be back."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is absolutely wonderful and located in such a special place. As a family we enjoyed the relaxing and comfortable inside and beautiful outside. If visiting this part of North Carolina, it‚Äôs a must to stay here."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house has it all, front porch rockers, swings for both adults and kids, back porch swing and plenty of land to hunt lighting bugs. The creek was our favorite! It shimmers! Comfortable and Cozy we easily slept six but it could‚Äôve held more. Would definitely visit again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent place for our family! They had everything we needed and more! will stay here next time we are in the area!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great place to stay on an amazing property! We will definitely stay here again if we are in the area again!
2021-07-01,4,Group trip,"Little Rivers was a very nice place to relax and spend time with family. The house was well equipped, with everything needed and a few extras. The only downside was the Wifi service. I needed to get some work completed, but wasn‚Äôt able to do any work. It may help to add a Wifi booster for better service. It would be helpful to have two sets of keys., for others in the party. It would make it easier for everyone to come and go. I would bring the family back to Little Rivers again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,If your looking for a amazing weekend in the mountains this is the place for you and your family. plenty of space for every one to spread out and something for everyone to do. Can not say enough good things about this home.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Michaela and Jordan‚Äôs place was the ideal place for my multi-generational family to enjoy the NC mountains. My 80-year-old father could easily navigate the home. He was also able to walk to the fire pit and enjoy family time around the fire, which he did nightly. My grandsons were so excited when they entered the home and spied the Smores supplies and the candy. Walks around the beautiful property were a favorite activity of my son and granddaughter. The front porch was my favorite spot to enjoy a cup of morning coffee and read.
The creek is deceiving. At first glance it looks ankle deep, but we soon discovered it had spots that were knee deep and perfect for cooling off in the afternoon.
Little River Retreat is very clean and well maintained. The setting is peaceful and private. Marion is a few minutes away and a charming town. Little River‚Äôs location is the perfect home base for visiting Asheville, Black Mountain, Mount Mitchell, and other Western NC attractions. Less than 10 minutes away is Lucky Strike Campground and Gold and Gem Mining as well as Vein Mountain Gem Mining. Both places were big hits and many gemstones, including geodes were found.
We will definitely return!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place for hosting our friends reunion. Peaceful countryside location with proximity to hiking and charming mountain towns. Hosts took great attention to detail in providing items to make us feel at home (ie s‚Äômores kit for the fire!) Clean place and great host communication.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a wonderful property and a great weekend getaway. We will be back again. They surprised my niece with a happy birthday sign and a cookie cake. We were able to hang 3 hammocks up for the kids. The kids loved the creek and the swings on the Porch. The adults enjoyed sitting outside and watching the kids have a great time. I loved not having cell service it made me have to turn off the phone and truly relax.
2021-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,The grounds and the house are beautiful and far enough removed from many distractions you don‚Äôt want when you really are trying to relax. The front porch was phenomenal and a great place to spend a lot of your time. The back porch is large excellent for family sized gatherings. The fire ring was icing on the cake for every evening; topped with s‚Äômores compliments of our hosts. The only thing I can say is that the internet was nearly non-existent. For the little work I had to do it made for much lost time locating a coffee shop close enough that also opened before 8am. I ended up having a MINIMUM 15-25 minute drive every morning.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Lovely home. Highly recommended for families looking for a weekend getaway to the mountains. Very peaceful and secluded. Plenty of things to do outdoors with the creek nearby, and at the house."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Very nice place to stay! It was super welcoming, clean, and very spacious! My family and I had a very nice stay at this location and would definitely return here in the future!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Staying at Little River Acres was an enjoyable experience. Our first impression was that of gratitude for Michaela and Jaden to hang a happy birthday banner and leave a cookie cake for our daughters birthday extravaganza. The home was warm and welcoming, very clean, and accessible to all our needs. It was also nice to spend time with my girls since the WiFi (Verizon) did not work often, creating some difficulty with navigation on my GPS. Other than that I would highly recommend their home and will definitely return to enjoy the peace and solitude it provided. Thank you so very much for your thoughtfulness and allowing us to share your home!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay! The privacy and outdoor area was much appreciated. The home was welled equipped and super clean. The supplies for making s‚Äômores were a welcomingtouch!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second trip to Little River Acres. Just as great as first time. Wonderful hosts. Will definitely return again.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was such an excellent location for a weekend family get away. The amenities were excellent as were the views! Great place for a family (and pets) to hike, play outdoor games, and have a campfire! They also had accommodations for babies available. Will definitely stay here again!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our night at Michaela & Jaden‚Äôs was perfect! The house was so clean and cozy and had everything we needed for an amazing night with the family! From outdoor games to basketball and s‚Äômores at the fire pit, it was just what our family was looking for :) close to Asheville and beautiful mountains, we will definitely be back! The hosts were also so nice and helpful, communication was great! Thank you for everything!"
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Very clean and great location.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, and the pictures didn‚Äôt do it justice ! Plenty of space and fully equipped for a great time! It is a fantastic secluded spot for a weekend away and we didn‚Äôt wanna come back to the real world ! We would recommend this house to anyone!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great secluded location, but still not too far from stores and restaurants. My friends and I really enjoyed our stay."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and I really enjoyed our stay. It begin with a beautiful drive from I40 down to the property. Along the way we saw goats, ponies, cows and a wild turkey. I live in Kentucky and the plank fencing I noticed on the way to Little River Acres reminded me of Kentucky but more beautiful with the back drop of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
Upon arrival to the house we discovered lovely furnishings and warm and welcoming atmosphere. The kitchen counters and cabinets are unique and beautiful!!
The front porch is a great place for gatherings, reading and reflection.
The hosts were very responsive and delightful.
Little River Acres is a wonderful place. Already planning our next trip.
Anna B."
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Such a hidden gem! We felt like kids at camp. I beyond recommend! The property is beautiful, the house is cozy as can be, and we felt right at home. Hosts were kind, helpful, and easy to communicate with."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Michaela & Jaden have made the Little River Retreat available and it's a lovely place to visit! really I appreciated the responsive communications leading up to our visit and good descriptions/pictures of the property that set expectations perfectly. We so enjoyed a 'down weekend' in the countryside, peaceful and quiet in such a beautiful setting. The home was very clean, well furnished, and comfortable. If we are in the area again we would love to stop back..."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Michaela and Jaden‚Äôs place is a piece of gem. Our family enjoyed staying at their place. They are very thoughtful and nice. I will definitely recommend this place .
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ruthann‚Äôs place was perfect for our visit to the Bigfoot festival. The house was within walking distance of the event but felt very private and quiet. Super clean and Lisa went above and beyond to make sure we felt comfortable and at home. We‚Äôll be back!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First of all what a clean and well decorated stay! I felt like I was back at grandmas house (with newer furniture of course) At first I was bummed out once I noticed there was no TV in any space however I was in town for business so in reality not much time was spent in the house except to sleep or change clothes. All in all it was a good stay at a very reasonable priceüëçüèº Quiet, safe neighborhood as well."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"George and Lisa are great hosts. Communication is quick, and solid suggestions on food and drink!
The place is a nice size and all of the amenities of home. Beautiful wooded lot off of the rear patio.

My wife and I highly recommend Ruthanne‚Äôs Place!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful little cottage in a gorgeous town! Lisa was wonderful to work with, and her home was immaculate. We have stayed at many rental homes over the years, and this was by far the best! Everything you could need, is included. From toiletries, to soaps, and even speciality coffee.

Loved everything about Ruthanne's woodland cottage...including all the lovely flowers, the deer that visited us, and the comfortable and welcoming cottage. Honestly, the picture doesn't capture just how lovely this place is. Our host was great and made sure we had everything we needed. Marion is just a short drive to Dupont State Forest, downtown Asheville, Hendersonville, Linville caverns, Linville Falls, and Table Rock Mountain. We took advantage of all of it and had a great time hiking up mountains and exploring waterfalls. I highly recommend this place!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa's place is so cozy and inviting it really was a pleasure to stay there.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Ursula‚Äôs cabin is amazing! We are already thinking about when we can come back again! The creek provides an amazing view and is so relaxing to listen to! We loved waking up hearing the birds and water in the morning. There were so many beautiful butterflies around the cabin it felt like a fairytale. The cabin is so clean and had everything we needed for cooking (pots, pans, spices, coffee)
The wood stove was so fun to make fires in and cozy to watch while we relaxed on the couch! We appreciated the available wood! Ursula was very kind!! She made us feel welcomed and gave us suggestions! She also provided comfortable chairs while looking out at the gorgeous mountain view! Definitely recommend seeing the view and the hiking trails on the property. Thank you for having us and our dog üê∂ who had a blast exploring! We can‚Äôt wait to book again next year!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for having us Ursula, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the cabin.
It was a pleasure meeting you.
Tom and Regine"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One does not get all five star reviews for no reason. Ursula is the ultimate host, and this house is a dream come true. We need a place to relax with our dogs, and we could not imagine anything better than this home. Ursula became a friend as well as a precious host, and the home was beyond our expectations. Whatever you can imagine by looking at the pictures, expect more."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"As I have been to at least a dozen VRBO's and Airbnb's, I was so surprised at the value this unit offered and when I was looking at booking, the final price blew me away....and not in a bad way. The additional fees the owner was charging was so very reasonable and made the desire to stay there even the more perfect.
How this unit was available to me at the last minute was indeed a miracle. Then of course I was waiting to make my final accessment until I actually arrived at the unit. Cause at this price...something had to be awry. But as soon as I got out of the car I could hear the stream out back and when I walked onto the larger wrap around porch I was even more surprised how closes the stream was to the back of the home!
I was reminded of Psalm 23: The Lord is my shepard, I shall not want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures and leads me beside the still waters and restoreth my soul......
Also the drive up to this location was a drivers dream with awesome mountain views!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The love and care Ursula has put into the cabin being a tranquil retreat has paid off in a big way! It's warm, welcoming, relaxing, and the perfect place to recharge. Ursula is extremely responsive and kind. My dogs took quite the shine to her and we all enjoyed exploring the property together. I cannot thank her enough for the experience and warm welcome."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great quiet weekend away. We arrived on Friday and left on Sunday, so our visit was short but just what we needed. When arriving to the area on Friday, I saw Ursula had already messaged me on when we would be arriving. We wanted to walk around the nearby downtown area, so I was able to give an around about time. When we arrived at the cabin, there was a cozy fire in the wood burning stove and she had left some chocolate and apples. The bottled water was a nice touch, as well. We drove to Spruce Pine for dinner, which was lovely. We stayed on the grounds for the whole of Saturday: hiking, grilling, laying around, and we were able to meet Ursula. She was super helpful and had a few suggestions for things to see and do. She also messaged me with those suggestions so we had a list to go by. We hope to be back soon!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the perfect cozy cabin in the woods while still being central to all there is to do in the area. The caverns, Little Switzerland, multiple hikes and waterfalls, gem mining, downtown Spruce Pine, etc. are all within a 30 minute drive. There is a beautiful view of the creek flowing beside the cabin from the porch - I enjoyed my morning coffee watching the water flow. We would listen to the creek through the screen door and it was so serene. You can take a small, easy hike up the creek to a small waterfall, which my 5 year old was so excited about. He also caught his first salamander. The cabin was very clean and stocked with everything we needed, including lots of extra blankets and wood for the wood burning stove. I also appreciated the reasonable checkout cleaning requirements, that can be hard to come by on Air BnB! The host was very communicative, responsive, polite and helpful. Great experience all around!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect airbnb experience. We've stayed in many airbnbs, including many excellent one's, and Ursula is the best most gracious host we've had the pleasure of meeting. The house is so lovely and comfortable, the wood stove is amazing, and everything has been set up to ensure a good experience for guests. The land around the cabin is so beautiful - it is like you are situated right on a mountain trail. And in fact, there are trails on the property which we highly recommend walking. Wonderful experience and will certainly hope to be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very private location and cozy cabin. Really enjoyed with everything! Creek had therapeutic effects and everyone in our family had opportunity to just fall asleep while relaxing.
Cabin itself is one of not so many places you can tell it has a soul. It‚Äôs cozy, has everything you would need.
Definitely, added to my list of the favorite places!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Ursula‚Äôs cabin was perfect! So cozy and peaceful. We stayed for a whole week, 3 adults and two dogs. The porch is awesome and we loved the fireplace. We day hiked everyday and Ursula recommended good hikes to see waterfalls. Lots of hills and windy roads, very private but feels safe. The stream is lovely. It felt like home and we were sad to leave. Thank you Ursula for being such a lovely host, it was wonderful to meet you!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! Stream is very ncie
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed the most peaceful, relaxing, and serene weekend at the cabin; felt right at home from the moment we walked in.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the most peaceful beautiful place I‚Äôve ever stayed. Host was immediately responsive and so super helpful!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This little get away cabin is the perfect place to reset your mind and body. Being able to hear the stream when you go to bed or wake up in the morning is an absolute dream. The house is well stocked incase you need anything or if there is a rainy day. We honestly didn't want to leave. Can not wait until we go back for a visit!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This has to be my favorite Airbnb ever! The location in the woods, next to a creek that can be enjoyed from a wonderful wrap-around porch exceeded expectations. The word that comes to mind is ""magical"". Even washing dishes at the kitchen sink was a pleasure since it has to be the coolest sink I've ever seen. When we come back, we'll check out the trails on the property! Thank you, Ursula."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My sister and dog Elliott and I loved staying at the creekside cabin -- especially sitting in the rocking chairs on the large, charming porch directly overlooking the rushing creek with its tiny waterfalls (and the porch has a closed gate for the dog). The ever-present rushing water sound was very soothing. She's even got a hammock down there now by the creek. The cabin inside is so charming -- a perfect blend of historic, country, and modern styles. The beds and pillows were very comfy. The cozy house is so well stocked with kitchen items (dishes, spices, oil, coffee, etc.) towels, blankets, books, games, DVDs (bring your own condiments). She had fresh flowers, sweet treats, and some home-made artisan soaps. It's at the end of a street so it's quite private. The only other house belongs to Ursula but it is up above on a hill. She lets us walk up the gravel driveway and some steps past her main house to get to the lounge chairs that are at a mountain overlook perfect for sunset!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Ursula‚Äôs place is a wonderful cabin in the woods at the very end of the road. I could have sat all day outside on the porch listening to the creek. Very peaceful and close to so many great hikes on the Blue Ridge and in Pisgah NF. We also made it over to Round Bald on Roan Mountain, which had the best views of our trip."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely wonderful stay! Enjoyed the weather and local trails. The cabin is perfect!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you, Ursula, for providing such a unique stay.
This property offered so much!
We enjoyed taking morning walks on the trails with the dogs, exploring the creek to discover the waterfall, and relaxing on the deck just listening to the creek, all with total seclusion. The mountain view is perfect for sunrises and sunbathing, then watching the sky turn pink from the sunset.
The cabin was clean from cobwebs. The linens were fresh and abundant. The kitchen had everything we needed for our weeks stay without the clutter that sometimes can be
overwhelming when you're a guest.
Ursula was the 1st host on a property that we experienced during a stay, and I'm glad she was there! She was a lovely host who respected our privacy but made sure everything was perfect!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,This cabin was so heavenly I didn't want to leave! I could sit on the porch and listen to that stream for hours. We loved exploring the property and Ursula's helpful signs and directions made it easy. Inside nearly everything we could need was supplied for us. All this and more make this one of the best Airbnbs we have ever stayed in.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was absolutely lovely! Ursula left little touches all over that made the cabin comfortable and inviting. The cabin is a private, peaceful oasis."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt say enough about how much we and our dog loved staying at Ursula‚Äôs cabin. The cabin has everything one needs for a cozy getaway, the pictures truly don‚Äôt do justice to how charming and peaceful the it is. We lounged on the large wrap around porch and listened to the babbling stream below, made a cozy fire at night and explored the trails during the day. I plan to try and make it back to stay longer!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin is not fancy, but was perfect for our needs. You can tell the owners have actually stayed because lots of little things were included that made it very user friendly. Little things like plenty of kitchen towels and bath towels make the stay easy. We loved the board games and listening to the creek. The host was very responsive and dropped off citronella candles when we let her know they had been used up by prior guest. Fresh water bowl for our dog was ready when we arrived."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great creek-side cabin!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Ursula‚Äôs cabin was just what we needed for a long weekend. Surrounded by beautiful nature and the cabin had so many thoughtful touches. All you need is to pack your food and a good pair of walking shoes. The cabin is stocked with movies, books and games but honestly just sitting on the wrap around porch is the best part. We had rainy weather one day and the power went out. Nothing that was in Ursala‚Äôs control but she was right there to make sure we were okay. We didn‚Äôt need power to enjoy our stay. Can‚Äôt wait to come back."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Creekside Cabin was a dreamy spot! Clean, classy, and authentic! The perfect spot to unplug and be with nature. It was quiet with creature comforts, we are planning our next visit!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay here, the location is absolutely beautiful and we hiked through the creek and waterfalls out back in the rain one afternoon- it was magical.

I would definitely recommend this cabin to anyone looking for peace and quiet in beautiful natural surroundings."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our second time staying at the creekside cabin and it was even better than the first! We love the seclusion and beautiful scenery the cabin offers. With private hiking trails and a creek next to the cabin, we didn‚Äôt have to leave the property the entire weekend. The cabin was extremely clean, as usual. The host was quick to respond and very friendly! We love everything about the creekside cabin and plan to return again and again! If you‚Äôre looking for a tranquil, private get away, the creekside cabin is your place!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the Creekside Cabin was perfect! The cozy space and beautiful surroundings allowed us to unwind and relax. The cabin had everything we needed so we could enjoy our peaceful stay without needing to go anywhere. We will definitely return!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quiet, and so relaxing. An amazing disconnect from the outside world while surrounded by nature and lots to explore! The lookout on the trail by the cabin was the absolute best, especially at sunrise. Even with the cold rain, we still went out and explored around and had a great time, especially when you get to come back to a nice fire and some movies to relax for the night!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Ursula‚Äôs cozy and rustic cabin felt like a little piece of heaven! It was such a wonderful serene place to disconnect from it all! Ursula was an awesome host and thought of everything! We will definitely be back!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"At the end of a winding private road in the Blue Ridge Mountains, an hour's drive from Mt. Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Mississippi, a beautiful rustic cabin overlooking a gurgling mountain stream awaited us. We were there a week. When we first arrived, the temperature was 20 degrees at night. The cabin was, as the Swedish say, ""hygge"" (cozy). Lovely evenings beside the fireplace. The last 3 days, the weather warmed considerably, affording pleasant dinners al fresco on the wrap around porch. Throughout, our hostess Ursula was charming and accommodating. The property is large, and there are numerous well marked hiking trails in the hills around the cabin."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Wonderful host! Her home was exactly what we needed - a peaceful getaway in the woods surrounded by a creek. Cozy fireplace and eclectic furniture made us feel welcome and at home :) we hope to be back
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Most beautiful place we‚Äôve ever stayed , the house was wonderful. We absolutely love the Creek the trails. God‚Äôs beautiful creation for us to use for a few days. The woodstove was wonderful. We will definitely be coming back."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A peaceful retreat right along a beautiful rippling creek. We had such a restful stay.

The cabin itself is beautiful - love the natural look and wood-burning stove, and the hostess is extremely accommodating - she really made the experience stress-free. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a peaceful getaway. The quiet cozy cabin was a superb romantic retreat for two. We had a wonderful stay! The rain on the roof was like a sleeping potion. Ursula even made it snow for us! The little extras that were provided put it over the top. We will definitely try to make our way back!!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had an incredible time! Amazing views and amenities! I can‚Äôt wait to book this again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Incredible stay at Ursula‚Äôs! Place was very easy to find thanks to the well described instructions and pictures. Upon walking in we were greeted with a already lit fire in the nicest fireplace I've seen. Plenty of room for the two of us. Loved the wrap around porch, most of our time was spent on the porch enjoying the sounds of the water moving down the creek. Spent some time hiking the easily accessed and marked trails found right on the property, lost of good spots to sit and hang out while taking in the surroundings! Kitchen is well stocked with every amenity you could need to cook meals. We stayed in the loft, which was very comfortable and cozy. Lots of extra blankets and bedding for cold nights! The bathroom was immaculate and well stocked, even had a gift of homemade soaps. We will be going back for many more trips for sure!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the place to go to get away from everything. No noise, no people, no traffic, hardly any cell service. Truly a perfect escape from the world."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had an amazing time at Ursula‚Äôs cabin by the creek. It was very peaceful and we enjoyed the cabin very much. Kids enjoyed the DVD player with the large collection of great movies. We will definitely be back soon!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this lovely cabin. It is even more charming in person than the photos suggest! Communication was top-notch, and everything we needed was provided when we arrived, plus some thoughtful extras."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Creekside cabin was the perfect getaway. We spent Thanksgiving there and the kitchen had everything we needed plus thoughtful extras like chocolate and teas. The environment was peaceful with the sound of the creek, beautiful views, and a roaring fireplace. My father and I enjoyed exploring the trails and the creek. My little dog loved every bit of it too. Summed up - we were immersed in nature and spent quality time together."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at Ursula's cabin. Due to a family emergency we got to the cabin late at night but Ursula had everything ready for us. We loved having the wood burning stove going at night and listening to the peaceful creek all day long. We ended up staying at the cabin more than expected which was perfectly fine because the cabin was so cozy and peaceful. We especially enjoyed the trail that we were able to take our dog on. This was a wonderful place to stay and we hope to be back in the future.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cabin was really quaint and cozy in a beautiful quiet location. The wood stove was lovely to use and watch the fire burning. Even in the colder nights, the heater and stove kept the cabin cozy and warm. The area is beautiful with lots of trails and waterfalls. We loved going to Books and Bean, local book store in Little Switzerland. Also, you are only a short drive from Blue Ridge Parkway."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Words can‚Äôt express how much we enjoyed our time at this cabin! The cabin and property were exactly as described. We have stayed in many rentals that seems cheap or cut corners, but the care that is put into this cabin and property did not go unnoticed! Between the trails, book, and porch, we never had to leave the property! Our dogs were in heaven with the creek. 10/10 and we hope to be back soon!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a wonderful trip. Secluded, but still within distance of a lot of fun places."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you are looking for a place where you can experience the beauty and tranquility of the blue ridge mountains then look no further!
When I arrived at the cabin after a long day of driving I felt like I had found heaven on earth! Sitting above a creek with a huge wrap around porch full of rocking chairs for forest viewing was perfect for me.
The cabin has everything you need and more to make this a home away from home during your stay. The property has a variety of hiking trails that I took advantage of with my dogs.
The weather was pretty mild during my stay allowing me to make fires in the wood burning stove down stairs and leave the windows open to listen to the creek and forest sounds at night. I kept imagining during my stay how the cabin and location would be perfect in any number of movies.
Well I could go on and on about what a great stay I had but the bottom line is I can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! The hosts were the best I‚Äôve ever dealt with. Everything was perfect! She even had some doggie treats and a bowl of water ready for our pups! The porch and the stream is so relaxing. The beds are super comfy. It was just perfect!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a magical stay during the peak of fall foliage season. The gentle sound of the creek running through the backyard was the perfect soundtrack to our weekend.
The cabin had everything we needed to feel at home from a fully stocked kitchen with ample refrigerator space, a comfortable bed large enough to stretch out, and the warmth provided by the wood burning stove.
We were close enough to falls and hikes we wanted to visit while still feeling away from it all.
We highly recommend and the pups loved it too!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we were going to stay somewhere cheaper, but decided at the last moment to stay here and were so happy we did. it was worth every penny! the creek and walk up to the waterfall was a beautiful addition to the stay. beautiful blue ridge parkway look outs a 20 minute drive away."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"An amazing place! We we have stayed at many cabins listed on Airbnb each fall. Of all of them this one is tied for first! Ursula was great and the cabin was great. Private, easy, and peaceful."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was a definite 10/10! We felt so at home as soon as we walked through the door. The rooms are cozy, and the porch is AMAZING.
We can‚Äôt wait to come back! ‚ù§Ô∏è
We highly recommend walking to the overlook if you get the chance. The view is phenomenal. üèî"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was quiet, quaint and absolutely magical. The porch will pull you in and before you know it hours have gone by. The surroundings are beautiful and the nature is healing."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved every minute of our stay here! The cabin is so cozy and welcoming. The porch looks out into the woods and the creek runs right next to the house. We spent part of our honeymoon here and the hostesses were so thoughtful in their welcome to us, leaving a note and even a sweet treat in the fridge! We had a late arrival on a chilly night and they left the wood burning stove on for us so the place would be warm when we arrived. Directions and instructions for arrival were very clear and easy to follow. The place had everything you could need. We can‚Äôt wait to come back and spend more days here! A very magical place indeed."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ursula‚Äôs cabin was AMAZING. Beautiful, styled wonderfully, all the amenities one could dream of having, and easy access to multiple attractions. Ursula had wonderful communication and was always a phone call away if anything was needed. Her view up top is indescribable and the trails around the property are so convenient for a nice hike! Easily one of the best AirBnB‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever stayed in!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a very nice stay at Ursula‚Äôs cabin. It was a little cramped with 5 people. I think 4 would have been perfect. The creek is beautiful. I loved sitting out on the porch watching the kids play in the water.
We had one minor issue when we arrived but Ursula was very responsive and took care of it promptly."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved our stay! Ursula is so friendly and accommodating. The cabin is wonderful a little small but it was literally like a movie cabin so cozy!!! The trails were fun but the creek was our favorite. We hope to return one day
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We have stayed at many vacation rentals as a family and this one was definitely the best! The cabin was a perfect size for a family of four plus our dog! The wrap-around porch and creek view was awesome! Great place to disconnect from electronics and reconnect with our family. We highly recommend this cabin and will plan to rent again in the future. Ursula was a wonderful and responsive host!
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Loved everything about our cabin, but especially the porch - the sound of the creek was heavenly and so very peaceful! Thank you!!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,A perfect get away for two ‚Ä¶ or a small family . So quaint and romantic . Beautiful creek side location and great rockers and lounging bed to relax !
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can't say enough good things about thos cabin. It is beautiful and just feels like you're a part of the nature that surrounds you. It's so quiet and cozy, you won't want to leave! We highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the area. It's a great location and we hope to return someday!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Even cuter than the photos! We loved our stay here!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This cozy cabin was a wonderful getaway to enjoy the peace and quiet off the beaten path. We had a great time hanging out on the porch and listening to the creek.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,perfect place you will never want to leave
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely magical. We felt so at home. Every touch was so thoughtful and beautiful. We made such priceless memories.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our visit back to this cabin! We escape to the porch and cool ourselves by the creek. This time we grabbed a couple of the walking sticks from the porch and walked up the creek to the waterfall! It is such a great opportunity to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of our daily lives and reconnect with one another. Ursula always makes sure that we are welcome and provided for with nice touches like chocolates and homemade soaps. We love this cabin and it has become one of our home away from home spaces.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to relax and getaway. Nice porch to spend time talking, playing a game, napping or reading a book. Little creek to cool off in just steps away. Friendly host was available and quite friendly but not intrusive. We will return!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely enchanting cabin üíñ It was super clean, exactly as described, and extra thoughtful touches throughout. I really got a sense of Ursula wanting to sincerely share this experience and ambience with travelers; it was like she really wants you to be connected with the experience wholeheartedly. I loved the little book about Forest Bathing! What a cute touch!
My pups and I really cherished our stay here and loved how it was not connected to cell service or Internet‚ù§Ô∏è I did not try to use the tv/dvds. My tv was sitting on the back porch and watching the creek and the maple leaves dancing with the breezes while the pups slept adorably beside me. It really allowed us time to reflect and be present with each other- which I know the dogs enjoyed immensely :)
The hiking trails around here are so much fun and then to cool off afterwards in the beautiful creek is just divine ‚ú®
Thank you Ursula~ I really felt like I was able to decompress from a crazy school year. Looking forward to our next visit!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at this beautiful cabin with my boyfriend and parents. What a location! So peaceful and relaxing. Like an escape to another world. The way the cabin is fixed is so homey that we barely had that usual vacation adjustment feeling. So much better than a hotel and not much more per night! Recommend to anyone.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location loved everything about this place.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely amazing experience. 10/10 would recommend!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"the cabin was just as advertised -- well appointed, beautiful view, incredibly peaceful, and checkin was a breeze. we will definitely be back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Remember when you were little and you'd say that you loved something, and then your snarky friend would demand, ""If you love it so much, then why don't you marry it?!"" Well, if that's the case, I'm just going to have to marry this cabin. I'm extremely picky about my get-aways and I have a laundry list of must-haves, including seclusion, rustic charm, coziness, access to wilderness, amazing scenery, proximity to a stream or river, ability to bring my pups along, etc, etc. Ursula's cabin checked all the boxes and more. Others have touched on it already, but the pictures don't do this place justice. My heart just fluttered non-stop when I first walked inside - it immediately felt like home and I spent the week feeling like I was in a dream (if they could talk, the dogs would agree). Among so many other things, this cabin is the perfect writer's refuge. Leaving was super difficult, but this cabin stay was the perfect birthday trip and Ursula and Grace were just wonderful. I appreciate them wholeheartedly and hope to return! (Oh, and the soap is awesome and the eggs from the friendly neighborhood chickens made for a tasty inclusion into my birthday cake - thank you again!)"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I got a weekend at Ursala‚Äôs cabin as a Christmas gift for my brother and his wife and they LOVED it. They loved the river and fire and were blown away by the charm of the place!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love this cabin! This was actually my second visit--it's a peaceful, beautiful location, with a stream right beside the porch and trees full of birds. The cabin has lots of thoughtful touches: Ursula's handmade soap, various coffee-making supplies (a french press, my preferred option!), an exceptionally cozy daybed...
This is a great spot for a writing or reading vacation, or just for quiet relaxing on the porch."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely perfect. Our trip got rained out one day and we had to stay at the cabin most of the afternoon, but honestly, it made the trip better! We got to build a puzzle while listening to the rain and the creek! It was incredibly peaceful and beautiful and a much needed break for the busy life."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic ambiance with wrap around porch above the soothing creek. Easy to find and very hospitable host. Overwhelming options of outdoor activities to do around the area.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely splendid place. Only for those looking to get away and get some peace and quiet. It is small, but when you consider the porch and all the surrounding area, there was plenty of space for a family. Beyond cozy and comfortable."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful family trip! Location is private and very scenic. Ample amenities and lots to keep my tween boys entertained! Close to beautiful hiking and both Marion and Little Switzerland provide cute shops and good options. Excellent communication with our host. I have already recommended the cabin and would stay here again!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect getaway vacation!! My husband and I stayed in the cabin for a week and had the most amazing time. The creek runs right beside the large wrap around porch and we spent hours just sitting out there enjoying the rushing sounds of nature. The hiking trails on the property were incredible, the cabin was stocked with absolutely everything we needed, and Ursula was a very kind and inviting host. We travel regularly and this was absolutely one of our favorite stays ‚Äì if you're considering booking, DO IT!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautifully built and decorated cabin that is nestled into the woods. In addition, the creek next to the cabin adds extra tranquility for a relaxing stay. The cabin was spotless when we arrived. The trails through out the property are easy to navigate and provide multiple vantage points of the surrounding mountains. We are most definitely going to be staying here again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The moment you walk up the steps to the cabin and hear the stream running behind it, you realize you‚Äôve picked the best Airbnb in all the land. Then you walk around the corner and the stream and waterfalls are gloriously set out before you. There are rocking chairs and the coziest lounger to read a book in or watch the river. There‚Äôs a picnic table and a checkers table with chairs to enjoy too. All this fabulousness before you even step into the cabin.
The cabin is so enchanting and so well thought out. Ursula has thought of every touch and comfort one could wish for in their home away from home. We will never forget our time here and we hope to be able to visit again one day!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"From the beautiful location to the cozy atmosphere of the cabin this stay was perfection for us! The sound of the creek, the warmth of the wood stove, and the decor of the cabin made us feel like we had escaped into a fairy tale in the woods. Our kids loved playing in the creek out back and exploring the trails. We were just a short distance from several beautiful hiking trails too! Ursula was so kind and friendly. She made us feel right at home and was very attentive to everything we needed. We definitely want to return!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely, well appointed, with so many sweet and comforting touches. We loved the books, games, and puzzles, and exploring the trails. Our two kids loved romping with construction toys around the creek and playing Jenga on the porch. The daybed is super cozy and perfect for lounging around the fire. Perfect place."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cozy cabin is such a wonderful retreat and a wonderful respite. The amenities and small touches all add to a great stay. Ursula is a genuinely attentive host and made us feel so welcomed in Little Switzerland. Get out of here, Big Switzerland! Little Switzerland is where it's at. We will be back! -Will (and Pancake and Rachel)"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is everything that the photos show. Very rustic and picturesque. We had a wonderful time - just what we had hoped for our 25th wedding anniversary.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,amazing place definitely worth a stay.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is such a beautiful cabin and property. Our family had a wonderful time. We appreciated all the attention to detail that was taken in order to make our stay special. We hope to return!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was amazing! All of the reviews are true and you won't regret renting from these amazing host. It was exactly what my family needed. Ursula was an amazing host and so welcoming with cookies, fruit and treats for our dogs. We had a snowstorm that dropped 15 inches of snow in one night. Ursula gave my boys a sled to use which was a hit with the both of them. We were worried we would not be able to make it down the mountain to go home. Ursula assured us that if we could not make it down, she would let us stay until we were able to. She offered us a late check out the following morning and we were able to take our time leaving so the roads could be cleared. We have rented many airbnb's and this one takes the cake!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect private cabin. Just what we needed for peaceful relaxation. The creek is beautiful and the sunrise views superb. Buck stove kept us toasty warm. Cabin was incredibly clean and had everything we needed (we were happy for no Wi-Fi or TV). Thank You Ursula!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin had every little touch that you could imagine for a getaway in the woods. The handmade soaps, the book selection, the china, even the bath towels were really nice. We enjoyed the creek right along the cabin and the trails leading up from it. We visited Grandfather Mountain, as our snow tubing wasn't happening due to exceptionally warm weather. A very nice unplugged weekend for our family."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you Grace for the opportunity to let us stay in such a beautiful place and spend a beautiful time with your family.
It is a totally wonderful place and you breathe nature."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,A gem tucked into the mountains with a great host! Would absolutely stay here again.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin as well as the hosts are such a gem! It's the perfect way to getaway and enjoy nature, wake up listening to the soothing river in the back, and actually enjoy the presence of the family. We had just enough signal in a section of the cabin for emergencies but the lack of signal was amazing to not be on our phones the whole time. The kitchen setup was amazing and we had everything we needed to bake Christmas cookies and cook Christmas dinner. Our pups we so spoiled with the treats provided and our baby even got a surprise visit from Santa when we needed some help. These hosts are something else, they went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay. Thank you so much!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay at this cabin. The views walking around the area were great. The quaint cabin offered adorable touches that made it more relaxing and enjoyable. The communication from the owners was fantastic and they were extremely kind to us. I would recommend this space to anyone!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This cabin is absolutely lovely. It is perfectly nestled in the quite wilderness with a gorgeous view. The hosts were very helpful and responsive. We will be back!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay was amazing. Beds so dreamy. And the Cabin so quaint and cozy. The stream is the perfect setting with wrap around porch and rocking chairs. A chase lounge closest to the water coming down the mountain. Fire place is so easy to get going and so story book. The shower had great pressure and the toliet has a bidet. Kitchen had everything to cook with and the towels are infused with lavender. Just wonderful.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is adorably cute, with incredibly helpful and accommodating hosts. We had an fantastic stay over Thanksgiving enjoying the trails on property with our dogs, winding down in the rockers on the porch, enjoying the sounds of a nearby creek, and cozying up by their potbelly stove. The hosts were all so helpful and accommodating throughout the stay, even over the holidays! Five stars, we'll be back!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome cabin! Comfortable, clean and charming. We will be back to stay again soon!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The creakside cabin is a perfect cabin stay on the mountain side. This truly is a special place. Perfect for a simple, relaxing time in a quaint, beautiful cabin. There‚Äôs really cool, easy hiking trails right on the property and the view of the sunrise from the top of hill is incredible. Ursula was a perfect host and communicated quickly with any questions. Would give 10 stars if possible! Can‚Äôt wait to come back next year."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,ABSOLUTELY wonderful!!! The host is very sweet and made sure we had everything we needed! She suggested a whole list of activities near by that were great! The cabin is beautiful! The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice!! The trails around the house were fun! The Fam and I loved eating our meals on the porch with the sound so the creek in the background. Beds are super comfy. Hands down my favorite Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed at. We will definitely be coming back!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Grace is an amazing host. Everything from the extra outdoor pillows and blankets, to the coffee and spice supplies were perfect. We especially loved the cute doggie present and separate towels for us and our dog.
We didn't know we would be right on the creek which was a perfect surprise. The cabin is adorable, beds were all comfy, and it was so clean! The porch was the best part of our stay!
The cabin is super close to Linville Gorge, Waterfalls, and Cavern."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had the most magical time in this picturesque and serene cabin. So many little thoughtful touches that you don't find with many other places truly made us feel welcomed into this home. The coffee was delicious and perfect in the french press, the fresh fruit and small chocolates were delightful, the Buck stove kept the entire cabin toasty (plenty of firewood for the cold nights), the board games + movie selection were all well received by the entire family, and our four legged family member gobbled up the treats left especially for her.
Sitting in the rocking chairs with a warm coffee in the mornings and a glass of wine in the evenings while the stream flowing just below your feet within a stones throw of the porch ushered us into a state of true relaxation as our children spent their time exploring the surrounding woods.
The breathtaking view from the lookout marks the entrance and exit of some of the trails on the property, and bookended our meanderings through this piece of beautiful WNC mountain wilderness.
We lacked for nothing but more time to spend in this enchanting place.
Thank you Ursula, Grace, and Renee!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly the most magical place to stay! Went with my partner and dog for a combined birthday/early anniversary weekend and it exceeded our expectations in every way. The cabin is immaculately clean and almost too precious for words, the host is unbelievably sweet and hospitable (while also being entirely able and willing to leave you to your own if that's what you prefer), and the nature surrounding the cozy cabin can only be described as a true sanctuary. We especially enjoyed lighting the wood burning stove (wood included!), watching movies (a large stash of DVDs are available), doing a puzzle, listening to rain fall on the tin roof, using the well appointed kitchen to cook, and sitting on the porch rocking chairs which overlook a private running brook while we drank coffee and read. The property is large and has a good handful of trails that you're able to explore. Embarking on a hike meant walking up past the other house on the property where the proprietress happened to be staying for the weekend. Ursula popped out to say hi, welcome us to her home, and gave us thorough directions for walking. As we came back down from the hike, she again greeted us and set up chairs so that we could sit and enjoy the exceptional view overlooking the valley for a while! She brought us a glass of wine as well as a beautiful handmade soap that she had just created, and took the time to chat with us in a way that exuded warmth, kindness and hospitality- absolutely a trip highlight. My only criticism of the stay at the cozy cabin is that it had to come to an end, but we will absolutely return again soon."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stop along our BRP drive. Comfortable, well stocked home. Beautiful nature surrounding the property. Up in the mountains, big trees, and a creek that runs alongside the property! Would definitely stay again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is perfect! Enjoyed the days sitting on the deck watching and listening to the creek flowing down the side of the mountain. The cabin is at the end of the road so there is absolutely no noise except the sound of the woods but it is still minutes from the Blue Ridge Parkway and many of the Carolina waterfalls. The cabin does not have a TV (which is a plus) but plenty of games and DVD's. Cabin is well equipped and has personal touches everywhere, even dog treats for our pup! Our host greeted us with two glasses and a bottle of wine as my wife and I sat and looked at the mountains. Our only complaint about our stay is that we had to leave."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect cabin for our trip to the mountains. The cabin is beautifully restored with rustic features and antiques but it also is updated with many modern features. The porch overlooking the creek was my favorite spot to start and end my day. There is no cable or internet so it is the perfect place to unplug and reconnect with nature or family and friends. The host provide many personal touches that make it feel like you are staying with friends. Word to the wise-hwy 226A is called the diamondback for good reason. If you love driving winding curves and sharp switchbacks, this is your road. Be sure to take you picture with the sign outside the general store. If not, Hwy 226 is a longer way around but not as squiggly."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect in every way imaginable! It‚Äôs beautiful to experience such kindness and love all around by people who really enjoy making others feel happy. What a gem find! Will be going back soon!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If quiet, peaceful, secluded is what you are looking for, this is the perfect cabin.
The wrap around porch is so relaxing. The cabin is rustic, beautifully decorated, and very well equipped. Would recommend to all who want to ‚Äú get away‚Äù and enjoy nature!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Charming cabin in the woods! Cozy, clean accommodations in a gorgeous setting. The host was very responsive and left personalized special touches. Would stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin in Amazing!! You won't be disappointed with your stay. The hosts take care of everything, and you'll love the wrap around porch! The cabin is so cozy. There's even a wood burning stove. Be sure to bring your hiking shoes to take advantage of all the trails!
Joseph F."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most wonderful time!!! The location is perfect and beautiful. It was sooo cozy and there‚Äôs plenty to do from hiking, dinner in Little Switzerland, board games, dvds and just sitting on the porch!!! We hope to visit again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wish there was a ‚Äú10‚Äù star button I could click on. This cabin was everything I needed for a few days. Its was cozy, peaceful and so tastefully done. I felt immediately welcomed with the personalized note and chocolates and fresh fall apples. The creek off the back porch is so serene. And all of the trails on the property allowed me to completely immerse in nature. I also loved that I was able to bring my pup with me. He had the best time as well hiking and exploring.
I will absolutely return to this cabin and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for nature!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All the reviews speak for this place. It‚Äôs so well-appointed - the owners have thought of everything you might need. The home is just beautiful, and the location was perfect. This was my third trip to the Little Switzerland area and I will be back. This home is a top favorite!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better getaway for four people. The hosts were extremely responsive leading up to our arrival and when we arrived at the cabin, we were greeted with a beautiful, clean and soulful home. We were met with impeccable amenities and the natural surroundings are something to behold. Excited to go back!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I chose the Creekside Cabin for a quick weekend trip just to get away from it all and relax, and we were not disappointed. The cabin itself looked rustic, but was also charming and clean. The beds were comfortable with soft linens, and there were plenty of big fluffy towels in the bathroom. The porch was our favorite place to hang out because the sound of the water rushing by the cabin was so soothing that you could easily nap out there on the chaise lounge. Our favorite part was all the personal touches that the owner provided for our stay. The little extras like homemade soap, fresh fruit, and treats for our dog made us feel so welcome. We will definitely be back to visit as soon as we can. :-)"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was beautiful! It exceeded our expectations. Grace was on top of every detail, she is a great host. We are definitely visiting again soon!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We arrived early because I always want to scope out the surroundings. But not intending to check-in early so we turned around to leave and explore until check-in time. Almost down the drive I see a man running up behind us trying to wave us down. He was the kindest. Said Happy Birthday to my husband immediately. I told him I knew we were early and he let us go ahead and check-in to get our weekend getaway started. This spot is now our new favorite. We had perfect weather to top of our perfect birthday weekend for my hubby's 60th.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My three sisters and I absolutely LOVED this charming cabin‚Äîand the special touches by the host made the entire experience very enchanting. Best experience we could‚Äôve imagined and we hope to make it an annual trip. A dead end road in such a quiet beautiful place provided the calm and peace we needed. We hated to leave. Highly recommend this property!!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at the cabin! It‚Äôs absolutely perfect, a wonderful place to get away for a weekend."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Beautiful and peaceful, super clean on a fantastic creek! No insect problems."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My kids (16 & 19) and I had the most wonderful stay in the cabin. It is as compelling in-person as the photos suggest. My favorite part is the cripple-creek: always on and very soothing. Our activities could be outside working a puzzle or inside playing games and sharing movie night. The cabin has a way of bringing everyone together and yet, surprisingly, giving each their own bit of privacy. Loved it. The hosts are exceptional and responsive. They really made us feel welcome. The cabin was clean and well-apportioned with fresh flowers throughout. Idyllic. Wonderful place to spend time with loved ones."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet place with a calming creek. My dog fell in love and didn't want to leave so that's all you need to know. Well maintained cabin with comfortable beds and a nice DVD collection. I met the hosts and they were all lovely. Would stay again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could not have asked for a better experience than staying in this amazing cabin. A rustic half-wrap around porch overlooking the most perfect creek had plenty of lounging options to soak in the sounds of nature. Every detail of the cabin, from the wood fire stove (with a stocked woodshed) to the antique fixtures had a specific charm absolutely fitting for the area. This was genuinely one of our favorite AirBnB‚Äôs we‚Äôve ever gotten to experience, and it came down to how amazing these hosts were to us. The handmade soap, stocked kitchen with plenty of goodies, and a personal birthday card to my wife were truly appreciated. We will absolutely be back to enjoy the area once again. Prepare to disconnect from your phone (you don‚Äôt have the option) and enjoy connecting with nature. Thank you for allowing us to stay at your property!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the cabin was AWEsome!! We loved every minute and didn't want to leave. The cabin is cozy and charming with everything you need for a relaxing respite in nature. The king size bed in the loft was super comfy, the shower was refreshing, the stove is super powered, and the sound of the creek flowing right off the back porch is mesmerizing. We also hiked the trails on the property and they were a very enjoyable morning jaunt. My friend said that this was the BEST AirBnB she has ever stayed in, and I totally agree!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"2 Creeks Cottage was top notch. I absolutely loved the private location at the top of the mountain, with its own private creek and waterfall that we LOVED playing in (its chilly!!!). The cabin was a perfect size for us (family of 3) but could comfortably fit another too. The cabin was the PERFECT style for us, very rustic and cute but VERY comfortable. All of the nice touches that Ursula left to prepare the cabin for our welcome were so nice after a long drive (fresh flowers, a few lights on, fruit and candy in the bowl and a personal welcome note)! I can't wait to stay here again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful and magical cabin in a serene and convenient location in the North Carolina mountains. Gorgeous sunsets, walks, and nature surround the cabin on a stream. All the details are provided, books, bug spray, coffee, and homemade soap. Hosts were always helpful and warm. I cannot wait to return."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"During our stay we had the pleasure of meeting Ursula, Rene and her husband. We feel so fortunate to have connected with them and thank them for creating and sharing this oasis.
We loved the wrap around porch and did yoga each morning with the sound of the creek in the background. Our three dogs enjoyed romping in the water and hanging out on the porch. The temperature was beautiful so we didn‚Äôt need the AC but love that that is available if we come during warmer months.
Ursula even makes the soap in the cabin and it‚Äôs wonderful (looking forward to buying some!).
This was one of our favorite places we‚Äôve ever stayed and had everything we needed for a getaway. Worth the 8.5 hour trip to reset and leave feeling rested. Definitely make this a must on your travels."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want idyllic ‚Äúcabin in the woods‚Äù for your stay‚Äîthis is it!
I was so impressed with the cooking books and history of the area books. That‚Äôs a lovely touch.
After visiting Linville Caverns for the day, the kitchen had everything we needed to make a delicious and simple dinner from the trout we caught at the Buck Creek trout farm nearby.
We temporarily had misplaced our bug spray and I was so glad to know there was a spare bottle kept in the ‚Äúforgot anything‚Äù drawer in the bathroom.
I appreciated the water bottles and yogurt in the fridge.
We took Ursula‚Äôs advice and climbed up the creek bed to see the waterfall better up close. The porch was lovely at night for hot tea and watching fireflies.
We had great weather for leaving the air off and the windows open. I can‚Äôt imagine how lovely it might be to stay in winter with the wood ü™µ furnace.
I can tell how much attention to detail was put into hosting and it really shines. Absolutely worth the price for the stay."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cabin was awesome. No traffic noise!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was exactly what my soul needed.. a quiet getaway where my family could unplug and and unwind for the weekend. We explored the trails around the house, went to Toms Creek Falls for the day, ate in Little Switzerland, and played games on the porch while listening to the creek below. The cabin itself was exactly as described. Clean, cute, and just right for our family of 4. Thank you for a wonderful weekend!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We just arrived home from a lovely visit at the cabin. This cabin exceeded our expectations and we were so pleasantly surprised when we arrived that we decided not to leave until we had to! The thoughtful touches from handmade soap to a nicely stocked kitchen really made us feel at home. We whiled away most of our days in the fantastic porch area. We breakfasted at the picnic table, did our reading in the rocking chairs, played games at the gaming table and napped on the chaise lounge, all to the soundtrack of the gorgeous creek just below. Be sure to head up the hill to view the sunrise and explore the trails. We had fun identifying woodland plants. Have no doubts, this cabin is the perfect place to relax and unwind."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We truly enjoy staying in this little cabin by the creek. Feels like camping outdoors with all the doors open. The creek is so peace and the owners really make you feel welcomed. We will definitely be back.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is a wonderful getaway! The porch overlooks a small stream, with rocking chairs that are perfect for reading and daydreaming. The property is beautiful, with views of the mountains if you walk further up the hill, or down the quiet country road. A lovely place for a retreat!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent cabin for our family excursion. Very clean and thoughtfully decorated. Very peaceful and private. Lovely place for a relaxing time. Would stay again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, cozy, and cute! The perfect getaway for a cabin in the mountains experience."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was amazing! It‚Äôs a place to completely unplug from the normal routines of life. No cell or internet service, just beautiful nature! We loved the full kitchen to cook our own meals and the option to eat on the deck or inside!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. Being that you‚Äôre the second to last on the road there is zero cars/motorcycles. The porch was our favorite spot. Wish we would have timed our trip to be when the Rhododendrons were in bloom because they are going to be spectacular!! The king bed was very comfortable. I can‚Äôt say enough positive things about our stay.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a beautiful house with a great view. Grace and family are easy to communicate with. Would highly recommend
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The creekside cabin is a little haven nestled away in the woods and is the perfect breathe of fresh air. It was clean, homey, and had everything you could need and then some(including bite sized fresh cookies and homemade soap)! Make sure to bring a good book, so you can sit on the deck overlooking the stream with a cup of coffee and a cookie. A must-visit."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin was pure perfection. We loved all the small details from fresh eggs from the neighbors to the handmade soap. There were plenty of towels and blankets. There were plenty of games, books, DVDs and even a yoga mat! It is perfectly situated by the most perfect brook. We climbed the creek to the waterfall and let the dogs play on the property. The cabin is well equipped for a nice stay without needing to leave. It was a perfect little slice of heaven nestled on top of the mountain in the most beautiful mountain laurels. We hope to be back many times."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is beautiful, and then add the view on top of that, everything was perfect"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great time here! A beautiful clean home with an awesome view, so much to do at the house & loved all the games they had inside for when we had a rainy day! Also super neat they provided firewood & charcoal! We loved our stay and even ended up staying an extra night!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I like many people who have stayed here am speechless. Besides the million-dollar view, the host was extremely thoughtful about every detail. The place was cleaned above any Airbnb I've seen before. Looked new! We stayed with our children and pet and we over-packed. NOTHING WAS MISSING! I repeat besides food and your toiletry you can loosen up because this isn't your average Airbnb. We are planning our next trip there. I especially enjoyed how I did nothing but hang out at the house with the children and the children were fully engaged outside. they left me alone for Mother's day. So it's like going on a hideaway and getting your ""you"" time while spending time with the family watching TV, eating, and playing. It was Mothers Day weekend and that may have explained her lack of communication. But everything was picture perfect and I either found what I was looking for or figured out how to solve the problem I had. She made it easy. Perfect NC Staycation!!! Disney What??"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! The pictures of the view don‚Äôt do it justice! Super clean and nice home. Would definitely go back! Thanks!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Million Dollar Views!! This place felt warm and luxurious from the moment we arrived. The living room is stunning (and hopefully in winter the fireplace is useable!) and the view especially during sunrise and sunset is something magical. The beds are firm and the pillows are thick- all very clean. The shower got hot quickly and the rainhead is a nice touch. I would be cautious as to sharing that room as the barn door to that bathroom doesn't fully close for privacy. We loved having the kids games upstairs to play with and the books to read at night. My 3 year old went wild outside on the well kept play spaces. I would warn supervision at all times is required as the drop off is very steep only feet away from the play equipment. The hot tub took a couple hours to warm up but stayed hot our whole stay and was well loved. We could (and feel) hear the train a few times a day as its very close by. We loved that but others might not. Overall this place is a true gem and we will be back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful setting! Very responsive host. Clean and comfortable and stocked with all you need for your stay. We plan on reserving again in future...perfect halfway point to meet up with the grandkids!! Plan on being there for sunset--spectacular!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for hosting us! We loved our stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Kim was very responsive and knowledgeable about what was in the area. We didn‚Äôt have to venture far though due to the absolute stunning view we already had! I brought my telescope and bird watched as well as gathered in some of the beautiful scenery. Definitely ‚ÄúA View To Remember‚Äù!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Kim was very responsive- answered any questions I had in under 10 minutes. The place was perfect for a family/friends get away!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home was a great getaway for our family. Our kids loved the play area, fire pit and hot tub. The house was clean and well appointed. The scenery was beautiful and peaceful! A great home base to explore local hikes and attractions."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Kim was a wonderful host. Her house is beautiful with breathtaking views from every corner of the house! The floor to wall windows were delightful in addition to the hot tub. Very clean space with a very descriptive welcome manual and well-stocked kitchen/toiletries.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing house on a hilltop! The pictures can't describe how stunning the feeling of presence is, looking out over the mountains. We loved the hot tub too. Everything was in perfect condition, exactly as described. Tons of space and super comfortable. Wished we could have stayed much longer!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great mini vacay away from home for the weekend! It was fit for the whole family! As a cleaner myself, this place was immaculate! The hot tub was fantastic to relax in and the kids loved the games and space to play. We even lost a basketball ‚Äúmatch‚Äù against the kids where they enjoyed picking the movie for the night and lounging in the living room! This family had a great time visiting this rental and hope to be able to return in the future!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Loved it.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the most beautiful airbnb my husband and I have ever stayed at. The views are breathe taking! The house is literally perfect for a family or just a couples get away! Easy drive into to town or even Asheville! We will definitely be back!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"This house is beautiful, we did not make a mistake in the selection when we planned the family trip. We felt like we were at home, nothing was missing, and the location is a blessing. You can forget about the hustle and bustle of any day just by arriving and enjoying the nature that surrounds it. Marion is a very quiet town. It was an unforgettable experience. Kim and John were very attentive and helpful at all times."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Got this for my mom for a little birthday staycation. The place was amazing, clean, organized and welcoming. The grounds were beautiful and well kept and the view was amazing. The home is centrally located with Lake James about five minutes away. It was also pet friendly so we could bring our dog along for the fun. :)"

2023-11-01,5,Group trip,We booked this house for a quick birthday weekend and it was exactly what we wanted! The amenities were great and the view was spectacular. We enjoyed the hot tub and even got outside to play some basketball on the little half court! Can not stress enough that this is the perfect mountain getaway!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kim was an amazing host and made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. She answered all our questions in a quick and timely manner. Would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a good host and some even more amazing views!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I enjoyed our two nights at Kim's place. The weather was beautiful and clear giving us the full effect of the amazing mountain view.

Thank you to Kim for her excellent communication and hospitality!"

The house was amazing! Update to a modern feel that was still quaint. Location is private with an incredible view and great amenities for the whole family. Our kids loved the playground, foosball table and all the board games!
Location was in a great spot for us to explore both Asheville and Boone to see the wonderful peak fall colors! Lots to do in all directions.
We are looking forward to hopefully booking here again in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Breathtaking views that are unmatched in such a peaceful setting. Our trip was perfect- thank you so much!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed the privacy and scenery. We truly loved the hot tub and we also took advantage of the chilly nights by gathering around the fire pit. I will say that there are train tracks near the house so I would advise bringing rear plugs if you sleep in the upstairs room as the train came in the middle of the night.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful communication with our fabulous hosts that provided everything we could need for our getaway. Beautiful home and absolutely beautiful views enjoyed from the lovely hot tub. Thank you for a wonderful stay.

Stop scrolling and book this!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The view from the hot tob and back porch are beautiful. We had considered going on a hike for that kind of view but once we got to the house we decided to stay in all weekend and relax. The house is conveniently located close to downtown and the Bear Creek Marina so we had tons of options for dining and entertainment. I will absolutely be returning the next time we come to Marion.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and view! We enjoyed our stay!

Also the bedding was pure white and pristine. The hot tub, fire pit, and spectacular view made it perfect!"

We could not have had a more perfect weekend and look forward to returning soon. Thank you Kim!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tiffany &her puppers made for such a great weekend to visit Marion- location was the perfect balance between busy Asheville/Lake James & seclusion of Mt Mitchell especially given the holiday. Tiffany's home is located at the end of a gravel road which sets it apart from any local traffic &provides not only the serenity and stillness you might not find in the city, but also an opportunity to view some beautiful stars. The view alone is stunning which pairs well with the quaintness of the suite- perfect for 2 people &our dog, who absolutely loved being social &exploring the space. Tiffany included some nice touches like s'mores kits, k-cups &snacks upon arrival. She went above &beyond as a host to look after us &truly made us feel at home. Definitely recommend for a low-key weekend getaway with good accessibility to DT Marion, Black Mountain, Asheville Lake James. Will definitely visit again! Thanks"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a wonderful place - you cannot beat the view, amazing! Tiffany has done an amazing job making her space just perfect for a couple (and in our case, a couple with a dog). Very thoughtful touches throughout the space including s'mores...which I must have dropped a hot s'more holder on the ground and burned the carpet. Ugh! My age and lupus definitely impacts my ability to manage these things, and when Tiffany told me what I had done I felt terrible. She was very gracious, and was super kind throughout our visit - this is a must-stay if you're in the area."

My wife was completely happy and relaxed, we had a great time by the fire, made s‚Äômores, enjoyed the fairy lights and the view in the morning of the gorgeous mountains. Everything was exceptional.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,our stay in this treehouse was amazing! the views were stunning and slightly different everyday with the different weather. there was just enough room for me my husband our 2 kids and our dog.. very comfortable. there were lots of sleep options and towels provided which was very appreciated! we tried to find the on-site waterfall on our own and failed and then read the detailed instructions and we're able to find it.. it was pretty and a moderate hike that we were able to still do in flip flops and crocs. the animals were fun to feed.. the kids really enjoyed that. my husband and I really loved the grate on the fire pit..we cooked most of our meals on that despite the very well equipped kitchen. the hot tub gave us some trouble the first night but the hosts were very responsive and were able to walk us through it. the hosts also provided info on surrounding activities which was nice. we really enjoyed our stay!!

We especially love the hot tub and the view. You feel like you can really connect with nature and it‚Äôs very secluded. Make sure to walk to the pavilion and take the white trailhead to the waterfall. From the cabin to the waterfalls is about a 1.1 mile walk. We were a little nervous getting up to the cabin because the gravel driveway is a little steep. But my 2WD Hyundai Kona did it just fine! We were very impressed by how clean the cabin was. We hope to be back!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This listing was absolutely perfect for me, my fianc√©, and our dog-ter. We arrived with a two wheel drive small SUV (Corolla Cross) and had absolutely no issues navigating the path to the cabin. Upon our arrival, the host had a cute custom welcome sign that was a nice touch. The rope bridge was super awesome and a dream come true for my inner child. Extremely cozy interior that is perfect for curling up and reading a good book. There is under bed storage drawers for belongings. The deck is large with exceptional views. The hot tub worked flawlessly. Underneath the deck, there is a hammock and ring toss hook game.
The fire-pit area was perfect for us with two chairs and a grill that can be swung over pit for cooking. The ability to purchase firewood from host was very convenient. From the cabin, there are some really cool hiking trails that are perfect for allowing the pet to burn off some energy and explore. This place is a perfect getaway for a couple!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved our stay. It's a perfect weekend getaway in the mountains. We loved feeding the farm animals, walking to the waterfall, and making s'mores. It's not far from Asheville and other cities in between if you're looking for restaurant options. HIGHLY recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What an incredible find up in the mountains. You forget the rest of the world exists. The view from your bed first thing when you wake up, makes you not want to close your eyes and go back to sleep! Dog friendly was the selling point for us and our dog loved the property and the hikes.
‚ÄúPeggy Jean‚Äù said goodbye to us as we checked out and left the property. We will absolutely be back and will send friends and family to this amazing spot!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We cannot say enough good things about our stay here- we loved the trails connected to the airbnb, the gorgeous view, hot tub and space! We loved seeing the animals on the property.
The thoughtfulness and details made it a step above your normal airbnb experience. They had a dog welcome basket, s‚Äômores kit, firewood available, bath robes and comfy linens/towels. Would highly recommend to anyone interested in a couples getaway!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Oh my god you need to stay here! Audra and summer have mastered their craft of hosting. They did a wonderful job turning high haven into a beautiful honey moon spot for my husband and I! 100% recommend! Would love to stay again soon.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Couldn‚Äôt of loved this place more! Exactly what we needed for little getaway. Cozy and beautiful views with the amenities you need to do so. Hosts were very tentative and nice! We will definitely be back with our pups!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Highly recommend staying at High Haven. The treehouse was beautiful and the views where breathtaking. Gorgeous property to hike and explore and loved the friendly donkey, mini horses, and goats. The host went above and beyond to make sure my fianc√© had the best birthday ever. We look forward to our next stay at the peaceful and beautiful treehouse."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a perfect cabin! We enjoyed the view and the peacefulness of the location! Would recommend for anyone looking for a honeymoon cabin!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute place perfect for couples or friends to spend time in the woods. Make sure you have 4x4 car if you plan to park close to the house. My friend and I really enjoyed our stay and so did our pups they had area to roam around. Cute detail they left us supplies to make smores. Highly recommend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time here and are so glad that Audra and Summer shared their peace of heaven with us! This stay was a breath of fresh air in every sense. The serene surroundings and immaculate accommodations made for a perfect getaway. From the private magnificent views during the day to watching shooting stars and seeing the Milky Way at night, the High Haven Treehouse did not disappoint! Loved visiting with the rescue animals and seeing their fun personalities! We had a small hiccup with the hot tub functioning the first night, due to no fault of their own. When we notified them, they quickly responded and came to the treehouse to solve the issue (and on a Sunday night)! The recommendations for local spots kept us entertained in Marion and Old Fort. Highly recommended for those seeking a peaceful retreat! We are already planning our next visit!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,SUCH an amazing stay for a quaint and quiet getaway!! We will be back next year for sure!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was wonderful! I definitely recommend staying here. It was a perfect and private cabin for our honeymoon! They view is beautiful. We highly recommend getting in the hot tub at sunrise and sunset! We really want to come back when we can!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"As I mentioned in the guest book, you can tell a lot of time, money and thought went into the High Haven cabin. From the detail of the cabin to the little touches that make it feel like home. What a view it has also. Especially not even having to get out of bed to see the view. One of the best places we have stayed at for my husband and I. Will 100% be back again!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved every minute of the stay. Time went by way too fast. The views were absolutely stunning. Starting the morning with coffee and views and ending the day with a nice fire, and unbeatable views in the hut tub. Private, lots of beautiful trails that do not require you to drive anywhere oh and the cutest entertaining goats and donkey! It was amazing! Definitely will be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pros:
Super communicative hosts who were readily available for questions and proactively sent information that might be needed.
Beautiful space that is accurate to the photos
Thoughtful touches upon arrival
GORGEOUS views
Clean, private, well provisioned cabin.
Fabulous stargazing at night
Cool fire pit space
Clean hot tub was a great bonus!
Not far from Asheville, Black Mountain, and lots of things to do and see.
To know:
As described, the drive up the mountain on the gravel path can be done by a 2WD vehicle. The first ascent was nerve wracking but the hosts gave us the tip to go a bit faster and just keep going and it was fine. We made it all the way to the cabin, rather than the 2WD pull off and went up and down the mountain several times with no issue. But if you‚Äôre not used to that kind of driving, it can be scary at first.
Overall an amazing trip and we would definitely go back in a heartbeat!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a magical place to stay! From the GREAT views to the relaxing fire at the end of the day, I can‚Äôt say enough great things! We will for sure be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was absolutely picturesque! Host's were wonderful and responsive! The location was perfect and very private! Would highly recommend and we will definitely be back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful Beautiful place !!
My husband and I had a wonderful mini vacation. The hot tub was Amazing and the animals were so sweet and we enjoyed feeding them. Host were Amazing !! Looking forward to a future stay. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stayed here for our wedding night and absolutely loved it. Beautiful view and private.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family loved our stay at high haven cabin! It was just as described and very clean. The view was amazing, and the farm animals were so fun to stop and greet on our way in. The bed was super comfy too! Audra and Summer were very responsive and welcoming. I would definitely recommend booking with them!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Audra and Summer were amazing hosts! We highly recommend this peaceful, beautiful and very clean cabin tucked away in Marion , NC! If you are looking for a weekend getaway and need to relax and unwind - this is your place! My wife and I enjoyed sitting on the patio overlooking the mountains, watching the sunset and sunrise while drinking our coffee. The hot tub at night overlooking the stars was very relaxing and a great way to unwind. There are lots of great restaurants in driving distance and beautiful waterfalls. We highly recommend you come visit High Haven in Marion NC. You will not be disappointed. 5+ STARS! P.S. don‚Äôt forget to check out the farm animals on your way in and out of the cabin!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb was truly what we needed to relax the stresses of wedding planning away. Our honeymoon here was magical.
There is a waterful to walk to from the cabin, you wake up to mountain views, a hot tub steps away, and a fire pit to use at night. The animals at the entrance were so cute and friendly, that we could not resist stopping (almost) each time we drove by to give them treats in the little cupboard by them. There are plenty of things to do around, we visited little Switzerland a short drive away. The inn had awesome food and VIEWS, felt like you were in Europe. We also stopped at the Altpass Apple Orchard very close and had homemade apple pie. We also visited Mt. Mitchell and Black Mountain. We recommend Eddies Pizza & Pasta (homemade bread an marina are great) in Marion, Black Mountain Bistro in Black Mountain, and the Inn at Little Switzerland for awesome food. 10/10 will return."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved that this cabin felt secluded, private and surrounded by nature with amazing Mountain View‚Äôs. Close enough of a drive for us to explore Asheville and hiking. Super clean, cute and we would definitely recommend staying hear for a peaceful getaway!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had the best time staying at Audra & Summer's. Everything looked just like the photos. It was stunningly beautiful! So many little touches that took the experience above and beyond - things you didn't even think you would want or need that made the experience even more special. I can't recommend this place enough. Absolutely wonderful and beautiful. My dogs loved it as well! Audra and Summer were very helpful and communicative as well. I hope I can come back someday.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying at this cute little cabin for a quick weekend getaway! The views were incredible and the place was very clean. We had no trouble getting up to the cabin in our 4WD RAV4. The two cabins are close by, but you cannot hear or see your neighbors, which was really nice! The bed was extremely comfortable. Loved staying here!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! If you‚Äôre hesitant to book, don‚Äôt be! We drive a large ford transit camper van which isn‚Äôt 4wd and I was worried about getting up to the cabin but we were able to just fine. We enjoyed the peaceful surroundings, spending time on the deck with the gorgeous views and even hiking to the on property waterfall! Oh, and visiting with the most friendly goats, donkey and mini horse on our way out! We didn‚Äôt want to leave. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"10/10 would stay here again. The hosts have built a small but very well designed spot on the side of a mountain that's perfect for a couple's getaway. Amazing cleared out view of nearby mountains from your private hottub or firepit. Clean and tidy room. Hot water, fridge, and stove as well as all the basics of a kitchen that you'd expect. The hosts provided some great personal touches including treats and a towel for our dog. The hill up to the house is pretty steep but it seems to drain well and was handled easily by our AWD highlander. Hope to be back soon!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great stay. peaceful
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very nice, quiet, clean accommodation with a very nice view,
For us it was an unforgettable trip, highly recommended
üéñÔ∏èüéñÔ∏èüéñÔ∏èüéñÔ∏èüéñÔ∏èü§©"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great weekend get-away with a great view and super privet! Close to local towns, great hiking trails, and Asheville. Will definitely be back?"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy cabin with beautiful views and awesome amenities. Great for a weekend getaway or a longer stay! 10/10 I would definitely recommend
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. The cabin was beautiful and the bed/bedding was super comfortable. The location is very peaceful and relaxing. It was the perfect place to get away from it all for a few days and the hosts were great!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had an amazing stay! Audra and Summer were great hosts. The pictures don‚Äôt do the place justice, you really just need to see it go yourself. I saw some comments saying they had some issues getting to the cabin in a 2WD car. I have a 2WD car and had no issues. It was also great petting the farm animals on the way in and out everyday. Very peaceful, couldn‚Äôt have asked for s better way for my girlfriend and I to spend our 3 year anniversary!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"The treehouse is just like the photos - super clean with a nice view and very private. The unit is well appointed, the furniture is really comfy, the hot tub is great and the smores for the firepit are a really nice touch! The hosts are very helpful and communicative. The only downside is the drive up - I checked the reviews and saw conflicting opinions about whether or not 4WD is necessary. After checking in with the host, we opted to give it a shot in our 2WD car - ended up getting stuck on the last climb, just before the 2WD pull off, and had to get towed up by the hosts. I think it's more about what kind of tires you have, and mine didn't cut it. Something to consider!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Paradise. This quaint tree house was the perfect getaway. We enjoyed watching the stars in the hot tub, making smores by a campfire, hiking, and relaxing. The house is beautifully furnished and impeccably clean. We loved feeding the animals by the gate and relaxing in nature. I highly recommend enjoying this beautiful retreat to everyone wanting to unwind and recharge."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"High Haven Treehouse was every bit like the photos and description in the listing!
We came here to celebrate our 30th birthdays and our have our last trip as a family of 3 before Baby #2 comes.
The drive up is super doable in a 2-wheel-drive car all the way up to the provided 2wd pull-off point. For us, we were also fine getting beyond that to the treehouse parking.
The treehouse was squeaky clean and stood out because they allow dogs - but not a single allergic reaction was had by those of us in our family allergic to dogs! Not a hair or crumb or streak in sight: perfectly clean.
Beautiful decor, treehouse construction was gorgeous, and welcome goodies were an awesome touch. Clear instructions too!
There was ample space for a pack-n-play to be set up if your little one is too small for the the trundle bed provided. Toddler approved!
We all loved the sweet animals, swinging bridge, hammock, fire, hot tub, and hike to the little waterfall! Book this treehouse!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is exactly like the pictures and makes for an ideal weekend getaway! It‚Äôs so beautiful and cozy and comfortable and private. Just the best stay with the best view! We‚Äôll be back :)
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect small getaway in the mountains! It was clean, quiet, relaxing, and overall very fun"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay at this treehouse. It is truly just like the pictures, loved waking up every morning to the mountains. Everything was very clean, loved the hot tub and hammock. We were in need of a place to just unwind and relax and this was the perfect place. So very quit. Treehouse has everything you need, they do a great job of including so many amenities in this Tiny House. Clear instructions included. Truly a great stay for the two of us."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,this was the most AMAZING getaway for my birthday. everything was absolutely perfect from hot tub stargazing to the comfiest bed ever to the most beautiful views ever!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My fianc√© and I do experiences instead of presents for our birthdays so this year for my 27th we chose this beautiful little getaway with our 100 pound puppy and we all had an absolute wonderful, peaceful, and all around great time while here! Hope to be back for another birthday experience!ü•≥"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"As a rental cabin owner in Gatlinburg, We were so impressed by the high quality construction and every detail has been thought out to make your stay flawless!!!
Should have more than a 5 star rating."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a stunningly beautiful place! Secluded but the town is still easily accessible, this adorable tiny cabin is absolutely perfect for a couple. We loved every minute of it and will be back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful getaway! We will definitely be back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was an amazing property.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect little getaway for the night! The farm animals greeting you as you drive up, the hot tub overlooking the mountains, the firepit with the twinkle lights- everything made for a great experience for a little romantic getaway for my boyfriends birthday. I've already shared the link to multiple friends and family members!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The house and property are beautiful. However, I highly recommend having a 4 wheel drive vehicle if you are interested in booking. Note that the 2 wheel drive pull off is only after a lot of steep gravel driving. Although our 2wd SUV has relatively new all terrain tires and we've taken it many similar places, it did not handle the incline/gravel combination prior to the pull off very well. Unfortunately, we did not feel comfortable trying to make the drive up a second time and cancelled our second night. However, Audra and Summer were very understanding and graciously refunded us for the second night. The house and property are beautiful and I highly recommend it if you have a vehicle capable of the ascent. The view from the porch is hard to beat on a starry night."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I wish I could give more than 5 stars! This is a very special Airbnb. It is so unique, with the swinging rope bridge, the beautiful deck overlooking the mountains, a waterfall nearby, and cute animals! I am so thankful that the treehouse is dog friendly, because my dog had a blast! I loved how the home was located in a convenient area close to many restaurants and nature experiences. I would love to go back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic views from a great place. Secluded and quiet, perfect for those looking to unplug for a bit."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first trip away from home as a young family. My wife and I had a wonderful time relaxing in this beautiful treehouse cabin with absolutely breathtaking views of the Blue Ridge mountains. We didn‚Äôt hike to the nearby waterfall, but we did feed the goats and donkey and our 3-month old son got a kick out of it. Coffee and a hot tub on the deck is the cherry on top. And the hosts were super responsive with the few questions we had. Highly recommend and we will be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is perfect for a romantic and relaxing getaway! The cabin is equipped with exactly what you need to just relax and enjoy the space. The hot tub is excellent, the bed is comfortable, and the view is gorgeous. Everything was spotless. We ate at several local places, and our favorite was Louise‚Äôs breakfast a short drive away in Black Mtn. The farm animal greeting upon returning to the cabin was a great bonus."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at High Haven Cabin. The views were spectacular, the cabin was immaculate, and the hot tub was a welcome respite. Feeding the goats and Peggy Jean was a highlight!
We appreciated the local recommendations and enjoyed hikes to Still Creek Falls, Tom‚Äôs Creek Falls, Crabtree Falls, the Marion Greenway, and Linville Falls. GoGo‚Äôs Cinnamon Rolls is a must stop - delicious!
We liked the privacy of being out in nature a bit, but still close enough to drive to Asheville and the Biltmore Estate.
We highly recommend High Haven Cabin to anyone looking for a quiet place to stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Audra and Summer go above and beyond to ensure your stay is excellent. They have a beautiful property and have done an absolutely fantastic job of making everything accessible and friendly to the guests and their fur children.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, private little spot but still close to all amenities"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location and tree house are awesome, they've made a great job making this the perfect place for a quick getaway from the cleanliness, to the thoughtful details throughout the house (yay for s'mores pack) to the cutest animal farms that greet you at the entrance (Peggy Jean, the donkey is the sweetest) and I can't say enough good things about how responsive and helpful the hosts were."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an excellent, private little romantic getaway! This was our favorite Airbnb we've ever stayed in. The views were incredible, the Treehouse itself was adorable, the smell of fresh wood was so nice. We loved sleeping in the comfy bed just steps away from French doors that opened to a private patio with a hot tub! Unfortunately our hot tub didn't work but Audra and Summer were apologetic and responsive about it. Be aware, getting there in 2 wheel drive was hairy and parking impossible. There's a 2 wheel drive pull-off that was helpful, but getting up the hill in wet conditions was low and slow. Recommend 4wd for sure! Overall, a lovely getaway perfect for our honeymoon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, quiet, clean, peaceful. The goats, donkey, and mini horse were our favorite! Always there to greet us when driving back or leaving :) would go back in a heartbeat!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! What an incredible trip. This property is absolutely stunning and was the perfect most peaceful getaway for 2. I wish I could give it 10 stars! ü§©
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt say enough about this place! It is absolutely gorgeous and when we arrived it was spotlessly clean! The hosts provided everything we could need plus more. They really thought of every detail and even provided a welcome basket for our pups with some treats! Their food and hike recommendations were spot on and we had such a good time exploring the area. The goats, pony, and donkey at the entrance made my day!! They are so sweet!! We will definitely be staying here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Meeting the animals and being able to feed them was so much fun. The treehouse was exactly as described and provided a beautiful view of the mountains. What a nice view to wake up to everyday. The host answered all questions immediately and left local recommendations of places to eat and visit. We would definitely stay here again.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice views, private and cozy place. We loved everything about it. Host was responsive and accommodating."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at the cabin. The views were great. We enjoyed the fire pit area, deck and hot tub. The goats and donkey/pony were fun to feed for my kids.
We went into Asheville before we checked in, and then drove towards the cabin on the Blue Ridge Parkway. The views were incredible, and we did a hike at Craggy Gardens. We also recommend the waterfall hikes at Toms Falls and Roaring Fork...both easy enough for little kids.
We had a great weekend and can't wait to visit in the future. **Bonus tip for 2WD going up the hill...if you aren't used to it, go faster than you think you need too and it's way easier to get to the top then going slower (2nd try tip lol)"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best experience ever!! The place was so peaceful and quiet and the cabin was extremely gorgeous everything was clean and well designed. Thank you for the beautiful place üíïüíïwe can‚Äôt wait to come back here again!!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay for a quiet getaway! Place was lovely and hosts were very helpful! 10/10 recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful views to wake up to. This was that perfect place to stay for a peaceful weekend in the mountains. The treehouse had everything that we needed. Highlights of our stay included walking to the waterfall on the property and simply relaxing on the porch, looking out over the mountains. Truly dog friendly. We will definitely plan to return."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was just what I needed! Beautiful location and super serene. Hosts were very responsive and gave local recs! I will definitely be back (especially for the donkey!!). Loved that the host had s‚Äômores kits ready for you at check in.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The treehouse cabin was wonderful. The privacy and views were top notch. Loved the hot tub overlooking the mountains. The fire pit was lots of fun. We will definitely go back.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We have traveled all over the world, in many airbnbs..this place is by far our favorite.

We highly recommend staying here!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved spending a night at this cabin, the view was breathtaking and the amenities were sufficient for a short stay. It rained all through my stay so I could hike to the waterfalls but it was amazing soaking myself in the hot tub."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Prefect get away!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent location for a romantic weekend. Iconic views with a great cozy cabin and comfy hot tub to tie it together. Perfect place for a couple or single person to zone out and turn off from the world. Some of the best stargazing you can get on Eastern side of the states as well. We will definitely visit High Haven Cabin again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning. The treehouse is absolutely stunning and Audra and Summer are incredible hosts‚Äîsuper responsive and accommodating and the description and photos of this paradise do the location justice but nothing can beat staying here and experiencing everything first-hand. As someone who works with architects and construction design, it is clear a lot of thought has gone into this gorgeous and creative haven. Truly such a unique experience and one that will leave you feeling well rested, close to nature and wholly rejuvenated."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was definitely the best place to stay at for a night peaceful getaway! Absolutely gorgeous in every way! My girlfriend and I will most definitely be coming back!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Audra and Summer‚Äôs cabin was somehow even more beautiful than the pictures!! Everything about our stay was perfect and they were very helpful and proactive with communication. We will absolutely be returning, hopefully very soon!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing weekend in the cabin. If you are looking for a cooking kitchen, re-think your plans. The small two burner stove is nice but there is no oven and even less counter space, but you can grill on the firepit and the freezer/fridge is a half size so far larger than an average mini-fridge. We got up to the cabin in our 2 wheel drive Ford Escape with no issues but make sure you don't ride in the middle if you are not comfortable driving on steep gravel drives. The walk to the pavilion is short and also gravel but the trail head is there and is amazing! its a short walk to the waterfall and it does not dissappoint! At the foot of the mountain every afternoon we were greeted by all of the goats and donkey and got to feed them coming and going - awesome. The view from the cabin is unparalleled and worth every penny. Bed is super comfortable and I'm a bad sleeper. Marion is a short drive and has plenty of breweries and don't miss Pepperonis pizza on the way back!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,extremely clean and a perfect getaway from busy urban living New and fresh log cabin and a fun swinging bridge!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such a wonderful stay here ‚Äî it‚Äôs hard to fully put this place into a few sentences of a review. From the farm animals vocally greeting us on arrival to the coziness of relaxing under the stars and waking up to the morning sunrise, this place was beautiful. Private, quiet, and very comfortable. Somehow the location and views were even more serene and stunning than the pictures, which made our stay all the more special. Was a pleasure to be one of the first guests here and hope to be back in the future!"

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved our stay over the Christmas holiday. Our host Maria, was kind enough to set up a Christmas tree, decorations, and lights that really made the house feel like Christmas at home for our family.
The view out the back is a spectacular natural view with almost no houses in sight. We enjoyed making smores in the firepit out back and were grateful the hosts provided a well-supplied stock of dry firewood.
Inside, the house was immaculate clean, and the kitchen was well stocked for cooking. The beds were very comfortable and the morning views out the window were wonderful.
The host added so many extra supplies and touches that made our stay relaxing. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely wonderful! We had a wonderful time. Our expectations were exceeding!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the Carriage House was peaceful and exactly what we were looking for. My husband & I were celebrating our anniversary with a quick weekend getaway. It was the perfect size for just the 2 of us. We were attending a festival in downtown Marion which was less than a 10 minute drive from the home. Everything was clean & tidy. Shelby reached out the day before our trip with all the information we needed and to let us know to contact her with any questions or needs.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Shelby gave us very clear instructions and the place was lovely and clean! And there was an added bonus of having cute cows as neighbors!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this stay! It was very cute, clean, and well kept. It was close to the main part of town, but still felt private. Shelby was very responsive and helpful!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shelby's place was perfect for my son, husband and myself. It is smaller with low ceilings exactly as described but was not an issue for us at all. They had coffee and creamer packets for us to use. All linens were provided and clean. They did a great job decorating and making it feel welcoming but not cluttered. The only downside was no microwave, but we just used the oven to warm up our food. My son loved the trundle and it was super comfy for a movie. We were greeted in the morning by the cows in the pasture. The surroundings were peaceful as well as beautiful. However not far from a gas station and town for some fast food. Ten out of ten recommend. It was perfect for us. If we ever pass through again we will definitely stay here."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shelby was a great host and very responsive! She was flexible to let us leave our car there for a period of time after check out (and even longer when we lost the keys briefly). The space was cozy and cute. The bathroom is attached to the bedroom space which is clearly written on the listing. This was a non issue for us but may be a consideration for others. Overall, great spot for our needs and preferences!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was peaceful, and a great location! The unit was easy to access and really nicely styled and appointed. The host was very nice and responsive. The sheets were very clean and for a person with sensitivities it was perfect. She went above and beyond with proving some snacks and water and it was helpful to have a hair dryer there! Only negatives were an over-abundance of spiders and bugs, torn screens so we couldn‚Äôt open all the windows, the AC unit had a mildew smell, the shower could use a new shower liner, and the deck needed a sweep of plant matter. Overall though a pleasant stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed here a couple of times now. The place is very clean. Simple but has the necessities. Shelby is very responsive and has everything ready. This place is really close to our parents house and perfect for our visits.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Shelby's looks out onto a beautiful field; I wanted to just sit and look at it. The bed was comfortable and it was all put together nicely. Since there's no microwave I heated my leftovers in the oven and was reminded how much better things taste when heated that way. A very nice overnight stay. Note there are stairs up to it but only one short flight.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I spent a very pleasant birthday weekend. The stay offered by Shelby was cozy, equipped with all the essentials. Find a clean and safe space. I appreciate the detail of snacks for my birthday. I definitely recommend this place."

Beautiful views of horses in the pastures in the morning, a super convenient location and we had all we needed- coffee, a stocked kitchen and comfy beds for 4. It really didn't even feel like the ceilings were low either, it felt really open and bright! We ate at McDowell Local down the road and highly recommend - the owner was super friendly and welcoming and food was phenomenal. We'll for sure be back to Marion!!! Thank you Shelby!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We needed a place to stay at the last minute in Marion, and this was perfect! Super cute and everything we needed!

2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Cute little place for a quick getaway. Easy to find and quiet. I‚Äôm a super clean freak so I would suggest a deep clean, few cobwebs and spiders, but it is located on top of a garage so that would explain the spiders. Overall, enjoyed our stay."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is very roomy, including the bathroom. The location of the airbnb is great for taking a bike ride up to Mount Mitchell, as well as being close to other attractions.

Her place was clean and simple, easy to navigate with a toddler, and her communication was wonderful and quick!

We felt beyond welcome, and as if family were sharing their cottage. The creek , hammocks, and gentle rain made this one memorable weekend. I additionally appreciated the list of nearby attractions in all directions. Thanks for having us and we can‚Äôt wait be back! In fact We have to return- our boys have been asking why we had to come home ever since we started packing up to leave. Thanks again!"

Perfect spot for anyone interested in getting the real cabin experience in the mountains. This place has been in the family for generations.
Hiking trails to waterfalls aren‚Äôt far (10 min drive) including blue ridge parkway.
We ate in mostly, with a wonderfully equipped kitchen, but Puerto Nuevo Mexican restaurant was incredible for a night out. Inexpensive and everything made in-house.
Ron and Janet were so lovely, met us at the cabin and gave us a quick tour and rundown. This is a tight knit community with friendly neighbors around, which had us feeling right at home.
Perfect for couples escape or small family.
I could‚Äôve sat by that creek by the house for days just enjoying the mountain air and feeding the trout.
We will be back!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a return visit. I love the location and the hosts a great
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ron and Janet are simply lovely people. I wouldn't hesitate to spend an afternoon chatting it up with them while sitting by the creek with a glass of sweet tea in hand. The place is better than the pictures suggest. I has family history and you can feel the love that is in this home. If you ask, they will tell you about the people in the pictures on the wall or any of the heirloom items that thoughtfully decorate the space.
The beds are comfy, plenty of blankets and between the mini split and the gas fireplace, there is no problem keeping as warm as you like. Everything was spotless, in pristine condition and of high quality.
The view of the creek from the sitting room is fantastic. We enjoyed a long visit from a blue heron, during one of the mornings, who was staring down trout in the stream. We also enjoyed seeing and hearing a Guinea hen. Many cultures consider them to bring good fortune. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. Thank you Ron and Janet."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful home to stay in. Beautiful area and so well equipped. Everything we needed plus things you wouldn‚Äôt expect to be were provided.

Thank you guys for a wonderful getaway!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,:) 10/10
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ron and Janet are two of the nicest people you would want to meet. We've never had any reservations like this one. The directions may seem a litle complicated but Ron and Janet stayed in contct with us to make sure we found it okay. Peaceful Creekside Cabin sure fits the name. It's so peaceful, comfortable, and cozy. Janet makes sure that the cabin is equipped with everything you need. If you forgot something, you bet you can find what you need right there in the cabin.
The weather took a drastic change and the temperature dropped quickly. Ron was on the spot to make sure the fireplace, the thermostat, and extra heaters were at finger tip. He made sure we were warm and comfortable!!!
I could write a book about these two and never cover everything. We enjoyed Ron telling us about the history of the cabin and his family who once lived there. (When you go, look for the pictures on the wall. :):)
Thank you again Ron and Janet!!! Thanks for checking on our safe travels home as well. :):)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Close to all the places we wanted to visit during the day. It was great to sit by the creek and enjoy the fire in the evenings and just relax. We were sad to leave!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the cabin. It was perfect for the two of us. We loved the stream, fire pit and the sun room. Ron and Janet were the perfect hosts and made us feel like we were staying with family instead of just accommodations. The story behind the cabin made it more endearing. Can‚Äôt wait to come back."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Attentive, friendly, courteous, very responsive to questions, respectful of our privacy. We highly recommend these hosts and hope to stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ron and Janet are friendly and helpful. We enjoyed talking with both of them. The cabin is quaint and so peaceful. We loved sitting around a campfire at night listening to the stream. We will definitely be back.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The photos did not do this place justice! The hosts were friendly and welcoming. The place was perfect for our little family and so serene. It was very clean and had everything we needed to have a comfortable stay. Our toddler loved the wildlife and feeding the fish. We‚Äôve stayed in many airbnbs and cabins and this is probably our favorite. We would definitely stay again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was beautiful. We enjoyed the panoramic view from the picture window inside the cabin. And even though this place was hard to find, Ron kept in touch with us and directed us where to meet him so he could bring us in to the cabin. The creek was so peaceful, and it was fun feeding the fish. We really enjoyed our stay. And now that we know how to get here, will recommend it to others. Ron and Janet, you really have a little piece of heaven here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely go back to this little slice of Heaven! So close to the Blue Ridge Parkway, Little Switzerland and to Marion for more amenities. Hubs loved feeding the fish and the cabin itself was so cozy, clean and well stocked - just charming. Ron and Janet were a pleasure too!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We LOVED our stay here! It was super comfortable. Beds were comfy. The home was super clean. Kitchen was stocked with whatever you could need. The hosts were super friendly and inviting. We‚Äôd definitely stay here again.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 4th trip to the Peaceful Creekside Cabin, and we always feel right at home. Ron and Janet are always a pleasure to speak with, and they really have everything we need already there waiting for us. They make us feel like family, and it has been wonderful getting to know them, and the history of the cabin. The cabin is an absolute gem, and we have never found anything quite like it. A lot of love was put into this place, and it shows."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at this little piece of Heaven on Earth for a week - what a fantastic experience from start to finish. True Southern hospitality at its finest! Ron & Janet went out of their way to help us find the cabin (which is in the mountains) and made us feel welcome right away. Our family of 4 (including twin 10 year old girls) settled right in and got to enjoy hanging out by the creek, sitting by fires at the firepit, reading books, playing board games, cooking in the well equipped kitchen & relaxing on the porch. Although the cabin is off the beaten path, it is still easy to find your way to explore other places like the Blue Ridge Parkway or other destinations in Western NC. We even went to Carowinds, which was less than 2 hours away. If you ever need help with anything at all, Ron & Janet are super responsive and also make great recommendations for things to do - if that is what you are looking for. (Or just enjoy your peaceful retreat.) Highly recommend! We can't wait to go back!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When we got lost in a driving mountain rain while trying to find this place, our host drove out, found us, and guided us home. Fresh produce from their garden was waiting for us on the counter when we arrived. That probably tells you most of what you need to know: the hosts are the kindest and most generous we‚Äôve met. Their beautiful little cabin is just as special--everything thoughtfully furnished--and the place is spotlessly, sparkling clean. A front porch with swing, hammock, chairs and a BBQ grill looks out (as does a charming sitting room off the kitchen) on a gorgeous little trout stream winding around boulders, through riffles and pools. The fish are for the grandkids (there‚Äôs a bin of Purina fish chow if you want to feed them, however, and it‚Äôs a hoot), but the host showed me an easily-waded stream stocked with Rainbow, Brook, and Brown trout, about a tenth of a mile down the road. Western North Carolina is simply stunning: mountains and streams, hiking trails and waterfalls,"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved this cabin by the creek! It has everything you need (especially in the kitchen) and Ron and Janet were great hosts!

Thank you Ron and Janet !"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough good things about Ron and Janet. Two of the nicest people you‚Äôll ever meet. They always check in to see if we need anything.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A little slice of Heaven. The perfect creekside setting. If you have kids, book it! Great swimming hole, corn hole, fire pit, a swing, and plenty of board games. My son thought sleeping in the loft was so cool.
The house was immaculately clean and everything we needed was furnished. The owners had the fire pit set up, offered local recommendations, and made sure we were comfortable. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ron and Janet have provided a home away from home adorable cabin. From the time we arrived to after we left they checked in on us and made sure we had everything we needed.

I‚Äôve already recommended them to someone and we will definitely be back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our 2nd time staying at the cabin and we are so glad we returned. We love the creek, feeding the fish, having a campfire, and the parkway being nearby.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time and it was very relaxing to sit by the creek and feed the trout. Ron and Janet were great hosts and were attentive to our needs which were very few since they provided just about everything you could need. One small thing that was greatly appreciated was that they left on the key ring to the cabin a local grocery store and gas discount card. Thank you folks for the hospitality and we will certainly be back!

It is the perfect little getaway in a peaceful surrounding. The kitchen has everything you need if you plan to cook your meals or there are places to eat close by. There is plenty to do in the area, sightseeing, hiking, fishing. Or stay at the cabin and play a game or read a book by the creek. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My second time staying at this cabin! Our family loved the creek running along the property, and the easy access to lots of great hikes."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second visit. Very nice creek front location in remote NC. Had a great time enjoying the fire pit and just decompressing.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far the friendliest hosts we have met on our many years for using airbnb. The home is the quintessential cabin in the woods will all the amenities. A gas fireplace next to a couch and chairs that puts out a lot of heat (it has a regulator), a full kitchen, bath/shower, large kitchen table, double bed , changing room and a small room with rocking chairs overlooking the stream in the back yard. It's as cozy as it gets. We stayed here because we wanted to do some hiking and visiting potteries as well as drive into Asheville for the day -about 1 hr drive. This cabin is remote, the closest coffee shops and restaurants are in Downtown Spruce Pine, with a mall with typical stores on the bypass. As are most homes in this area, the cabin is close to the road, but this road had very little traffic and once inside we felt like we were in the middle of the woods. If that's not enough the floors are a rich cherry wood made from furniture grade lumber and there is a loft with a double bed."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Janet and Ron were great. The cabin was beautiful and has everything you need. We will definitely be back.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 3rd stay at the peaceful creekside cabin, and we fealt right at home!! Ron & Janet are wonderful hosts, and the cabin is always clean and cozy!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ron & Janet's home meets the description of ""peaceful"" and ""stream side"". Inside it's comfortable and well furnished, including the kitchen. Outside, there's a fire pit ready to go right next to the mountain stream. Check in and check out was very easy. There aren't any nearby restaurants or shops, so view this as a true get-away. There is good trout fishing downstream from the cabin, and many hiking trails in the vicinity."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time during our stay! The Sun room is so peaceful when the sun shines in the windows and you can sit and watch the creek flow by. It was nice seeing the stars and being in the quiet. Our son said he wished he had brought his telescope! The kids loved having the open space. Plenty of space for our family of 4 inside. Several games to choose from, as well as corn hole. Our daughter loved the pigs and hens across the creek. Hosts are very friendly and responsive. We hope to return when the weather is warm enough for in-creek play!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a warm and friendly place to stay

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for a relaxing weekend. I think the highlight of the stay was watching the farm animals graze the field across from the cabin (pigs, wild turkeys and chickens). Host was pleasant and responsive. The little creek that runs through the property proved to be a great resting spot with a nice fire pit included to extend your stay outside."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything is perfect, if you are a type of person who appreciates nature and peaceful place to stay. The cabin has everything you need to have a relaxing get away.

The cabin was clean and cozy and the property was lovely. We loved sitting in the sunroom watching the creek down below while eating our breakfast and playing games. The kitchen was stocked with all the things we needed to cook our meals. My son did some fly fishing just a 5 minute walk down the road. The location is close to Little Switzerland where there is a wonderful bookstore/coffee shop. We were not far from the blue ridge parkway and were also close to Toms Creek Falls in Marion. It was a wonderful getaway for a few days!

Ron and Janet were exceptional hosts, checking in to make sure we were comfortable and went out of their way to help us! We are definitely staying there again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly Peaceful!
You will find Fresh Mountain air, the sound of water flowing in the creek, an evening fire outside and inside (gas fireplace), a fully stocked kitchen and more.

We highly recommend this home as a peaceful getaway."

The location is quiet and peaceful, making it the perfect place to get away and relax for a while. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for more accommodating hosts, and would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and home-like environment. The cabin has a relaxing sunroom with a beautiful view of creek. Well-equipped kitchen. Cyclists would enjoy staying here as Little Switzerland and the Blue Ridge Parkway are only a 7-mile climb from the cabin on low traffic road.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ron and Janet are exceptional In their hospitality. They greeted us at the cabin and showed us around the property . They Answered every question concerning Wi-Fi local restaurants and churches. The property is equipped with many outdoor sitting areas a place for a fire and a creek full of fish to feed. Little extras like shampoos and soaps and coffee pampered me and my travel companions . Condiments and spices make the kitchen ready for cooking and sitting on the porch or by the creek for mountain musings and hillside fellowship! It‚Äôs a beautiful place with warm welcoming hosts . I will return again !

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We returned for a second stay and brought our children. We've stayed in January and now in August so can vouch for the beautiful grounds and comfort of the cabin in cold and hot seasons. We loved playing in the creek, relaxing in the swings and hammock and totally enjoyed every minute here. Our kids are already asking when we can return. You can't find better hosts than Mr. Ron and Mrs. Janet! You'll have what you need and more on hand. Bring good water shoes if you want to play in the creek."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much Janet&Ron for our fantastic stay at Peaceful Creekside Cabin!
Great directions, suggestions to local attractions, and the speediest fire starter we have ever seen. The fish food in the bear proof container was added entertainment - feeding the trout in the creek.
We could not have asked for anything more...everything you could need to make it a home away from home was there!
Thanks again!
Susie, Nicole, and Carolina

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was immaculate and well furnished. We particularly enjoyed the sun room overlooking a creek on the property. It was great for bird watching and relaxing. We also enjoyed feeding the fish in the creek.
The location of the cabin proved to be convenient for trips to the Blue Ridge Parkway, Linville, Grandfather Mountain and Julian Price park. The town of Marion was convenient for shopping trips and had a variety of restaurants.
We hope to visit the cabin in the future."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful cabin right on the creek! Ron and Janet are wonderful, and the cabin is very comfortable and relaxing! It is also in a great location and close to fun things to do! We definitely plan on returning!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything I'd want a cabin in the mountains to be. Not too fancy, but exceptionally clean, cozy, functional, and charming. We spent most of our time sitting in the reading porch, enjoying the view of the stream.
The stream is delightful, the front porch is perfect, everything inside was just right. They even included ice in the fridge. And feeding the fish was a blast!
Ron and Janet were so friendly, we felt like they had personally invited us to visit.
A plus for motorcyclists: the cabin is right on 226A, otherwise known as the Diamondback. Traffic was few and far between."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! Ron met us upon arrival to show us around. The cabin was adorable, well maintained, well stocked, and spotless! We loved sitting by the big window reading and enjoying the view, relaxing on the front porch, and feeding the trout down at the creek (Ron even provided fish food). Ron came down and built a fire in the pit while we were cooking dinner, and it blazed for hours without us even needing to touch it!
5 stars, would recommend, will definitely be back!
Also, highly recommend Tom‚Äôs creek falls (10 mins from the cabin) for an easy/beautiful hike, and go to Smokey Que‚Äôs bbq for dinner!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is even better in person! Ron was an excellent host and very helpful with suggestions of things to do in the area. The cabin is very clean and cozy. The perfect place for a peaceful mountain getaway.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We don‚Äôt usually write reviews but are making an exception for our stay in NC. Ron & Janet couldn‚Äôt have been more welcoming or helpful!
They responded quickly, were waiting for us upon our arrival, and shared their insights about the area and the history of their family home. We had a wonderful time and hope to return next year. Oh, and a couple of more things, ‚ÄúPeaceful Creekside Cabin‚Äù was truly peaceful, well appointed, & spotlessly cleaned! Thank you both for making our stay comfortable & memorable."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the cabin for a weekend last summer and absolutely loved it, so we came back for a long weekend this summer to celebrate our anniversary. Ron and Janet are fantastic hosts and have thought of just about all the little touches to make the cabin comfortable. We spent a lot of time on the porch and in the sunroom‚Äîcan‚Äôt get enough of that view! And you can‚Äôt beat the location; easy drive to Marion, Lake James, Little Switzerland, and Linville. Lots of hiking nearby too. We look forward to staying here again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ron and Janet were wonderful hosts!
The cabin was quiet, clean, well stocked and comfortable.
We are from Florida and my children (5 and 10) were not used to having to navigate stairs to get to the restroom (which was downstairs) during the night. However, we were well set up without using the loft at all. There was plenty of room to set up a cot and several blankets/cushions to quickly and easily create 2 makeshift beds near the master bedroom and bathroom which made everyone happy.
We could have easily spent an entire relaxing day at the cabin swinging in the large tree swing, grilling out and having a campfire by the river. However, we opted to do some of the things they recommended in the area that didn't require too much additional driving.
We highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to have a relaxing weekend. Great things to do around and wonderful places to eat. Would highly recommend if you like nature.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing experience, Ron and Janet were extremely helpful in every way possible. One of my favorite things to do was feeding the fish in the creek!

The hosts are beyond hospitable. They even started a bonfire for us to make our stay more enjoyable! We will definitely be back again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin provided more than enough space for me and my son. It has two bedrooms, although one is sort of a loft that is open to the kitchen area. (Could be an issue if you're bringing the whole family and if people go to bed at different times.)
The kitchen was equipped with all basics and a few nice additions, including a Keurig coffee maker.
As the listing says, I had no cell service once I left the nearby main road, but could connect via cell and WiFi at the house. I like this cabin's location because it is 15-25 minutes from attractions in several different directions: the towns of Marion and Spruce Pine, Linville Falls, Linville Caverns, Blue Ridge Parkway, and more.
My son is almost 7 and his two favorite experiences were recommendations of the host: Buck Creek Trout Farm and Tom's Creek Falls. We highly recommend both!
We would definitely consider returning for a future trip to the mountains."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and clean cabin. Extremely relaxing. Hosts were very accomodating and helpful.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved Ron and Janet's cabin on the creek. I was looking for a place that would give that camping feel without having to go camping. The fire pit by the creek was so nice and the boys loved playing in the water and swinging on the tree swing. Our boys loved sleeping in the loft area, and my husband and I enjoyed looking out over the creek in the sun room in the evenings. Ron was an extremely accommodating host and even whittled us some sticks to roast some smores over the fire. We would definitely love to visit this place again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The written-out directions were very well written and useful to have before getting all the way to the house.

They are terrific hosts!!!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"(I am a bit wordy, but you should read this whole review!!)
AWESOME cabin !!! Even better in person than the pics! Our Hosts - they were both absolutely fantastic and so attentive.
We stayed here in some of the coldest temps of the 2022 season -- and it was perfect .... toasty warm inside, the gas logs were also good ambience, and the fav - coffee every morning in the Sunroom, with the large picture window overlooking the creek. So scenic and relaxing! and , we had a nice fire in the firepit one evening - all of these things just fed my soul !
The cabin's kitchen is VERY well furnished; great water pressure and temp in bathroom for Hot showers ! ... also have plenty of games, cards, books and some DVDs provided... be sure to ask the Hosts for their restaurant recommendations- we ate at several and were pleased with all of them. There was only 2 of us, so we only slept in downstairs bedroom - it was totally comfortable with an unexpected BIG closet for all our ""stuff"".
We are already looking to visit again this Spring!!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We arrived to Janet patiently waiting for us at the home. We got an amazing tour of everything we would need and a couple of places we could visit on our trip. They were very nice to bring us a couple of items when we needed them, at no charge. Unfortunately, there was a snow storm warning and they recommended we left early if we wanted to make it back home on time for work. Regardless of this, they helped us find a safer place to stay at and even offered us a refund for the nights we couldn‚Äôt spend. We are DEFINITELY coming back! Much love to Ron and Janet, we will remain in contact."

The last night we enjoyed a fire down by the creek. Ron was great with communication in ensuring all our needs were met."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful Creekside Cabin was ideal for our needs. While perched on the top of a hill the driveway was level with the road and only required a few steps to enter. We met Ron the owner upon our arrival. The cabin was built by his grandparents and Ron lived in it till he was a teenager. He and his wife renovated and updated the cabin several years ago.
The cabin had a large front porch that extended the length of the house. I sat out here every morning and some nights enjoying my coffee and the sounds of the creek below. The main floor had a large kitchen and dining table, den, fireplace and TV. My mother-in-law slept in the large bedroom with adjoining walk in closet. There was also a full bathroom complete with a washer and dryer. The focal point on the main level was the enclosed sitting area that looked out to the creek. Stairs led to what was originally an attic but now a loft bedroom. At 6'3"" I was limited where I could stand erect but the bed slept great.
Ron was quick on responses to my questions both before our arrival and during our stay. The cabin was super clean and we have recommended it to several friends and hope to return in the spring."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cozy cabin between Marion and Little Switzerland! Close to the Blue Ridge Parkway, hiking trails and waterfalls. The cabin was immaculate and Janet and Joe have gone above and beyond to make sure their guest have everything they need for a relaxing stay. We enjoyed sitting in the sunroom, overlooking the gorgeous creek, drinking our coffee each morning. Joe and Janet are super hosts..(very friendly and welcoming)....highly recommend this charming mountain getaway. We are already planning our return visit!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ron and Janet went out of their way to make our stay extra special. Ron stopped and got us liver mush and he even offered to build us a fire in the fire pit outside. Janet was kind enough to show me the ins and outs of the cabin, the AC and the heater, and chatted with me for a while on the front porch. They both were available by phone the whole time if we needed anything. Such friendly folks and the cabin looks just like the pictures. I look forward to going back one day."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! Wonderful experience! Everything is new and fresh and immaculately clean. The hosts are very friendly and welcoming and available for anything we could have needed. The cabin & setting is all we could have asked for, with a cozy (well stocked) interior with a lovely front porch perfect for rocking, and an easy flight of steps down to the beautiful creek. There is seating and a fire pit right on the banks of the creek (fire wood is even provided). All very picturesque... We enjoyed ourselves so much that we have already planned our next trip and we will be renting the second lovely house across the road as well as this cabin so that we can bring a crowd. There is only one thing that could have been improved upon this time -- MORE NIGHTS to stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great get away with the peaceful creek water running through the backyard. Our kids loved feeding the fish and the swing outside. House was spotless clean and host were great with communication and making sure we had everything we needed! Try out Bessie‚Äôs Dinner for breakfast in Marion!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little cabin in a remote, quiet area near Little Switzerland. Very clean and cozy. A great value getaway spot. The owner made us comfortable in case any needs arose, but our stay was perfect. Don‚Äôt think twice about this one. It‚Äôs a great stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful cabin and wonderful owners! The cabin was immaculate! Would definitely be going back! We especially enjoyed feeding the fish out back!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can't go wrong with this place

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best weekend at this cozy cabin! It exceeded all expectations! The hosts made sure we had everything we needed to relax and enjoy the peaceful mountain setting! The stream is glorious, the cabin is quiet and so comfortable. They have thought of everything! This has been placed at the very top of our list for our next mountain trip!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super clean. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever met that much clean place on Airbnb. Convenient location, polite host. Definitely come back next year."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin to stay at and the best host you could ask for. Definately will be coming back
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is amazing and so so cozy! Loved the warm feelings and being greeted by the actual host and them giving great tips and recommendations for all different things we asked! Talked to them for a little and got to see a peak at the next house they are going to start Airbnb too! Definitely will be back with the kids next time!! Couldn‚Äôt say a single thing bad as it‚Äôs perfect and calming!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot with amazing hosts!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent value and location. Ron is super nice and helpful.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ronald was a great host making sure we had all we needed. the location is idealic on the stream it is a lovely getaway
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"5-stars, all the way! If you have kids, go here.
Our family LOVED this cabin. Right next to a beautiful medium-sized creek with lots of trout (not for fishing) that you can feed to entertain the kids. We spent hours playing in the creek with our 6 year old. He loved it! And our little one liked to splash around, too. We also cooked hot dogs and s'mores at the private campfire area right next to the creek, with firewood Ron was kind enough to provide. Next night was hamburgers on the grill - always a winner.
The cabin is Very clean and well-appointed. Spotless, actually. Had everything we needed. We cooked meals there (all the pots, pans, dishtowels, silverware, knives, even the totally necessary coffee grinder and coffee supplied by owner in the cupboard). Love it when hosts make sure there is coffee, in case we forget to bring ours, life can continue... ;). The upstairs bedroom loft was a lot of fun for me and our son to sleep in. Kind of an adventure... The sitting room overlooking the creek is a great place to relax and reflect on life and the beauty of nature. There is a swing on the tree down by the river (near the corn hole boards) that our son absolutely loved. So be prepared to push several times a day. The swing can go pretty high, and our son had a great time over and over and over and over.
The location is fantastic. There are LOTS of options for short (or long - we selected short) hikes very closeby. We hiked 2 miles round trip to one waterfall near Little Switzerland, then went to a Gem Mine to ""pan for gold"". Something really fun for the kids, and we all learned a lot about gems, which NC is known globally for. The next day, on our way back to CLT, we hit Tom's Creek falls. A nice little mile loop with another gorgeous waterfall at the end. Great way to finish off the trip.
Ron is a WONDERFUL host. He was very responsive, and more than that, he is considerate. You can tell by his demeanor he is a truly kind and good person. His desire was to ensure that our family had everything we could need (and more) so that we could relax, unwind, and have a truly memorable getaway from the big city. He succeeded.
All in all, the Peaceful Creekside Cabin exceeded all of our expectations. We highly recommend it to you and your family. We will be going back to explore other nearby attractions. For sure."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin does not disappoint, great location offering peace and quiet. Ronald met us when we arrived and gave us a walk through of this amazing cabin. You have everything you will need here for a weekend getaway or a weeks long stay, highly recommend for anyone who needs a mountain getaway in a prime location. We will return to stay at this place again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hey travelers! If you need a touch of connecting with nature right outside the door, consider this spot. The hosts have thought about you and your needs prior to arrival. Everything from board games to a regular sized fridge, you'll have most of the conveniences of city life. Then, when you step outside the rush of water from the brook grabs your attention. Need a grill, they got it. Corn hole? They have that too! AND you might get to see something awesome like a grey heron! All that and it doesn't even cover all the nearby natural sites. It is a wonderful escape."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We found a great spot at The Peaceful Creekside Cabin. Ron and Janet were excellent hosts; easy to contact, friendly and helpful. The property is beautiful and well kept. Ron had several good suggestions for places to go and things to do, but hanging out at the cabin and enjoying the relaxing atmosphere might have been the best part of the visit. The way the light hits the property is amazing. Highly recommend this gem of a vacation spot."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for peace, relaxing and enjoying nature!! The house was so clean and all the details were perfect.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay if you are looking to escape from busy life and have a nice retreat in the mountains . Ron and Janet made sure we have everything we need and they made our stay very memorable .
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I came here to spend some time alone. Ron was great with explaining everything around and in general. Cabin is as described - clean, great outdoor space and can hike just as you head out. With closeness to blue ridge parkway and still secluded enough , this is a hidden gem of a place for a party of 1 or 2. Everything was as expected - Kitchen, bed, indoor space, outdoor space, you name it. 5 stars for everything. Recommended totally."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,We loved our stay Ronald‚Äôs beautiful country home! It is perfect location out in the country mountains with peaceful creek flowing by the house.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ronald and Janet were the most wonderful hosts, and this was one of our best Airbnb experiences yet. The cabin was very clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. A well appointed kitchen for preparing meals, games, comfortable beds, hammocks, etc. We loved sitting out on the back porch or around the fire spending time together. The creek running around three sides of the cabin was absolutely picturesque, and sitting out in the sunroom with coffee in the morning, was nothing short of delightful. We wish we could have stayed longer, this space was the backdrop to some wonderful memories made!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hospitality was second to none. Loved the space; amazing place to disconnect!

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great stay! The cabin and the view are even better than in the pictures. We hope to return in the future so we can spend more time relaxing on the porch or beside the stream. The hosts are very attentive and have clearly thought of all the little details to make your stay comfortable. We strongly recommend staying here if you‚Äôre in the area, even if only for one night!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, peaceful cabin!! Enjoyed hearing and seeing the wide variety of birds and butterflies, as well as fireflies in the evening.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, beautiful little cabin. Janet and Ron were wonderful and involved hosts who checked up on us. Sitting in the sunroom with a mug of coffee in the morning, watching the creek, is worth the drive."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is not only the cutest cabin ever BUT Ron was super friendly too! It felt like home for the 3 of us! We can‚Äôt wait to come back! We did get lost finding the place but Ron was quick to the rescue! It was nice to know that Ron was only a txt away if we needed anything! BEST AIR BNB EVER! The cabin had plenty of space and stuff to do. Beautiful views from the front porch and inside the cabin of the creek. The generous amenities made our visit stress free. Thank you again for such a comfortable home away from home!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in a great location to hike trails & waterfalls. The cabin had everything that we needed and was very clean. I enjoyed reading in the mornings in the back room, while looking out at the creek, it was very relaxing. We would stay here again!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay. Very clean with beautiful surroundings! With the main door open (screen door shut) you can hear the stream from inside, which I loved. The cabin is quaint but well appointed. Ronald and his wife were wonderful and they made sure we were comfortable. Would stay here again!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Peaceful Creekside Cabin. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better location and Janet and Ron were excellent hosts. We enjoyed meeting them and they responded promptly to any questions we had. Check in and out was a breeze.
We loved sitting out watching and listening to the river. We were treated to a campfire built for us and fresh farm eggs. The cabin was equipped with everything we needed. While we had no cell reception on 226A, the WiFi setup at the cabin worked great for accessing the Internet and texting. This is a great place to go to relax while still being close enough to other sites. We drove to along the Blue Ridge Parkway to Mount Mitchell, checked out Tom‚Äôs Creek and Linville Falls and Linville Falls winery. There are plenty of things to see and do. Thanks for a great stay!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great. The house had everything we needed and the placement and view along the creek was perfect. Seating inside and out took advantage of the location. Thank you for the outdoor fire.

2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous Creekside cabin. Amazing location if you‚Äôre looking to get away. Little Switzerland is right up the mountain and was like driving through a fairy tale. Also check out Toms Creek Falls. Super close and worth the hike weather you‚Äôre feeling adventurous or just casually looking to get back to nature. I would suggest stocking up on food and gas, they are both a bit of a drive away. Great living space. Amazing views. Would highly recommend for a mountain getaway."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing stay! Close to many local attractions that the hosts graciously disclosed! Breathtaking reading nook!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved this stay so much! The cabin is beautiful, cozy and so homey and our boys really enjoyed the loft because it reminded them of a tree house! There‚Äôs also a gorgeous creek just outside the window, (we enjoyed watching the creek while we had our morning coffee), so peaceful and heart-warming. The owners- (Ronald and his wife) are so welcoming and provided us with everything u we could possibly need including a list of nearby attractions. We‚Äôre so appreciative to have found a gem like this one and will definitely be visiting back again!ü¶ã‚ú®‚ú®"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place! The place is very well kept and up to date. The wifi works wonderfully (which helped when I was doing my work). It comes with almost every type of food appliance, so don‚Äôt worry about bringing anything. The place also is stocked with really nice shampoo/conditioner/hand soap which is an extra plus! Definitely a hidden gem!"

It has an incredible view of a beautiful creek and the mountains, comfy beds and living spaces, a fully functional kitchen, and a gorgeous porch.

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"my wife and I came to visit for a 4 day getaway. We absolutely fell in love with the place and are planning on returning later this year with our children! The creek is so serene, and the home itself is so lovely and inviting. It was very clean, had every comfort of Home including fresh ground coffee creamer and sugar. The owners were also kind enough to bring us by some of their fresh honey from their bee apiary! We forgot eggs and butter, and they brought us some and refused to accept payment for it. They really were a class act!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super kind hosts, beautiful location, next to a river at the foot of a mountain. Charming interior that overlooks the landscape. Love the sunroom! Graciously had the fire pit started when we returned for the night. 10/10 experience in every regard."

He welcomed us and explained the trails that are available to walk on the land. He also recommended Tom's Creek falls and Linville falls that are near by as well as some local food in Marion. He was available for anything we needed, he made us a bonfire one night down by the creek. It was incredible!
The cabin is cozy and warm with multiple gas fireplaces, a clean bathroom and a sun room where you can sit and read overlooking the water. We loved every second of this trip and we hope to do it again sometime!"
