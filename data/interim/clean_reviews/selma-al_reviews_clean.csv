2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"AC is fantastic , this weekend was the 55th Selma Jubilee and all hotels were booked, my pageant sisters and I had to opportunity to stay two nights at Woolworths loft. As this was not my first time staying , it was my sister queens and they really enjoyed being close to downtown , parking was perfect , we ate lunch at downtowners which was walking distance, and in route of the parade. This visit made it my 3rd stay and I’m making it a priority to visit each loft ."

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is an ideal place to stay if you want to really experience Selma. Location is on the main street just a short walk to the NPS Center and the bridge. The rooms are amazing in a nicely renovated historic building with lots of character and modern conveniences. Very comfortable. AC is a tremendous help with planning your stay. We did her sampler tour which helped get us oriented to the community. She had great recommendations of things to do and places to eat. Good information is also found in the room. Can not say enough positives and it is worth a stay in Selma if you want to appreciate the historic significance of this place.

I brought my daughters there while we waited for their Aunt to pick them up for the weekend and my 5 year old daughter went on and on about how cute the Loft was and how much she loved it and wants to stay in it herself one day.

I felt so much peace and needed the quiet to help finish a few projects and heal myself from the work I do. My grandmother passed April 1st, and June 27th is her birthday.

Their owners have done a wonderful job of preserving and converting the building into splendid loft apartments, and a delightful design shop on the ground floor. It was a great place to stay.

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay with Ac and she continues to treat us as family! I really like how she would check in on us to make sure we are ok and if we are in need of anything. If you are visiting Selma I would definitely recommend you booking with her!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came to Selma with a group of friends and family and rented 3 of ACs lofts.

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay at Woolworth Lofts. Not only was Suite C lovely from the standpoint of design, it was also sparkling clean, comfortable, and located in the heart of downtown Selma.

AC is a great host who clearly loves the city is excited to help you have a richer experience while you're in town."
2019-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This place is beautiful, spacious and immaculate. My only complaint was the noise I heard at night, but I was on west coast time and don't sleep well while traveling east to begin with. Bring earplugs if your are a sensitive sleeper like me."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Woolworth Lofts are the best place to stay in Selma! The space is beautiful and stylish and comfortable and artistic. AC is the perfect host. And take the tour she offers to get a sense of local history and architecture.

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Selma visitors - you must stay here! Book your time in Selma at any of the Woolworth Lofts Airbnb offerings. This is a special place, curated with love. The spaces are beautifully decorated, warm, and welcoming. Our bed was comfy, linens were nice, the kitchenette is great, and I’m always grateful for a K-cup in the morning. Parking was easy, right outside the building. If you are lucky you will meet AC, one of the loveliest Airbnb hosts I’ve had the pleasure to meet. I will remember Selma for the warmth and love and hope that we experienced there this weekend. :-)"

The lofts are clean, stylish, well equipped spaces that have character and an unbeatable location. I especially appreciated being able to do laundry. This is what Airbnb should be all about."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! We found this gem while evacuating from Hurricane Michael and I must say the pictures do not do this place justice. AC has put so much thought into every detail and it really shows. It feels like you’re in a Nee York city apartment. The laundry service was fantastic and the decor was to die for. I love the vintage feel with a modern twist AC has created. Would stay again. This is the best Airbnb I have found so far and would recommend it to anyone.

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for friends or extended family to stay in one space, yet each have privacy! Our family used Suites A, B and C and it was amazing! Walkable to everything downtown, including cute shops and history locations. The hosts were always available and very responsive (via messenging through Airbnb) but also allowed us our privacy. We didn't see them at all while staying. HIGHLY RECOMMEND a stay at Woolworth Lofts!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had the most wonderful time staying here. AC is so friendly and responsive, offering a ton of local tips. The space itself is beautifully (and locally) decorated. Will definitely be coming back next time I pass through town."

Every detail is so well thought out for a true respite of comfort when traveling and absorbing so much emotion learning about Selma. Stay at Nancy’s place. You will not regret it!! This 100 year old home is a true rarity and a real home away from home. Though we did not meet Nancy face-to-face, she and I had a couple of lovely phone conversations. She personifies Southern hospitality, even from next door!! PS. The washer and dryer are a handy bonus!!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nancy is a great host and very punctual. We had everything we needed along with a little extra. The beds are so comfortable and she leaves goodies for you at check in. I travel with my children so the extra locks were a plus in knowing that we were safe. The roads in that area are a little bumpy so watch your speed. Also, if you like watching bring you own tv. The stay was great, clean, and very roomy."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Very clean and super convenient to town. Nancy is a wonderful host! Highly recommend.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were in town for the annual tour of historic homes. The Joe-Ann was perfect for us. It is located in the historic district. Parking was available in the back. The apartment was very clean and well furnished. It was also incredibly quiet. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this unit to anyone traveling to Selma.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home! Parking was the only thing I had a slight “inconvenience” with. If you have a bigger vehicle it’s kinda tight back there where they want people to park so you’re right ontop of each other if one care takes up a wide gap. (Which is what happened to me) She worked with me on checkout and having a package delivered day of checkout. She leaves cool snacks and goodies that are locally bought. Very friendly woman. Lovely furniture. Only downside was not many practical cooking I utensils. (Big spoons ans such) and the roads in that area are horrible. Major potholes so beware. Which is out of her control. I don’t blame the host. But if you’re staying in Selma. This Is in the safer nicer side of downtown. Would recommend 100% if you’re staying in this area. Oh and one bedroom has no tv and the other is like 20 inches. So bring your own. But I would def stay here again
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A lovely home on a tree lined road just a short walk from downtown. Excellant value. Homey and comfortable. 5 stars!

I would highly recommend Nancy's Place as a location to reside for Selma visitors."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely spotless. It is an amazing old brownstone type dwelling with so, so much room.

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Well located in Selma's ""Old Town"". Just walking the neighborhood was so nice. Beautiful homes and interesting architecture from the 1800s and early 1900s. I was helped by Nancy and given so much information about Selma. I will return. Take time to visit the Old Live Oak Cemetery. The churches and temple are so beautiful and so many different types of architectural styles are represented. I was amazed by the sophistication of the different styles.
The beds are very comfortable and everything is so nice and clean. Comfortable furniture and fully equipped kitchen. Nice towels and linens. New televisions and good internet connections. This is a great place to use as a base for day trips."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nancy's place was sparkling clean, larger that we had imagined, and with a great location. We especially appreciated how accommodating Nancy was with our late check-in (especially that she left a light on for us)!"

Church, and right on the coffee table we found a great photo book to refresh the events that made Selma famous. The unit is really tasteful and unique, and perfect for 2-4 people. Selma is...well...Selma, but this is perfect base to explore the town."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good downtown location. Appears as if Selma is trying to build up their downtown area and this location is conveniently located to alot of the up and coming small boutiques and stores. The host was very responsive
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,AC's place was the perfect place to stay. Everything was unique and enjoyable. Highly recommend.!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"AC's loft is cute is a button, thoughtfully decorated and curated. I loved how artistic the space was and enjoyed noting all the reinventions and reuse of old furniture and architectural elements in the space. The building itself is beautiful, hardwood floors, high ceilings, stain glassed windows. The beds were very comfortable, and I had everything I needed. On a personal note about AC, the owner. She is such an inspiring human being. Woolworth Lofts not only provides a nice place to spend the night but also celebrates Selma and offers a healing place to explore some of America's traumatic history. AC helped me in ways that were above the call of duty for an owner as well. She was so generous towards my family and I after a traumatic personal event happened while we were staying in the loft. Her support and care during the early times of dealing with things was unbelievable. She is an angel, and she is the person to ask to guide you through the city of Selma. Thanks, AC!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a treat to come back to the Woolworth Lofts.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I had a stay at the Woolworth lofts March 2024. We had a horrific trip there. AC the host was wonderful and so helpful. Our flights were delayed and by the time we arrived in Selma the rentals were all closed. Although we had reservations to pick up. She was kind enough to assist us. She went beyond the call of Host duty. We appreciated her kindness and thoughtfulness. She ensured we were doing well while staying at the lofts. We loved the lofts and the history that came along with them. We will visit again and without a doubt will be staying at the Woolworth Lofts.
Thank you!
Ali (Arizona)"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ac is a wonderful host of a beautiful, historic, spacious and centrally located apartment. Will definitely return when visiting Selma and the local area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay at AC s loft!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient to the tourist areas in Selma. Loft space is a great idea in the old downtown buildings. AC was a great host, provided me a list of tourist services and books about the history of Selma. Her space downstairs also provided lunch while i was there. I will definitely recommend the lofts to all visitors and this will be my spot on future visits."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This apartment is simply adorable! The decorations are perfect and made the apt feel cozy and comfortable. We only stayed for one short night. We didn’t arrive until 9:30 pm but the apt was well-lite and entering was a breeze using the very clear instructions sent from AC. The apt is located downtown, and we had our concerns about safety at first but felt okay once we entered. We left early the next morning so we didn’t get to enjoy the space and views as much as we would have liked to. At any rate, we enjoyed our stay. The one thing that I would like people to know is that this apt is located in a noisy area — or, it happened to be noisy on the night we stayed (a Friday night). There were emergency vehicles (with sirens) and loud vehicles that passed by the apartment numerous times during the night. The noise maker provided didn’t help with these loud sounds but did help with regular street noise. I felt like traffic was beyond the host’s control but wanted others to know about this."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Glad to be back at home and experience the guests’ point of view!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wasn’t able to make this stay but I’m sure it would have been nice. It would have been my second time staying
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came on a school trip on Racial Healing. Ac's work in Selma to bring community together with the 5&Dime downstairs from the loft is inspiring. She was incredibly helpful with suggestions on people to speak with, and different activities in the area."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I had a wonderful time in Selma, where I stayed at the Woolworth Lofts for a week. Suite A was perfect for me, with its spacious layout and natural light.

I highly recommend the Woolworth Lofts to anyone visiting Selma."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful and cozy place to stay, in the heart of historic Selma.
We love the authentic and historic you get inside the whole building. AC did a great job renovating the whole 2nd floor and in my opinion there is no better place to stay in Selma. Just a few minutes away from everything that is worth seeing in this charming city. We'd love to come back someday."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love staying here! It is one of my favorite spots in the country. I do not want to stay anywhere else when I am in Selma. I LOVE that the host LOVES Selma, its history and its people. It makes all the difference!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loooooved staying here! We arrived a little later than expected and it was a bit rainy on arrival day so we weren’t able to explore quite as much as we had planned, but that turned out perfect because Woolworth was absolutely lovely for a movie night in. So comfy & cozy, and being able to have our dog seriously made it feel like our home away from home.
The host went above and beyond in so many ways = offered so much info about the area & even has an app where you can purchase the audio + directions for self guided tours! They also had great custom goats milk soaps!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This experience will be one of the highlights of the trip. The attention to detail and welcome made this experience special and unique. AC welcomed us with warmth and generosity and shared local history beyond the historic sites we visited.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You are not just staying in one of the most beautiful Airbnbs you’ve ever seen, you are staying in a work of art. In addition we took advantage of ACs, walking tours of Selma, in addition to our preplanned visits along the civil rights Trail. Our stay could not have been more perfect. You do have to be able to carry luggage up and down stairs, that was fine. We would highly recommend."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were passing through Selma and wanted to stop for the night. This was in an easy to find location. The loft was really beautiful and thoughtfully decorated. The host had great local recommendations- we ate Lannie’s bbq and read up on local landmarks.
The bed was a bit too squeaky for us, and I didn’t get much sleep because of it. The building is old, so we heard every footstep of anyone else in the building. The sound machine was truly a game changer- it was very much appreciated!
I’d recommend the loft for people who aren’t light sleepers and want to stay in Selma for a few nights."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a wonderful place to stay. We felt very much a part of the local history by being here. AC is very proud of Selma and it shows. I recco taking an early sunrise walk to the river and amongst the old buildings.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay in Woolworth Loft A. It’s far more spacious than the pictures indicate, well-appointed, and quiet (despite being on busy Broad Street). The restoration work that’s been done here is obviously a labor of love. The stained glass windows are lovely, and the skylight above the bed allows you to enjoy the night sky. We really enjoyed out time here and look forward to staying again."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Woolworth Lofts are THE place to stay if you want to explore Selma, AL!! The location is only a few blocks from and on the same street as the famous bridge. The loft was SO comfortable, airy, and filled with natural light and it's decorated so simply and beautifully.
AC knows so many people working to transform Selma into a cultural destination, growing forward from the past, and loves to share what they are doing. It is also a great place from which to visit the community murals by artist Tres Taylor in several small cities close by, including three in Selma.
I would definitely stay there again!!"

How I would love to see more buildings restored to their past glory."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was welcomed with warmth and hospitality throughout my entire 4 night stay in Selma!

Fantastic communication, and a place with a lot of character, with everything I could need and perfect location! I would love to return!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"AC's Woolworth lofts are the best AirBnB we've had the privilege of staying at. You can tell a lot of love went into furnishing this space.

Looking forward to returning very soon!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I cannot recommend AC place enough! I stayed for 4 nights when I was in town for work and I felt right at home. AC herself is absolutely lovely and her tours offer a wealth of local knowledge and history. I've already booked my next stay :)
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked three apartments for our family to stay with us. All the Loft apartments are artistically decorated and very comfortable.

I will definitely stay here again!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is blocks from the Edmund Pettus Bridge and has tons of character and charm. The flats are filled with local art and books about Selma’s past. AC is not only an exceptional host, but appears to be a community champion working to improve and honor the historic downtown Selma area. Definitely something to support!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying in the Woolworth Lofts and returning to this welcoming space in Selma was a treat. The lofts are centrally located, spacious, comfortable, flooded with natural light, and have everything one may need for a short or long-term stay. AC is a wonderful host who goes above and beyond for her guests through genuine hospitality. Her knowledge and passion for Selma and the surrounding region runs deep and her enthusiasm for sharing this special place makes for a special Airbnb experience. There is also a vibrant community and art space beneath the lofts and we had the good fortune of joining an event while there, which drew a wonderful group of people whom we were lucky to meet. You can feel the care and love that went into every aspect of restoring this building and we couldn't recommend staying here enough. Thank you AC and team!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is THE place to stay in Selma. AC welcomed us into her beautiful space and we immediately felt right at home. Her passion for the Queen City is apparent the second that you meet her. We loved seeing Selma through her eyes. The loft was beautiful, comfortable and historic. Stay here! You will not regret it."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This loft is amazing! The historic aspect, high ceilings, skylight, and stained glass windows blew us away. It is worth every penny. AC was so kind, helpful, and communicative! Would definitely stay here again in the future."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"AC was on location upon our arrival...and gave us a personal tour of the property. Centrally located in the heart of the city, there are businesses in ever side, and library across the street.. with a Coffee Shoppe right down the block! We were very comfortable, and were well rested with everything taking place. We were in town for a loved ones funeral...and we were able to rest and have peace and quiet when needed..

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Love these lofts. This was the second time I’ve stayed here. The space was comfortable and roomy. The only reason for a 4 instead of 5 star review was that there was a storm that night and around 4:00am the skylight began leaking and the sound of the dripping kept me up. I was assured this would get fixed and I believe it will. I would definitely stay again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved the location and how it put you right directly into history. I was also grateful to have the opportunity to talk with AC when I checked out and was amazed of all the other history in this area. AC should be a tour guide with the vase knowledge she has of the area. I was glad to show my son a part of history and will make a trip back with other family members. I’ll definitely recommend you to stay at AC place for the full experience and you might get luck and have a heart warming conversation with her, too😁👍🏾."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We visited Selma for hubby's one-week work trip, and hotel rooms wouldn't work because we need a place with a kitchen due to our plant-based dietary habits. We were happy to find the Woolworth lofts on Airbnb, with the kitchen we needed. Keep in mind this building is well over 100 years old, and that's the charm of it! High ceilings, tall arched windows, and decorated tastefully. AC was extremely helpful with our every request. We stayed in Loft ""A"". If you love the glorious sunshine in the morning, Lofts A or B are wonderful choices. Would definitely go back again if the opportunity presents."

AC is a fabulous host and I appreciated her warm hospitality. The fabulous windows in Suite A overlook Broad Street, and the skylight over the bed is neat. This old building was renovated with modern touches while keeping the historic feel. It is clean, comfortable, and unique - I can’t wait to go back!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved it!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed in unit A for first time. AC let me know there's a little more street noise compared to the other units but wasn't too bad. Nice to have a property owner be upfront about everything. Everything was great as usual.

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"AC’s communication and understanding is top notch. Very helpful in anything I asked about. Our stay was great, I just wished there were options for dinning out within walking distance. There’s one nearby, but they are not open on Saturdays, and only for a few hours on Sunday’s. We loved the openness and the ability to enjoy the art work down below.
AC did mention some new boutique hotel was coming to the area, but it will take a year or two. I’d come back to check it out."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"(This is a cross-posted booking for several of Ac’s lofts). This is our second year booking the Woolworth Lofts in Selma for a work event in Greensboro. Everything from the booking process to check-in and our overall stay have always been A+. My personal favorite part (aside from the location) is how inviting the environment of the lofts are— there are numerous pieces of art throughout, many which are for sale, which is such a simple yet thoughtful part. I love being able to take a piece of my experience in Selma home with me! Would definitely recommend to anyone and definitely plan to return again :)"

2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Adorable space! I loved that the Host added a note about preconceived ideas of Selma. Old building charm. Floors are wood and creak on every move. But that’s part of the charm. Friendly host and sweet housekeeping lady.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This loft was right on point as an immaculate stay in the middle of the downtown corridor - full of cleansing natural light and plush amenities for comfort. The towels were fluffy and the space was nice and cozy on a cold winter's night. The view from the front windows is picturesque and the bright lighting over the parking area made things feel safe and secure. Check-in was a breeze and our hosts were very gracious in showing us around and being available as needed for communication about anything. Will definitely stay again on future trips - this is a great find in a great location in this historic city!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was pretty much the best Airbnb and host experience I have ever had.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very clean
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing place to stay! For starters parking was excellent. We had a front row spot right by our door everyday. As you walk up the stairs and into the hallway you’re greeted with beautiful hardwood floors and lovely light fixtures that take you back in time. At this point you can already tell this building was meticulously restored to its original state.
The room itself has a great amount of natural light. Lay down in the bed and look up to take in the most gorgeous skylight you’ve ever seen. That was hands down my favorite feature. And don’t you worry about street traffic waking you up. The room has a sound machine that drowns if all out. A very nice touch, and something you can remove from your packing list.
The living space is open with very large windows that have a touch of stained glass at the top. Peek out the windows to take in views of the pristine Dallas County Library and a pretty little fountain at city hall. At this point you’ll be torn between hanging out inside the loft or hitting the streets of Selma to meet some of the nicest people around!
Everything in the loft is clean, freshly painted, and uniquely decorated. You can’t get this level of comfort and style at a hotel! Come visit!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great space for a great price. Great location. Friendly host who communicates well to make sure all needs are met. Enjoyed our stay and would definitely return if in area.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loft A is much more than the pictures show. This is an amazing space to stay in while in Selma. The Loft is located right in the heart of downtown Selma with easy access to adorable boutiques, restaurants, and of course the infamous Edmund Perry’s Bridge.
It is beautifully decorated with a light and airy feel. The tall ceilings make the space feel much larger than it is. There is an incredible surprise when you lay on the bed and look up…I will keep it a surprise. This is a must stay if going to Selma.
AC is an amazing host!!! She was there every time I had to contact her. I even lost the keys….and she was so accommodating and kind…..while I interrupted her vacation.
I can not say enough about my experience here. I will definitely be returning to Selma, and I hope Loft A is available for me yo stay in again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Woolworth Lofts are a must when staying in Selma! Everything about my stay was absolutely exceptional! The lofts are clean, cozy and inviting!

The location is great. I highly recommend stopping by the Selma Welcome Center to chat with Jeffrey and Gary, or stopping by the awesome bookstore owned by David (both located just a few minute walk from the loft). AC has created a sanctuary in the Woolworth Lofts and I can’t wait to return."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful, comfortable and clean place. Heads up, if you arrive after 4 p.m. on a Sunday there are very few places open to eat. Otherwise it’s great!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Lofts A and B for a long wedding weekend in Selma. Only blocks from the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the Woolworth Lofts were right in the center of town and close to all of our weekend events. The lofts were clean, well lit (fabulous windows), had comfortable furniture (including the beds) and Loft B had the perfect kitchen table for family card games and late-night snacks. AC (owner) responded immediately to questions by text, and it was fun to run into her around town. AC's check-in/out instructions were clear and concise, and again, her phone number is everywhere if you have a question. Enjoy your stay!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A.C. Reeves is the perfect host. She's done a beautiful job of renovating and repurposing the old Woolworth's store in downtown Selma. The lofts are decorated beautifully. Highly recommended to anyone staying in Selma.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From asking questions, to check in, to it be exactly how it looked in pictures & perfectly spotless…. It was the best place I’ve ever stayed in that area!

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was absolutely perfect. Quiet and near everything I came to Selma to see. I will definitely stay again in the future.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,AC is an outstanding host and cares a ton for her guests as well as her surrounding community. She’s so connected to Selma and you can tell by the way she speaks about it that she truly cares and that her Airbnb’s are way more than a business. Additionally the place was so clean and just a beautiful place. Check in and out are extremely simple and upfront. She was very accommodating for anything we needed and was always a text away.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stay tonight in the middle of history. This space is right up the street from the Edmund Pettus Bridge where incredible history shaped the world. The space is clean, well-designed, and I can’t forget the natural light. Easy parking, check-in and out, and a fantastic location with a great coffee shop up the street make this my top choice should I return to Selma."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,AC has created an enchanting escape for those of us who want to escape the real world every once in a while. Highly recommend if you're looking for some whimsy and some magic!!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ac’s Woolworth loft is gorgeous! The space is comfy and livable but the draw for me were the artistic touches that make the apartment beautiful and like few others I’ve stayed on. I highly recommend and hope to stay here again on my next visit to Selma.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,*this review is cross posted because we stayed in multiple spaces managed by AC over the course of a weekend** We rented a handful of the lofts for Alabama Audubon’s Black Belt Birding Festival in Greensboro! It was a great experience staying at the lofts. AC was an excellent host and was so thorough with providing check in/out information. Such a wonderful experience in a beautiful town.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Talk about ""Community"", well I was actually referred to Taylor's prestigious listing by another ABNB owner LaQueena. A last minute emergency arose with my booking with LaQueena. She communicated with me every step of the way. I literally drove through a rain and hail storm getting to my destination from Texas to Alabama. LaQueena and Taylor worked together like true professional business owners who value their customers.
It didn't take long for them to collaborate and connect so that my family's lodging was secured. Initially my stress levels were high, but after receiving immediate responses from Taylor (Love this host) and LaQueena, my stress simply melted away because I knew things were going to be ok.
There are hundreds of ABNB business owners out there, but what separates the elite from the rest is how they respond when things go wrong. These two hosts are among the elite, and Queens Palace was the icing on the cake, as my family LOVED this place!
Thank you to my two angels!!"

2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This is a nice place but if I would’ve read the details before booking, I would’ve never book this room. I thought the patio was private and shared with another apartment. NO NO NO! It was NO STOVE and you really have No privacy. I brought my husband to see his family that he haven’t saw in a decade and was going to cook them a nice meal but that didn’t happen. IMMEDIATELY pulling into this driveway WE FELT WE WERE BEING WATCH! It’s definitely not worth the price that we paid IT WAS THE NO STOVE FOR ME! PLEASE MAKE SURE TO READ THEIR RULES AND POLICY FIRST!!! The place is very CLEAN AND NEAT."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a place to attend my oldest brother's wedding and Taylor's place is just as described and shown. Very clean, smells nice, and comfortable... Side note, I'm am particular about certain things when staying or eating at places outside of home- especially now due to Covid. I'd contacted 2 places with questions about their spaces and got late responses. Being new to Airbnb, I was worried about my timing, how things work, and climbing stairs, etc. Taylor promptly responded and gave clear instructions for everything needed before and after booking to where there was no need for a thing for my entire stay! And no worries as Taylor's steps are well padded and not steep which takes a lot of strain off the body. I found my little brother booked one of the places I contacted (reason for the late response), yet Taylor's place was nice, so comfy, cozy and clean that my little brother and sister-in-law with my 10-month old niece preferred hanging out there during our downtime instead of their Airbnb😁. My brother's place was uncomparable and we'd not hesitate to book with Taylor if ever in Selma again!😎"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The accommodations were great. The location is rural and not much to offer. Really no nice restaurants. A little pricey for no pool or gym.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Taylor’s place was lovely. Exactly as described the studio was enormous with a ton of space to spread out. I worked remotely while I was there and the Wi-Fi was great. . Was nice to have the desk for my laptop and the big couch to stretch out on and watch TV. It was a quiet and restful retreat. The area was well lit and felt very safe. Taylor has all the details down pat. Keypads for easy self check in, signage for important things and she even left a few drinks and snacks. I’ll definitely stay again."

2023-10-01,2.0,Group trip,"Place has Potential if $invested & creative designs. We only stayed 1 of 2 nights-tried to find another location first day but couldn't. We all were HIGHLY disappointed/Place had foul, stinking smell especially upstairs. My dad almost fell per bathroom downstair entry door is too narrow & don't meet code. Stairway don't meet code either & in desperate need of painting. Upstair Bedroom ceilings coming apart w/large old water stains. One with open ceiling vent. Sisters couldn't sleep per felt a critter would come through vent. Spider webs on ceilings/walls/light fixtures. Saw a roach as well. Upstairs' bath inside top cabinetry look awful. No bathcloths instead bathRAGS. A bath rag had huge stain. I couldn't use it. Very little used liquid soap & dish detergent/with Perhaps 1 or 2 ounces each. No one could get sleep to include me.

2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was very hot upstairs due to a/c was not working. Downstairs was comfortable after dark. But couldn’t sleep upstairs (79-80degrees) till midnight, then cooled off. Also the front door looked like it had been kicked in and wouldn’t shut without dead bolting it. Wouldn’t recommend if you are there for construction work for sure, not fun coming from a hot day outside to a hot room at night."

We chose Denise's home which is a 1901 historic house.
The house was super clean and is very livable with three comfortable bedrooms.
Yes the house is old and it has not been refursbished to modern standards but if you look for an authentic experience in a neighbor riched of history then this is the place.
Thanks Denis for your support in local communities. We'll be back!"

The home itself is in an historic neighborhood and has the nuances of an older home but the amenities provided made the stay comfortable .
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Pretty amazing house that was built in 1890. Cool civil rights pictures. I assume it was clean (& had no issues), but a paint job would make it appear more clean. The bathroom sink upstairs didn't work, so that was inconvenient. I was surprised at how dilapidated the town of Selma is, although part of the damage is due to a tornado in 1/2023. Despite this, I was grateful to stay in this historic house in such a historic town. If only the walls could speak!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house is incredibly spacious and a good value. We were in the area for a funeral and booked on short notice. Denise had the house clean and warmed up for us during a stretch of cold weather. Denise is very responsive and reasonable about house rules.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was too short. We only stayed overnight and had to leave early in the morning.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay in this large historic home, and so did our little dog. There are many architectural details in the home to admire. Having owned an old Victorian home ourselves, we know that it “is not perfect” as the listing states, but we felt that this place was perfect in its imperfection; if you love old houses and can understand that, this is a great place to have a relaxing stay. The super comfortable bed in the downstairs bedroom gave us restorative sleep and its attached full bathroom was cute and cozy. The fully equipped kitchen helped us feel completely at home as we prepared meals, and the living room and outdoor seating areas (especially the front porch!) were great places to relax and soak up the charm of the area. The home is located near the historic sites in Selma and is a great base for exploring. Denise and her husband are great communicators and super helpful. We are so glad we stayed at their sweet old place."
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,house was nice being an older home. there were only 2 small hand towels left out for 5 guests being there and coffee pot had old coffee and coffee grounds left in it .not sure if a professional cleaning service comes if so they were not doing their services properly overall price could be less due to lack of towels toilet paper and cleanliness. host communication was timely so it may be due to the cleaning service they use . would stay again if a little cheaper

2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The house was gorgeous, but we had to sleep on the couch downstairs because the air conditioner didn't work well upstairs, it was above 85 all night, I assume it's just because it's an old house. it was great getting to see a home that was built so long ago, enjoyed that!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Denise's place was perfect for what I needed. They had plenty room and the home was an incredible place with historical charm. There were beautiful hardwood floors and felt like a step back in time (without sacrificing convenience). I'd recommend it to anyone. Also allowed me to keep my well trained dogs and everyone was happy.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I enjoyed this property so much. We made memories and just relaxed and had fun. Denise and Dr. T are welcoming, attentive, and caring hosts. I will recommend this place over and over again. Thank y’all!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home and gracious hosts. This was comfortable for our one-night stay during a cross-country drive, we appreciated the time to enjoy the comforts of home. I loved the convenience of the fenced yard, we could relax and our dogs could enjoy themselves!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cool old house in the historic district of Selma. You can feel the love that went into it. Easy to get to the Edmund Pettis bridge (with the terrific Coffee Shoppe nearby). Be sure to take a day trip to Gee’s Bend. And it is very pet friendly!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Denise and her husband are the best example of southern hospitality! My pups and babies loved the yard. The claw foot tub made me feel like a princess! On top of that, communication is the best I’ve experienced! Highly recommend!"

2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful old house and we loved staying here. The rooms are large and airy with nice areas to relax; we did not have occasion to cook on this visit, but the kitchen is well appointed and would be fine to prepare meals to enjoy in the dining room; bed was very comfortable and we slept well; I loved soaking in the clawfoot tub upstairs!
This is a work in progress and, with some devoted restoration work, I am sure will be a showplace. There was a plumbing issue downstairs which I am certain is being remedied now. I love the peacock accents around the house, the unusual clock upstairs, the interesting faceplates on some of the electrical sockets, the brick patio, and the front-porch swing.
We are thinking about a return visit in the fall and would enjoy staying here again. Denise and Terrence are very good hosts."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place is a diamond in the rough for sure! The house is huge, and beautiful, With crazy tall ceilings that made me feel like I was in a palace. This was also the first Airbnb I've had that had its own ADT alarm system that we could arm at nights and when we left which made us feel safe and sound. The private back porch area was our own little oasis. The owners Denise and TV are the sweetest, most accommodating people ever! Would definitely recommend this place for any Selma bound travelers."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space feels just like home. Everything was just right for our family and the hosts were very accommodating - always available.

We were able to cozy up and enjoy the treats she so kindly left for us, and were pleasantly surprised to find such a great place at the very last minute. I found the cleaning fee to be a bit high, but the space was very clean and welcoming. The upstairs was closed for renovations but when it reopens I'm sure this place would be perfect for family reunions, weekend getaways with a group, and beyond. Thank you Denise!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was very friendly and provided great communication. I fell in love the moment I walked in. The house is clean, spacious and very reasonable for all of the amenities that are included. It located in a beautiful historical quiet neighborhood.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Host was everything you would imagine when you think of a Southern Lady with Class, Hospitality and a Deep Southern Accent, LOL. My experience at the Peacock Pride Historical home was the most peaceful, relaxing and amazing experience of my many travels. It was located within 5 minutes of all of the Historical Sites in the Middle of Several Historical Mansions. It exceeded the value because of the memory. I recommend this peaceful experience to everyone. Sincerely Dr T.V.W."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying at Taylor's Airbnb. My stay was just as amazing as the first time. Taylor's place was well decorated with a home away from home feel. The place was clean, the bed was comfortable, a nice area was located outside for you if you wanted fresh air. Taylor's place is well worth the price. I will choose to stay over a pricy hotel. The area is very peaceful and quiet. There is a local grocery store, gas stations, and restaurants not far at all if you need anything. Taylor's is an amazing Host. Any questions you may have she promptly responds. Taylor provides you with recommendations of places to visit along with any valuable information you may need for your time at her place. There are also amenities in case you leave something behind.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Instructions for checking in were very detailed and the process was easy. The location was central to everywhere I needed/wanted to go. It's out in the country, but so is everything down there. It's set in a little grouping of guest houses so you won't feel isolated but you definitely have your privacy. A lot of thought was put into this cute little place to make it welcoming and comfortable. I especially loved the little outdoor area that's screen tented against the bugs, equipped with a fan, and with Alexa to play your favorite music. What a lovely way to end or start the super hot days. Like sittin' on the front porch. I'll definitely look to stay again."

It was perfect for sharing meals with a large kitchen and dining table, and the sitting room was cozy with quiet mornings with a coffee, newspaper, sunshine and birdsong. The bedrooms were comfortable and we had great sleep. The neighborhood is quiet and neighborly and easy to access. Angela, the host, was friendly, helpful, checked if we needed anything, and fast in responding, and when we had sudden car trouble she came through quickly with helping us extend our stay and offering local suggestions to help us. Thank you for a wonderful stay."

We would definitely recommend this house!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wow! This is a beautiful spot in a historic area. Couldn’t have been more perfect. We only wished we had more time to spend at Angela’s place. All the bedrooms were equally comfortable. We had to check in pretty late and Angela made extra effort to ensure it was easy for us. The neighborhood is gorgeous. A sweet respite during our civil rights history trip to the area. Highly recommend.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Angela hosted us for one evening as we traveled through with our dogs. Her cottage was perfect as we each had our own private bedroom. Her outdoor area is beautiful, their are squirrels if your dogs go crazy, and she's adding some herb gardens in the outdoor space."

Your communication on directions, access, and wifi was impeccable. This was a very clean and spacious AirBnB equipped with everything we needed especially since we got in late. The snacks was much needed since everything was closed. NOW THAT'S HOW YOU HOST!!!😊 You are definitely a great host and the information on local things to do was a great addition. We had a great time at this Airbnb. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. Even better in person. (Please check it out) The neighborhood is very conveniently located downtown and safe. Would absolutely recommend anyone to stay there!
We still couldn't get over how nice the place is decorated and the (3) bedrooms was super bargain for 2 people vs a hotel stay. The variety of coffee and teas was an absolute joy especially winding down in the evening.
We even had time to put some steaks on the grill.
Please stop and stay here! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!👍👍👍"

I thought I would not be checking in until the next morning, because of a canceled flight but I was able to make a stand by flight, and arrived at my schedule time, well, he never gave me the code to get in (I should have gotten it 24 hours before check in) so sat outside in the heat for an hour trying to get a code, to find out the place had not been cleaned cause he let the quest before me stay later and waited to clean up, had to clean ourselves in order to sleep that night, He did come the next day and clean and it looked great, however I requested at last a half of a day to be refund, because of what happened only refunded $25"

2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great home in selma alabams historic distric
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Quinton was very personable, and welcoming. Once I arrived at the property Quinton met me there to walk me through the property, and answer any questions I may have. The house was clean, and very spacious. I will definitely stay at this property again when I am in the area."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A nice older home, with some renovations. My kids enjoyed the piano, and that there was a TV in each bedroom. It was nice for our family of five to be able to spread out. Quinton met us upon arrival, and was a very gracious host."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is an amazing place to rest. In the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, my family evacuated to this home. Even my 93 year old grandmother was able to be comfortable.
This home is large, plenty of amenities, access to the city of Selma is great. Neighborhood is safe and we loved being here. It took the sting of being displaced away a bit.
Quinton was attentive and very kind to us. He ensured the home was clean and even allowed us to get in a bit earlier because he had no where to go.
This was a really great experience."

2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay as comfortable as your own home
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"I am a native of Selma and returned home to visit family. Not enough room at my childhood house for my family so we opted for AirBnB. The tech house was great! It is located in a quiet, safe neighbourhood, which was good considering Selma's overall decline and increased crime since I moved away in the late 80s.
All the rooms had very comfortable beds, the bathrooms were well-stocked, as was the kitchen. Quinton gave us a pre-visit call as we were en route to the house, and talked us through some housekeeping issues, which was very helpful.
I would highly recommend the ""tech house"" for anyone visiting Selma with a large family."

2020-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"First I must say that this house is absolutely beautiful! The host was on the spot with his communications and welcomed us with complimentary snacks, drinks etc. The house is in a great location where you can get to the main streets that have all of the conveniences within minutes. We did however have some things that happened that inconvenienced our stay such as a late check-in and a couple of other things that I would not mention here because I feel they may have been beyond the hosts control Along with the late check-in. Upon reading all the reviews before our stay, I feel like we just got all the bad luck. However, we plan to frequent this area in the near future and will keep this house on our list as one of our favorites. I am confident that this visit was just a fluke."

Beds comfortable, loved how owner kept as much of the old charm of home when he renovated it. Although seemed to be a good area, security cameras/system made us feel more at ease during our stay.

Quinton was an incredibly hospitable host — he came to greet us in person, was flexible when we were arriving late and was available to answer our call and share how to check in and answer questions we had. The house has lots of thoughtful touches that went above and beyond our expectations — a security system, cold drinks in the fridge and snacks in the cupboard. Very clean with plentiful towels.

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host's write-up for this home is accurate, and the home is roomy and clean. Quinton was a wonderful host!
The A/C worked great, there are TV's in each bedroom with streaming services already hooked up, ceiling fans throughout, and the kitchen is very well appointed. Two bedrooms (queens) on first floor, and two (queen, single) on the 2nd floor. Quinton provides some drinks and snacks, which is very convenient, and all the usual amenties were there as well. The beds were comfortable, as were the rest of the furnishings. The new hot water heater provided the best pressure/volume to the bathub/shower in the hall bathroom, but it was also acceptable in the others 2 showers. Towels and bedding were fresh and soft.
Easy to find and you park in the off-street driveway. Close to anything you will want to do locally. You will not go wrong if you stay in Quinton's offering here! I brought 2 people who had never done AirBnB before, and they are now sold on the concept."

We had a very enjoyable stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Toia’s place was just as described. We were needing a place to stay at the last minute. Toia was very responsive and kind to allow us to book so late at night.

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for direct access to Selma. Quiet, well-kept neighborhood of apartment duplexes.
Inside, the air felt nice, cool, and fresh with solid AC.
Enjoyed maps and rustic feel, and appreciated the rustic headboard lamps in the master suite for evening reading.
The 2 bed/2 BR each, which had a classic and simple design.
Mattress and bed/BR linen choice was most disappointing.
While it beat the alternative of sleeping in a tent for the entirety of the [wet] weekend, the full-sized, stiff boxspring wasn't comfortable--especially if sharing a bed. Felt like sleeping on very* cheap linen and pillows, but was clean.
Same with the white towels and rags in the BRs, but unfortunately very cheap rags/towels do not handle wear well from previous use, though presumed clean, of course. Quality in these regards goes a long way.
Freezer handle wasn't secure and was like halfway popped off, but was clean and cold nonetheless.
For the location and price, it really was a solid BnB!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful and clean place. I highly recommend to anyone traveling to the area to book here.

We have stayed at many Airbnbs and this was the most interactive stay we have had with a host. We traveled with a toddler and she did all she could to make our/his stay much better.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay in Selma. We listened to one of the host's walking tour guides (while driving) that gave us a great taste of the city and introduced us to the artists who had work displayed in the airbnb. The historic building, colorful windows, and eclectic decor made for a wonderful stay! No details were missed - even the coffee table books shared about Selma and the Black Belt. The small bedroom with twin beds was one of our favorite parts."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was one of the best Airbnb experiences we've ever had. The apartment is beautiful with high ceilings and incredible sunlight. No lamps are needed until sundown! The building was really cool, as a rehabilitated building. There were toys and chalk for our kid to play with and Ac was incredibly generous and accommodating as we tried to navigate our arrival around our 2 year old's nap time. There is no better place to stay in Selma, and it's just a couple of blocks from historic Edmund Pettus Bridge. Coming home at the end of each day was like coming back to a retreat. We'll DEFINITELY come back to Selma and stay at this Airbnb again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Woolworth Lofts are simply fantastic! Feels like you are in your own place. AC does an incredible job. Couldn't be cleaner, and just really cool - like being able to buy the artwork off of the walls. I would recommend coming to Selma just to stay in the Lofts!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely stunning loft in historic building FULL of charm & art & info on local attractions. The light in the loft is amazing. The furnishings so comfortable and thoughtfully curated. Every second there was heaven! I will absolutely return and give it my highest rating. If you go, make the 20 minute trip to Old Cahawba, rent bikes and cruise around the old ghost town. So fun!!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was awesome. Very comfortable apartment and cozy beds. We slept like a log. The location is very close (within a few blocks) to many historic sites in Selma. Check-in was easy and straightforward. We loved the design of the place, and the books on the coffee table were so good. AC pays attention to the small details that make a superb airbnb experience."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The location was perfect for our family. We loved that it was a dog-friendly place who we brought on our roadtrip. It was convenient to the places we wanted to see. And beyond a resting place, the loft was beautiful. Stained glass windows and from floor to ceiling! So much light. We loved it!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love old converted buildings, so the Woolworth Lofts was the perfect spot for me. it is easy to find, easily accessible, and a wonderfully rich and diverse selection of artwork and reading material make it a pleasure to hang out in! 10/10 will book again!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This historic loft (Joan Baez stayed here when she came to the March on Selma) is beautifully restored and looks out over downtown Selma. High-reaching ceilings, beautiful stained-glass windows, great art, magnificent light and very comfortable. Easy to get anywhere in town. You are right downtown, so street and occasional train noise nearby was present, but Ac provides bedside ""noise"" machines to help soothe any of that away and it was not a problem for us. Ac was very communicative, helpful and provided all sorts of suggestions for tours (she has her own self-guided tour that she makes available in addition to lots of eating, shopping and other tour guide suggestions), and she encourages guests to try to look at Selma in a different light than what people think of when they think of Selma, Alabama. It was a great stay. There are stairs to climb, FYI, so pack/prepare accordingly (it's an old, historic building!)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Woolworth Lofts is within walking distance of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. The Lofts provided place of refreshment while sorting through the emotions of some hard history. Our host was communicative, provides resources, enjoys talking about the city and has a heart for peace."

We love AC and the Woolworth Lofts"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ac is an AMAZING host! She was super helpful for first-timers like us - gave us lots of perspective and background and recommendations to enhance our visit. Selma has so much history - I hope more people will come to see some of the most important landmarks of the Civil Rights Movement. When you're in Selma, staying with Ac means you have a friend in town. It's quite obvious that she really cares about her guests - it was a terrific stay."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved everything about our stay in Selma! AC is a wonderful host and the Woolworth Lofts are amazing. Truly a resort and beautifully decorated. We were in loft B and it was spotless, with luxury bedding, very comfortable living area and beautiful windows overlooking the downtown area. The Coffee Shop across the street was great and super friendly. We were enjoying the loft so much we picked up takeout (at Lannie's bbq) and stayed in! We were able to peak in a few of the other rooms, and we would be happy in any one of them. Sure hope to come back! Thank you AC for creating such a wonderful place to stay!"

I returned back with family for a girl’s weekend trip and they fell in love with it as I did. The access to Selma and it’s gems on foot, and the feeling of being home does it for me every time. I can’t imagine being in Selma and laying my head anywhere else."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay with AC is always a pleasure. I like the messages she leaves on the kitchen table. She stopped to speak and to see how we were doing and if we needed anything. if you are ever in Selma definitely check her out.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is so stunning that we stayed an extra night. We’ve stayed in many beautiful and unique airbnbs all over Canada, the USA, Mexico and Cuba and this is our favourite so far. It’s a piece of artwork! It’s in a historical location with lots of neat things to walk to nearby. It’s a huge space, it’s clean and bright with pops of colour from the art work and decor. It has everything you need for cooking. It’s a gem!!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing loft space in the heart of historic downtown Selma that has been renovated with class. My suite was clean, cool (in August) and we felt safe in the neighborhood. Check-in / check out was all automated and easy. Most importantly, the loft was very reasonably priced.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay !
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"amazing location, wonderful host, great amenities and communication"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to submerge yourself in the history and culture of the South, you’re at the epicenter when staying at the Woolworth Lofts in Selma. AC, who owns and operates this small collection of units renovated from the old Woolworth Building, has added her loving touch – creating a cozy hideaway (mine was Suite B) tucked off the main street that is both a traveler's refuge and itself a space that speaks to the historical importance of Selma and contemporary elements of its location along the Alabama River. In fact, you'll enjoy all the creature comforts of an upscale Airbnb – but with plenty of room and amenities of a spacious apartment you'll wish you owned! There's no better guide than AC to point you in the direction of significant landmarks, and to introduce you to local characters that literally bridge the past of the Edmund Pettis Bridge to the present, as Selma continues struggling to shape its identity in the modern world. Don't miss out on the next door ""5 and Dime"" (of course) art gallery – an expansive space that rotates a variety of award-winning artists on a monthly basis. Art from the heart, I came to think of it: local artists, including several important figures, who represent the fiber of the region, creating art that lets through creases of light through their mostly three-dimensional work. Character, cleanliness and culture -- my 3 Cs (+ AC!) when traveling, and the cornerstones of an amazing experience you'll enjoy when you make the Woolworth Loft your home in Selma for a brief visit (mine was three very full days) or a long-term stay. Highly recommended."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As always our stay was inviting and pleasant. If you are visiting Selma stay at Woolworth Lofts you can't go wrong!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Ac has created such a special, artistic, and unique place to stay while in Selma, and my friend and I enjoyed staying in Suite B. The stylish furnishings in the beautiful space made for a comfortable respite. The bathroom was roomy and was nice as a shared space, and the master bedroom was peaceful and cozy, and the second bedroom (with two twins) was also comfortable. Note, the photos for this suite don't really reveal all this space has to offer -- the main suite was large and gorgeous; the second bedroom was small, but plenty comfortable with two twins. The location was perfect for walking through town, and parking was free and plentiful when we were there. Would definitely stay at the Woolworth Lofts again when visiting Selma. Thank you, Ac!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this place is perfect!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Woolworth Lofts is a treasure. The space is filled with natural sun light and art - the antidote for most of life's ails.
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Everything was wonderful, loved the arbnb would stay again"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best hosts ever. AC is full of hospitality, and her love for her community shows in everything she does. In fact, I’ve already changed my upcoming anniversary trip from another city to Selma because I just can’t wait to go back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super clean, bright and perfect. Stay here!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A spotless, comfortable and very cool unit in the heart of downtown Selma. Booking and communication was a breeze, I highly recommend the lofts."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay in Selma at the Woolworth apartment. The apartment was beautifully decorated, clean and very functional. We also enjoyed the curated coffee table of books that shared the history of Selma Alabama, as well as the self guided walking tour app created by our host AC. We are so happy we discovered this lovely spot while traveling through Alabama."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Woolworth Lofts is a lovely place to stay in Selma. Wonderful hospitality touches and if you appreciate art and historic preservation, you will be very happy with AC's home away from home."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at almost all of the Woolworth Lofts, never disappoints, best value, and amenities in Selma"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and clean as always ! My favorite Airbnb host! ☺️
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"AC’s loft was spacious enough for the three of us, and had everything you’d need for an overnight stay. It was very clean, and there were plenty of linens available. We were in town for a two day basketball tournament and with having only one uniform, the washer and dryer came in handy.
AC mentions the noise machine to cancel out the sound of the train whistle. But even the sound machine couldn’t cancel out the street noise. This is totally out of AC’s control, and the only reason I mention it is so future visitors can bring ear plugs. Unfortunately folks treat Broad Street like their own personal Talladega."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a place to stay that feels like home, this is it! My daughter and I walked in and we both said “ WOW!” This place is beyond beautiful, comfortable and clean. Ac, thank you so much for everything and we will definitely be back!"

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"You expect Ac to keep in touch, communicate instructions well, make checking in very easy, etc. You can also expect Ac to make sure you rest well...she is very aware of what it takes to rest in that location."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The space is lovely and homey. AC welcomed us like part of the family and gave great suggestions. We would go back in a heartbeat.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I had the best time! We loved the look and atmosphere at the loft. I am a vintage lover, so I was in love from first sight. We were sad when it was time to check out. I will defiantly come back!

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Woolworth lofts in Selma is sanctuary.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Honest so amazing, best sleep i had in AWHILE. the bed is so comfy, I didn’t wanna get up. It feels so at home in the stay. Me and my partner was coming through, and needed somewhere affordable and a nice rest stop. it’s in a adorable area as well. i would say the best part of our stay was the host, she was so very kind and helpful during our stay, her communication was great. if we ever come through Alabama again, we would definitely stop by again and stay longer!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"You’ll love the Woolworth lofts, very spacious, every need met and beautiful artwork adorns every wall. Very close the the newly refurbished downtown Selma area….the river views are stunning with tons of boutiques to catch your fancy. The daily rate won’t stay this low so go now!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,👍🏾
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Suite B is where you want to spend your time in Selma. Natural sunlight floods the space with happiness and warmth from the huge windows that are capped off with stained glass. The loft will become your personal art gallery as you enjoy work from local artists on every wall. But please don't stop there. Look around at the trim and the furnishings. I'm convinced the twin beds were constructed from wood reclaimed from the space. Add to that a bathtub made for soaking and relaxing. I also encourage you to partake in the book selection. My kids and I enjoyed reading from the selection of local books. And as a mom let me add that the small touches like white noise makers and blinds in the windows and a fridge and freezer and natural soap products and the washer and dryers available down the hall and having a private locked space made my stay safe and relaxing. Please make the Woolworth Lofts a part of your stay and take the opportunity to become a part of this community, looking for the unexpected finds like sun print artwork on fences and paintings under the bridge supports. 😍"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This loft is a southern charm with an organic bohemian feel. We loved it and it’s so spacious. Ac is a great host and went the extra mile. We will return again!!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It always feels like a retreat staying at the Woolworth lofts. Comfortable beds, beautiful furnishings, thoughtfully decorated, historic charm, real art! Each suite has a unique personality all its own; authentic, historic space while clean and modern-feel with lofted ceilings. Great value-- would cost 3x as much in a different city! Always looking forward to my next stay at the Woolworth Lofts!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic space, wonderful host! Five star experience!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute loft with great art work!
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at the loft! The loft has a great vibe and is very comfortable and cozy. It had everything we needed for an overnight stay. As mentioned in previous reviews, the street noise is loud. We stayed on a Saturday night and had a good sleep thanks to the white noise machines in the room. We would definitely stay again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Woolworth Lofts is a fun and funky space conveniently located to explore downtown Selma. It hits all the hospitality marks ~ very clean and well-stocked with everything you need. AC (the host) is warm and generous and excels in communication. This was my second stay at the Lofts (Suite A the first time, then Suite B). Both are comfortable, open art-filled spaces with interesting street views and amazing light. The only negative is that the street noise is very loud, especially at night. The white noise machines in every bedroom help cancel out the noise. I’m looking forward to future stays at the Lofts."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean convenient place to stay if your in the area! Host communicates well! Second time booking will book again
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suite B is a private apartment with full kitchen on the second floor of an old building on Broad Street. It’s close to the Edmund Pettus bridge. There is ample parking in front or the side. It’s easier to back out if you’re parked on the side.
There is a flight of stairs to ascend to the second floor. The old building has creaky - but solid - wooden floors that I enjoyed listening to. Suite B is on the corner so you have expansive views on two sides. I love being able to see outside. The blinds close for privacy when you want.
The place is remodeled and in great shape. The plumbing fixtures are first class! The internet service is fast, 100mb plus. There are many nice touches, the host did a great job.
I will caution future guests about the street noise. Broad Street is a major highway with frequent vehicle traffic. The host provides sound machines in each bedroom that help, but do not eliminate the street noise. Small price to pay for a wonderful location, but worth being prepared for. I travel with a 20” box fan; placed beside the bed I slept all night without issues.
Recommended. I will look for availability here the next time I’m in Selma."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I liked the B Suite so much that I came back with friends. Again the accommodations and the super host, A.C. did not disappoint. The beds are so comfortable that it was hard to get up and get going. The Woolworths Lofts is a point of destination for any lovers of history and art. The deep dive into Selma's history through A.C.'s custom tour was amazing."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love staying at AC”s whenever I visit Selma. You can’t go wrong staying here. My favorite is the Cadillac Loft. Pictures are far from what it really looks like. If you stay in any of AC”S lofts you can’t go wrong.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"such a wonderful space beautifully furnished and decorated, bed is extremely comfortable too. my dog and I were very happy here and learned a lot about Selma from ACs wonderful book collection. Can't wait to return"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Check-in was smooth clean. Great location. Great stay I will be booking again!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The most relaxing stay! This historic loft has everything you need. Perfect in every way!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"AC's place at Woolworth Lofts was one of the best airbnb experiences i've had! The units are in the center of historic Selma, and you can't help but root for a revival of the beautiful city. We spent a few days working from unit B, and loved the high ceilings, antique furniture, and amazing light that came through the windows in each room. The wifi was fantastic for two of us working with video calls and whatnot.
There's been so much great work to the building, and it has a ton of charm. Note that there are three beds in the place - a queen, two twin daybeds, and a pullout from the couch. AC was a great host, and was an awesome person to discuss life and its complexities with. I would also extend the recommendation to stay here if you're also looking at getting an airbnb in Montgomery or Birmingham, as there's so much more charm in Selma in my opinion."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous space and wonderfully warm and welcoming hostess. Highly recommend!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an outstanding lodging option for anyone who is visiting Selma or the surrounding area. Suite B is spacious with plenty of space for a family. The kitchen has all the essentials to cook at home, with a large table where everyone can gather together. Tastefully decorated, the owner has highlighted local artists and Selma's history. The Lofts are a quick walk from a coffee shop, the National Parks office, and the Edmund Pettus Bridge. We are looking forward to our next stay at the Woolworth Lofts!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,AC was a great host and the place was terrific. Highly recommended if you're staying in Selma.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re in Selma, this is THE place to stay! I stayed here as I was evacuating from Hurricane Ida & had no idea where I was even going. Ac is the best host I’ve had on Airbnb & I travel frequently. The space is cozy, clean, & decorated beautifully. Ac even has art for sale on the walls! I learned so much about Selma by all of the books on the coffee table.
Thanks again, Ac!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything you need and more is waiting for you at the Woolworth Lofts. Questions are answered promptly. Highly recommend you visit Selma and stay at The Woolworth lofts.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exceedingly comfortable, exceptionally clean and convenient Airbnb. One block from the Edmund Pettus Bridge, one block from the good coffee shop, tucked inside the Historic District with abundant parking - it really couldn't be any better. Owned and staffed by great people helping to build the future of Selma. We absolutely loved it and can't wait to return."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is really beautiful and has a lot of space to hang out, which is what we needed. We used the kitchen and kitchen table quite a bit and it was nice to hang in the living room.
It’s also really convenient to many historical sites. The beds were comfortable and the shower is roomy.
AC is easy to communicate with and open to suggestions, and I mentioned that the bathroom needs hooks and places to put your toiletries, and I’m sure she’ll work to make that happen."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a blessing in disguise that our airbnb reservation was cancelled on us at the last minute, and in a mad hunt for a place to stay, ran across Ac's place.
As a former member of a historical society and a real estate developer, this place made me giddy in its redevelopment. Ac did it RIGHT!
Utilizing the existing bones, the unit is well designed to maximize the high ceilings, oozes charm, full of local details and art that you wanna buy for your own house, plus high on the list, super CLEAN, modernized and made me wish we had a few more days to stay and explore Selma.
If you need a place to sleep in Alabama, this is it!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best spot in town!!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best place in Selma!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We rented a handful of the lofts for Alabama Audubon’s Black Belt Birding Festival in Greensboro! It was a great experience staying at the lofts. AC was an excellent host and was so thorough with providing check in/out information. Such a wonderful experience in a beautiful town.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a great reason to plan a trip to Selma. Great, clean and vibrant space to explore a town that has deep and hard fought history. I would totally advise that everyone get a chance to see this special and important landmark town. AC is a great host and gets everything just right. Perfect accommodations! Everyone I met in the town was real warm and friendly. I'd definitely stay at AC's place again if I return."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the loft, location, decor, cleanliness, & comfort. Exactly as advertised. Bed was very comfortable. Very impressed with overall all feel & design of the loft. Highly recommend this place & would definitely come back.
Thanks Ac!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love Woolworth Lofts. The Cadillac Loft is my favorite one. It’s very spacious and so clean. I recommend any of the lofts they are all unique in their own way. This is my home away from home in Selma.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my first Airbnb experience and it could not have been more pleasurable. The loft was just as it's shown to be. There was lots of great reading material also available which added a wonderful personal touch. Communication with the host was the simple and easy.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This inviting space provides comfort, functionality, and convenience. The renovations tastefully retained the vintage character of the original structure, while mindful upgrades have kept kitchen and bathroom appliances and bedding, top notch.
The hostess was equally endearing and pleasant. She communicates in a clear, thorough, and kind manner.
We felt appreciative to have a turn to stay in this special, well cared for space."
,,,"I cannot, in good conscience, recommend 422 Lapsley St as a place to stay. The poor air quality, cockroach/insect infestation, lack of cleanliness, and unaccountable co-host made our experience truly dreadful. Save yourself the disappointment and find a different accommodation option in the area.
The overall condition of the property was appalling forcing us to leave prematurely.
The air quality within the rental was absolutely deplorable. As soon as we entered the premises, a stale and mildew odor engulfed the entire home, making it difficult to breathe and triggering allergies for some members of my family.
We encountered cockroaches scurrying across the walls, making it impossible to relax or feel at ease leaving us disgusted and repulsed.
Accumulated dust and webs were visible throughout the property and urine stains were on the sofa.
The co-host responded dismissively, brushing off our complaints and placing the blame on us. This was a terrible experience."
