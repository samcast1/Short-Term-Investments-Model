2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for an awesome stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked the friends suite for my daughter’s 15th birthday weekend. She was wanting to go ice-skating and we had found the outside arena in Gadsden. I told her to look on Airbnb and see what she could find. She found this Airbnb so I went ahead and booked. The day we left for our fun weekend, her friend tested positive for the flu, so that kind of made the trip a little not so fun at first.
When we got to the apartment it was everything and more than what I saw in the pictures! We enjoyed it and everything we needed was within 5 miles! We are booking again! I HIGHLY recommend it."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed at Micah's Airbnb and loved it! It's super spacious and comfortable, plus the location is perfect—everything's walkable, but it's far enough away from the action that noise isn't an issue. Micah is an awesome host, super friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend!"

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"My sister was getting married the weekend of our stay and we were looking for a great place with a convenient location. This Airbnb is across the street from my sisters wedding venue (the pitman theatre). We thought this specific Airbnb would be perfect because it’s also friends themed. Who doesn’t love the friends tv show? Am I right?! We walked in that Thursday afternoon and were shocked at how gorgeous and clean this loft is. The high ceilings and giants windows in the bedrooms were everything! My sisters wedding photographer got the most breathtaking wedding photos standing in front of the tall windows. The friends theme was executed perfectly and they provided us with makeup wipes,laundry detergent and dishwashing detergent which was so helpful. Micah was very helpful and proactive with answering any questions that I had. I can’t wait to book another Airbnb stay with Micah again. My husband and I are already planning. Our stay was pure bliss. Thanks, Micah!!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,My first Airbnb. I'm sold and will be using Airbnb instead of hotels in the future. Lynn and Sandra were very accommodating and had a binder clearly laying out everything from using the wifi to local recommendations. The place had everything you may need including snack for both humans and dogs. I had 3 dogs with me and they provided access to the entire large backyard. I will be doing this same trip again in the future and I'll be looking to stay at the same place again.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We've enjoyed cozy and home-like relaxing atmosphere. The apartment was so comfortable and lovely decorated.

The use of the garage to park my car, especially given the inclement weather was a real plus!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great stay for us as an overnight to break up a long trip. It was so spacious and welcoming, with everything you can imagine to make the stay comfy. If you forgot any toiletry, an extra was there. Keurig coffee with various selections, plus tea. Chilled water and a tray of fun snacks, too. Sitting area spacious with comfortable chairs and bed, too. Large grassy fenced area for our dog to really stretch her legs. It’s a lovely rural setting, 10-12 minutes to an Ingles so not far at all. Very clear instructions for everything. Great outside lighting and delightful entry in the garage, welcoming guests as they check-in. We will definitely come again as our mid-way stop on way to NOLA. Thank you, Sandra, for sharing your beautiful home with us!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, will definitely recommend! Very safe and so cute and comfy. The coffee was a godsend in the morning for our early moving drive home. The room was so clean and the snacks were also a great touch.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sandra's place was absolutely wonderful! We arrived after dark and she had the garage door open, lights in the driveway, lamp on in the garage and a lamp on upstairs. The place is very welcoming and feels like home. Sandra has snacks out, waters, coffee bar and even treats for your pets if you bring them. It was just my son and I traveling and we felt perfectly safe staying here. We will definitely save her place and stay again when coming through."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We brought our 2 year old dog and We were in the area to pick up our new puppy; Sandra knew this and left all types of treats and doggie snacks out for us. Such a sweet touch. If we are ever in that area again we will definitely stay again. Definitely recommend!!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was cute and cozy. It's an in-law suite as described in the listing so you don't have a kitchen but I didn't need one so it worked for me. Enjoyed the fenced in backyard for my little guy, (my dog)🐶 also there were snacks and bottled water in the fridge which was nice. The bed was very comfortable, slept great."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Sandra's. The coffee bar and snacks were both great touches, and we enjoyed having them. I was impressed to find decaf and other non-coffee options too. That was great. Her home is on a quiet street that makes an excellent dog walk, but it is also right next to a highway that enables easy access to the hiking trails and nature that we were there to visit.
Her book of recommendations was great - we had a wonderful meal at Harp and Clover.
Everything was clean. Sandra was incredibly accommodating and helpful. We travel with frozen dog food, and she allowed us to store it in her personal freezer. The garage was also nice because of the wind and cold weather.
Honestly, I can't say enough good things. Perhaps, a counter-height surface near the bathroom/kitchen area would have been helpful since we brought food and prepped with the microwave, but that was just a tiny thing. We would definitely stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Sandra and her family are the epitome of Southern Hospitality! The place was above and beyond what my husband and I expected! Sandra was always quick to respond and help out whenever needed!
-Things outside the space-
You're close to restaurants (highly recommend Coosa Cafe) and not far from Cherokee Rock Village nor Noccalula Falls. You should go to the Rock Village to watch the sunset, but also to explore. The Christmas Lights at Noccalula Falls are far superior to Winterfest in Pigeon Forge. Tickets are $10 during the week and it includes a train ride and petting zoo. And if you enjoy caverns, you should check out Cathedral Caverns, it's an hour away, but worth it and affordable! Desoto Falls and Indian Falls were cool! We rolled in a little too late to be able to explore the other areas. Cheaha State Park, Bald Rock, and Rock Garden Trail were neat! If we ever come back to Alabama, we are definitely staying with Sandra again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice and quite worth the price
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,we stayed here on our way to and from Florida and communicated with Sandra several times as we traveled. The place was easy to find and very comfortable. The extra touches such as snacks and holiday decor added to its charm. We will definitely be back next time we head to Florida

My only regret is that I wish I had tipped a little bit more..."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place worked great for us! We brought our dog with us and she had treats and everything for us! She also had snacks, water, toiletries, etc for us when we arrived. Those little things made the stay great!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I absolutely loved this place and so did my 2 cats! It’s very clean and organized and well decorated. The area is very quiet and beautiful even for it being close to the main road. There were snacks, water and coffee provided along with some dog treats (no treats for cats in case you have a cat). I came in late November and they had put up some Christmas decorations which was so nice and made me feel right at home. I am absolutely saving this place and rebooking if Im in the area again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"OK where do I start? I normally don’t elaborate on these this much, but I have to say this is the best guest suite I’ve ever stayed in! The host makes you feel right at home and even offers you a spot to park in their garage. This host takes southern hospitality to a whole new level. There were snacks, waters, and several different types of coffee and cream. Also, extra toothbrushes and things that you wouldn’t expect to be there for you at an Airbnb. if I’m ever in the area again, I will for sure stay here."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Just what we needed for a great price.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We always enjoy our stay with Sandra. We feel like family during our stay and the accommodations are superb. If you enjoy fishing, travel with pets or simply want a peaceful, safe place to stay, Sandra’s place is perfect."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I would absolutely stay again
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stopped here for a night while traveling from TN back to LA with our dogs. The room was immaculare, private over the garage, and stocked with coffee, tea, water, hot chocolate, apple cider, many different snacks, a basket of toiletries with anything you might need, phone charger, and even dog treats. We were able to let our dogs stretch out and roam the large fenced yard (and do some zoomies!). We chatted with Sandra while out walking our pups and she is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Bed was comfortable, room temp was perfect and had fridge, microwave, and tv. The retractable gate at the top of the stairs was a nice touch to keep our dogs in! Sandra really has throught of everything! We wished we could have stayed on another night because it was so relaxing and the binder she provided in the room showed some really great places in the area! Hope to return!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was perfect and had all the little extra touches that makes a stay even better! Snack basket was fantastic! Very friendly and responsive host too! Bonus Even got to park in the garage!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. Had everything you could want. The host had thought of everything!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Immaculate & peaceful! We travel a lot and have stayed at many hotels and Airbnb’s. This was by far one of the best and we plan to stay here again in the future. What made the stay so pleasurable was the extra details. We arrived late (midnight) and the garage door was open and ready for us to pull in and park. We easily followed the directions for check in and made ourselves at home. There was a basket in the bathroom for items possibly forgotten, a snack basket, a cpap machine table, seasonal coffee cups, creamers, and a notebook with info. These extra details really made the place feel like home and safe."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Good host

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and thoughtfully stocked with everything we might need. Even with things we might have forgotten. It was close to the main road which made our comings and goings easy. We saw Sandra as we arrived and had a nice chat before she went to work. It was the perfect spot for us to be to visit a relative and enjoy a nice stay away from home. I liked the booklet Sandra put together of things to see and places to go. Excellent
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sandra and her Husband made us feel right at home from the get-go. Responded almost immediately when I called with a question. Their place has such beautiful grounds that they keep immaculate. They invited to join them at their church for Sunday service and it was like we were at home. We wish we had had time to utilize the fire-it and swing in the yard. Next time we will stay longer. It was a great stay!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charming place, peaceful and quiet. Sandra greeted me upon arrival and helped me get situated. Would definitely stay there again. Lots of homey little touches."

She had so many cute little ""things"" that just made our stay even more perfect. I'm pretty sure she thought of everything! She had snacks and water set out for us and even had little treats for our pup!
Sandra's place was small but very comfortable. Perfect for a couple or a very small family! And the price was unbeatable.
The location was also very nice. Quiet country (we even saw deer), and we felt safe the whole time. I loved that she even had a binder with things to check out, including places to eat. Highly recommend Decks and Docks!
Will definitely stay here again when in the area."

What a great surprise for us after driving 11 hours on our trip! She met us at the door and showed us to our room which was one of the best we’ve ever stayed in.

There was plenty of room so we weren't on top of each other, and during the family barbecue the kids had the fenced backyard as well as the kids room with bunk beds and a TV to hang out in. It was a perfect hub for all our family to come visit.

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Great house!! Spacious and very clean! Huge deck and nice front porch for sitting. Loved our stay!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! I am an avid Airbnb guest and this place is one of my all time favs. Had no idea I would be staying in the middle of a vineyard, yet there we were. Beautiful setting, we took a walk through the grape vines every morning down to the babbling creek. Great way to start your day. The house is exactly as advertised with plenty of room for everyone. Super clean and had all amenities one could want. I cannot forget the stars! Sitting on the back deck at night it looked like a million stars were out and they were so close it felt like you could almost reach out and grab one. Fabulous! Definitely a 5 star property!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The property is very nicely decorated, clean, and well-maintained. Zinta checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed before and during our stay. Brian and Zinta are great hosts, and this is a great location. It’s a beautiful, quiet area, but not far from town and close proximity to Noccalula Falls."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love staying here. It is in a great location and is very spacious.

2021-12-01,5,Group trip,Thank you for a wonderful place to stay!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you’re looking for a quiet, semi secluded place in the middle of town, then this is it. We needed to find a place to stay for the week, while our home was being prepped for sale. It was hard to find something that checked all the boxes, until we found this. The house is super cute inside, has a huge fenced back yard, washer/dryer, 2 full baths and for those that need it, it’s handicap friendly. Zinta was able to cater our check in/out times and responded super fast if I needed something. We’ll definitely be back when we need a home away from home!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stayed at Mrs. Zinta’s beautiful home. It was conveniently located to restaurants, grocery stores, shopping and literally down the street from the falls. The kids and our dog loved the yard. Overall great stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,This is a great home with great host.. We had everything we needed and the size of the home is very spacious and accommodated a large group of our wedding party! Thanks again for everything!!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the house. Set up to make you feel at home. You will enjoy your stay. It is close enough to everything but secluded enough to allow rest and relaxation!

2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Great stay everything they mentioned and some
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay was beautiful!!! The home literally makes you feel right at home. Zinta provided everything we needed and more for our stay, from dishes and utensils to books and games for the kids to play. We will for sure return for another visit."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is larger than it looks! 2 living rooms and 2 kitchen tables along with the spacious deck provide all of the space you need to enjoy even with a large group. The beds are very comfortable and the kids room was well equipped with books and games and plenty of room to spare. The highlight for us was the beautiful creek at the bottom of the vineyard. We wish we spent more time exploring on the property. The owners invited us to come and enjoy live music at the event venue and my mom had a blast talking to lots of friendly people that came for the show.
I can not stress how amazing it was to be in a huge comfortable house that was less than 1 mile from the beautiful Noccalula Falls park. We went every day and explored a new trail. There is so much to see and do just steps from the front door. You won’t be disappointed if you chose to stay at the Bryd house."
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay with plenty of space and a nice outdoor area behind the house. Came into town to play RTJ Silver Lakes and it was an easy commute over.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and property. There is plenty of room for the whole family plus in-laws. They have thought of everything you need for a great vacation!

2020-12-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay. Cool area and host was helpful for recommendations!
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,...
2020-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous home in a beautiful setting. Since we were there in November, the vineyard was sparse but was still an amazing landscape and my sister and I did yoga there! The Noccalula falls is literally around the corner and offers an amazing hike and scenery.
The fenced back yard is ideal for dogs, and the owners are very accommodating and gracious with their pet policy.
The kitchen is stocked with most essentials you will need and is spacious for cooking and entertaining.
The fireplace inside isn’t operational, which is a shame because it is so gorgeous. But, the owners provide plenty of fire woods for the very unique and cool fire pit/stone chimney in the backyard.
My only complaint was that the owners house is essentially in the backyard/next door, and I would have wanted to know that prior to the arrival day instructions. Also, a couple people drove up to the house and accessed a shed on the property a couple times, and it felt very weird and intrusive.
The owners are VERY responsive and accommodating and I would def recommend this home to any travelers!"
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,"Zintas place was even better than we expected!! This home is very spacious, cozy, and clean! Zinta was very quick to offer local suggestions and to ensure that we had everything that we needed! The home was kid friendly! Thanks for an awesome stay!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience from start to finish. Very prompt communication. The property was fresh, clean and spacious. It was very well laid out for my mother, who is in a wheelchair. There were thoughtful extras everywhere...games, books, small pet crate and bowls, and plentiful bathroom and kitchen supplies. Little ones to elderly will be happy here. The kitchen was equipped well enough for us to easily prepare our meals. Don't hesitate to stay here. Convenient to downtown, interstate, and Noccalula Falls. We met our host, Zinta, who lives next door, and she brought us a jar of their harvested local honey as a parting gift. A+++."
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,The house was very spacious and clean. During our stay we all felt like we were home. Zinta and her husband were very responsive and tentative.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing place! The photos looked beautiful but with a brand new listing and no reviews we were pretty hesitant. SO GLAD we stayed here! We booked super last-minute and Zinta and Brian raced around to make sure we had everything for a perfect stay. Wine, lots of firewood for the beautiful stone fire pit in back... cozy and comfy with plenty of space, and everything is clean, new, and functions perfectly. I wish we could have stayed longer. Can’t recommend this place highly enough! We’ll be back for the nearby waterfall and the hospitality! (And the crab claws!!!)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Dan was amazing. Very communicative. He was easy going, helpful and made recommendations for things to do. He left us a snack basket and all the toiletries we'd need. He checked in throughout the stay to make sure we had all we needed or wanted. The place was clean and cozy. 10/10 recommend, and will definitely be back next year."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at Dave's place. Again it was wonderful and we wished we could have stayed longer! We love the view of the lake and how quiet and peaceful it is. If our travels ever lead us back Dave will be the first one I look up!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David was a fantastic host. Extremely friendly and his dog, Harley, stole the show! We go to Gadsden every year and will book again in the future. Looking forward to it."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Place was great, David is a great host. Harley the big white dog loves fish eggs! Perfect location to any boat ramp, restaurant, and anything you need. Would definitely stay again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David was an awesome host, and we really enjoyed our stay here. I highly recommend his property, if you’re needing a place to stay within the Gadsden area. Perfect location for an angler wanting to hit the Coosa River."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely beautiful place and surroundings, David was the best host ever and his place provided more than your usual Airbnb, we will stay at this listing Everytime we are here from now on! The river was so peaceful and beautiful and the dog that comes with the house was amazing lol, we will miss him the most!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great Lake home. We came just before Christmas to visit family in the area so used as place to drop our stuff and sleep.
David kept to downstairs while we were in the main upstairs. It’s separated by a door and so the space is not privately secured if that matters to you."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a fantastic host and place was amazing. Would recommend to anyone.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,David was a wonderful host and so was his pup Harley. We felt right at home the moment we walked in and the view was beautiful. I especially enjoyed stepping out onto the screened in porch to drink coffee in the mornings. All of the furniture was comfortable and we slept well every night even fell asleep watching tv on the couch a few times. David’s place was perfect and we will be returning next time we are traveling to the area. Thank you for making our trip more enjoyable and relaxing.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a gorgeous house in magical surroundings. The local wildlife was an added bonus. We already have a booking to return.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very private, quiet, and home-y. Absolutely worth the price."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, super host, would gladly go back again"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David was awesome. He answered all calls and texts immediately. He even came to hang out with us when we had a bonfire and played a couple rounds of cornhole (sorry we lost when I was on your team, David 😬). Overall, it was a fantastic stay. I'll definitely be booking with him, again, the next time I travel up that way.
P.S. Harley, the yellow lab, will greet you at your car door and be waiting for you at the front door in the mornings. He is the sweetest boy, even if he does shed a ""little."" He is also not afraid of a firepit, so help him to keep his tail out of the flames! Haha. Be sure to give him lots of love when you meet him, and tell him I say hi!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place right on the lake.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay with David. Great place on the water at Neely Henry. Perfect place for fishermen. Super Host.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you have the opportunity to book this place and you don't, you are missing out. We loved the huge screened in porch over looking the river. We had perfect weather so we hung out there, ate our meals there. The view is gorgeous and really let's you completely relax and take it all in. David was the epitome of the ultimate host. He was so gracious and very professional. Made sure we wanted for nothing. His house has EVERYTHING you could possibly need.
When i am back in the area, I hope his place is available. On top of that, I fell in love with his dog, Harley. He is the sweetest lab and loved all the attention that i could give him."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We felt right at home! Host was very responsive & accommodating. The place was beautiful. We were in town for an event and didn’t get a chance to enjoy the backyard but definitely plan on returning for a relaxing getaway.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easily one of the best stays I’ve had through Airbnb! David’s place provided everything I could have needed and more. From the beautiful views, to the friendly service, I highly recommend anyone staying here."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place to spend 4th of July weekend (Sat - Tues). The house is easy to get to, private, and clean. The photos reflect it perfectly. The boat ramp and dock were a great benefit, and David was incredibly helpful. If he hadn't helped us get our boat in the water, I don't think we would have made it!! The enclosed deck is amazing. What a wonderful peaceful place to sit and view the water. We watched a beautiful lightning storm move through from the deck. This is a house that has to be seen to be totally appreciated."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here to fish for four days. The house was perfect the host was great and helpful. It had everything we were looking for. If I ever go back to Gadsten to fish. I would definitely stay here again

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,AMAZING SPOT ON THE WATER!! My family and I had an extremely good time at this home. The home was large enough for our family and has an amazing outdoor space. The dock on the water was wonderful for swimming and floating around. The fire pit on the side was great for evening relaxation and chatting. The open floor plan that looks out over the water is amazing. This will be a family vacation spot for many years to come. Brittany the host was literally a text or phone call away. Thx again for an amazing time!!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect lake get-a-way. Being right on the water was perfect. Cooking out there on the BGE at sunset was a delight. The fire pit really made the evening ice. Water was calm and just right for paddle boards.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying right on the riverbank and fishing off the deck.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay. My daughter was being married at J&D Farms, so we used this as a close place to stay after the rehearsal dinner. Then the bride and groom spent their first couple of nights there. It wound up being the perfect setting.
And thanks to the host for making everything so easy from check-in to check-out.
We would highly recommend and will definitely plan to come back at a later date."

It also comes with a great secure parking space that fits even large SUVs. We really loved our stay and it is located right in old Gadsden town, which we found to be really cute and amazing, really loved waking up and walking down the street. Micah was amazing and very communicative always there to help which was above an beyond. We would absolutely stay here again. Thank you so much Micah for all your hospitality! Cheers!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The apartment is lovely and clean. It looks just like the photos. Micah was very helpful and responsive. The teenage kids loved the pool table. And the garage parking was fantastic (it was raining when we loaded up to leave).
There are quite a few steep steps up to the apartment (one flight) and no elevator, so just be aware if you’re traveling with a little one or someone who struggles with steps.
If steps are not a concern, highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Micah - thanks so much for sharing your lovely loft!! You are definitely a super host. I truly appreciated the prompt and friendly communication throughtout. We so enjoyed our stay while visiting Gadsden for the Kingsmen Big & Live Concert. The location is perfect - central to everything. The loft was super clean and just as pictured. We enjoyed the pool table and had the fun surprise of attending the First Friday Car Show on Broad St. Will definitely return to this location if we ever find ourselves back in Gadsden! Thanks so much!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We came for a wedding in Noccalula Falls with our two small kids. The experience was very enjoyable. Micah’s place was spacious and comfortable.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My spouse and myself, stayed at Micah’s loft in downtown Gadsden while we attended my high school reunion activities. Micah was a very responsive host and had all we needed to be confortable. The loft was in a great location in downtown Gadsden which was in walking distance of numerous restaurants and a coffee shop. This location was perfect. We were across the street from Pittman Theatre for our first night of the reunion weekend and then a short drive away from the main event on Saturday. If you are looking for a downtown location, with walking distance to many restaurants, stores and a coffee shop, i highly recommend you to make a reservation at Micah’s loft ."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment our booking was accepted, Micah was super attentive and responsive. He said we were going to love the place and WE DID!!
When we stepped in the door, we just felt at peace and completely at home. The place was immaculate and inviting and had everything we needed. Micah was so gracious and even accommodated a late early check-in request because we forgot AL is on central standard time and we arrived super early.
Great area. Very walkable and central to many things.
Will definitely stay there again if we ever find ourselves that way. Would surely rent any property owned by Micah!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this place! It was pouring down rain the first 2 days we were here, so the garage was a huge blessing, especially while unloading. My husband and I enjoyed playing Scrabble on the rainy days while the kids played pool! The kitchen was perfect to cook our Easter dishes in and was very well stocked. We are a family of 5 that fit in the loft with room to spare. We will definitely be back when we return to Gadsden. Micah was very responsive and helpful throughout our trip."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Micah deserves the recognition of “super host.” The loft apartment is very nice with modern style furnishings. The kitchen and bathroom were very well appointed and a pool table, large TV, and board games were fun bonuses."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was everything I was looking for and more. Upon arrival I was greeted by a walking distance music store, where I was able to browse for cymbals for the drums. I appreciated the temporary parking to get my stuff unpacked and situated. The layout was on point with a separate bedroom, the bathroom, and a large walk-in closet. I loved the privacy of the garage, the peace and quiet, the decor, the kitchen, the loft & open space, cleanliness, and the ice maker:). The residents I encountered were friendly and happy- rightfully so! The hosts are very quick to respond and helpful with any questions I had, and excellent suggestions were made for places to check out. I look forward to making it my home away from home for next time!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this place for a work conference in the area with the intention of traveling with my husband thinking while I was at the conference he would have a quiet place to spend the day, play some pool and hang out. He ended up not being able to come so it was just me. I didn’t get there as early as I had hoped so it was dark. Kevin and Bethanne had both communicated that the driveway was a little difficult to find so I knew I may have some issues and proceeded with caution. It was so dark. When I arrived though, Kevin quickly came out and showed me where to go and then gave me a tour of the place. It was the perfect place. Quiet, roomy, clean. Each morning I saw deer across the river eating and playing. I am from the city so it really was a treat to be in such a beautiful place. I will definitely keep this place in mind for any future trips to the area! Would definitely recommend checking it out!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Once again, Kevin and Bethanne provided a great stay. Best place to stay in this area, I'm a repeat customer and I always will be. Clean and beautiful and they go out of their way to make it comfortable!"

I recommend staying here for a good weekend get away!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a really nice place to stay, right on the water. It was fun to play pool and there is a nice big kitchen. The space was clean and tidy. Thank you again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So glad we found this cabin! It was exactly what we needed and the location was great for getting quickly to Southside/Rainbow City and Gadsden. It was very clean and well stocked. Kevin had surely anticipated any need we might have had. He was so nice to work with and very responsive. I hope the bungalow will be available next time we come to see family.

Will definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I spent our 21st anniversary at Kevin's place, and it was perfect! It was everything we had hoped for - private, peaceful, relaxing, and right on the water. We spent much of our time fishing and relaxing on the dock while watching an array of local wildlife. Kevin and his wife even took us out for a ride on their boat which was definitely a welcome surprise. You won't find nicer, more responsive hosts. We left feeling like we'd made new friends, and we hope to visit again soon!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Had a great stay! Would definately come back.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed the peaceful and quiet location of this Air bnb. It was cozy and welcoming, with great hosts! Would stay again"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely nature welcoming committee. We saw several baby and adult geese, turtles, deer and a heron. But it is quite remote from activities and restaurants, and shops. I think it will be improved some once the boat dock is repaired. The bungalow itself was fairly comfortable with a good size kitchen that had plenty of dishes to make meals. But plan on cooking because with the duplicated addresses food delivery would be difficult."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Always love our stay here! Kevin & Bethanne are incredible hosts and their space always feels like home away from home.
Convenient location to lake life and city food/events locations. Great communication. Clean and bright, tranquil and welcoming. See you guys again soon!"

I’ll definitely be coming back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kevin was such a great host! He showed us around when we got there, offered us to fish from his dock, told us about some great things around and was all around helpful! The house was exactly what the pictures showed. Very clean and quiet, just what we needed. I even sprained my ankle on a hike and he was so accommodating to me. We got to see some baby geese, fish and the neighborhood celebrity cat “Church”! It was a very lovely getaway!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin, was a great host! It was the retreat that I needed. Someplace quiet to think, to write, to read, and completely recharge."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the quiet away from the city home. Had privacy the whole time. Met Kevin and Beth just before leaving. They were very friendly. We were not able to view the sunset because of the weather conditions. But pretty sure the view will be great because of the way the house plan is. We will definitely come back again.

2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,Just like the pics. Very quiet and a pretty view of the Coosa. A good spot if you’re visiting Gadsden!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We were looking for a quiet peaceful getaway and we found it!!! This little bungalow was perfect! We look forward to coming back.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host and place to stay. I went back for a second time because of how nice the bungalow is and how hospitable the host is.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I really enjoyed ourselves at this location. It's secluded and has a country feel to it, but it's only 10 minutes from the city where the mall and restaurants are so it was a perfect combination of privacy but with the convenience of being able to get what you need. The place was really clean, and the billiards table was in pristine condition. They have a SmartTV so you can sign in and watch any shows you want to, and they stocked coffee, tea, and condiments for you. We plan on coming back to this location in the summer with our kids as it's truly a perfect spot."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really loved the cabin,also very clean.
I would definitely
recommend. And hope someday stay again. very nice people.👍👍👍👍"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything thing was clean and inviting.cozy place to make as your Basecamp to do anything Alabama has to offer .highly recommend!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our time here. The house was perfect for our needs. I wish we'd have had longer to actually enjoy it though. I also wish we'd have had more time to talk with the hosts; Kevin seemed like a really genuine guy. I have a feeling he has some interesting stories to tell.
Hopefully we can make it back again and bring the kids next time. Looking forward to doing some fishing and swapping stories around the campfire."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay. The cottage is very clean and roomy. The setting is perfect and the October sunsets are stunning.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was absolutely outstanding. Kevin, the was extremely helpful in every way He also helped me get my boat in and out of the water. The house was exceptionally clean and extremely well decorated and designed. A very unique property. I will definitely stay there again myself and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone. If you don’t try your are missing out on a unique property.
My biggest concern is everybody is going to find out about it but that will probably happen anyway. We went there for our 30 year anniversary. We loved it.
Would be a great place for fisherman as well."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"If we could give 10 stars we would. This is a simply amazing spot to stay at. Even if we had plans in Birmingham we would still book a stay here and make the 1 hour drive each way. You have everything and more when staying in Kevin's cottage. We didn't want to head back to our own homes because the entire experience was 5 start from the start. Kevin will personally meet you to show you around. There is more than enough space for relax, sleep, BBQ, and check out the sights. Would love to stay here again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was perfect for my stay. Very comfortable, super clean, setup very well. But the best part is the location and VIEW of the water and the peacefulness of the cove. I enjoyed sitting in the swing on the dock and taking in the birds and the water. Hope to return on our next trip to AL. Thank you!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the perfect lil’ spot for a relaxing getaway! Kevin and Beth are 5 star hosts and we definitely plan on revisiting!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"a wonderful place to stay, it really was very peaceful! the pool table was great as well as the layout of the bungalow. would love to stay again :)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Kevin’s place is awesome. I’ll keep coming back as long as I’m in the area! Still the best air b&b I’ve stayed at so far.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kevin was very responsive and had great communication. The location is beautiful and the space was comfortable and had everything we needed. We will definitely be back!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Accurate description- perfect stay in Gadsden.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Executive Summary: If you’re planning to spend a relaxing weekend, week, or month in Gadsden, Kevin and Beth’s place is where you want to stay.
Long version: Gadsden isn’t a public transportation or walking town. Everything centers around boating and driving. If you’re planning to drive anyway, you should be sure to rest your head somewhere quiet and extremely comfortable. That’s Kevin’s place.
This is an Airbnb that’s designed to be lived in. And we speculate that the hosts have spent considerable time setting up and tuning the space to ensure that everything works smoothly.
The stay is a separate building not attached to the main house. You enter through sliding glass doors that provide a view of Kevin and Beth’s tributary of the lake. The space has very high ceilings throughout except for the bathroom. There’s a heater / air conditioner, two ceiling fans and even a dehumidifier (it’s on a lake in Georgia). During the heat of summer, we found the fans to be redundant.
Their kitchen amenities are of the highest quality. A serious gas stove, with quality pots and pans, Samsung microwave, coffee maker, fridge with ice maker, a toaster that actually evenly toasts, even an electric can opener. The only appliance missing from the kitchen is a dishwasher. Not an issue for us. We didn’t generate enough dirty dishes to mind hand-washing them.
The knives were even sharp. If you stay in enough airbnb’s you’ll learn how rare this is. The reason? There’s a knife steel in the block and a sharpener next to the block. Other hosts could learn a lot from Kevin.
The kitchen is large enough that two folks can prepare dinner without getting in each other’s way. As mentioned previously, all of the appliances are top-notch. If you need a tool or container and can’t find it in the drawers or cabinets, we would be astonished. Ice cream scoop, apple corer, immersion blender, julienne peeler…
There’s a large couch in the main room, and an easy chair, facing a large-screen TV which included the usual semi-infinite Roku options. Also in the main room is a high-end pool table.
And, there’s a roll-top desk as a wonderful dedicated workspace.
Adjacent to the breakfast bar in the kitchen is a dining table that will seat six comfortably.
The bathroom includes a shower with nozzles high enough for us tall folks, and room adjacent to the sink to store your stuff.
The mattress on the bed was a bit on the hard side, exactly the way we like it. The bedroom closet is large enough to hang everything in your suitcase.
We measured the internet speed as 40Mbs down and 20Mbs up, using our VPN.
Bottom line: Kevin and Beth’s place is quiet, comfortable, complete and fully functional. It doesn’t get any better than this. We’ll be back."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great quiet place to stay.
Very clean & nice."

2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Super cute place, but if you’re planning on needing two beds just pack an air mattress. The couch pull out bed is so uncomfortable you can’t even sleep on it. Other than that it was super cute and clean!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a great value. Kevin and Beth are extremely responsive and helpful to any of your needs.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is comfortable and perfect for a short or longer time away. The bungalow overlooks a small portion of a larger lake system, providing a lot of fishing opportunities from what I’ve heard! It was beautiful, quiet, and everything we needed for a wedding weekend in Gadsden. The bed was clean and comfortable (along with the rest of the home) the kitchen had plenty of space. Kevin was a great communicator and made sure we felt at home. If I need a place in the area again I will be back!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Spacious stay, clean, smelled good, soft blankets, Community brand coffee provided. Easy access off 59 if you're traveling through. In a small, safe private community on a lake. There is a digital thermometer on the heater/ac that makes light at night (which I don't think can be turned off or covered up). Hosts respond quickly, are very friendly and accommodating."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin and Beth were so welcoming and great hosts! I was there for a week and had some outgoing mail and they even let me use their mailbox! The place was so spacious, quiet, and well stocked. I was in town to visit family but had to work during the day. I would come back late at night but the automatic lights outside were a nice touch for safety. Giant TV was great and the sound system was nice to plug into my phone and play music. You can’t beat the views and it’s not a long drive back to the Main Street of town. It was an affordable stay too which factored into me choosing this location. I will definitely stay here again when visiting family in the future."

Kevin was there to greet us and show us around the place. Great space inside with everything you would need to enjoy your stay. We sat on the dock and watched the sunset and then walked around the neighborhood that is surrounded by water. Comfortable bed, couch, every dish and appliance, plus a pool table! In the morning Kevin even offered a bucket and soap so we could wash the truck. Amazing hospitality and we were grateful for it all."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to visit! Kevin even came outside in the AM & said hello and small talked. Will definitely be coming back in the warmer months!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful experience
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My wife, daughter and I were in town four days for a series of music concerts. We really liked the location, as it was in an older, well established neighborhood near the old downtown area.
The only problem we had was the wifi was not working because of an equipment failure from the provider. Mr Fortner was very diligent in his efforts to resolve the problem. Unfortunately, it required equipment replacement by AT&T and could not be resolved until the day we were leaving. Being unable to resolve the issue, Mr Fortner offered to refund our money and allow us to move. We chose to stay.
We feel he was very fair and would stay there again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It was just like being at home very nice and clean

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I stayed just one night. I don't care for hotels for the most part. I really felt like I was staying at a friends house. I didn't stay long enough to check out the area, mostly because it was dark, but I felt safe and it is centrally located in town. It felt like being back in my first apartment, but this one had furniture!
It's not on the beach, and isn't a condo, but its comfy and the host was amazing."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Host was very informative. We added an extra day after booking and host made it very easy to do. Quick response.

We hope to be staying here next year when we travel back to the area like we do every year, if we have no moved back to Alabama. He kept a check on us to make sure if we needed anything he was always there for us. Such a wonderful host. Gadsden is a wonderful place to shop, spend some time, and lots of things to do. Make sure you book with Kris, He will take good care of you and your family."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was perfect for our stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,It was really beautiful
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect or stay! Close to all the places we needed to go. There are plenty of beds and blankets. The bathroom is small but clean.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a great stay!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property was centrally location for all our need not far from interstate. Beautiful area. Chris was was very responsive when there was a slight challenge due to weather.
He was quick to answer calls, arrived within women’s to work towards the issues.
The Area had lost power for about nine hours before our arrival the high heat was challenging. Chris worked diligently to assure our comfort.
The only tough part about the trip was Mother natures high temp and thunder storms, which is beyond out control. Chris and Fortner’s Vacation Rentals LLC’s are an extreme
Delight. We were treated like family,. If you are looking for a taste of home, and not try to bust your wallet, Check this folks out. They will not disappoint. The area is very quiet if you just want to retreat and rest this spot would be ideal.."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,we enjoyed this. It was close to where we wanted to be and quiet so I slept really well - and I am a light sleeper!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent one night during the final leg of a 12 day road trip, and the place was just as described. The bedrooms were private, and there was plenty of space for our family of 4 to spread out after being on the road. Everything was clean and comfortable. There were plenty of snacks for the kids. The host was friendly and helpful throughout the stay. He even answered my questions when we arrived in town late! It took us a couple of tries to find the parking, but it was not an inconvenience; we wouldn't have had trouble had we arrived during the day. Overall, I would recommend this space to anyone looking for a private, clean, and comfortable place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place was closer to Downtown and restaurants. The host was very responsive and checked on us if we needed anything else. We had a great time.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great experience at this Air BnB. I’m from Gadsden and have a big family so it’s hard for us to cram in on family when we come to visit. I was really happy to find such a cute place in a good area! It’s was very clean and the host even left us snacks and water! Definitely recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy to communicate with and great area. House was perfect for 3 but could easily fit up to 6 comfortably!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Chris is an outstanding Host. We arrived at 3:00 AM because we came in from Oklahoma and Chris met us out front so he could show exactly where to park and how to get to the Apartment. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. The neighborhood is beautiful and very safe. Chris was extremely easy to communicate with and available when we had questions. We highly recommend this place!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! The little apartment is very private, and the host is more than kind and communicative. Even after we had left, we realized we had left something behind, and the host was so accommodating, allowing us to come back and look. There was a ton of stuff left there for us (e.g. candy, popcorn, water, etc.). Overall, very good stay, especially for the price."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks so much for being a great host, very attentive, always available and the house was great. Sorry we were late getting out but you were still very kind."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved the place! I travel with kids so the night lights in the bedrooms were an amazing feature that so many places miss. The snacks were also a big hit! I appreciated how there wasn't any clutter in the way of glass decorations and things, instead it was decorated in a way that was kid friendly."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fortner was easy to communicate with and we enjoyed our stay!
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cool spot for a work trip. Quiet, had necessities, water, and awesome snacks. The host was extremely attentive and checked on me throughout the stay, without being overbearing. I wasn't crazy about the parking at first, but in the end, I did feel safe. Could use a deep cleaning, but I'd stay again if ever in the area. The host was absolutely amazing!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was cozy and comfortable, and our host was helpful and responsive. The kids and I had a lovely stay, and would stay there again."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay for 3 people. Could even fit two more if you really wanted, and for the price, you can’t get better than this! This spot is in a great location, not too far from a lot of places, it was clean, we had water and snacks provided, and all-in-all I have no complaints! This is a great Airbnb for rock climbers to book as there are outdoor locations to climb within 10-30 minutes of here. Also, Kris was great! My crew and I managed to lock ourselves out of the apartment on the first night (it was our own fault), it was around 11 p.m., and I called Kris to which he thankfully responded. He came out of the comfort of his home to rescue us and was very welcoming and friendly. This was a great deal for us broke college students, and overall I highly recommend!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10 out of 10
2024-03-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The host is very responsive, but the location is not great at all. The neighborhood surrounding the rental seems unsafe. I wish I would have read the reviews describing the building as a former retirement housing or low-income housing facility prior to booking. The whole building is currently in process of renovations but is in disrepair. There was a horrible smell throughout the 15th floor, where this listing is located. When we walked in, there was dirt all over the bathroom floor and pubic hair on each surface of the bathroom. The host did offer to have the cleaning person come up and clean the room as soon as I messaged her, but at that point I was so aggravated by the appearance and experience that my child and I left and did not return. We ended up renting a hotel room in the area instead, so I was out double the amount of money I paid for the rental. I would not recommend staying here, although I did appreciate that the host responded quickly until I asked for a partial refund."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The studio apt was nice and clean. My partner and I stayed for 2 nights and spent our days rock climbing at hospital boulders a 5 min drive. Great place to stay when wanting to go do our doors activity’s in the day, with Noccalula falls, hospital boulders, and sand rock all not too far away. Overall great stay and we will be staying again!"

They even had kindling in the fire pit outside for us.
We love the ton of Collinsville. We walked down there a good bit. They have a nice coffee/tea shop. Really good food. They also have a large Hispanic community with multiple convenience stores and a really nice dinner/grocery.

The hosts were very communicative and helpful. Unfortunately the weather didn't cooperate, so we couldn't go on the really beautiful looking hikes we had planned on, that are in the area. However, even the rain was beautiful and cozy and just meant we got to spend more time at Beloved's Rest--jacuzzi is amazing, lots of grilling and even a few outdoor games in-between showers! Couldn't recommend more, we definetly want to go back."

The best thing we enjoyed was it was private, which made our relaxing time even better with how peaceful it was. The views this place has from the firepit to up top in the hammock to laying in the bed were simply breathtaking.

The remote controlled fireplace was incredible, the shower had spa pressure, and the bed was really comfortable. Couldn’t be better."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space was such a nice space to stay. Gadsden is a small town and being able to walk downtown easily and visit little shops and restaurants was a nice treat.

The firepit on the deck is lovely. Parking is tight- so we used the alley down the lot as instructed with our bigger vehicle, easy.
Sweet spot, exactly as described, Pamela easy to communicate with, very responsive.
See you again next year for the Christmas lights!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's rare for something advertised online to be as quality in real life. The loft is just as described. It was very clean, cozy, and comfortable. Pamela really nailed the details to make it an easy stay. We were given great instructions for check-in and parking. Every switch and remote is labeled so you don't have to wonder what everything does. She provided a book with restaurant recommendations and of those we tried, they were all excellent.
The kitchen was stocked with plates, cups, bowls, cooking utensils, spices, paper towels, dish soap, etc. There was washing detergent for both the washing machine and the dish washer. There were even K Cups supplied for the coffee pot.
The couch and bed were both super comfortable. The shower is amazing with multiple shower heads. The rooftop patio was great too. The sitting area with gas fire pit was awesome. The ability to close curtains to block the cold wind was great, and the picnic table was nice for eating.
This review doesn't do it justice. If you are even considering booking this airbnb just do it, you won't be disappointed."

We started our days in the kitchen that had everything we needed for a full breakfast. Spices, pots, pans, coffee, creamer; we had it all.
Most days we left to explore the hiking trails, shops, and restaurant recommendations, but returned early enough each day to have quiet evenings by the fire.
While this was a pleasure trip, the dining room nook was perfect for sitting for a couple of hours and getting my work done on the provided wi-fi.
10/10 all the way around!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Top notch every time!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft is by far one of the nicest places my wife and I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. There are no amenities or touches left unaccounted for. The best example is the towels on the back overlook porch that are there so that if the seating is damp from rain you can cover them. The only thing you need to provide is yourself, and food if you intend to cook.
All of downtown Gadsden is a 5 minute walk. There are plenty of shops and great restaurants less than 2 minutes by foot. The best part of that immediacy is that, despite being so close, the loft is peaceful and secluded enough to feel as though you are miles from the main drag.
Pamela is an excellent host who responds promptly and with a very friendly demeanor. She has tons of recommendations for local food and fun that, if you haven't already, would give you more than enough to utilize for an itinerary.
I could go on, but frankly you should just rent it yourself. Don't think twice."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although the photos are great, they don’t do justice on how cute this hidden gem truly is! The essentials are all within walking distance which is convenient if you don’twant to have to drive everywhere. You can tell everything was thoughtfully picked out based on the attention to detail. If I’m ever back in the area I will definitely stay there and will tell everyone I know to stay there as well."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The loft is amazing. Comfortable spacious convenient and above all else gives you a vacation spot right in the middle of Gadsden!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pamela’s loft apartment was an exceptional stay. Her communication was quick and thorough. Instructions on where to eat were accurate. The appointments she provided with the rental was exceptional as well. I could have shown up with nothing but my clothes and had everything I needed to enjoy my stay...down to the little details...such as even providing good clips for my Frito chip bag. A great coffee machine with coffee provided. The nice robes were an additional, thoughtful offering. Everything is in excellent condition, well maintained and very clean. The deck is private and just as advertised in the photo. The rental is in an older commercial district that although old, had a nice vibe to it. The private parking garage was very useful with a provided clicker to easily come and go. If in the Gadsden area again...her place will be the first I try to rent.
Rick Moore"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place and hosts. Throughly enjoyed our stay. Will recommend!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So glad we decided to book this stay while in town for a wedding. Pamela has thought of every little detail. We had everything we needed and much, much more. Her loft is very, very clean and all the furniture is very comfortable. Having a one-car garage and being on the main strip of downtown Gadsden was a major plus. If we’re ever in town again, we’d book again. Pamela is a perfect host."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft at Chestnut was an EXCELLENT get-away. It was a couples retreat for us, and a base for us to go ride bicycles on the Chief Ladiga Trail, which is about 35 minutes away by car. The Loft itself has more than everything thought of. Seriously.
The living space is large and yet very cozy. A grand island separating the greatroom from the kitchen is large, with plenty of space for cooking, snacking and planning activities all at the same time. The bedroom was quiet, comfortable, and the large closet made putting your bag out of the way a snap! The master bath/shower is fantastic ---and--- the ""bonus"" of having the half bath off the great room was SOOOoo convenient when two folks are getting ready to WALK out to dinner! Last, the upstairs, rooftop space is such a deluxe feature. Seriously nice. We caught the spring weather on a perfect weekend where it was just cool enough for the firepit, and yet warm enough to enjoy the breeze. And also coffee in the mornings.
The Downtown area was an unexpected gem. Lots of shops, boutiques and food-gettin'-places all within easy walking or cycling distance! The rehabilitation happening is WELL underway and VERY interesting to witness :)
Truly a delux couples getaway - we plan to come back. Fo' Sho' ..."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice comfortable home, quiet, rural without being isolated. Dave and Jo are wonderful hosts, great place for the dog to run around in the fenced yard and see other dogs. The cafe less than a mile away had amazing home cooked southern food. It was a great place for a long term stay, was even able to get both our cars in the garage. Internet went out and Dave was super helpful getting that resolved."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Dave has a beautiful and cozy home we have been fortunate to spend in time in twice now. This Country Cross Roads home is a perfect place to stay while exploring the areas lakes, trails, and restaurants."

The WiFi didn’t work well, this was frustrating.
The yard is fenced but easy for a dog to get out and the neighbors’ dogs are loose outside so be careful walking your dog."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed staying at Dave’s Place! The house was definitely worth the stay and saved us so much time on our wedding weekend getting to and from our venue.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,the home was absolutely beautiful and very homey.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house met all our needs. Dave was a super host. The house is what I'd consider country. There is only a small grocery store, Subway, Jack's, Dollar General, McDonalds & 3 gas stations all on one corner. That it. Sharecroppers is a coffee shop that sells other food & merchandise but closes @ 4 PM.
All somewhat major areas about 40 mins to 1 hr to get to. The scenery with mountains, cotton farms, lakes & sick beautiful. If you want quiet at night & don't driving everywhere, Dave's place the spot to.
The house is fully stocked with everything will need. Fenced in yard for kids and/or pets. Cul de sac road work maybe 10 houses, so it is safe kids.
I'd recommend house & stay if you want an affordable homey feeling & want country living & a wonderful host."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay. Description was accurate and house had everything we needed. Great place will definitely rent again when in town visiting family.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kacey’s while we were visiting my in-laws. Plenty of seating and perfectly comfortable beds. The main bathroom is amazing and the kitchen is nice to cook in. The only thing I would mention for future guests is that it is not stocked in any way in the kitchen or bathroom beyond the very essential basics of TP and towels and a hair dryer in the bathroom. No shampoo or conditioner etc. Be sure to bring your own of everything you need.
In the kitchen we really only found salt and pepper and some sugar for the coffee. They did have small packets of creamers but literally that’s it. Several cabinets were locked off with zip ties so we assume a lot of that stuff was in there.
It was super clean and tidy and comfortable and the whole family really enjoyed it. We would definitely stay here again."

I must say if you are looking for quality, comfort and cleanliness look no further. I will definitely be booking again soon. Hands down the best in the area!!!"
