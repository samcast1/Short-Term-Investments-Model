The apartment was clean, spacious, and in a perfect location to walk around and explore Gulfport (& a short, gorgeous drive to Biloxi). I absolutely loved the exposed brick walls, and my husband's favorite part was the skylights. :)

Thanks again !"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I haven‚Äôt stayed in a hotel on purpose in 6 years and use AirBnB exclusively. So I‚Äôm very picky about my stays.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! I loved this place. It is such a cool space. The neighborhood was safe and close to so many shops. Not too mention, Small Cakes, the cupcake place downstairs. Do yourself a favor and get the Lemon! This place has amazing skylights, it is beautifully decorated. Charles met us at the site, showed us everything and then actually walked me and my 81 year old Mom around the corner to the restaurant where we were meeting my brother. The house was superclean. I would definitely go back!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for all of the parade and festivities. Mia and Charles were great to us all weekend long. Some of the best hosts. We have already talked about returning next year.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Mia and Charles are exceptional hosts. The apartment is spacious and beautifully furnished. Having the cupcake shop downstairs was an added plus.

Great location with restaurants, stores and and shops close by. A great seating area outside to enjoy a drink. Highly recommended! Mia & Charles we‚Äôre incredible hosts! Don‚Äôt forget to visit the cupcake shop downstairs."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Finding this little slice of heaven made my busy Cruising the Coast days so much more comfortable. The cleanliness, the spaciousness and the location all worked perfectly. This was one of my favorite stays in an Airbnb."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time in the upstairs spacious apartment. It is located in a historic building and has all of the wonderful characteristics that go along with that. It was exactly as represented in the photos. The location is perfect! Close to great restaurants and breweries, and the cup cake shop below the apartment, beyond words! And you get a Birds Eye view from the balcony of any event that is taking place on the street. We would definitely stay again!"
2022-09-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly, this was the worst AirBnB experience my family has ever had.
I can only give it 2 stars- 1 for location and 1 for cleanliness.
Things you should know before booking that are not plainly listed in description:
1. Only street parking is available for this location and it is limited to 2 hours during the weekdays until 6PM.
2. The owners bathroom only has a tub- no shower. The only shower option is a 4sq. ft. stall shower located in the second bathroom.
3. There are ~20 stairs that you have to walk up to access the apartment. It may not be ideal if you‚Äôre bringing a lot of items or have decreased mobility.
It‚Äôs clear that the host has tried to make the space nice but there are several small things that could be done to make the experience significantly better. There were only 6 towels that were provided to us- all mismatched and stained (plus just one hand towel for two bathrooms and a handful of washcloths). The living room has no side tables or coffee table, so if you have a drink while sitting on the couch you have to set it on the floor. At least 3 lightbulbs were burned out. We were only provided with 1/2 a roll of toilet paper per bathroom for the weekend. The window/mini-split AC units are all loud and inefficient and woke us up throughout the night. The Wifi was spotty.
Check-in is supposed to be at 3PM. We messaged the seller just before 2PM and told her that we did not expect to be let in early but would like to be let in right at 3:00. At 3:00 there was no one there to meet us so we called twice, knocked on the door- all with no answer. At 3:15 she called to ask where we were, but never apologized for being late or missing our calls. We also contacted the host one time during our stay to ask a question and she said she would call back with an answer but never did. That‚Äôs just not kind or professional.
I would never recommend this to a friend or consider staying there again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a pleasure!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great location, and you can't beat the value! We spent a weekend at Mia's place and had a blast. Walking distance to many great restaurants and attractions (Sully's, Chandeleur Island Brewing, Half Shell Oyster House, Perk's, and, of course, Smallcakes and SeaGrapes downstairs). Easy walk to the Aquarium, as well. Despite being downtown, the stay was very quiet and safe. Would highly recommend and will likely stay again!"

Enjoyed our times at the gulf beaches of MS and eating our way along the coast. And a bonus was the Smallcakes just below the apt for a quick treat!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,You will not be disappointed.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This stay was very serene and relaxing. I am a traveling Healthcare Professional and this was just what I needed. I was so comfortable in this apartment that I didnt want to go out. I loved the oversized tub as well as the comfortable couch. The natural lighting was my favorite . Smallcakes is also downstairs so need I say more. This place is a üíé.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was amazing! So beautiful with the skylights. Mia was so kind when we arrived and offered suggestions for nearby eateries. There is no designated parking spot, but parking can be found easily on the street (except you have to move every 2 hours M-F during the day). I would definitely stay there again."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Love it!!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space is clean and the pictures do not do it a justice. It is very spacious and in a wonderful location near restaurants, shops, and the beach. Mia was kind and welcoming and responded to questions quickly,"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is stunning! Pictures do not do it justice. It is in walking distance to beach, casino, brewery and restaurants.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to be close to the beach but away from the congestion, this is the perfect location. It is situated above a bakery, but you do not smell food while inside. It is very spacious and consists of the necessities."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place is fabulous. The pictures don't do it justice. It is much bigger and nicer than you would expect. The location is perfect. There are multiple really nice restaurants within walking distance and the cupcake shop downstairs has the most delicious cupcakes. Mia was a wonderful host.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Oh my! Such a great place! Mia and her husband went the extra mile and we felt so supported by them both! The place is walking distance (only a few blocks) from amazing restaurants, a park, the gulf, and the aquarium. We were glad we rented a car so that we could explore nearby towns and beaches but this place is central for Gulf Port for sure. We loved the beautiful exposed brick walls, the tub, and just the general look and feel!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay. We stayed a weekend and it was the ideal area downtown. Close to everything. The apartment was clean and well furnished. Mia met us to give us the keys. Very polite and hospitable...would love to stay there again.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mia‚Äôs place has comfortable mattresses and is clean and well appointed. The entire apartment is spacious and the beautiful kitchen is no exception.
The apartment is located on the second level with a cute and yummy cupcake shop below. It‚Äôs well insulated as we barely heard street noise and never heard the business below.
We walked to the beach where there is a long walking trail and white sand beaches.
Excellent restaurants and an outlet mall are all nearby.
Mia was welcoming and a great communicator."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful apartment inside and out! Mia was so sweet and helpful!

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at Mia's! It's a short walk to the beach and within walking distance of several fantastic restaurants. We especially enjoyed the balcony. Good for people watching! We can't wait to visit Gulfport again and stay at Mia's lovely, spacious place."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"5+ stars across the board. The apartment is huge and gorgeous. Skylights provide tons of beautiful natural light (bring a sleep mask if you like to sleep in). Location is walking distance to everything- the beach, casino, bars, and some of Gulfport's best restaurants. Mia and her husband are welcoming, kind, gracious, and accommodating. Let Mia know if you have any issues and she will take care of it right away. And the value is great too- the same week-long stay at our usual hotel was charging $200 more. Great place, great location, great host, great value. Stay here, you'll love it."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and beautiful place! We were shocked at how nice the place was. Definitely will be back!

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Huge place with lots of space and light. Good size TVs in each room. Enjoyed our stay and will come back if in the area. Very clean. Mia was a great host. Loved being downtown, one block from The Half Shell Restaurant and several others. Close to other entertainment. Lots of storage space for luggage and bags."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great. Excellent location in downtown Gulfport and blocks away from marina & beach. Beautiful place. Very clean and sanitized. Very spacious. Walking distance to aquarium.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice & spacious apartment. Was also very clean
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a great space to stay with kids because there‚Äôs a lot of open space inside that kids can run around. The pizza place downstairs is fantastic and also the aquarium is within walking distance along with the beach. I would recommend families staying as well as singles. Again I loved it there was so much open space.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent communication. Quick and easy check in! Overall a really good location it is within 20 minutes of the casinos and other night life in Biloxi!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The neighborhood was adorable, and the home was impeccably clean, beautifully furnished and not too far from the beach. We had a fantastic time exploring the area and your home was the perfect base for our adventures. Looking forward to coming back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Blueberry Hills is a quintessential Southern beach oasis. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience. Check in was easy. Parking to unpack the car is literally steps from the door. The ocean view from the French doors, screened-in porch and pool area is beautiful. The home is tastefully decorated and has the tallest doors I have ever seen. Literally, if you are 7‚Äô8‚Äù, you‚Äôll have clearance. There was no extensive check out list or to do list for us to complete while we were there. The trash can was magically taken to the road on Monday morning and brought back up after the trash was hauled away. Ken even stopped by to check on our stay, but sadly, we weren't there. You can easily walk to the beach or the Discovery Center. It is in such a cute neighborhood and I felt totally at ease letting my children play in the yard. My only wish is there were summer dates available because this would be our go to rental. Thank you Ken and Tanya. We had a wonderful stay."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED this home. You can see the beach from the house and we enjoyed the heated pool. It had everything we needed including towels, fool floaties, toys, games, and lots of kitchen essentials. The home was super clean and beautiful. The home owner stopped by to help us learn how to heat the pool, showed us how to work the gas fireplace outside and even bought us pizza. One of the BEST airbnbs we have ever stayed in. Highly highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Will recommend this to anybody looking to get away and relax! We will be staying again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay!! The location is perfect. Highly recommend Felix‚Äôs restaurant which is within walking distance of the house. The house is so modern and clean. We will be back!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay! The house is on a quiet, beautiful street where you can see the beach across the Hwy. there‚Äôs lots to do within 1-3 miles of the place. We loved it here. This home is very beautiful has amazing craftsmanship (for those of you who appreciate that type of thing), and is very clean."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was awesome. Adding either a privacy blind or curtains would be great for the patio with the fireplace, because the house next door is close. But the house was AWESOME..."

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,My husband and our adult kids and their partners had a great time at the beach house. The house is beautiful and we had plenty of space for all 6 of us.

The owner was very responsive and immediately resolved a couple of small issues to ensure that we had a memorable vacation!!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was absolutely beautiful, clean, and located super close to the beach. It‚Äôs a short ride to the outlets and casinos. The best part for us was relaxing in the pool and they have extra beach towels in case you forget yours! Great stay and would definitely book again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! This place delivers everything that it promises and then some. It's in a great location and provides a welcome respite! On a side note, we had some minor TV streaming questions and the owner actually came over to answer them! Probably our #1 Airb&b experience. Bravo to Tanya and Kenneth! Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was exactly as pictured, the host was very accommodating! We really enjoyed it and will book again if we come back to the area. House has everything needed! Great customer service and good vibes through out ‚ù§Ô∏è"

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,If you want to enjoy yourself through reading or relaxing indoors or outdoors on patio or pool. It was all planned out with so much detail. You can curl up with a book or or wine down with a hot cup of tea. The coffee bar was excellent also. Spacious & beautiful inside & out.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Always a great stay at Shady Oaks. Plenty of room for family of six no stairs for the grandparents. Neighborhood quiet and close to everything. Able to ride the bikes and use the boogie boards at the beach. Enjoyed the firepit in the evenings. Easy to communicate with Jeremy and Katrina. Looking forward to our next stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Place to stay. Clean and comfortable. The bikes and wagon for the beach was a great plus
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed a relaxing getaway to the beach! We highly recommend it.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were very accommodating. I bombarded them with all types of questions and they answered them promptly. If they didn't have the answer, they did their best to put me in the right direction.
They mange very well the two properties where I stayed; first in Bay St Louis and then in Gulfport.
My trip was a short one, but I accomplished everything I have planned. I fell in love with the area and I expect to return."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little place. Jeremy and katrina were super responsive and were there if we needed anything, but fortunately we didnt. Very well stocked, updated very nicely. Will be trying other homes they offer as well!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Beautiful house probably one of the cleanest Airbnb we have stayed at. Walking distance to the beach and we loved the soaking tub. Newer appliances with a well stocked Kitchen. Great communication with Jeremy and Katrina
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent stay! We had the best time. Place was as described and pictured. Some highlights for us: master bath in the master bedroom was amazing, love the huge shower. The queen pull out couch is in a small front living room which is somewhat separate from other spaces and main living room so it feels really doable to use as a ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù space. Having laundry right in the main space. The beach cruiser bikes are so great. Having beach chairs, umbrella, beach toys and wagon to pull it all was really appreciated so we didn‚Äôt have to pack and travel with those. The beach is two blocks from the house. You do have to cross busy Hwy 90, but it‚Äôs very easy and doable, just watching closely the traffic. That section of the beach was so private, had very few people sharing it with us. Recommend going to local fresh fish market to get shrimp, etc to cook in the spacious kitchen! If we ever make it back to MS, would definitely stay again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family and I loved this home and neighborhood! Very clean home with comfortable sleeping quarters and lots of amenities! We will definitely be booking again! Thanks so much for sharing your home with us!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Home was beautiful. The kids and I enjoyed purses. We felt like we was home cause it was just that peaceful. Especially the fire pit we enjoyed that a-lot too
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Jeremy and Katrina‚Äôs Gulfport home was beautiful and in a great location. The house was clean and felt very welcoming. The only thing we would say is that more lighting in the backyard would definitely be awesome so guests could hang out in the back yard at night. We also enjoyed the beach since the home is so close. Will most definitely be coming back! Thanks so much!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Jeremy and Katrina‚Äôs place! The home was as described and pictured, but even nicer in person.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay at the house. I felt right at home and comfortable. The guidebook with recommendations was very helpful, especially this time of year (December) it helped to have the specific suggestions. I took a nice bike ride along the cost and a visit to the Mississippi Aquarium. The home had everything I needed and wanted. I loved the style as well. Communication was great during my stay. Thank you."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great communication with the host and in a great location. Very close proximity to the beaches and restaurants.

I am looking forward to staying here again and would most definitely recommend this listing to anyone who is looking for a home away from home feel ."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely a ""home away from home"" experience. From the moment we walked in, it was the most stress-free, and relaxed trip we've ever had. The icing on the cake was all of the little conveniences that are alreadyin the house - dishes, pots, baking sheets, etc. as well as the bits you accidentally forget to pack, such as dryer sheets or hair dryer stuff. We didn't find ourselves in need of anything like we usually do on trips. All of this on top of the literal handful of minutes to the beach walk and the very quiet and peaceful neighborhood surrounding Shady Oaks. Jeremy and Katrina were very friendly and proactive getting in touch with us to ensure we were good before we checked in, through our check out. This was our first AirBnB, and it couldn't have been better."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a cute place with a beach vibe. It was roomy and in a great location. I enjoyed drinking my tea in the backyard each morning while enjoying the view of the Gulf. We‚Äôd happily stay there again!

2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Shady Oaks was so perfect for our little weekend stay! The house is beautiful and very well kept. My friends and I all felt at home and comfortable all weekend!
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Safe place. It was my first time at b&b I felt comfortable there but there was a few things could have been fixed. Before we came. The sofa bed cannot be used to sleep on. I brought a Matt topper so I was able to have some comfort. I Wouldn‚Äôt even put kids on there. The toilet seat was broken and tilted. I just had a hip replacement and it was awkward to use. I don‚Äôt understand why there‚Äôs a cleaning fee of $100 it obviously wasn‚Äôt done before we stayed there. Plus I had to collect sheets and blankets and put them on top washer. Bring garbage to curb and load dishwasher. So what‚Äôs with the $100 fee. It should be something included in the price of rent. Location and safety was spot on. Parking was good to.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful and comfortable home. Very attentive hosts and very nice.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet peaceful place and matched the description on line.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What great hosts!! Jeremy and Katrina were fantastic and the place was super cute and cozy. You could sit outside and see the beach and enjoy a beautiful area. Walked and rode bikes to the beach several times just to enjoy the view even though it was December.
Everything was just a short drive and we were able to drop by the pop up markets in the local parks in Pass Christian and Long Beach.
If you go near the holidays, definitely visit the Gulfport Harbor Lights festival!!
We heartily recommend this place!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our 2nd time staying at this location and we had a great time. Seeing the beach from the backyard and being in walking distance is a plus! Home was clean and Jeremy and Katrina did everything to make the check in/out process as simple as possible. My only suggestion would be for blackout curtains in the Master bedroom to allow a little more rest while on vacation.
If you‚Äôre looking for a great place to take your family on a beach getaway, Jeremy and Katrina are great hosts!"

We definitely plan to book here in the future"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property was absolutely perfect. The house had everything we needed and could not have been more equipped than it was. They definitely thought of everything.
The location was great. Walking distance to the beach but far enough away from the chaos usually associated with a beach trip.

The best sand on a beach ever and great shallow water for exploring. The house was so well equipped we barely had to bring anything but clothes and food!

We also ventured east to Dauphin Island, also super quiet bc of cold weather - which was just fine with us.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a gorgeous spot. The hosts keep everything immaculate and are very personable. The street noise was a little annoying, but it wasn't enough to disrupt sleep. A small price to pay for near instant beach access and gorgeous surroundings hosted by amazing people!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Krista and Jordan‚Äôs place was stunningly decorated, immaculately clean and had every possible convenience.

Its a beautiful home , very clean and inviting . The hosts are awesome . Left us a welcome basket with snacks and beer for the hubby which he loved. A cute sign welcoming the family with our names . The kitchen has everything to cook full dinner I just brought a Turkey roster. They have lots of amenities shampoos and soaps , laundry detergent and lots of towels . All cleaning products kept at site which I love bc I can clean up while staying there . The upstairs room is beautiful with the best view! Only downside the jet tub doesn‚Äôt work which is disclosed before and there is no table for 4. There is seating outside for 4 but just a barrel so we could not eat together at a table but tray tables provided. Upstairs bed is like a dream . Elevator was a little iffy but worked for luggage and helpful . Porch views are gorgeous! We will be back"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a super lovely stay at The Nest!!! The home was perfectly appointed, and the views were breathtaking. It was a little loud from the traffic when sitting in the deck, but once you got to the beach, it was just ocean sounds. The master bed was ridiculously comfortable. I also loved the little seating area upstairs ‚Äî it was perfect to be able to knock out a bit of work. It‚Äôs a great area with lots to explore, I would definitely recommend!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We could walk out into the ocean for about 1/2 mile. Not clear water but excellent beach. The house was perfect, nice furniture and great appliances. The only ding is that it doesn‚Äôt have a table for four inside. Very welcoming and responsive hosts"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A really comfortable retreat, well stocked with plenty of kitchen and beach wares to bring family to the beach. Welcome basket was lovely.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at The Nest. The location was great. Lots close by or close enough to drive 30 min west or east to antique shops and unique dining. The house was very clean and had lots of wonderful hand picked touches by the owners to make our stay enjoyable! Beds were comfy and love the bedjet. Enjoyed drinks in the evening and coffee in the morning in the front porch to catch the sunrise/sunsets with Beautiful and unobstructed views. Lovely welcome basket. Close to house next door but still very private; never heard the neighbors. Enjoyed our stay very much.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Nest is an amazing find. Private but so close to everything. We enjoyed the sunsets and going over to the beach anytime we pleased. Most enjoying is the fire pit on the beach brings locals and passer-byes and is a perfect opportunity to meet up with fellow travelers.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful place with a great amenities
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a gorgeous little beach house. Great if you have kids because the beach is right across the road. The views are beautiful. The upstairs bed is like a cloud. Just wish the jacuzzi tub jets worked. I can 10/10 recommend.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We highly enjoyed our experience staying at this AirBNB. Probably one of my top three locations so far! They were very kind to leave us some goodies, there were frosted glasses in the freezer ready to go, the home was very nice and well kept. And the VIEW was amaaaazing."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home is absolutely beautiful! We did not want to leave. Beautifully decorated! It had everything you needed and more. It was very clean and organized. The hosts were great. I would absolutely stay again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,There was some mishaps ON OUR END BUT the owners are absolutely wonderful and I‚Äôm grateful. The house is beautiful please book. Beautiful location and house
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tucked away in a cozy corner with a unobstructed view of the ocean and beach this one is perfect. Well equipped home, comfortable beds, an awesome deck overlooking the ocean for morning coffee and evening wine. If your looking to just get away, this is it!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time here. We had a very nice welcome basket waiting for us. The view is Amazing. The highway is close but didn‚Äôt bother us really couldn‚Äôt hear it. We had no issues getting across the road to the beach. The house had everything we needed and never had any issues. Krista and Jordan have a very welcoming Home. We will definitely be back and highly recommend this home.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful beach house for a getaway!! We came to enjoy the casinos and the drive was easy back and forth. We enjoy our morning and evening adult drinks on the desk with a nice gulf breeze. The bedroom on main floor is a bit small but ok for a smaller couple or kids. House was stocked with everything you could need. The beach was right across the street and for a holiday weekend very quiet. The house's decor was amazing and thank you for all the goodie and drinks came in handle after a long night at the casino. Can't wait to book again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is perfect for a get away! The view of the beach is awesome, close to everything you will want to do! The house is very clean, Krista and Jordan are fabulous host. You will love this place!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Considering this place? BOOK IT NOW IT IS SO WORTH IT!!! The hosts are very accommodating and answered almost immediately. The home is beautiful and this is one of the few places that is actually ""steps"" to the beach!! We loved every single moment!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This location is perfect I will come back time and time again
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was nice in clean beautiful view. The restrictions made me feel like, I was on pins and needles. Such as , If you not upstairs turn the air off or if you not outside the car porch lights has to be cut off. Both of the jacuzzi don't work. I feel like if you paying top pay everything should be working. And Airbnb should be like just like a hotel but better. But overall I love the place just hate, I couldn't get in the jacuzzi. But we made sure that we left everything with good standards. As me being landlord, I wouldn't want no one to leave my home in bad conditions. But we still enjoyed ourselves and made the best of every moment. Thanks..."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was great, great location, all the amenities you need, and stunning. This house is not too far the restaurants or a Walmart. There is a busy street to cross to get to the beach but traffic isn‚Äôt too bad. Will definitely book this place again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,loved the nest and loved the beer our host left. We had an amazing time. Be sure to check out Ship Island!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful view & house! The hosts were responsive and even left snacks & wine that were much appreciated after a long day.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was beautiful and perfect for our needs. Very much a relaxing beach vibe to the home with amazing view of the gulf. Krista and Jordan made it very easy to get in and out and were responsive in communication. The only issue that caught us by surprise was the very heavy and constant traffic on the four lane highway between the house and the beach. It was quite noisy. But not much that can be done about that. Just know going in that it won‚Äôt be the blissful beach experience like most resorts offer. Other than that the house is exceptional.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Right above a busy highway and up on stilts so a little wiggly in the wind! New experience for a northerner! But, so cute and the kids loved building sand castles across the street! Owners left us beer and a basket of treats! So sweet! We loved Pass and Bay St. Louis. Kids loved Billups for dinner and Creole Creamery for icecream! Great house in a cool area!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great experience!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great communication and great house. Thanks!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This nest was the perfect house for a weekend visit with our son who is stationed at Keesler AFB. Krista and Jordan were always available with questions and really made our stay special. We were welcomed with a personalized sign and a welcome basket. The property was very clean and had all the essentials. The house is beautiful and looks exactly as presented in the pictures. As a military family we travel as much as we can to visit our children at their bases and it‚Äôs important for us to have a relaxing time to reconnect, the nest provided the space and allowed us to really take in the beauty of the beach. We look forward to staying again late this summer."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay, beautiful views, incredible retreat. One of my favorite air bnb experiences!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love this place! This was our second trip here and we hope to return. It‚Äôs cozy and clean with a fantastic view of the beach. We loved the front porch and the expansive master bedroom. This place has everything you need for a wonderful beach trip!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was awesome. We went just for a quick get away weekend but will definitely be planning a longer stay and looking forward to staying here again. Beautiful home, great spot, and excellent hosts!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful location wonderful set up for us! We enjoyed the stay very clean and well kept! Very good instructions easy directions to follow from the homeowners. We even received a gift as a bonus looking forward to coming back!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely great house for a relaxing weekend. View is great, private little area without a crowd. House extremely comfortable. Plenty of fans, AC and heating options. Host are outstanding at communicating and receiving questions. Thought we were going to spend lots of time in Biloxi but found we enjoyed gulf port and bay of Saint Louis more except for casino. Take the host advice on food! FYI Walmart is about 2 min away to the west! No need to go to town."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for the beach! We had so much fun at the Mardi Gras parade! Nearby Ocean Springs is a must. Thanks Krista and Jordan!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest was a perfect home base for myself, my husband, and our two teens to spend the last week of our winter break!
In general, The Nest was very clean and had modern updates throughout the entire home. We most enjoyed how incredibly close we were to the beach and that it was centrally located for fun day trips to Biloxi and New Orleans. It was also nice to have off-street parking, comfy beds and couches, bath tubs, a plethora of towels, extra toiletries, and a well equipped kitchen. We also appreciated how thoughtful the hosts were with a welcome message, basket of snacks, and adult refreshments.
Long Beach itself did not disappoint (nor did its neighboring beach towns), and we were incredibly lucky to have near-80¬∞ temps in late December. The beach here has lovely, soft white sand, and the section right in front of the house was almost always quiet. It is quite shallow, but we enjoyed all the bird watching and exploring that the sand bars created. The sunrises and sunsets were great. Highway 90 is quite busy, but it was not a big deal for us to load the car and take it to parking right across the street for an easy trip.
We would definitely come back and stay again!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest was clean and had all the amenities for my family and I to enjoy. The panoramic views of the ocean was breathtaking! There is plenty of nice patio furniture to enjoy the view all day long, if you choose. We used the cargo elevator for our luggage, extremely helpful, versus carrying our luggage up the stairs. The hosts were fabulous responding to our requests. We enjoyed the welcome basket, nice touch, when arriving at the destination after driving 8 hours.
Thank you Krista and Jordan for allowing us to stay at The Nest! We had a wonderful time! Be well, stay safe."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wow! The Nest is incredible! We had a fantastic experience and recommend highly! Krista & Jordan made us feel so at home in their beautiful beach house. The house is pristine and the beds are so comfortable. We look forward to returning in the future for a longer vacation.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful home, great hosts. We will be back for sure"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The views were amazing! This ‚Äúnest‚Äù was so clean and beautifully decorated and had everything we needed. The kitchen was stocked with every small appliance and kitchen gadgets for cooking. They even left us a welcome basket with wine, muffin mixes and some snacks. Check in was a breeze! Right next to the water. The only downside is the sound of the cars passing on Hwy 90, but wasn‚Äôt terrible. Highly recommend this amazing beach house and we would definitely stay here again!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our relaxing trip to Long Beach. This was a perfect location to watch the sunsets and sunrises! The views were breathtaking from the porch and first and second floors. Also, the access to the beach was so great and the decor was very modern. Everything was perfect! We will definitely be back!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We rented this property for our honeymoon weekend getaway. We do not enough words to describe our wonderful experience! The home was exactly as presented, located in a quiet area, and just a short drive to Bay St Louis, Gulfport, and Biloxi. The owners are super sweet and very responsive to messages. We have already recommended The Nest to friends and will definitely return!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place is even better than I was hoping it to be! 100% would recommend it!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My mother, sister and I so enjoyed our stay!!! Sister stated ‚Äúthe most hospitable place ever!‚Äù Location, views, and home were flawless, the special touches were incredible. I cannot recommend this gem enough!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Host communications was amazing. Property is as shown on the listing. We throughly enjoyed our stay.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved this property! The house is beautiful and inviting with everything we needed. We enjoyed the host's special touches and nice beach views from the porch. It was a short walk to the beach and quick drive to local restaurants-not far from Gulfport. We will definitely stay here again if we come back to Long Beach.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lots of close by restaurants and bars and check out Bankhouse coffee for a long walk or quick drive.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Nest is a wonderful getaway for a couple or a few friends. Everything you could want in a house at the beach and the hosts are superb. We will do this as a repeat.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Nest was a wonderful place to stay! Steps from the beach and the place was very clean and well stocked. The personal touches left by the host were unique and very considerate! We loved our few days there and would highly recommend!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My kids and I loved our stay at the nest! The house was clean and beautiful. The views were great and we loved that we could just walk across the street to the beach, which was not crowded at all. The upstairs bed was the most comfortable bed I‚Äôve ever slept on. The kitchen has everything you need, although we ate out most of the time. Shaggy‚Äôs and Billups were our favorite restaurants. I would highly recommend staying at the nest!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house, the endless breeze on the patio was my favorite part. Warning though: Long Beach is majority white, got some weird looks in the food establishments, but I love that I make them uncomfortable while not doing anything. The house is amazing, 10:10. Hosts were very helpful."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Information in the listing was accurate, we enjoyed our stay. Electricity took out their router and we didn‚Äôt have WiFi for a couple of days but Jordan was able to get a tech out there and replace it. It wasn‚Äôt too much of a deal since we spent most of our time outside. Jordan was decently fast to respond and was respectful of our time and privacy. We loved the bedroom upstairs and the bed was comfy. We had never been to the gulf coast in MS and were a little disappointed with the beach (we‚Äôve been used to beaches in Florida so it‚Äôs hard to compare.) the beaches in Gulfport just don‚Äôt feel or look all that clean. That is obviously not at the fault of the owners. The area felt kind of deserted (mid-July) with not a lot of people in the area. We didn‚Äôt really find a lot of places where we enjoyed the food. Please don‚Äôt let what I said prevent you from booking if you just need something private. it truly is a nice location and wonderful to wake up to in the morning. We drove to Dolphine Island, AL for a day which was only 1.5 hours away. The owners provided a nice gift of snacks and wine. If you do go, you just check out the Pop Brothers for dessert. We met the owner and it was fantastic, we went multiple times during our stay."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing property, very clean, great location, very welcoming, it was also very well stocked with food and a welcome basket, as well as a welcome sign as we had asked in. I had an amazing stay and will definitely book again if given the chance!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. Exactly like the pictures. Can‚Äôt wait to stay here again!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Way better then booking a hotel room
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great. The house is literally across the street from the gulf. the house was super clean. The kitchen was fully stocked for cooking. The living space was spacious and comfortable.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home! Easy access to beach and activities!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time in Long Beach and the Gulfport area. The house was clean and exactly what we expected. The restaurants were great and the people very friendly.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I completely enjoyed our stay here. The house was spotless, and we enjoyed the privacy as well. They had a customized sign and welcome basket waiting on us. They have clear instructions on how to check in and responded really quick to my messages. The bed was amazing! It was soft and inviting plus it has a bedjet and that was wonderful in itself. This will definitely be our go to vacation spot whenever it‚Äôs available! Go ahead and book a week or two because I promise you aren‚Äôt going to want to leave."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled here for a week-long friend getaway and absolutely loved it. The house was extremely clean, comfortable, well taken care of, and had a great location. We were always within a 5-10 minute drive of a lot of different bars, restaurants, etc., which all had very good food and drinks. The hosts had great communication, the check in was easy, and they even left us a nice welcome package on our first day. We loved everything about this house and would definitely stay here again.
I'll also say that the house is right on a major road across from the beach, so the traffic could get a bit loud during busy times. It was definitely manageable, however, and worth it given the proximity to the beach."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house is perfect for a relaxing get away! very well stocked with what you would need to have a great vacation and awesome views and location!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great home! Very comfortable beds, lovely amenities (well-stocked kitchen, grill, bikes, etc), and lots of views. Hosts were very kind and prompt at answering questions."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful home right across the street from the beach. House is fully stocked with all you need. Krista and Jordan were great to communicate promptly. Thanks!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful facilities, great beach view and private location with proximity to everything you could need. The home was beautiful, the beds were amazingly comfortable and there were really nice touches. I wish that the jets in the tub were available during my stay, that the grill was on the deck (as pictured) and that there was some kind of binder with instructions for lighting or other need-to-know information. Nice thoughtful touches such as a welcome basket with a personalized note were lovely. The tvs were nice (with the exception of the bedroom tv that did not work as expected). Overall, my family and I would recommend The Nest to anyone looking to get away and enjoy a relaxing getaway! Thank you to the gracious hosts Krista & Jordan!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great hosts and location and views can‚Äôt be beat!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. Definitely worth it. The location is right across from the beach and you can sit in the living room and watch the water. The only thing we will change when we return is to go when it is warmer although we had a great time with it being super chilly.
2021-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"While this house might be amazing in the ‚Äúin‚Äù season. It was not great in the ‚Äúoff‚Äù season - and not cheap. Things didn't work. We couldn't check in until it was already nearly sun-down for a 1 night birthday. And we were asked to do laundry and dishes when there was a $150 cleaning fee. Bikes were out of order, whirlpool tub out of order. It was like visiting a hotel no longer in its prime."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful home with great views of the beach. It‚Äôs cozy, welcoming and has everything you need. The master bedroom is luxurious, especially with the beautiful ocean views and gorgeous sitting area. The master bed is incredibly comfortable too. Plus, the porch is very spacious and a great place to enjoy the beach even when it‚Äôs rainy. The hosts are helpful and welcoming, too: they left snacks and drinks in the kitchen for us, which what‚Äôs a very thoughtful touch. Highly recommend!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. We love it so much we added another night. Thank You Krista and Jordan. We enjoyed our getaway.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Right on the water in a less crowded spot but still a close drive to many restaurants/landmarks
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was awesome! It has a beautiful view of the beach! The host was great!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great house, wonderful views and great location. Clean with all amenities. Couldn‚Äôt ask for anything better."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay. Lots of meaningful little touches and great amenities. Definitely worth it!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We rented The Nest to have a nice escape from our home for a few days with the kids. The views from this home are superb and very relaxing energy. It was exactly what we needed and was even able to go into New Orleans for one of the days!
Krista and Jordan made us feel at home and even got us some beer and snacks."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect. The house was very warm and welcoming. Can‚Äôt beat walking across the street to the beach. Communication was great. All the amenities of home. Would recommend!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised, enjoyable experience all around"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house right on the water. Great location. We had a great time! The traffic is a bit loud.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice stay. Was worried when Zeta hit and tore up the coast. But by the day before we were to arrive the power came on. WIFI never came back on due to power outages but we used our Verizon hotspots and I had our Apple TV with us, so were fine. Great sunsets. Great walks on the beach. One of the most comfortable beds ever. Kitchen had everything you would need.
."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend staying at property. We will be back again for sure.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place!
Like so many others we had to change plans for our daughters wedding due to Covid. Our now son-in law was not able to travel due to military restrictions. So Instead of a big wedding in Virginia, we had a very small (6 guests) celebration here. It was amazing. The Nest was the perfect intimate spot! Instead of a fancy rehearsal dinner we enjoyed a fire in the beach. The spacious master bedroom and bath was spa like for the bride to get ready. The views of the beach in the background were perfect for the ceremony!! The photos of the sun setting could not have been more beautiful!
Thank you Krista & Jordan! You helped us transform a disappointing and stressful time to joy and happiness!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Right on the water so you have great views from nice patio. Krista and Jordan were delightful hosts and thought of everything - kitchen was well stocked and lovely to prepare meals watching the sunsets. Master bedroom is a large en-suite with nice sitting area.
I will be back."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This house is exactly what you see in the pictures! Gorgeous, very clean, extremely well stocked, and you couldn‚Äôt ask for a better location! I will stay here again and will recommend to all of my friends!
I only have one con and I would recommend that if you are a light sleeper that you bring ear plugs. This house is literally on route 90 and the route is a highly traveled route 24/7. There are a lot of very loud trucks and vehicles day and night! Especially on Friday and Saturday nights. I think the youth in the area use it for drag racing because we were awaken several times with loud roaring motors at high rate of speed late at night.
I feel the house itself it worth tolerating this one annoyance."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible location, easy access to beach."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Nest is a perfect place to stay overlooking the Gulf. We loved the beach house and will definitely put this on our list of favorites. The host was so thoughtful and left a bottle of wine for us. The decor is so cute and it is wonderfully located. The outside deck is the perfect place to watch the sun rise and the afternoon sunset. Long Beach is one of the quieter areas on the MS Gulf Coast. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for the perfect beach getaway. The communication and nice little touches from the host were great!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's a beautiful place! The location is perfect; far enough away where you'll have the beach to yourselves but close enough to have some restaurant choices. It's just a mile from Walmart and there's some nice patios just a couple minute drive to Gulfport.
The view is incredible! We enjoyed sitting on the deck and just watching the Gulf. Add in a couple beach bikes, chairs, and BBQ, and we had everything we needed.
Communication with the hosts was great as well. They immediately answered all our questions and had some great recommendations. They had a little welcome message for us as well as some thoughtful snacks.
We highly recommend The Nest. If you're headed to the beach, stay here. It's a great setup and wonderful hosts."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,House was very clean and view is awesome
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a WONDERFUL time and the views could not be beat. The house is right off a main road so it was easy to get to different places to pick up food or go out to eat. Even with COVID, everywhere was open and we were able to eat some delicious southern food. They welcomed us with a goodie basket which was a super sweet touch. It rained half the time we were there, but it still was an exceptional stay because the house was so great and the views were wonderful. The elevator is extremely handy when packing in and packing out. We walked over to the beach every single day with our 6 month old and 1.5 year old. The sand is SO powder soft and despite the water not being crystal clear, it was still really clean and nice to play in! It was also really shallow so my daughter could play safely. The upstairs view from the bedroom was so dreamy and the shower pressure was EXCELLENT! Book this unique and beautiful stay and you won't regret it!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay !! House is so tastefully decorated with over and above comforts !

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about the Nest is perfect. The location, the view, the furniture, the quality of the details are top notch. Worth every penny! You can expect all the amenities of an expensive lake front property, but with a view of the sunrise, the ocean, and the white sand. Amazing!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we had so much fun here!! the views from the bedroom were incredible as well as the deck! it was rainy and cloudy the weekend of our trip but the house made up for it for sure! we tried one of the restaurantes suggested by the host, The Rackhouse, and it was delicious!! we would definitely come back!"

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fianc√© and I travelled to Long Beach to get married on the beach in front of family. Y‚Äôall this place was wonderful. Krista and Jordan were so professional and dependent. The Nest is a MUST! We loved every second of it and the views are AMAZING. You are close to everything you need and delicious restaurants. We enjoyed drinking coffee in the morning on the porch and having a cold beer in the evening. We will be coming back in the future! If anyone gets lucky and this place isn‚Äôt booked, don‚Äôt second guess it, DO IT!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable space with amazing views of the Gulf! Homeowners were very responsive to messages and we truly enjoyed our stay. We hope to bring our daughters back someday!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful views and ocean hues‚Äîthis place will have you feeling the beach vibes! It really does make you feel like you‚Äôre in a cozy nest perched high above the hustle. We loved this house! Well-appointed kitchen so we cooked a lot, but there are great restaurants everywhere. We tried Darwell‚Äôs and LOVED it. We used Krista and Jordan‚Äôs bikes to ride down through Pass Christian and all the gorgeous seaside homes. Just a really great location. One last thing, we had never tried a bed jet before and it was so life-changing. We ordered one immediately! Worth the price of admission. This place is great. Book now and have zero worries."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Nest is the perfect place for the perfect beach getaway. It had every amenity you could ask for to make your stay exceptional. We will be back for sure!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is üíØüíØüíØ!! Great beach front property, clean, quick responses from Krista & Jordan. House had a lot of GREAT amenities, perfect for a get away or family vacation! We ended up staying an extra night we loved it so much!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay right across from the beach. Beautiful views await you from the house. Very clean and well thought out amenities make this one of my favorite stays yet!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest is incredible! Great location and views! Very clean. And Krista & John are so easy to work with, very communicative. Would highly recommend!"

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest is Awesome, Truly a 10 of 10, I have been doing AirBnb for a while now and this is ONE OF THE BEST EVER !! Krista and Jordan are some of the best Host's ever, I had a couple of Special requests for my wife and they were Amazing with my request's . I would HIGHLY rate ""THE NEST"" as a place to stay, and We will be back !!!! 100 % 10 STARS ++++"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little beach front house that is tastefully decorated and furnished. Incredible views of the gulf with spectacular sunrise and sunsets. The bed in the master suite was very comfortable and the view from the sitting area is a great place to enjoy your morning coffee. The hosts are friendly and helpful and helped make our weekend enjoyable. My only complaint is we couldn‚Äôt spend more time at the nest.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This quaint cottage has everything you need in a great location. There is a beach fire pit across the street that you can get a permit from the town, and it is amazing to wake up to that view. The master had a bedjet which is an amazing thing - helped us stay cool and/or warm at night without turning the AC on. Very nice touches, stylish, comfortable, and just an amazing place to stay. Highly recommend from the wine glasses / champagne - to the coffee options."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We actually are locals and we loved staying at the nest for our anniversary getaway. A perfect romantic place with amazing views of the beach and sunset. Even though it was cold, there were plenty of cozy blankets and hot chocolate awaiting us! The host offered us wine options and allowed my husband to bring gifts up early as a surprise when we arrived! It was a PERFECT anniversary staycation!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home looks exactly like the pictures. It‚Äôs very clean and stylish. Krista was very attentive and responsive.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our favorite thing by far was the views of sunrise/sunset over the water. Relaxing in front of the picture window oohing and aahing over the scale of colors was just what we were hoping for. Bed was comfortable and my mother enjoyed the bed jet tremendously. That was a fun surprise. Would definitely stay again. Thanks Krista!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Best place on the Mississippi Gulf!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Quaint, modern, home-felt and inviting. The NEST is as advertised. Book with confidence. The Marshall's of Central Virginia"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristas place was awesome. Great location, updated decor that both embraces the beach and comfort! Loved the patio but the road was a bit noisy for a quiet night by the beach. Easy to access from any direction. Amenities were high end (linens, kitchenware, welcome package). Wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay here again. Loved it. Truly relaxing spot."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. Extremely close to the beach and close to restaurants, grocery stores, and other amenities. Fantastic balcony! Would definitely stay again!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely place. You can not get any closer to the beach. Downtown is a walkable distance if you are used to walking. We had a great time and the house was beautiful. The bedroom upstairs is large with an on suite bathroom. The bedroom downstairs is much smaller. The kitchen and living room were wonderful for entertaining. The lift is a great amenity!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay! If you‚Äôre looking for a deck to overlook water where you can sit and read a good book ‚Äî this is the place. Owner provided personal touches like wine, wine glasses, and fresh flowers in several rooms. Awesome view from the master bedroom too. Nice clean place! Close drive to restaurants. I would recommend staying here."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Home. This house has a great balcony overlooking the beach. Its super comfy on the inside. There's an open kitchen and living area and lots of windows upstairs and down also overlooking the beach. The upstairs bedroom has a full master suite and includes a sitting area with large windows and another great beach view. The house is well decorated. It was perfect for my wife and I and two children. We plan to return and can certainly recommend this place to others.
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place could not have been any more perfect! I had been looking for over a year on how to propose to my girlfriend. Trinity was an amazing host. I literally could‚Äôve lived on the porch with the ocean breeze and the view. This is definitely a place to go stay and enjoy a relaxing time.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed the area shopping and eateries. This was a wonderful home with a great view. I was really impressed by the time and care the host took to put fresh flowers in every room!

2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great - close to restaurants and Walmart if you forgot to bring anything. Huge plus that Uber is in the area. Kitchen was well stocked and as described. Great for a small group or family.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved staying at this place!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was such a great space. Very functional (and beautiful!) for us and our young children. We spent most of the days digging in the sand and enjoying the view. Will definitely be back!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is AMAZING!! It is probably the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. It is equipped with everything you need. The beach is a short walk about 3-5 minutes. The location is perfect and close to lots of different things. The house was super clean and everything was wonderful. The owners we quick to respond to all my questions and so nice. We will definitely be staying here again. Highly recommend to anyone traveling to the area.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was so much bigger than expected:) the house is perfectly situated 5 min walk from the beach! Perfect location close to downtown and also Biloxi and Long Beach..the amenities and extras are so convenient and thoughtful from the bikes for a nice ride to the washer and dryer..would definitely recommend for a family stay or a weekend getaway:)
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House is decorated like HGTV! Amazing touches to make your stay great‚Äî beach items, bikes, outdoor chairs, coffee station, etc. Was nervous about bringing young kids anywhere during pandemic; this provided a getaway while staying away from the masses! Will be back for sure!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The photos in the listing are lovely, but in person the house is a lot more roomy than it appears. It is extremely comfortable and allows for an extra guest or two to have plenty of personal space. The location was great- -we loved being further away from the busy traffic zones toward Biloxi which also made it easier to cross over to the beach. Whether traveling to Ocean Springs or taking a drive to Long Beach, Pass Christian, or Bay St. Louis, the house is located centrally to all. The green space next to the house (along with the cool breezes) made it so relaxing just to hang out. We cooked most of our meals at the house and can say that the kitchen is very well stocked with supplies. The owners have thought of everything-even bikes to ride! You will not be disappointed!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a must stay in Gulfport. You will not find a more perfect place...spot for your vacation. Jeremy and Katrina are excellent hosts. They were very accommodating to our needs in such a short time. Will definitely be back.
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This adorable beach house is exactly as advertised! Clean, well appointed, comfortable and relaxing! Close to beautiful, not crowded beaches, a splash park for the kids, restaurants and grocery stores, and more! My only regret is that I had to leave! Definitely book this beach house if you are looking for a wonderful getaway!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Love this beach cottage! Darling inside...commons areas are bigger than they look in pictures.

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeremy & Katrina were amazing hosts! They were prompt at responding to any messages, questions or concerns. They were super friendly and even got us checked in early when we arrived ahead of schedule! The house was very spacious and absolutely BEAUTIFUL! There were so many amenities and personal touches. We were steps away from the beach with beautiful views, yet not right on the highway. We had an absolutely amazing time and will definitely be going back and booking with them again. I would recommend this location and these hosts to anyone ten times over - if you're looking and it's available, book it NOW! You'll be glad you did!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We would recommend this home to everyone!! Very clean and cozy
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The accommodations: This place was perfect! It is only two blocks from the beach and you can see the ocean from the property. The home is beautifully decorated and had every comfort we could ask for. This place would be perfect for a weekend get-away or for a month-long retreat. We stayed for a week and I was able to dial into every meeting and never had the internet drop.
The natural beauty: The beach has soft, white sand. We watched pelicans and other sea bird diving into the ocean. We watched fish jumping out of water during the day. At night, we watched schools of smaller fish jump in response to a flashlight. We saw an armadillo walking down the street. Also, there are the most amazing sprawling old trees on and near the property.
The hosts: Jeremy and Katrina were very prompt and polite in every communication. I would definitely rent from them again."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I came to the beach to heal from our 24-year-old son's death from Stage 4 colon cancer last year. We chose the perfect spot. Very private. Lovely neighborhood and host. Didn't have a full kitchen but had a nice size refrigerator and microwave...we had everything we needed and more. The walk to the beach was only minutes. The birds and squirrels in the courtyard were charming. Felt refreshed by the surroundings and the beach. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Lisa!! -the peters"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We wanted a place for the two of us and our small dog that had outdoor
space to enjoy when we were not at the beach or out to eat
Lisa's place was perfect. This was our first trip to Gulfport and we were delighted with the beautiful white sand beach. We enjoyed driving down Beach Blvd and being able to see the water on one side and the beautiful homes on the other side. The Roku had to be replaced when we were there which Lisa and Rachel took care of quickly. Rachel left us some homemade chocolate chip cookies when she replaced it. Yummy üòã They went above and beyond to take care of us. We will be back. Oh, the sidewalks were perfect for me to walk with our dog in the neighborhood and by the beach."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay in Gulfport! We were traveling for a soccer tournament but between games, we enjoyed walking right out our door to the beach. Great location for relaxation and/or exercise. We did both! Walkers, cyclists, and kayakers this is a great spot! Great restaurants all around. The house was perfectly cleaned and ready for us. We felt very comfortable, safe, and at ease during our stay. Very roomy spaces with everything we could need and a beautiful, private outside area as well. Perfect location and Lisa was the perfect host! My husband and I passed along the rental info to several other families on our daughter‚Äôs team and also hope to come back for the two of us to explore and enjoy the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Highly recommend!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lisa's place was great. Very clean and comfortable. Wish we could have stayed longer but we were just passing through on our way home.

We had a great stay at Sea La Vie, and look forward to returning there in the future!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sea la Vie is absolutely gorgeous from the gated courtyard right through to the comfortably furnished great room. Being one block from the Gulf of Mexico, it made all my dreams of fun in the sun come true. The bed was very comfortable with wonderful linens. Cold water in the refrigerator and coffee pods for easy brewing made life just a whole lot better. It was my first experience with the computerized lock on the door, but once I figured out red meant stop and green meant go, we were in business. Lisa was the perfect host and checked all the boxes to make our stay so enjoyable. Truth be told, I'll be back."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lisa was a great house. Make sure I had everything I needed. Hospitality and communication was superb. The place was immaculate and a peaceful spot to stay for rest and relaxation or do some study work.

Clean, nice character, very safe for solo traveler, and appreciated being able to have my pup there (lovely dog-friendly fenced yard/garden. ) Was a one night stay-drive through, so limited kitchen not a problem at all (small fridge/micro, snacks were appreciated). Definitely would stay again. Recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Lisa was extremely helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's place was a quick walk to the beach and clean and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and we had all the comforts of home away from home. Location was great, short drive to downtown Gulfport and to Biloxi. Enjoyed a run every morning along the boardwalk which was less than a block from Lisa's place. Will definitely stay here again when in the area."

The space is so comfortable! I was very impressed with how clean everything was. The basket of snacks was a very nice touch. The bed was very comfy! Lisa was very helpful, kind, and communicated great! This was a short trip, but we definitely plan to return soon for a longer stay and take advantage of the beach being across street!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lisa was so nice & answered any questions we had. She also opened up her guest home to us & it was so nice. She was very attentive to our needs & she let us know if anything was going on.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Pictures do not do this adorable place justice. You can see the ocean from Lisa‚Äôs driveway. It‚Äôs located in a safe and quiet neighborhood. The decor is all very tasteful.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the PERFECT rental for my dog and me! Cozy, quiet and relaxing. Would love to return one day!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lisa's place is very quaint and affordable. If you are looking for a one-bedroom short-term rental extremely close to the beach, this is the one! This place has a very secure and peaceful feel, and is close to all of the coastal attractions. Lisa even helps you be prepared for some train noise by supplying a box fan."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa‚Äôs place is awesome! Soooo close to the ocean! Very clean, bed was comfortable, huge TV, desk if you need to work like I did- tall ceilings so seems very spacious! Love the August with digital key access! Plan on staying here again!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you to Lisa for all the special touches in your lovely beach home. I enjoyed your books and comfortable bed very much. The location is perfect for a beach gal like me. My dog loved it and really enjoyed walks on the beach. He even loved walks around the neighborhood. Beautiful location.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay for a weekend getaway for my husband and I. Private and peaceful. The place was clean and smelled wonderful! Lisa provided thorough and clear instructions on access which made it easy upon arrival and there were no issues for the duration of our stay. Highly recommend.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is perfect if your going to an event at the coliseum. Much nicer and more private than a hotel stay would be. Very clean and quiet. Will definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sea La Vie is a very clean, private, well-furnished, well air-conditioned dwelling with super-easy parking. It‚Äôs one block away from the Mississippi Sound which has beautiful sand and warm, calm water. The sound is so shallow, in fact, that the fist 200 yards from shore are like a kiddy pool- no exaggeration! You have to sit down to get your belly wet. Though I loved the sun, sand, and water, there isn‚Äôt much of a beach culture- probably due to the lack of surf. Moreover, restaurants are a bit spread apart, and the wooden piers remain closed from storm-damage. However, the approachability of the beach (lots of free parking) is second to none, and the paved beachside trail made jogging very desirable. It‚Äôs a 1.5 mile jog to downtown Gulfport and the brand new Mississippi Aquarium."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful home. Great value and a top tier Airbnb experience! Well worth the stay if you‚Äôre visiting the Gulfport area!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If I said it once, I said it 20 times...this place is so cute and so clean! We are so glad we found Lisa's Cozy Sea La Vie! We only had the pleasure of staying one night but are so glad we did! Lisa was wonderful to communicate with! She helped us find a place for dinner, Half Shell Oyster House, which was about 5 minutes down the road. We slept so comfortably! She even has a box fan for guests, which is so awesome for those of us who use one every night! The beach is less than a 5 minute walk. Everything was just as described and just lovely! I would highly recommend Lisa's Cozy Sea La Vie! I just have to say it again, it is so clean and welcoming! Thank you, Lisa!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa‚Äôs place was very cozy, and on a nice private road.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an overnight stay for us and our little pup, on our way to the beach in Florida. I can‚Äôt say it enough about how pleasant, clean, and beautiful this little cottage was! We were absolutely blown away! This was our first time ever to try an airbnb, we usually stay at a motel in Gulfport‚Ä¶but if they are all like Lisa‚Äôs it will be our last time! Loved it! Great job Lisa!"

Nicely updated 1 bedroom unit that had everything you needed; nice decor & very clean! If/when we come to Gulfport again, we will stay here & highly recommend this unit -perfect for a couple. Lisa provided timely & great instructions that made it easy to check-in & out. Thank you Lisa!"

Mrs. Lisa was very responsive and getting into the place was very easy with the app. Her instructions were very clear and worked like a charm!
The walk to the beach was short, and the sunsets were amazing! There was NO ONE on the beach the 3 days we spent there.
Mrs. Lisa was also very helpful with activities and places to visit for entertainment.
If you guys are looking for a weekend getaway, this is the place for you!! Will absolutely be visiting again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was a short walk to the beach. Super quiet neighborhood and everyone was very friendly. I have recommended this place to friends. My two dogs enjoyed it. We will book this place anytime we are in Gulfport.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lisa's home in Gulfport is a great location to relax and get away for the weekend on the Mississippi coast. We felt like we had a private beach for most of the weekend. We were the only ones on the beach most of the day because there are no hotels nearby. Lisa was great in delivering any check-in or check-out instructions and was responsive if I had any questions. 10/10 stay
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"You couldn't ask for a nicer, more helpful host! And the room is just perfect for two! so peaceful, the courtyard was serene, and just a block from the beach!!! wish we could have stayed a week!!! Would stay again in a heartbeat! ‚ù§"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I loved our stay! The place was so cute and the cleanest air bnb I‚Äôve stayed in.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cottage was incredibly adorable and the furnishings were nice, the bed was awesome and there were plenty of amenities and supplies. Being a block away from the beach makes this spot highly desirable. We loved just walking around the neighborhood in the evening and felt very safe. I would recommend this spot a 10 out of 10. We would definitely stay here again if we hadn‚Äôt just bought a house il the road, but we‚Äôll definitely recommend for our friends and family when they come down"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I couldn‚Äôt believe how close we were to the beach. It‚Äôs right there. My two toddlers and I could easily take a stroll to the beach whenever we wanted. We loved the back patio too. My little ones rode the little carts around every free chance they got. And the bed was super comfy. Lisa went above and beyond.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,1 block from the beach super quiet and peaceful

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I made a very last-minute request to stay at Lisa's place, as I needed to get away from New Orleans for a few days, and she quickly obliged! I brought my 8-year-old golden retriever with me, who absolutely loved lying in the yard and running on the beach. We took walks along the path each day. There are some restaurants nearby - you could certainly walk to them. I chose to drive just because I was by myself and it was super hot outside. There is a small grocery store just down the road, the Gulf Islands Waterpark, and the Aquarium - all within 2 miles. Parking was easy and safe. And the neighborhood was absolutely lovely, quiet, and safe too! Whenever I need a few days away from New Orleans, I will certainly check to see if Lisa's is available!"

I‚Äôm so happy I chose this place. I was only here one night but it was perfect.
No kitchen so take note of that. But it was perfect for my needs.
Lovely area outside to enjoy and plenty of space inside to relax as well.
Beautiful neighborhood. I highly suggest walking around!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly what we were looking for. Perfect for myself, my wife and our small dog. Enjoyed the privacy and the living room area. The private yard made it perfect to take out our dog. The bed was very comfortable and having the refrigerator came in handy.
Really appreciated all the small details like the coffee pods/cups, plates and utensils, travel size toothpaste(which we forgot to pack)and the linens smelled great.
Definitely recommend !"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I wanted a short get away for our first anniversary. Sea La Vie place was perfect for this! Lisa was an amazing host. There were so many personal touches in her space. It was so clean and it was more spacious than I assumed from the picture. The neighborhood was quiet and felt extremely safe. The patio was so beautiful and only steps from the gulf!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was everything i expected , Shawn and Cindy were very responsive. I will definitely be back to visit !!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. Cindy and Shawn sent multiple notes..Only point and has zero to do with place is the beach or specifically the water did not appear to be swimmable.. this is zero on Sean and Cindy and easy to drive a couple of miles further into Gulfport. Great place for two couples . Would text again
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Place was beautiful and immaculate. Owners were responsive and helpful.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was very nice and cozy. Has a nice home feel. Would recommend and will be returning in the future.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot, highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is beautiful and is as new. It is well furnished throughout. Interior design/decor is nautical as you might expect for its location. Everything was very clean.
A fair number of steps to reach the interior of this home which is two levels. Parking and storage is under this home. Parking was very tight for my 4-door dual rear wheel truck but standard autos/SUVs should be no problem.
I requested to extend my stay by one day which was promptly acknowledged and approved by the hosts.
I was very satisfied with my stay and will consider this home if back in Gulfport again.
Thank you Shawn & Cindy‚Ä¶"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shawn & Cindy's Seaside Sanctuary was exactly what we were looking for (i.e., private, beach view, very clean (seemed brand new), reasonable cost, and everything was easy (e.g., communication, access, recommendations, etc.). We won at the casino, the meals / restaurants we're very good, everyone we met (e.g., liquor store guy, post office lady, wait staff, etc.) were super friendly. The place is built on stilts... so be prepared to go up & down stairs with luggage, groceries, etc. Also, having eye-covers to sleep in darkness was helpful.
Totally unrelated to Shawn & Cindy and Seaside Sanctuary... we felt we were targets of a pickpocket scheme by a woman-man team at the Island View Casino blackjack table (i.e., zip up & secure your purse & be wary of overly friendly / advice giving person [i.e., the woman] with her partner [i.e., the guy] lurking in wait at a nearby slot machine).
The accommodations were perfect & we had a wonderful time! R&G"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing views of the gulf from both decks! Loved the house and minutes from great food and all the fun of Gulfport and Biloxi.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the house and location. Shawn & Cindy were great to work with. We look forward to coming back!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful. The beds were comfortable with a well appointed kitchen and beautifully decorated.
Be aware that there are 50 steps - 32 to the first floor and 18 to the second floor.
We loved getting the exercise but just overlooked it when booking. We would do it again!!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a last minute road trip for some rest & relaxation. You cannot beat the view & it really is steps to the water. The home is lovely & has everything you could possibly need with great restaurants close by. Town was decorated for Mardi Gras which we didn't expect but was so fun to see!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shawn and Cindy were excellent hosts. Always responsive if needed and even shipped back a ring I left. The place is clean and they have thought of all the little things to make it a perfect stay.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,beautiful water views to see and gorgeous sunsets. unobstructed water views from all levels
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great find.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house with stunning views. The house was clean and well appointed. Shawn and Cindy were excellent hosts.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Mississippi Gulf Coast from Pass Christian to Biloxi is a treasure of pristine beaches, great seafood restaurants, interesting shops, picturesque harbors, casinos (mainly in Biloxi) and even a historic site (Beauvoir--Jefferson Davis' last home). We stayed in a home located in this area with all the coast has to offer. Not many homes or hotels (except for the huge casinos) on the coast are right on the water, but we stayed as close as possible.
Like many buildings near the waterline, the building is up high on stilts to avoid hurricane storm surges. We parked in the open-air garage beneath the house. Once up the 20 or so stairs, we entered a comfortable apartment with kitchen and laundry. On the patio, traffic from Beach Boulevard could be noisy, but the fine views more than made up for it.
The home looks freshly built and is well accessorized for a comfortable stay
When not looking off the patio, we could watch the large screen TV with access to a number of streaming services!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We very much enjoyed our stay at this home. It had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Being right across the street from the beach made for great views when we needed to be inside due to poor weather conditions.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place. Terrific location, smart layout and very nicely appointed. Friendly and professional host."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute home.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was amazing! Had everything we needed, very clean, amd in a perfect location!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great‚Ä¶just as portrayed in the pictures and described in amenities. Shawn and Cindy were very responsive to any messages sent and also checked in during our stay from time to time to make sure everything was going well. Our stay was just Friday-Sunday and on Friday the noise from traffic made it a bit difficult to enjoy the fabulous balconies but Saturday and Sunday calmed down quite a bit. And the traffic noise was not noticeable at all inside. There are quite a few stairs both inside and outside the home‚Ä¶quite the workout. My granddaughter called it our beach tower. The stairs would definitely not deter me from staying at Seaside Sanctuary again‚Ä¶overall great experience‚Ä¶10 stars!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our 2 night stay!! The house was VERY clean and exactly as described. Clear check in and check out instructions. You als can't beat a 30 second walk to the beach!! We enjoyed the outdoor spaces. Place was a 10 out of 10!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing. Conveniently located to anything I could've desired to go do.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was emaculate! It had all the space and amenities we needed, and then some. The kitchen was equipped with all the essentials. We stayed a week and loved the location. The beach is across from the house. We loved sitting on the porch every evening. Its close to good restaurants. We loved everything about this place."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,There were a couple of things that were inoperable but overall stay was fine. My wife and I are disabled veterans so it was a little difficult to go up and down the numerous stairs. This is definitely a house not meant for anyone who has difficulty with stairs. This is not a fault of the house but something I feel needs to be said. The wagon to take to the beach was ‚Äúclutch‚Äù!! We happened to be in town during ‚ÄúCruisin‚Äô the Coast‚Äù and the loud vehicles going up and down 90 was also a noise issue and sleep didn‚Äôt come easy. Ear plugs might be needed for light sleepers. Once again if these are not issues for you then your stay will be completely outstanding because the house was top notch!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive. Newt and clean. Great location and super safe!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great wifi, and tv and sound system. Couldn‚Äôt figure out how to control volume. 10am check out is a little too early. Cutting board would be good addition. Great place with view."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay. Steps away from the beach. The house was clean and pristine.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house in walking distance of the beach! Shawn and Cindy were helpful, responsive hosts. The only drawback was the noise from the traffic on the highway right in front of the house, but it didn‚Äôt detract much from our experience. Great place to stay for a vacation!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good stay
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, we will be back next year!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a memorable experience it was staying at this beachside house! Enjoyed an afternoon at the beach, grilling out front while watching cars go by, and sitting up top and watching the sky go dark. The house felt brand new. I enjoyed the ability to park the car off the street and under cover. The hosts provided a few beach towels and toys which saved us money! It was a great stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful hosts, wonderful place! Beautiful view, and very comfortable place to stay. Had a blast, and would love to visit again one day!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was stunning and serene. With 3 outdoor areas to enjoy, we got to enjoy beach views from nearly every room. Check in was easy, hosts were responsive and had clear instructions. Beach access was a short 2 minute walk across the road. Outdoor shower was great for washing off sand. The hosts provided lots of beach amenities like chairs, a beach wagon, and sand toys. Linens were clean inside the home, there were plenty of towels, and beds were SO comfy. Kitchen was well stocked with dishes and was clean and inviting.
We had a lovely stay. If you want beautiful views and lots of fresh air with the beach only steps away, this is the place for you!
The ONLY thing I would change about the home is the placement right beside a busy highway. There was a fair bit of highway noise, but it didn‚Äôt take away from our otherwise perfect experience.
The hosts provided restaurant recommendations and, from the suggested list, we ended up having dinner at The Rackhouse and loved it.
10/10!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Mindy's Place was awesome. I just love the area and the Gulfport beaches. I will stay with Mindy again. Communication was great and the price was very affordable.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mindy was very quick to reply when I reached out to her. The house is VERY walkable to the shore, however there is a 4 lane highway between the house and the beach. Also, while the house was worth the rental fee - I did notice just a few issues with the home - that no doubt would have been hurricane damage sort of issues. These were NOT a deterrent. Just things that do occur with any home in that area. The linens, the kitchen - everything was well inventoried and clean. I would absolutely recommend Mindy and this home if looking in the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Place was as advertised in the listing. Very calm and relaxing setting. Few minute drive to majority of attractions. Great place to stay. Would highly recommend staying here. Will look to stay here again next time in town.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was great, loved the back patio and watched the sunsets over the beach, and location was in close proximity to restaurants. Only one thing - the grill was really dirty and we could not use. Overall the place was clean and very comfortable and will definitely recommend to our friends and family."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"very nice small house. nothing fancy and not right by all the attractions but I liked that. it was very cozy and we felt right at home, especially with the ninja coffee machine! I liked that everything needed was included in the house, shower soaps, dishwasher, laundry soap, beach toys and chairs, and even sunscreen. The house was nothing fancy but cheaper than anything similar and it served our family of 4 perfectly. It wasn't right on the beach but it's a very short walk across 1 road, worth the effort because there were no other people on that part so it was much cleaner than parts closer to Gulfport. I definitely would recommend for a relaxing- based for vacation or if you want to be a little distance away from the hustle and bustle of the cities."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful and homey place close to the beach. There was a friendly welcome sign for my family as well. You can tell the place is well maintained. It was clean and comfortable. The host was responsive and accommodating. I‚Äôd stay here with my family again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location! Very comfortable home with lots of attention to detail (i.e., beach towels, beach chairs, first aid kit, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hair dryer, waters, beach toys, etc).
Would definitely stay here again!üòä"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Short walk to the beach and very clean and tidy. And for a big coffee drinker like me a nice touch of three types of coffee set out in the kitchen. Would return if in the area again!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Both Mindy and Brain were very helpful, they did a great job of interacting with us and were great hosts.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice and respectful hosts! Beautiful house and short nice walk to the beach. Amazing back deck to watch the sunrise and sunset on! Would stay here againüòä
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The only issue was a mouse in the house. Otherwise everything was great.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We are very happy with Mindy's place, so spacious and very clean inside out. Nice kitcken with full side frig. It's way better than pictures. Get up to a beautiful sunrise from the east where the view of the ocean. Definitely come back next times."
2023-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"We couldn‚Äôt ask for a better location. We were close to great restaurants and grocery stores. We loved the fact that everything was in the same area and we didn‚Äôt have to drive far.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mindy's place was home away from home. The host were very flexible, and responsive. The place met our expectations for a family of 6 ages, (3, 5, 11, 14) + 2 adults.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect for our family of 6. Location was in the middle of everything but also peaceful. They were building another house next door but the only reason we knew is because we saw it. We didn‚Äôt even notice noise, even with a kid young enough that still needs his naps! Appreciated the fact that their were full sized shampoo, conditioner, body wash in both bathrooms. PLENTY of towels! Between showering to get sand off 4 kiddos and 2 adults, we never had an issue with towels. Plenty of beach towels too. Kitchen was very clean and appreciated how clean the fridge was and clutter free completely empty. The welcome note was a very nice tough too!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is beautiful - two adults and 3 teens were very happy and comfortable here. Well appointed, everything you need, responsive hosts."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mindy‚Äôs place was a great stop over to break up our travels. The beach was across the street with a path from the back patio. Restaurants were within a few minutes drive and Walmart was close by. The house was very clean and had plenty of room for my family of 5. We had enough toiletries and kitchen supplies to last for our two day stay.
We enjoyed building sand castles and throwing a frisbee on the beach. As usual in the gulf be aware of the jelly fish. We all got stung at least once."

2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful house just across the road from the beach! My family loved the fact that you could walk out the back door and be at the beach. They even had beach chairs for us to use! My wife loved how the house was decorated and that they had just about everything you would need already on hand if you forgot something. When the weather wasn‚Äôt cooperating, the leather sectional allowed all 7 of us to sit and watch a movie in comfort. Having a washer and dryer provided on site was really great for dealing with the wet towels and swimsuits. It was easy walking distance to the pier and the casino too! The covered back deck was great place to relax. We would often have a beverage and watch and listen to the ocean after getting too much sun. We loved the fact that it was near all of the action, but just far enough away that we had our own space too. We pretty well had the whole beach to ourselves except for the joggers coming by. We will definitely be back."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was what we expected. It was right off the strip we were able to walk to the beach. The casinos weren‚Äôt far ! And the restaurants in the area offered great food. Will stay again when we return !!!!

House was clean, close to everything!
I was a little disappointed of the beaches in gulfport. And made the drive to clear water beaches vers the beaches in gulfport. HIGHLY recommend this home would stay here again. My children loved the ocean marine park and the dolphin encounter within 15 minutes

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a corporate rental-- not a mom & pop-- so that comes with pros and cons.
Pros:
-It's super clean, well appointed, and uncluttered. It also has great family amenities like a pack n play.
Cons:
-They're not flexible or communicative. We paid $85 cleaning fee for just one night, so when baby napped early, I asked if we could check out an hour later thinking for that money their cleaning person might be flexible. They immediately said no (presumably without taking time to ask the cleaning person). So I had to wake baby up to get going on their schedule. Then when I realized I forgot something I had to go back to the house--- only to realize the cleaning person hadn't arrived and they had us leave for no reason."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cottage is very cute and located in a quiet cul-de-sac. It is super close to all of the attractions Gulfport has to offer. I would like to add that it is not very child friendly though. There were many breakables we had to move to ensure they did not get broken. The kitchen table also had very sharp corners with a glass top that is toddler height. There is also no latching mechanism for the front door that is either childproof or above child height. The beach is across the street, but it is a very busy street. You cannot drive straight across, but you can drive and park further down."

They really thought of everything - beach towels, a beach umbrella, beach wagon, beach chairs, extra linens, every kitchen utensil you could need, a welcome bucket with snacks, and a stock of extra toiletries in case you forgot yours. Plus Rebecca provided a Pack n Play and a high chair for our 18 month old (so nice not to have to pack those)! The beach is about a 10 minute walk away (or a 3 minute drive - parking right by the beach was easy when we were there in late May). The house is immaculately clean and the area felt very safe. There are plenty of restaurants (plus drug stores and grocery stores) nearby - you couldn't really walk to them, but parking is ample around here. We had a great time here and would highly recommend it to anyone!"

When you walk in, the home welcomes you and is fantastically decorated; I loved her beach theme and use of colors and textures. We traveled as a family- a couple and 2 giant teenagers and we had all the space we needed. Perfectly setup, I loved her thoughtful touches like the welcome binder, the coffee and the snacks.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, sparkling clean with all the things that you need for comfort. Was close to shops and restaurants but in a quiet neighborhood. Our host put up a Christmas tree and had other decorations to make our holiday perfect üòç my husband said he‚Äôd stay again (which he never says)."
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Such a great place!

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cottage is the cutest! We went over Thanksgiving weekend - arrived on Thanksgiving and Rebecca worked with us to allow us to check in early so we could cook our Thanksgiving dinner!
The house is exceptionally clean and the most well stocked Air BnB I have ever stayed in. Usually we have to provide extra garbage bags, laundry soap, or TP - not here. Rebecca had plenty for the stay. The kitchen is also extremely well stocked. I had brought a peeler and a can opener thinking those items wouldn‚Äôt be there, but they were! Has every item you would need to cook any dinner.
The decor is so sweet as well. We loved all the ‚Äúseas the day‚Äù items. Three bedrooms accommodated our family perfectly! The location is perfect too. We walked to the beach one day, it‚Äôs only about a 2 block walk. Ocean Springs is only about 20 minutes away and a super cute downtown to check out.
Would most certainly recommend this place to anyone and will stay again if we travel to Gulfport.
Absolutely an amazing little house."

2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"My highschool friends and I visited this house for my best friends wedding. The house was just like it was described. There were 6 of us and we were comfortable and felt like we had plenty of room. The house was just big enough. We didn't use the kitchen area much- we were too busy trying the local restaurants- but there is a kitchen that is perfect for cooking! The beach is a short 7 minute walk from the house. It was beautiful. We were so busy we didn't get to enjoy the back patio, but there was a gorgeous back patio that would be perfect for relaxing.
We ran into an issue with the interenet while we were there, even though it was out of Rebecca's control, she was still quick to reply and try to help us fix our problem.
I will not hesitate to check out Rebecca's place when I return to Gulfport!"

,,,"We rented for 3 months, Place was infested with bedbugs, we were covered with bites and had to go to doctor 3 times and dermatologist to figure out the cause. owners saw the infestation and claimed we brought them but according to research it would take months for an infestation like that to develop. They claim that it was treated. But the house was still filthy when we were supposed to return. We have pictures of everything. We left after only 5 weeks . We owe hundreds of dollars from doctors bills and prescriptions. Sorry we all had to go through this ‚Äútogether ‚Äú."
