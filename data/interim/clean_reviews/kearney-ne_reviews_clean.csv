2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home located in a private, rural setting. The view was gorgeous and it was a peaceful place to relax. John was very responsive and helpful to make our stay perfect. I look forward to spending time here again when visiting family in the area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ew construction. Clean Perfert
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"In short, John’s cabin is an absolute gem. We most enjoyed the quiet accompanied by the sounds of nature. We saw badgers, deer, eagles, owls and a whole plethora of other wildlife. Bring your binoculars and a good camera! Memories will be made!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend if you're looking for a quiet, remote getaway. Thanks, John!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great for those that want to “camp” comfortably, and it’s much better than just that. I could spend days here without getting in my Truck, as could my young children."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great. Very beautiful place and great surroundings. If u love the outdoors then this place is for you. Right on the river. Lots of wildlife viewing and can see every star in the evenings.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Would love to go back again! It was so peaceful and the house was beautiful!
2024-04-01,4.0,Group trip,Great place to stay in the Nebraska countryside. Peaceful and quiet.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great getaway and awesome location. Thank you!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the most beautiful properties in Nebraska. The home feels like home and is very spacious. Huge kitchen. We met our friends there and had a wonderful visit. John also provided us with farm fresh eggs!
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was a gem! Surrounded by nature, peaceful, could see the stars at night and breath the fresh air. This was the perfect get-away."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great private getaway from all the crowds while on a crane watching trip. The river was just down from the cabin as described and the property was great for a little hiking and exploring. We brought all of our food for cooking at the cabin and the kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed for food prep.
Towels and linens were clean and sufficient. There was a nice supply of board games for a rainy day, 3 SmartTV's, and a pair of binoculars for checking out any wildlife you may see at a distance. We definitely heard the wild animals in the middle of the night, but it justed added to the ambiance.
Check-in/out instructions were easy to follow.
Dishwasher, washer and dryer, coffee pot [cone filters], toaster were available and functioning
TIP: Arrive with your food, as the property is as described, off the beaten path. I imagine you will have a bit of a drive to the nearest grocery store if you didn't plan ahead. We were prepared for, and loved the seclusion."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,The cabin was beautiful and perfect for a girls weekend getaway. The kitchen was great with all of the necessary cooking items to prepare our meals. The main room was so spacious and the furniture was comfortable. We're already discussing when to book our next weekend getaway.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home on a beautiful piece of property.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a gem. My girlfriend and I attended a nearby bull sale and it really couldn’t get any closer. This place is quiet, private, and very spacious. The floor plan is super open and there is a ton of room to spread out. It more than accommodated just the 2 of us and could very easily host a multi-family stay. John was easy to work with and the self check-in with the keypad is a breeze. Do plan to bring your own food as there is not much other than condiments and town is a good distance away. You can definitely cook anything you’d want. There are pots, pans, cookie sheets, a crockpot, etc. The included washer dryer is also nice, we were able to run a load with little issue.
Do be wary of wildlife however. We arrived after dark and there were definitely critters hanging out on the front step when we tried to get in. Not a problem, just an observation. You should expect such things when staying in the Sandhills! 10/10, really can’t go wrong here."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very friendly hosts, clean and enjoyable"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay. The house was great and the property was beautiful. John was a great host.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is gorgeous, watching the sunset through the windows and from the porch made the trip worth it. It was cold and I had issues with getting inside because the lock was frozen but John talked me through it and was immediate in responses to any requests I had. It’s an amazing place and well worth the booking."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John has a great place to stay! My family and I will definitely be back, everyone loved the home. The scenery is beautiful, it was a home away from home. John is an outstanding host and we’re happy we got to meet him!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were on a big road trip from Salt Lake City to New Jersey and John’s place was our first stop. It was perfect for our quick stop and our big family. My kids loved the bunk beds!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We only wish we could stay longer at John’s house. It was absolutely beautiful, outside and inside. Very clean, new. The host was very responsive and helpful. We will definitely be back for longer stay."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is really well done, very clean and cozy. Perfect for a large group or just the two of us. Well stocked kitchen for cooking or good restaurants not to far away. We enjoyed a nice evening fire in the fire pit with tons of stars including plenty of shooting stars. The sunsets both nights were spectacular. This is a special place and John was the best."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at John's place. Love the secluded and peaceful cabin. Looking forward to planning our next trip!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This riverside home was everything we hoped for...and more! It is pretty secluded (which suited us great!), in a beautiful part of Nebraska, surrounded by hills, trees, fields, and wildflowers. We brought our two little guys (3yrs and 1.5yrs) and they had great fun romping in the yard and playing on the front porch. The river is accessible but not so close to the house as to make it worrisome for little people who can't swim. A nice little clearing by the river, surrounded by towering cottonwoods, holds a zipline, swing, and slack line that make for great fun. The house itself is clean and beautiful (""magical"" and ""refreshing"" were two words that kept popping up in our vocabulary while we were there), with a well-thought-out layout and a crisp decorating style that is chic while being very kid-friendly at the same time. We are already talking about coming back! We highly recommend this place and its hosts. Thanks for a great stay, John and Mandy!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the cabin was lovely in every way. It was so quiet and relaxing. I couldn’t recommend it more and we will definitely be back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little vacation, we went to the winery's (passport Nebraska) - they were a little drive to get to but not bad. Their house was a great way to end the evening great views. And their beef and farm fresh eggs were great :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The property was beautiful! We hope to make it a yearly stay. I wish we could have stayed longer. Very family friendly. Our kids had a blast!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location, view, river, and cabin were beautiful!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"From the beginning to end the whole trip was fantastic. John was very responsive and helpful and had an amazing place to stay. The ribeyes that were purchased from him were some of the best steaks we tried and the provided grill was excellent. We had no complaints. We did not venture to the river, but the environment was great and exploring the fields was beautiful. Highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The River cabin was absolutely amazing! Our hosts were the best, very accommodating and great with communication! The property was beautiful. The perfect place to explore and swim! We will definitely be back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing cabin with wonderful western Nebraska views. Hosts were very responsive and helpful. Super private with river access and plenty to do. Great for a weekend getaway or extended stay, would definitely stay here again."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great host, great steaks, peaceful location"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a great place to stay for my family! They loved the tree swings, zip lines and hay bales to climb. This was my kids favorite place on our trip west. The porch was peaceful, views were amazing and the night sky was incredible. The beds were comfortable and the house stayed nice and cool in the 95degree heat!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stopped after a long day of driving with 4 older kids (ages 11-16) and were immediately able to relax and stretch out. John gave clear instructions and the property was beautiful. Kids ran right to the river and zip line. The big round hay bale to climb up and swing from was a hit all around. Absolutely beautiful and so peaceful. The accommodations were in perfect shape, clean and spacious. We were very comfortable. Would stop again!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was lovely and just as described. The river was a short walk from the house, and there was a swing and zipline for the kids to enjoy. It was absolutely gorgeous and so peaceful."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home was clean and beautiful. The host are friendly and very helpful. Peaceful area and a great place to be with family. Our family cemeterywas down the road and the kids lived fishing by the river. Great place!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and Mandy were amazing hosts! The whole process and everything was very smooth, pleasant, exactly what was listed! The area was so beautiful and breath taking…. The view were amazing! The location was a very good location…. John helped us keep updated on the weather and storms, he helped guide us on the best possible route and roads to take….. John was very responsive thru the whole process and also the whole weekend…. He and Mandy made sure to message us and tell us to have a good visit, to relax and enjoy our time and visit, and also to check and see if we needed anything and that they would help us gather stuff for fire pit and help bring us stuff to start a fire…..I would definitely recommend and highly recommend to friends, family who want to enjoy a quiet, peaceful and secluded getaway or vacation….I hands down would have to say that we were and are blessed with the best hosts ever! It will be definitely hard to find better people then these two…. There’s a whole lot to say!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the River Cabin! It's a beautiful home, with all of the amenities one could want. The surrounding countryside is very peaceful and picturesque. The South Loup River is just a few steps away and was great to kayak. The location is fairly remote, requiring some gravel road travel, but that's part of the charm. We expect a return visit!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay very beautiful views and very spacious! John the host was very responsive with communication and gave great instructions on how to get into the house! Would definitely recommend for a quiet clean place to stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful location and home. Very newly constructed, adorable decor, and super clean. It’s a bit off the beaten path as we were just passing through, but the space was perfect for a big group. Comfortable beds, thoughtful lighting by the beds and easy access to outlets. Great kitchen supplies.
As a superhost myself, I thought John and Mandy were stellar hosts that were always quick to respond. They were helpful and you could tell they took pride in their role as hosts!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John’s home was perfect for our multigenerational family! It was clean, comfortable, spacious, and had everything you could need. John was a wonderful host - super responsive, and very accommodating. And the setting was absolutely gorgeous. I would highly recommend staying here and hope I can return soon!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a nice short stay while passing through NE. The house was clean and organized. Make sure you bring the groceries and coffee you'll need for your stay because its a good drive to the closest town for supplies.
Thanks John!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,John's place was a little farther away from Kearney than what I usually stay when working there but I absolutely loved the property! Deer greeted me every morning when I pulled into the drive and the surrounding countryside was some of the most picturesque I've ever encountered. Loved it. 👍
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the perfect place if you want to get away from everyone and everything! Views are spectacular and John and Mandy were great! Responded right away and answered all questions! The cabin was immaculate!! Pictures were exact and it was great for just 2 of us but has room for the entire family! Would recommend this place to everyone!!
10 Star Rating!!!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and his wife were amazing hosts. I am a Airbnb super host myself, and I have much to learn from John. He communicated very clearly and efficiently. The place was extremely clean. The beds were comfortable. The environment was peaceful, and I just couldn’t say anything better about the accommodations. As a matter of fact, he even gives you the ability to buy his farm, fresh steaks and eggs, which are probably the best you’ll ever have. Thank you guys for your tremendous hospitality. I wish I could give you 10 stars out of five."

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved staying in this home. There are three bedrooms which easily accommodated our families who were traveling together. The house was very clean and homey. We especially enjoyed the kitchen. It was well stocked with all the essential cooking supplies, so we were able to make a nice dinner and breakfast. Also, the setting was lovely. The farm is in a rural area, but close to interstate access. Finally, Lorna and Garland were great hosts."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place, clean and well maintained. Living room is cluttered but still very workable and a place to gather. Description didn't say it was on gravel road, but we live on a gravel road, but others did not but it was so worth the price, so clean and great accommodations so overall 5 stars."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Even though the living room furniture looked like it came from the 80s LOL, it was clean and comfortable. A bit like staying at Grandma's--complete with piano--, except Grandpa put in a great TV. The house was spacious. Beds were very high quality--which is really where you want the luxury to be. Little touches like usb ports and wireless chargers. Beautiful surroundings. Will definitely stay again if we find ourselves in Kearney. Highly recommended! Thanks!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place for a group, with plenty of beds and lots of outdoor space. Interior worked well for us, though it could be tough to find seating for everyone to be together if the group is large. Excellent hosts who responded quickly and thoroughly when we needed it."

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,This placed worked great for our family stay. I like things very clean to really relax when I am away from home. This place was VERY clean and well organized. We had dinner and breakfast at the home and the kitchen and dining areas worked great for us. There were two areas to watch TV which was nice to be able to watch different things. This house is in a very nice neighborhood and in a peaceful country setting with lots of space. I can see how this place is perfect for business or large groups with its set up and number of bedrooms. The beds were very comfortable. The hosts were very responsive and helpful. I would highly recommend this place and will stay again if we stay in Kearney. Thank you for the great hospitality! Kandi

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this is our 4th or 5th stay, and we continue to use Tyler's propeties because of how well they are setup for larger groups. Always takes good care of our crew."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family gathered for thanksgiving and had a great time. The rack in the entry was a great place for everyone to put their coat, shoes and other belongings as they entered. The upstairs gathering space seemed small for the number of people who stayed there but we made it work. Everything was very clean and the host was very accommodating. There was lots of parking and it was warm enough the first night that we were able to enjoy the fire pit. We brought our camper and would have liked to have a 30 amp plug in so we could use electric heaters instead of propane. We plan to use this VRBO again next year."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Tylers Airbnb was awesome!!
We especially loved the large family Media room with sectional couch & games available to play, special family bonding time! 💞

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"highly recommend this B&B.
of all the B&B’s we’ve been in since our family has grown to 10 adults and children, none have been as well suited to accommodate adults and children as this one. plenty of bedrooms and bathrooms to allow for the varied needs of moms, dads, kids, and grandparents. great open spaces for gathering for meals and socializing. both our grown children said it’s been the best B&B set up they have experienced.
the hosts were nice to send welcoming messages and were quick to respond to questions.
don’t know when our family will be back in the area again, but this B&B will certainly be the first place we check for availability. thanks for a memorable and comfortable stay."

Communication was prompt. House was clean.
We will for sure book again"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We really enjoyed the place. It was just outside of the city by a few mins, so lots of green space, trees and wild life. The house was clean, check-in was easy. Host was good about responding to messages.
There was 12 of us there, but only 2 showers, so it took a long time to get through the shower schedule. The big basement room helped keep the girls entertained, b/c they could watch a movie on the big screen!
I was hoping to use the gym and washer/dryer, but didn't see until it was too late that I would have needed to get that figured out ahead of time. Since we were only staying one night, I didn't bother reaching out once I figured out I needed to request access.
Overall, I would definitely recommend and would stay there again with a large group."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kept him posted when we had to ch age plans, first time so he assisted with editing to add a date. Let him know in advance what we had planned for and people changed but he was aware. I’m someone who tries to leave things better than I found it, saw trash in the yard and picked it up, asked if we could grill and they made sure it was available. We loved that we had a place to clean up and store food post grad where we could relax and just enjoy the home feeling vs hotel Jenga blocks. Adorable in decor. My daughter enjoyed the chattering she had with the decor birds. 😂 it was so calming for me I didn’t want to go home!"

The shower had excellent pressure and temperature. The neighborhood is quiet. Gordon was proactive in contacting us ahead of time and was responsive when we needed help navigating the controls on the Smart TV. The leather sofa and chair reclined, and throw blankets were provided for cozying up. The house was cheerfully decorated for the holidays. We hosted a family holiday gathering at The Cottage, and everybody loved it. We had all the kitchenware that we needed. We played one of the games that were provided. We decided we want to ask Gordon & Elizabeth for decorating advice because the home was more beautiful than anything we could have created ourselves. Our family made wonderful memories in this house and will definitely be back for a future stay. Thank you, Airbnb, Gordon, and Elizabeth!"

We'll definitely stay there again next time. (Hopefully this review won't help the cottage get so booked up that its unavailable when we're planning our next trip to Kearney!) We've found our happy spot."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in several Airbnb properties, Gordon’s is one of the cleanest and nicest places I’ve been to.
The house is clean and comfortable, very open and inviting space. Lots of amenities offered , as well as items such as lotions and hair products in case you forgot anything.
The neighborhood was quiet and private , close to some local restaurants ( we ate at Cunningham’s twice:) ) as well as a nice base location to reach the various parks.
I would definitely stay at Gordon’s again and highly recommend to others."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We rented this place for a trip with my kids and parents to see the sandhill cranes. Not only was the location great for that - it's about 15-20 minutes to great sites for bird watching - but the house is an absolute treasure. It was spotless, with plenty of space to sleep the six of us, and Gordon and Elizabeth were super helpful and flexible when we ran into last minute dog sitting problems. It's a very dog friendly house, just be aware there's no fence and you'll need to bring a lead if you want to let your dog hang out outside. The weather was snowy and icy while we were there, but the house was well outfitted with deicer and the driveway was shoveled really quickly."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Five Star Stay in Kearney. While the town, isn’t terribly small, it is definitely a small town. We drove through freezing rain & ice & arrived at the cottage after dark. The exterior/interiors lights were on, checkin was a breeze; we were in the warmth almost immediately! The cottage was charming & spotless and the basket of welcome snacks were a hit.
This bathroom is updated, so clean, & has gorgeous glass shower. The only thing we ran into - it’s really one person in the bathroom at a time while showering…the water pressure was great and stayed warm for four back to back girl showers 😂😂
The bedrooms were good size, with comfortable bedding. Living/dining area was very functional, much larger than expected. We played battleship- lots of games provided. Kitchen was well stocked-really appreciate the storage containers.
No unusual checkout requirements.
For light sleepers, it’s very quiet at night, so when someone went to the bathroom, my light sleeper was awake as well."

We saw about 320,000 of them lift off from Rowe Sanctuary in the early dawn. The experience gave all of us goosebumps (bird pun intended) and we made lasting memories. We all appreciated the little ""bird-y"" touches throughout the house from the crane photo to the avian bric-a-brac. If you stay here, be prepared to want to take the couch home--it's wonderfully comfortable. The furniture in general is designed to make you feel at home and the seating arrangements are thoughtful. Thanks for a great stay!"

My family of five lived in this house for two weeks. We could have stayed for months and been happy. Everything worked, everything was exactly as pictured, and every room had exactly what we needed. The house is in the middle of town, so it took us about five minutes to get anywhere. The kitchen is well-equipped. The living room has a big couch and a comfortable recliner, plus a big TV and board games. The beds are comfortable. It snowed while we were there, so we really appreciated the enclosed porch in the back where the kids could keep their boots and coats. The house was very clean. It was perfect."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The entire process with SueZan was great. Clear simple checkin and checkout process. House was as pictured, actually nicer than expected. We walked to the Bricks a few times to eat, and have a drink. Plenty of close options to choose from. Very nice having a grocery store a block away for last minute purchases.
Not planned but one of the best surprises during our stay was Kearney cruise night passing in front of the house. We were able to sit on the porch and watch the parade and happy families.
Overall we had a great stay and would definitely recommend to others staying in the Kearny area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay in Kearney! Walkable distance to groceries, fireworks (when the calendar allows), and our favorite—Cunningham’s Journal. I was pleasantly surprised: the master suite is on the main floor, and the remaining rooms, and additional bath, are upstairs. An additional fridge is in the “garage,” but the kitchen was really well supplied. We have two small children, so we were happy to find games in a cabinet, baby spoons in the drawer, and even a step stool. If I had to guess, SueZan is a much-loved grandma.
Loved our stay; we will definitely return when we can!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful family experience.
The kitchen was well stocked with cooking utensils and items such as spices and some condiments in the fridge. We enjoyed the game area in the basement and the front porch with chairs and a porch swing to sit out and enjoy the nice weather as well as the fenced in back area with the grill, table and firepit.
Bedrooms were spacious and sitting areas on upper level were a bonus. There were no unbreakable dishes or glasses for small children so you may want to bring them as well as storage containers for left overs.
It was great to be just a block away from a reasonably priced grocery store as well as a few blocks from a Walgreens.
The host responded immediately to any questions we had which we greatly appreciated.
The city of Kearney is amazing especially considering its size. We thoroughly enjoyed the Children's Museum, park with 3 playground areas, walking trail around a lake, and observation tower and very nice bike trail which went for several miles.
We would definitely consider staying again and it was centrally located for our family from Colorado and eastern Iowa."

All 4 of us need to 'check-in' with our separate businesses, even while on vacation, so the high-speed wifi service was appreciated.

2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed here for one brief night passing through the area. The trains are not very loud and did not bother us or our two small kids. The couches and bed were uncomfortable.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Tastefully decorated and well stocked! Comfy bed, great water pressure and hot water. Friendly and proactive host. Large fenced yard that our pups appreciated very much. W/D was a real plus too. Location is more industrial and near where trains pass by, but I happen to love the sound of a train and it wasn’t loud to me at all.
Just down the street is the Main Street in a quaint little city. We loved the selection of shops and eateries, and music was playing over speakers on this street. That made for a nice walk with our dogs after having pizza and some drinks at Platte Valley Taphouse…dogs welcome on the patio. The owner and patrons were so friendly and nice. An all-around very pleasant stay for this couple and their dogs who felt very welcomed!"

Megan was very responsive when we were having trouble figuring out if we could get to Kearney because the interstate was closed between our home and Kearney. There was a big backyard which would have been a really nice place to relax in the summer. There were a lot of nice touches with items in the kitchen such as sauces and condiments and some food. We enjoyed our stay and would stay again."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,This home is adorable and we enjoyed the vibes! The yard is quite large which was a welcomed surprise. We did need to keep an eye on our dogs due to the miscellaneous items around. The train is close and can be quite loud but manageable. Good location for food and coffee.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice Boho -- the owners are definitely taking good care of the place and put a lot of effort in upgrading it
The location is in a more ""industrial"" side of town with a few trains that we were not used to...but this should not change our mind about selecting this place.
I like the fenced in backyard -- this helped our pooch feel more comfortable
We do like our coffee in the morning (and we are older generation) so a standard coffee maker on site would be great. Using the Keurig is not my favorite appliance. Luckily we had some instant coffee and did try to use the Keurig machine
A suggestion - this would be a great place for the crane watchers that come into town in Early March into April -- since the location is so close to the best places for cranewatching along the Platte -- you should advertise this! It was so convenient for us.
I love all your improvements to the house -- they made it very comfortable."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed here on a quick visit to Kearney. Easy to find, easy to get in and out of. I was not there long and didn’t need much, but seemed well stocked."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was great! The location was only 20 minutes from Kilgore Rd and the Three Bridges Hike/Bike Trail, where the Sandhill Cranes migration can be observed. Our two dogs really enjoyed running around, playing and laying in the sun in the large fenced backyard. The bed was very comfortable and we slept very well. Extra towels, sheets, toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent and garbage bags were p provided and was awesome! Having a washer, dryer and dishwasher was perfect! All in all it's a very cozy little updated house with everything that's needed and was perfect for us for our 6 day stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Home was very clean!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Megan hit it out of the park with setting up this place and making guests feel right at home. The inside is very clean and nicely divided into different areas, sleeping, kitchen, living; has all the amenities, including some games, having coffee available, and some left-behind non-perishables from previous guests. She and Joey provide great local recommendations; we tried many and loved them all. Both are very responsive and provide proactive, timely and clear communications. We were there to take in the sandhill crane migration: breathtaking! And we felt very comfortable coming and going. While we did not spend time in the private yard, it looks inviting and like a great space in warmer weather. We’d definitely come and stay here again!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication and great place for the price!! Plenty of extra towels and blankets also which was a huge plus!! Just as described and wouldn’t hesitate to stay again, thank you!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband, 14 year old daughter and I stopped here for a night traveling through Kearney. Hosts thought of absolutely everything their guests might need or want. This is a small house but very well thought out to maximize the space to make it feel larger and open. Fully equipped home had everything you’d have in your own home. Wish we had a longer stay here to finish the puzzles and play in the spacious back yard!
Train was heard but not an issue at all, was actually really cool. Loved the decor! House was immaculately clean. We felt safe staying here. Grateful for the self check in as we arrived later in the evening. Quick communication for our last minute reservation as well.
Megan and Joey know how to create an experience even for just a quick stay. I would book again!"

We were stuck in a blizzard, enduring many delays, and they compassionately made the necessary changes to our booking. They proactively provided information about the weather on their end and were concerned for our wellbeing and safety.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We needed a place to stay close to a graduation reception. This place was perfectly close and slept the 4 of us well.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Boho Cottage was the best! I'm looking forward to a return trip when I have another conference there. Thanks Joey!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is such a great place to stay when I come into town to village my daughter in college. Will definitely book again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a great place for me and my family to stay for a few days. I’ll definitely book it again next time I’m in town.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,peaceful location!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked at the Boho cottage on our way back to Colorado from our holiday trip out east and needed a place to stay in the area after our first booking canceled. I’m not sure if the price had been increased for the holiday weekend but it was a little more than I would expect to pay for that small of a space. It is a super cute, clean and nice space but pretty small for 5 people. The bed in the bedroom was very comfortable, however both futon/couch beds in the living area were not comfortable at all. The kitchen was well stocked as the bathroom with very nice touches and comforts. We had fun playing Nintendo and the TV was nice as well.
It is right next to train tracks but surprising not that loud. It was a good place for 1 night with limited options and Joey was very friendly and responsive."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was homey and convenient! It was clean and tastefully decorated without clutter
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for warm hospitality.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at the The Boho Cottage Getaway and will definitely be staying here again. Great location and friendly host. Couldn’t ask for more.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Joey's house was great for our stop from Colorado. We're a family of 4 and we had enough space to be comfortable. Very clean and tidy. Yes there is a train nearby but its not loud at all. Both kids slept through the night and weren't bothered by it at all.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a neat little boho getaway. Super cute, clean and well kept up! I loved all the decorations and wall art."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joey was so responsive and everyone was so easy to find and access.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little house was just what we needed!
It was cozy and well equipped for our stay.
There were so many thoughtful touches and amenities that make you feel right at home (and that could possibly save you a Walmart run).
Joey and Megan were good communicators and very responsive.
Would recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable, no hassle, and affordable space."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place 👍

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for letting us check in an hour early so we could get to a wedding. House was very lovely and comfortable. Thank you again!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a gem this place was a long our cross country route. Very well appointed with anything we needed. Comfortable bed and very nice bathroom. Will certainly stay again if we're driving through.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was great hosts. Worked around what I needed for our stay. The house is amazing. So clean and updated and comfy. Great use of space. Kitchen had it all. Such a easy stay with a good location.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joey, was very responsive when trying to communicate with him. Everything was clear in the instructions. Home was clean and tidy!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joey and Megan’s place was perfect for us. Cozy, charming, and as described. As hosts, they were extremely responsive and friendly. I would definitely stay here again if I have the opportunity."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute place! Perfect spot after a long day of driving. Thank you for having all the little extras. We were just passing through but we did stop at Good Evan’s and it was delicious!!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A quiet area, but close to services.
Ok if you don’t mind some train traffic."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay for us. An easy walk to Central Ave where all the coffee shops, boutiques, salons, bars, and fun are. My daughter had knee surgery and instead of a hotel, we stayed here. It was very comfortable and served our purpose very well with the kitchen. We enjoyed the side yard and outdoor furniture too. Thank you!! I highly recommend this AirBnb."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was very clean and welcoming, the host was very friendly and communicative, and overall it was a perfect place for us to stay."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Joey's place was super cute, clean and tons of amenities! Joey was great with all interactions, as well. As listed, he has a neighbor that no one wants but we had no interaction with him whatsoever. Also, as listed, the trains run by all night but there was no whistles and, mostly, you just felt the rumble but not obnoxious enough to wake you. We did hear a ""slam"" noise a half dozen times or so from the bedroom throughout the night. We never did figure that out. Overall, if you're driving through and need a place to stop for a quick night, not bad at all. The trash man even waited for me while a ran our garbage out to him as we were leaving :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joey was and awesome host. Super clean and comfortable. Would stay here again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really comfortable. Excellent bed. Both air conditioners worked great, keeping it cool on a 100F day!
Lots of extra amenities, like kitchen items, bath supplies (including an extra tooth brush!), HUGE refrigerator in a full kitchen."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Joey's boho bungalow was the perfect place for a quick stay when visiting Kearney. They has so many thoughtful touches and is a quick drive to downtown. Thanks for a great stay!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was easy to find and centrally located. The space was cute and well thought out with extra details such as charging cubes and extra toiletries. Thank you again for hosting!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! Everything was clean and as described. Hosts had many little extras that made our stay extra homey and stress free! Our two young kids loved the games and toys provided. The kitchen is well stocked with what we needed to make a few meals. They even had some bathroom things in case we forgot. Everything is easy to find and figure out. The bed was comfy too. Plenty of pillows and blankets.
It was a short trip to the fair grounds in Kearney for the teamster events we attended, and not too far from the State Fair in Grand Island. We found plenty to do over the weekend. If we're ever in the area again, we will for sure book this cozy place!
Side note: We had a wheel bearing go out on our car. The garage about a block away was super friendly and got us fixed up quickly! The walking distance there was an unexpected huge plus for this trip!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a fantastic few nights.
The place was perfect, clean quiet and well stocked. The laundry was an added perk and Joey and Megan went above and beyond to accommodate me. I look forward to staying here again."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great very short stay on my way through town. It was a quiet night. House interior was clean and very nicely decorated. I would stay again. Neighborhood was colorful but we didn’t have any problems.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As advertised, a solid spot with everything you'd need. Zero issues, and easiness of everything all around."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It’s a great place to stay, however, the neighbors houses and the overall vibe was a bit sketchy. Just be prepared for that."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great home- clean, comfortable and awesome air conditioning during a hot Midwest summer. Joey and his wife were so friendly and responsive (even when we accidentally turned off the dimmer switch in the bathroom- lol)! Would definitely stay there again- no question! I do understand the reviews that state that it looks a little sketchy at first from outside and the surroundings, but It was 100% safe and comfortable and the “next door neighbor’s reputation” was a nonentity for us. Both times we saw him, he was friendly. So overall- an awesome value and incredible hosts!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a gem of a find in Kearney! The entire space was immaculate and had so many thoughtful touches from bath bombs to card games. The hosts were extremely responsive and made sure we had everything we may have needed. We will definitely be renting again we are in town next!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place!!! Super clean and comfy space with adorable features. So much better then any hotel in the area!!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean & well stocked house! The cutest touches & had everything we needed. Hosts were responsive to any questions.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Joey was a great host! I really appreciated all of his help.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute little home, super sweet host"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay here. Will definitely consider coming back again at some point in the future. Would highly recommend for families in the area, who need a place to crash for the night."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Cottage in Kearney, NE was the perfect AirBNB stay. Parking and check-in was easy with the host’s instructions and the space was comfortable and clean. The kitchen was equipped with plenty of pots and pans to cook a full meal. The washer and dryer worked well and was a great asset while on a long trip. Overall, I would definitely stay here again and/or recommend it to family or friends visiting Kearney."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were surprised and delighted with Joes's location and commendation. the house is tranquil and progressive.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joey was very nice and accommodating and kind! The place was also very clean and functional. Would highly recommend him as a host!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was driving across the country and decided to stop for the night at Joey's place. It was just what I needed for the night. I was able to book it and check in his place in less than 10 minutes.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was cozy and welcoming, with all the necessary amenities to make our stay enjoyable."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Joey is a great host and the house was very well decorated and clean. Close to downtown activities as well!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I traveled to Mariposa, California from Michigan and back for my daughter's wedding and stayed in several airbnb homes. This one was on the top of my list. It was very clean and well stocked with things I wouldn't have even thought of. I only wish I would have found this place on my way to California as well. I would definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This little place was super cute on the inside and very clean! The beds were comfortable and the little kitchen had what we needed for a quick, overnight stay. You can tell they put a lot of effort into making it a comfortable space.
There were a few challenges, though. There are only 2 AC units in the cottage which leave the kitchen & bathroom/laundry room very warm. The AC unit in the living room cools only enough to make the room temperate. I would advise you bring several fans with you to make your stay more comfortable in the summer months.
Though the landlords have no control over the next items, it's good to be aware before you arrive: the neighborhood is rather industrial and a little sketchy looking/feeling. Which feeling is unfortunately augmented by some very unfriendly neighbors that share the driveway with cottage renters. Since street parking is allowed, I would advise you leave your car on the curb so as to avoid the neighbors' space altogether."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joey was very responsive to a concern I had and put my mind at ease right away. This place is beautiful! Joy did a great job with the remodel of this home. Every appliance is modern, and the bathroom is very nice. Comfortable bed. Great working area, great kitchen. Nice TV. Overall, a great stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice stay. One night stopover during a trip. Everything we needed was there.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute little house. Perfect for the four of us after a concert in North Platte. The neighbors, however, that’s another story. 😬🙄 It wouldn’t keep me from staying there again. As I’m sure it’s not like that all of the time."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place to stay during our road trip…close to the freeway, clean, quiet, cutely decorated, and super stocked with everything you’d want in the kitchen plus fun pampering items in the bathroom. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks! Great, easy and clean stay and we appreciated it!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Spotless house. Cozy.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute, comfy, & very accommodating! Joey let us book last minute for a night along our road trip. Nice backyard with outdoor seating!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little house! Everything you would need for an overnight stay when you are out town. Conveniently located to everything in town. The host was also super responsive to any questions we had during our stay and was very flexible!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were so lucky to find Joey's place on our road trip out west. It was perfectly comfortable with so many thoughtful touches - easy to find - and super close to town for a nice bite and a quick getaway. Thank you so much for hosting us 🙏 highly recommend!!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the location of this house. We were traveling from Michigan to Colorado and the house was close to the highway. My family walked to old town where we looked at shops and ate lunch. We had car problems and Joey let us have a late check out to help accommodate. We will be returning next time we need to stop on our travels front Michigan!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home to stay and relax. They have thought of everything you may need.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great little place to stay on a roadtrip passing through. It was clean, beautiful and had everything you'd need (and more!). The bathroom is stocked with toiletries (even bath bombs), the kitchen with snacks (and a freezer full of veggies, meat and fruit). The swings in the back are a great way to relax after a long day of driving. The bed was comfortable, everything was really clean and they had a fun (and hard!) puzzle that I did watching movies.
Joey was responsive and super kind and friendly. Other than being in a lower end of town with train tracks right outside, it was awesome. (The trains never blast the horn, just rattle by periodically).
As a single woman traveling alone, I always question safety. I felt a little uneasy when I first got there due to the lower end neighborhood by the tracks, but realized pretty quickly it was just the small town feel, not an unsafe neighborhood in the city."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joey is a great host, responded to all our inquiries quickly, providing helpful information. The house was spotless and nicely decorated. We had a great night sleep in a comfortable bed. Joey went above and beyond, providing the most extensive amount of food items we could ever want with coffee and tea, as well as many spices. We wish we could have stayed longer."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This lovely home in a quiet neighborhood was the perfect overnight stop on our way to Colorado. We appreciated all the little details throughout that made us feel right at home.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joey answered my questions in a timely manner. The interior was decorated very nice. There were lots of extras in the bathroom and kitchen . I would stay here again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay!! It was clean and cozy and had everything we could possibly need plus extras in case we forgot anything. Definitely hope to stay again anytime I’m in that direction. 🤍🤍🤍
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was just as described! Beautiful and well thought out home. Very relaxing stop along our road trip. This home has all the amenities that you need… plus! We were very satisfied with our stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Charming little house! Had everything we needed and was a great place to relax. We really enjoyed our stay and Joey was super friendly and helpful in his correspondence.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The place is cute and clean. The chair swings outside were nice to swing in.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed one night during a multi-day drive on HWY 80. Easy access to Hwy but not too close. This is a unique and special place--I loved it as soon as I drove up and even more when I walked in. It's a tiny, fully equipped house with a backyard and nice tree in front. Lots of windows and a front and side door with screens. The inside is beautifully furnished and decorated. Nice bathroom with nice toiletries and bath extras. Private, calming. I felt very comfortable. Just my style. Wish I had more time to enjoy the hammock and hanging chairs in the yard. There is a freight train that passes close by. No horn, but you can hear the train. I'm sensitive to noise but it wasn't an issue at all, more of a nostalgic part of the experience. Joey is a great communicator and very responsive. I enjoyed the stay very much!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great place to stay while passing through Nebraska! My mom and I were looking for a last minute spot, and this was the most responsive and best deal I’ve ever found! The home is so clean and provides so many little extras — from coffee in the kitchen, to bath bombs and facemasks! Couldn’t be more pleased, and highly recommend!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,we couldn't have asked for a better host -we enjoyed our stay
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying at Chuck and Mary’s Airbnb. They were super kind and friendly. We felt incredibly comfortable and feel blessed to have met them both. Would stay here again if I find myself back in Kearney!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for providing an absolutely wonderful couple of days for my sister and I. We enjoyed a fantabulous dinner all because of Chuck’s grilling expertise! The love they share between the two of them and their family just flowed right on into our lives- laughter was contagious not to mention the hospitality was like no other. Teamwork demonstrated between Chuck and Mary was quite extraordinary. Thank you for sharing, preparing, welcoming, and even sending us off with smiles😊. Enjoy the time you get to spend here, you will be delighted by all the enthusiasm! And banana bread😉"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary was such a gracious, inviting host. She made me and my sisters feel so welcome. The house is in a peaceful residential area, convenient to everything Kearney offers. The banana bread that Chuck made was DELICIOUS!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Chuck and Mary are great hosts and The Heritage is an unusual place to stay at, so neat and tidy yet so full of old historical treasures to discover all around the rooms and the house in general. You will find a place that you can actually call home even if it is for one night if you’d like. They belong to a very close family with a warm and beautiful connection with nature and full of hospitality. Just on your own, couple looking for a place to relax or a family trip, this place is perfect to spend the time and chill. They have the spirit of adventure and can be very friendly, full of good vibes and a positive energy that surrounds the place will make you feel cozy and like part of the family."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chuck and Mary are great hosts, very communicative and clear. We were happy to stay in your home. Thank you for having us."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay was very nice! Thanks to Chuck and Mary we felt like at home!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Chuck and Mary's AirBnB was a complete joy. They greeted us with a tour of the space, fresh baked banana bread and an invitation to park in the garage. Their home is immaculate, with a rich history. They had helpful recommendations right away that allowed us to find the ""The Bricks"" downtown on a nice walk to stretch our legs after the drive and get booked for a Audubon Society crane blind that had been sold out for weeks. The beds were very comfortable and the home was very quiet for a good nights sleep. Staying with Chuck and Mary was perhaps the best AirBnB experience we have ever had."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Chuck & mary were quick to respond to a number of questions we had. They were friendly and felt like family. Knew the community front and back. Thanks for a great stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hard to imagine a place more prepared for guests with amenities and accessories for everything. Chuck was there when we arrived and helped us in as well as explained right away how everything was laid out and worked. Two of my sisters and I stayed there and having a room for each was great.
Something I don't remember being very specific was the ""off street"" parking which really meant we got to park in their detached garage with our own garage door opener! Quite nice."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We are happy repeat guests. Whenever we head to or through Kearney we seek to stay at Chuck and Mary’s place. They are quintessential hosts. Their kind thoughtful attention to detail is unmatched.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You will not meet a kinder couple than Chuck and Mary. We felt instantly at home and our space was spotless. They went above our expectations for a “super host”. Chuck and Mary’s Heritage House had everything we needed or wanted to make our stay enjoyable. I don’t want to spoil any surprises, but let me just say we will be back if we are anywhere near Kearney, NE in the future. In terms of bed comfort, hot water or water pressure, Wi-Fi, and coffee availability - it was excellent. There was much more room than we needed for the two of us. The Sandhill crane migration is what brought us to Chuck and Mary’s home and the location to Rowe Sanctuary was perfect! Thank you Chuck and Mary; you truly have a magnificent home with a wonderful history to tell to all that pass through your doors."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Chuck and Mary were very responsive to messages, friendly, very helpful, and went out of their way to assist us with luggage, as well as to help my friend ascend and descend the steep stairs. They provided a good selection of coffee and tea and a nice banana bread for breakfast. I recommend their B-n-B and would stay there again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chuck and Mary were incredibly thoughtful and knowledgeable hosts. Their house is just as beautiful and thoughtfully appointed as it looks. We had a wonderful stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chuck and Mary were great hosts, with clear communication, quick responses, garage parking (!!!), and the warmest welcome I have ever received.
The quarters were clean and cozy, with many delightful and thoughtful details, like beautiful towels, chocolates, personalized welcome notes, cozy robes, touch-lights, a variety of soaps, bottled water... some serious attention to detail!
Highly recommended, and I look forward to visiting again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a great and personal experience Chuck and Mary provided! Lots of personalized notes, stocked fridge of drinks, coffee and tea provided, garage spot, and fresh made banana bread. I’d give 10 stars if I could. Chuck and Mary are true Super Hosts and the bar all others should try to achieve. This was our best AirBnb experience ever!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place with everything and more you could need for a comfortable trip!

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Chuck and Mary are the best hosts! You can tell they truly enjoy meeting and hosting people and are the kindest people you’ll meet. The place was also lovely & very accommodating for my family. We loved all the extra touches. They were also so kind to help us with an unexpected transportation need that came up that they offered out of their kindness! If I visited again I’d remember a swim suit for the hot tub! Thank you guys for being so kind and accommodating!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chuck and Mary are wonderful hosts and made us feel right at home. Their home is comfortable, inviting and includes lots of thoughtful extras. We definitely recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful home, and a perfect setting for a stay, especially if you don't have a need for a kitchen. Very cozy. The hosts have thought about every detail. Garage parking was an extra perk, and the hosts were very attentive. Pay attention on your check-in tour - lots of info that will help you enjoy your stay more."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Chuck and Mary’s. Their hospitality and the warmth of their home is unparalleled.
It was one of our first outings with two toddlers and they made us feel right at home and put us at ease. The space was so full of history and was beautifully decorated.
They provided us with helpful recommendations and we enjoyed the children’s museum and other family friendly activities in the area. We look forward to returning when the cranes are migrating through or in the summer when we can enjoy the nearby parks. Thank you!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One of the best Air BNB stays I’ve ever experienced. The Heritage House is just as described. Was a perfect fit for me and four teenagers. (Even with just the one bathroom!) Chuck and Mary are the best hosts-the whole experience seriously felt like we were guests in their home. Beds were super comfy, all the extras were so appreciated. Stocked mini-fridge, great coffee bar, homemade banana bread, which we devoured. The home is located in a sweet neighborhood perfect for a morning jog or walk, as well. The grounds are lovely. Would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chuck and Mary were great host.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful suite. Hosts personally showed me around, pointed out nuances of each bedroom and the bathroom. Offered to carry my luggage up the stairs. Truly superhosts!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,There were three of us and each of us were able to have our own sleeping space. That was so nice. Our hosts greeted us and helped us with our luggage. Chuck stayed with us to explain everything about the space and give us eating suggestions. The space was stocked with beverage options and some homemade goodies. These hosts made you feel very welcome and comfortable. The weather was too cold to enjoy their beautiful outdoor space. Highly recommend this for your stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Chuck and Mary were the sweetest hosts we've ever come across and were beyond accommodating. They went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable during our stay. Be sure to have your coffee on the pergola and make sure you ask Chuck about the history of their home!

They made us feel very at home, and constantly reminded us that if we needed anything to just let them know. 10/10 hosts and 10/10 stay.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Okay everyone, I’ve stayed at quite a few Airbnb’s and Chuck/Mary’s place in Kearney, NE was BY FAR the ABSOLUTE BEST I’VE EVER STAYED AT…times 10, no…times 100! No joke! Everything is absolute gorgeous! Their home has soooo much charm, the originally woodworking is incredible, but the hosts are the kindest, most hospitable people you will ever meet! There are soooo many nice extra “touches” they do, from the beginning to the end…soooo accommodating. If you want to know what “Nebraska Nice” is all about…a at Chuck and Mary’s Heritage House. You will NOT be disappointed. They make you feel so welcome and like your family…from minute one. They’re right there if you need them, but they don’t get in your business either. There are special touches all around their beautiful, quiet property. And the City of Kearney is amazing as well! The people of Nebraska (Kearney specifically) are the definition of kind, nice and hospitable. Thank you thank you thank you Mary and Chuck…for everything!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sisters and I have stayed at Chuck & Mary's Airbnb nearly 10 times. We love everything about this destination and LOVE Chuck & Mary who seem like family to us. The home is gorgeous yet so comfortable. Each bedroom is unique and tastefully decorated. There is a cozy gathering area with a coffee bar and comfy seating. The outdoor garden spaces are simply heavenly, especially during the summer months, when covered with an abundance of colorful flowers, exotic plants and comfortable seating to relax and take it all in. The hosts have thought of everything to make their guests feel special and right at home."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The best Airbnb experience we’ve ever had! Chuck and Mary were the most amazing hosts. They were welcoming, helpful, and generous. And that was before we discovered that our son had accidentally left his wallet behind. Chuck and Mary didn’t hesitate in getting it to us. If you ever get the chance, stay in this beautiful place with these wonderful hosts. If ever we travel their way again we will definitely stay with them. I can’t say enough about what a great experience we had. Thank you for everything, Chuck and Mary and your whole crew!!!!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful place to stay. The upstairs apartment is beautifully decorated and full of amenities. The outside of the house is also beautiful. While we didn't use the hot tub, we enjoyed the pergola. Chuck and Mary are so friendly and accommodating. They met us upon our arrival, showed us where our off street parking was, showed us the private entrance and explained everything in the apartment. They're very knowledgeable about the history of the house and about the Kearney area. The apartment is conveniently located near restaurants and stores. We certainly recommend it to anyone who is staying in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying at Mary and Chucks’s home wasn’t like any other Airbnb experience we have ever had. It was like visiting family! They didn’t just provide a beautiful and cozy place to sleep, they took care of us. Our family is traveling to all 50 states and after a long journey we needed an oasis, and that is exactly what we got. If you are traveling through or near Kearney, Nebraska, Mary and Chuck’s Heritage House is a must!!!
Mary and Chuck,
Thank you for giving us wonderful memories that will last a lifetime.
Sincerely,
The Ciruelos Family"

The space was so clean and the hosts were friendly and made the stay perfect. If I ever stay in Kearney again it will be only at Chuck and. Mary’s. Do yourself a favor and book this place.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We came in late and had to head out early, but Mary met us outside to make sure we knew where to park and set up some cushions for us to relax and sit in their garden. In the morning we came out to find Chuck cleaning our car! Truly some above and beyond hosts. I'd give them six stars if I could."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"From the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed and invited into an absolutely lovely private apartment in a gorgeous old house. The beds were super comfortable, coffee and other drinks were provided, and the space was perfect. Our hosts thought of everything and more with chocolates on the pillows and even oversized bath robes. We definitely hope to stay here again sometime for a longer period and make use of the lovely outdoor garden area they have created. Thanks for hosting us!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Chuck and Mary made us feel right at home from the moment we booked our stay! They were enthusiastic about answering any questions, both before we got to Kearney, and especially once we were there.

You cannot go wrong with this rental!"

The landscape is beautifully maintained, their garden is peaceful, and the outdoor patio/pergola is so charming & relaxing. Chuck & Mary are SUCH sweet, kind, interesting and friendly people. You will NOT regret booking your stay at the Heritage House!!
Chuck & Mary: It was so good to see the both of you again!! 💞 Thank you for being such wonderful hosts; you guys are awesome. I hope your Memorial Day weekend with your family went well! Hope to see you guys again on a future visit to Kearney. Take care and God bless you both..."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chuck and Mary are wonderful hosts and proud of the Heritage House and their town. Chuck even wrote a short book focused on the family that built the house. If you like local history, and want to stay in an historic house, Heritage House is a great choice."

Always asked if we needed anything."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Family!!!! The best word to describe how Chuck and Mary make me feel! This was my third time at the Heritage House. I leave a little piece of my heart behind in Kearney every time I stop here! An amazing space with so much history and tons of personalized touches. Chuck and Mary are what the Airbnb experience is all about! Clean and cozy-- but the company is what makes this stay worth it the most. Can't wait to come back again and stay awhile. If you're lucky enough to stay with Chuck and Mary in their beautiful historic home, you'll make friends for life. Cheers!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had the opportunity to stay here recently. It looked great online, but was even more amazing in person. Along w/the house being so cozy & full of history, Chuck & Mary made our stay SO much more wonderful! The rich history in the house was so intriguing! Talking w/Chuck & Mary was SUCH a delight; we truly wished we would've had more time to talk to them. They were so understanding w/us; on our way to check in, 2 older gentlemen had just hit a deer. We stopped to make sure everyone was ok, & waited w/them until the sheriff came. Chuck & Mary were so kind to us (even though they had to stay up later bc of us). Chuck & Mary are genuinely nice people. The house alone would have been a great place to stay, but Chuck & Mary made our stay a remarkable one! We enjoyed the secret garden, what the jars of grape jelly were for, the Sandhill crane sculptures, the Jon Crane artwork & more! Thank you guys for your kindness & hospitality! Both you guys & your home meant a lot to us...💜"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I finally realized my dream of seeing the Sandhill Crane migration in Kearney this year, and Chuck and Mary provided the perfect homebase for resting and recharging each day. They were both so warm and friendly, as if we were old friends, and they helped me locate great places to eat as well as view the wildlife. You will be staying on the second floor of the home where they live, but your space will feel very private and quiet.
All of the other reviews are spot on -- Chuck and Mary have thought of everything to make your visit to Kearney a memorable one. I plan to return again in the future."

From personalized welcome signs and our own newsletter to plush robes laid out to wear after shower or spa, every detail was perfect. Even though our suite was private and complete, Chuck and Mary were at our beck and call for every need.
Beds were super clean and comfy, fridge was stocked with drinks, snacks were available, and brochures and pamphlets for all the places we might be inclined to go were out. Chuck, member of the historical board, even gave us a tour. Heritage House is a trip in itself - there is so much history there.
We came to see cranes and see them we did. We got beautiful pictures and wonderful videos. We were about fifteen minutes from Rowe Sanctuary and even closer to Fort Kearney, both awesome viewing areas.
Chuck and Mary attended every detail and more than earn the highest rating possible and then some. They and their home were awesome. We would all highly recommend the Heritage House for your next stay."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are no words to adequately describe the amazing experience at Chuck and Mary’s beautiful home.
If you are in the Kearney Nebraska area and you are scrolling through the available Air BnB’s, stop now. This is the place!
We have been using Air BnB since 2016 and this place is at the top of our list of best stays ever.
Everything you have read in previous reviews is true, tenfold.
We were warmly welcomed and felt “at home” immediately. So many extra special nice touches that really made us feel welcome - too many to count (I wouldn’t want to ruin the surprises for you).
Look no further. The Heritage House is the best of the best and Chuck and Mary are amazing hosts."

They are truly generous and thoughtfulhosts."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I thoroughly enjoyed my five night stay with Chuck & Mary at the Heritage House. They are like the my family you wait all year to see at Christmas. The home is beautifully appointed with historical amenities as well as up to date travel and family photos of their lives. I found the upstairs to be more comfortable, in addition to having many of the features found in Five Star hotels. Their home is not just a place to stay, but a snap shot of how Chuck & Mary have made a positive contribution to humanity and are role models that we all could do well to emulate."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If there were more than five stars to give I would give them. After a long day on the road, this house had comfort and provisions in a way that exceeded my expectations in every way. This house has decor has a story to tell and it's a fun story to hear. The hosts were so helpful; when we mentioned that we were driving the Oregon trail, they gave us a state parking pass and pages of advice. Happy trails, Chuck and Mary."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Chuck and Mary's place is a true gem. We stayed over night on our way across the country and could not have had a better time in our short stay. Everything you could want has been thought of already. The extra touches (literally chocolate on your pillow) have already been taken care of. The space has plenty of room in the sitting area for four people, the rooms are large with nice queen beds in each, and the shower is wonderful. The mini-fridge keeps your items cold and you have a choice of two coffee pots for your morning brew or tea. The grounds are immaculate and Chuck and Mary are the most hospitable hosts we have ever experienced. If there is ever such a thing as a Super, Super host, Chuck and Mary are it. Read the description and check out the pictures. Everything is exactly as described and shown in the photos. We will surely stay again if ever in the area."

Thank-you Chuck and Mary!! We hope to stay there again soon!♥️"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were very late getting to their home, but they waited up and personally greeted us…and I mean…WOW! The extra special touches-from the sidewalk chalk and the personal signs throughout the upstairs. Each bedroom was decorated absolutely beautiful, fresh flowers, and homemade banana cranberry bread. They even have a fancy toilet…I’ll save the surprise for you! Really appreciated the fact that they do allow you to stay only one night. We were on our way to Sturgis, so it was a perfect stopping point. We even got to park in their garage! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEIR HOME. THEY ARE AWESOME HOSTS!! Would give 20 stars if we could!!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Chuck and Mary were so thorough in their communication with us. We knew where to go and even had Chuck meeting us in the front yard as we drove down the street to help guide us to parking and unpack. They made our family of six feel welcome and like guests in their home. Their flower gardens were beautiful and the added touch of bouquets in the rooms brightened our day after many hours in the car. We appreciated finding a place that was willing to accommodate our whole family and allow us one night as we needed a stopping point on our way home from out West. They thought of many cozy little details to make us feel at home.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A special Thank You to both of our hosts for waiting (waking) up so promptly, giving us the tour, and offering to help carry our bags. (we had been on the road for 14+ hours and arrived after midnight) I was blown away as well as wife and son with your cleanliness, attention to detail, spaciousness, and personal welcome messages with our names on them. I really loved all of your rich historical mementos about the house and from previous guests - MY FAVORITE PART! (I love personal stories) The beer and wine in the fridge were just the extra steps and granola bars, coffee, and chocolate snacks were on the pillows. (I had a beer for breakfast lol)
I loved the quilts and the beds and the pillows all so very soft.
The garden was so lovely, the hot tub (we hope to share a glass of wine and a story next time), and the neighborhood was the most quaint.
I felt like we were teleported to another place and time inside your upstairs.
This Airbnb is a must stay!"

Plus, Nebraska in springtime is priceless."

2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Above and beyond hospitality! Stayed here with a group of 5 for a college friend’s wedding and had a wonderful stay. We weren’t around the house much but wish we were to enjoy the beautiful outdoor area more! Chuck and Mary were amazing - they made sure we were settled and had everything we needed. Wonderful to converse with but also respectful of our privacy. Such caring and kind individuals. The space was good for our group- if I am ever in Kearney again I know where I will stay!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Chuck and Mary are the best air bnb hosts I have ever had. The bed rooms were perfect, they accommodated our every request and even gave us a lovely card on our way out the door.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly one of the most wonderful Airbnb stays I’ve ever experienced. The *place* has it all: walkable location, farmhouse charm. Beautifully outfitted with every conceivable comfort.
It would be excellent in any locale, but the icing on the delicious cupcake? Chuck and Mary. Hosts in the very best sense of the word, Nebraska-boosters, knowledgeable, helpful, AND Chuck’s an A+ baker and generous enough to share. Exceptional people.
Seriously, stay here if you go to Kearney for the cranes or any other reason. It’s a haven and a treat. We are so grateful for having found this wondrous spot."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"No detail was overlooked. Chuck and Mary take their duties as hosts seriously, in the best possible way. It felt like going to stay with an old friend who knew exactly what you'd need for your visit and was around if you needed something else but was going to leave you be otherwise. The rooms were bright and sunny with plenty of pillows for curling up with a good book and the beds were remarkably comfortable. There were fresh flowers in vases throughout - such a delight after driving through snow on the way there."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Heritage House is our favorite stay in Kearney. It is the upper level of the home with generous size bedrooms and a nice sitting area with plenty of homey touches, including home made banana bread! The hosts are very generous in helping with whatever your need may be. And of course we love the outdoor hot tub."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was planned as a relaxing trip for myself, my daughter and daughter in law. Everything we experienced from the space, decor, history of the home, the family whom occupy it now, all the personalized touches was priceless. We felt so pampered, respected, welcomed...what a gift. These folks should teach a class to all Airbnb hosts. We left feeling refreshed and joyful. Thanks, Chuck and Mary"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chuck and Mary are amazing hosts. They have thought of everything and are kind, fun and articulate. The space is generously sized, and they've included snacks, drinks, and even a bottle of wine. Chuck helped us carry our ""stuff"" both into and out of the house. My husband has Parkinson's disease, and the stairway to the second floor might have been a bit problematic, but thanks to Chuck's assistance all was fine. Rooms were spotless. I really can't say enough about how pleasantly surprised we were."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful experience staying at the Heritage House.

Staying in this cool old house is like stepping into a bit of Kearny history. And Chuck and Mary’s warmth makes you feel like you are part of their family. Except unlike family they honor your privacy!!! They truly go out of their way to make you feel at home. The beds are super comfortable, the shower is perfect, and the heated toilet seat with bidet is a real treat! Their outdoor garden area is beautiful and great for chilling, with both a cool pergola and hot tub! This will be the AirBNB experience you will compare all others to ever after!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful home that is only eclipsed by the exceptional people who care for the historic piece of Nebraska charm. It had everything we could possibly want, need, and so much more than I thought to imagine.
I wish we could have stayed longer; Chuck & Mary welcomed us at almost 9:45pm with spunk and energy despite the late hour, showed us around, and had cute touches all over the home to give our family a perfect stay. I won’t spoil any of their surprises, but if you’re lucky enough to book a night or two, you will be the hero of your group for finding this local gem.
Chuck has managed to maintain and restore all of the historic integrity, while adding a bunch of contemporary technologies that hang in the background but make the stay more comfortable. 1888 “thank you’s” and we hope to be back again some day!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Chuck and Mary where wonderful. Their place was wonderful and they were so welcoming to us. I would highly recommend you consider staying at their house if you are in Kearney.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Chuck & Mary take Superhost status to new heights through their attention to detail, generosity and creative personalized touches for guests. We were a bit road weary when we arrived so really appreciated their restaurant recommendations for dinner, a hot tub soak and access to their laundry machines. Their space is immaculate, lovingly decorated, and felt private. We enjoyed chatting with Chuck about his family's history and deep roots in Kearney. We also appreciated the home made goodies Chuck sent us off with as we hit the road again. We hope to return during the crane migration and stay with Chuck & Mary again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A perfect place to just get away for a day or if you can longer. Every picture shown is better when you see it for yourself. Chuck and Mary are the perfect hosts.

The bathroom is well equipped. Everything was very clean. There is so much history on the walls and shelves - you can explore it all. Chuck and Mary were very gracious in our communications and personally welcomed us with such cute and kind notes. We were very thankful to be able to stay there and loved it all.
Guests should note that the rooms are up a super cute and narrow staircase. Wasn’t a problem at all - but one suitcase at a time works best 😊"
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stayed here again on our way back through Kearney, and we enjoyed it just as much the second time through! :-)"

They were kind and communicative, and have an extraordinary attention to detail in their lodgings. I recommend them without hesitation."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We can't say enough about this lovely retreat. Chuck and Mary are so kind. They pay attention to every detail from homemade quickbread to flowers in every room. We enjoyed each room too: plenty of pillows and comfortable beds. The toilet itself is an experience (you'll see why). We relaxed in the hot-tub and used the sitting room to wake up slowly with coffee in the morning (October was too chilly for sitting in the pergola). Chuck and Mary even gave us a list of interesting places to look for on our way back west and a car bouquet upon leaving. Book this place immediately!

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice location in town close to restaurants and bars. We have stayed here twice on our way thru town. The space you stay in is the whole upstairs which has 3 bedrooms. All 3 bedrooms have interesting items to look at. Very well kept historic house with a great sitting area outside and a hot tub. Well stocked fridge and some homemade bread to enjoy with your coffee in the morning.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Chuck and Mary are awesome. They were very accommodating and personable. Our suite was cozy, clean and comfortable. Also, we enjoyed the special touches and delectable treat immensely. They are truly deserving of the title, super hosts."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Heritage House is a true gem, right in the center of Nebraska. My sisters and I have stayed here numerous times, and it has by far the best accommodations and the most fabulous hosts one can imagine."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome airbnb! I highly recommend this property.
Chuck and Mary are great hosts; friendly, welcoming, and have put a lot of effort into making a guest's stay pleasant. It's a historic old home, but doesn't feel like the typical old home, didn't have the creaks and things typical old homes have. Was sound and quiet.
They personally welcomed us even though we arrived late and showed us where to park (plenty of parking) and took us on a tour of the home. Also wished us a good morning each morning and made sure we had everything we needed.
The set up is awesome, three bedrooms that are separate from their living area, and also separated pretty good from the other guest rooms. Chuck and Mary had welcome signs and gifts for us; there's a coffee bar, a mini fridge, a tv, and nice sitting area. Beds are very comfortable. Nice patio area with covered pergola. Internet was just fine.
The bathroom is clean and fully stocked with linens and essentials. Honestly, I've typically been more of a hotel traveler because I like the conveniences of coffee, fully stocked bathrooms, etc that can be hit and miss at airbnbs. All those luxuries are taken care of at Chuck and Mary's.
One of my travel companions is a frequent airbnb user and commented this is the best airbnb he's seen. If we're every back in the Kearney area we'll be staying at Chuck and Mary's and I recommend you do to."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed in many Airbnbs and Chuck and Mary's place is exceptional in many respects, starting with the welcoming and responsive hosts, for whom hosting is a passion. They have lovingly restored this historic home with great attention to detail and the comfort of their guests. Chuck and Mary offered an abundance of amenities, including freshly baked banana bread, and we will long remember our stay. We look forward to staying here again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely phenomenal people with a gorgeous home! By far my best Airbnb stay! Everything was perfect!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Chuck and Mary welcomed us while traveling home for the funeral of a family member. This was the first time I had stayed in an Airbnb, and they absolutely set the bar high for any future experiences. It was a lot of fun to just walk around the space and see all of the pictures and historical items. It was kind of like visiting our own little Kearney museum. I was welcomed next to the house by Chuck, who pointed me in the direction of the garage where I parked my car for the evening. Chuck and Mary were very kind and welcoming, and they have thought of every detail. We were traveling with a kiddo and were pleased to find juice boxes and snacks, homemade banana bread, as well as toys and a variety of children’s books to keep him occupied. We definitely felt like welcome guests in their home and will look forward to booking again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Chuck and Mary went above and beyond to make sure I had a great stay. I loved the location, the comfortable room, the garden and all of the homey touches. Amazing experience—wish I could’ve stayed longer!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I chose to stay here because I was driving from Denver to Omaha and just wanted to stop ""somewhere"" in between. So I simply choose the Airbnb that looked best, and boy was I right! Chuck and Mary have a gift & a passion for making guests feel at home and then some. If you're anywhere in the vicinity, do yourself a favor and book a night or 10."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for the ultimate comfort ""stay"", just book this airbnb with Chuck and Mary. We have stayed with them each of the past three summers, and we will return again and again. The house is filled with history and charm, the location is convenient, and the hosts are the friendliest, kindest people you will meet on your trip. ""Over the top"" attention to details and the needs of guests .... and great stories when you have time to visit with them.
You will be glad you booked with Chuck and Mary."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Chuck and Mary and their beautiful Heritage House were the perfect stay in every way! Chuck communicated with us before our trip to make sure that he could have everything we needed, and when we were delayed and didn't arrive until 10pm, Chuck and Mary both greeted us with warmth and generosity. They helped us with our luggage and showed us around their guest suite full of character and thoughtful touches at every turn. They even had lovely beverages waiting for us. The beds and rooms were very comfortable, and we woke to delicious smells from the kitchen where Chuck was making a second loaf of banana bread with no nuts after he learned about an allergy in our family. This couple truly has a gift of hospitality and we felt welcomed like family on our visit back to Greg's hometown of Kearney."

My partner and I have basically been living in Airbnbs for the past year as we travel the country and this was our favorite stay by far! Chuck and Mary are so kind and the most hospitable hosts we’ve ever had. We planned on staying only one night but extended another night since the place was so lovely. They have thought of every touch from chocolates on the pillow to fresh homemade banana bread for breakfast. We look forward to returning to Kearney again someday and staying at Heritage House again!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Chuck and Mary were absolute fabulous hosts! This was our first experience at an Airbnb and it was great!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Chuck and Mary have truly the best Airbnb we've experienced. This is magnified by a unique gift of hospitality. They have made their upstairs suite into a lovely mix of modern and historic features and beautiful woodwork. Our visit happened to be on a sad occasion for our family and Chuck and Mary allowed us to invite additional family members to sit with us outside in their lovely, comfortable pergola and garden where we ate and talked for quite awhile. It was truly like an oasis. How blessed we were by them and their thoughtful gestures throughout our stay."

We have never stayed anywhere with so many thoughtful personal touches. I won't spoil any of them, but they were beautiful and thoughtful and made us feel valued and special. It felt more like visiting family than staying in a strange home. That said, privacy was plentiful. They were warm and friendly while managing to provide the privacy that travelers need. Not an easy balance to achieve I would imagine, but they made it seem effortless. I recommend them 100%. 12 out of 10 stars!"

I’ve wanted to live in one and staying here just confirmed how much I’d enjoy it. Great use of space, excellent decor and amenities. You’ll have everything you’ll need plus the added bonus of a serene environment complete with fire pit and hot tub! We got a surprise visit from the neighbours dog Primrose, the most loving and well behaved pup! The host was super helpful and quick to respond. If I’m ever in Kearney Nebraska again, I hope this place is available. Thanks Rachel for an incredible stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying in this tiny home was great! The place was so cute inside and out and matched the description and photos perfectly. It was easy to find and get checked in, and was clean and smelled nice. I would definitely recommend this to others and would be happy to stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A tiny house, as advertised! It was fun to see how it had been designed and had a lot of charming detail, like the sliding barn door."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Tiny Nest met or exceeded our expectations. If we get to Kearney again we will certainly consider staying at The Tiny Nest again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the tiny home experience. We had everything we needed.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super easy. Super smooth. My first time staying in a tiny home and it was lots of fun. It was a great place to stay while visitng for the sandhill crane migration.
Thank you!
Kathy"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying at The Tiny Nest. Our hosts were super friendly and helpful with giving us perfect tips to see the sandhill cranes. The location of the tiny house was very convenient because the cranes were in the fields nearby and we were only a 10 minute drive from good viewing locations on the river. As for the house itself, it was comfortable, clean, and cozy. Staying in a tiny house instead of an ordinary hotel room made the whole trip feel extra special. I would definitely come stay again!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came up to see the Sandhill Cranes during migration. We chose this spot for its proximity to corn fields and the cranes and it did not disappoint. They flew over the yard and were in the adjacent corn fields all day. Very cool. Our stay was easy. I think Rachel did a good job of describing her tiny home. I didn’t realize the steps would be a bit steep up to the bedroom and we wouldn’t be able to stand up in the bedroom, but we adapted and did just fine. The stairs had a sturdy handrail and the bed was comfortable. She had plenty of amenities. We hope to return one day."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just as described. It is a cozy place so be sure that is what you want. We were in the area for the crane migration. Very well situated for that. Interstate is close so you hear traffic when outside.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very pleased. We came to watch the cranes and location was convenient to town and the Audubon sanctuary.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at the tiny house. It was convenient to drive into Kearney. We were there in March to see the Sandhills cranes and there were fields near the tiny house that provided excellent crane viewing. We loved the tiny house and it had plenty of space for the two of us. The directions provided made it easy to find. If you have limited mobility the stairs to the loft may be challenging.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The tiny home should be called the cozy home! Rachel is a joy to deal with and has been there when we needed her. If you need a happy home base to come back to after your adventures, this place is clean, welcoming and restful. This was our third stay and we'll be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed for a night with my MIL and my 2 kids for a night of our spring break. We loved the Tiny House! It was very comfortable for 4 people, the furnishings were great and it was as described, really cute, cozy and clean. Easy to find everything in the home, and it was well stocked. We really appreciated the Brita pitcher in the fridge! Really convenient to The Archway Monument Museum and to the roadside blinds for crane viewing!
Rachel was responsive to messages and very helpful. There were also a few coupons for dinner places and we used one for Angus Burgers and shakes and it was a great, kid friendly recommendation! My MIL and I would definitely return sans kids to see the cranes again—and definitely stay here!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place and friendly host. Made for a lovely trip to Kearney.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We would stay there in a heart beat again! Close to a bike path, viewing Sandhill Cranes in the fields nearby and loved the decor and layout of tiny home. It was perfect for our Mother/daughter get away! Thank you Rachel!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely stay. The countryside/surrounding area is pretty, and there was a walking trail close by! The tiny home was comfortable and clean."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a nice stay, very private and outside of town. Pictures accurately depicted what it is, small but solid option for the price. Only problem was the breaker kept tripping and cutting the wifi, but host said they're going to fix that."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this space! We will definitely be back! Had a few animals come and visit us on our stay - very cute. Could hear the traffic from the interstate but was manageable and still peaceful. Have already been telling our friends and family to come visit this sweet little getaway spot!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is really easy to find, pretty secluded location, and super cozy. The house itself has a rustic charm that is very endearing, we loved spending time there. Bonus points because we had a HUGE flyover of American White Pelicans both mornings about 9:30. Literally thousands of birds. It was breath taking. We had a little trouble with the Wi-Fi, Rachel knew exactly how to fix it, gave clear instructions, and it worked perfectly. She also brought us some emergency coffee because we were out, 5 star host indeed.
It is a little close to the highway as some other reviews have pointed out, but it is not bothersome at all. My wife and I still enjoyed the hot tub both evenings and mornings, even got a visit from the neighbor's cat (neighbor's house is well over a hundred yards away and on the other side of a big stand of trees) who is super lovey.
Overall a great place to stay, everything works, it was clean, well maintained. We will definitely be staying there again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny home was the perfect getaway for my husband and I. When we had an issue, Rachel responded quickly and was very helpful. We have already talked about wanting to go back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying here- one of my most favorite spots on my way to Denver! Love this little tiny house. 🥰Peaceful, quaint, clean-& the outdoor space is a fun little hangout!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was an awesome place, we loved it there. A great place for a couple!!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was such a cute stay! Pretty much in the middle of nowhere but that made the experience very fun.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy and felt right at home. Perfect for me and my wife while traveling cross country. Rachel was responsive but also gave privacy which was perfect after driving 30 hours.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a phenomenal time and it was everything we could need for a night away! Super responsive host and communicated with us the whole time
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love it !
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Definitely would stay here again. Reasonable price and comfortable accommodations. A cute and cozy tiny home.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The tiny house was cute, clean, and nice. My granddaughter (3) loved the choice of d 3 different toddler bunk beds - she picked the middle one. It was very cold and windy during our stay, so the heater inside was unable to keep up. Fortunately, there were enough blankets for us to stay warm at night, and we were busy in town doing other things with family and friends during the day. Overall, it was a lovely secluded little place. It would be a nice place to stay if the weather were nicer. It has a nice deck with a grill and fire pit that would be really fun!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great place
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute, we had a fun staycation! Rachel was super kind to get the heat going for us in this Nebraska winter. 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazingly cozy place to stay. Beautiful outdoor space for relaxing.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,super cute! loved the loft space!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,it was our first tiny house stay and we loved it. the kids loved playing outside. At night with the lights on its so cute and relaxing.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,First time tiny home experience & it was perfect! We were obsessed with the house & we would love to stay again. Thank you :)
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This little home was spectacular! Such a calm and peaceful environment. Thank you for the experience! I’ve already recommended this place to friends!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was clean and smelled nice. The heating unit wasn't working well though so I had to use a space heater only. Also, the beds in the extra room were only crib sized mattresses and I didn't realize that. They would not be good for anyone but a small child. it was a fun experience for me and I would come back. The bed was comfortable and clean."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, great hot tub. Very relaxing"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had the LOVELIEST stay at this tiny house! From the moment we walked in, to the moment we walked out, we felt cozy and at home. Our kiddos LOVED the space as much as we did and they had SO much fun playing in the back room and swinging on the swings. We had everything we needed and it was exactly what we were looking for...a cozy space where we could relax and spend quality time with each other. It is really close to the interstate, but once you're inside the house, you can't hear ANY of it. Highly recommend staying here! :)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed here once before and loved it, so we came back! Such a cute place! Cozy and quaint and perfect for a quick night."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were so excited to get to experience a tiny house and so was our toddler. The hot tub was amazing after road tripping from Colorado. heads up if you have kids, make sure to put up the ant trap things if they are out. Also if you plan to use the pack n play be aware that the sleep pad is smaller than the pack n play surface area and may not work for your needs. It rained a little and in the morning the deck was icy so be careful in the colder months."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Reallt u u que place! Enjoyed my stay!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay at the tiny house! Dalayna was easy to communicate with and there were awesome directions to get there. this home was cozy and straightforward. I will be visiting again!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay off the beaten path by Kearney. Hot tub and great coffee were just a couple of the added perks of our stay here.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was peaceful and relaxing. The tiny house is adorable. Everything was comfortable, clean and well appointed. The head room in the loft was sufficient, but not abundant. If you have any mobility issues, this is not the place for you. Getting into the loft is a fun and interesting climb. We enjoyed our stay immensely!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very nice and we were able to check in early. It was a great place to stay and if we needed a place in Kearney again we (my wife and I) would likely look to return here.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful home that was very restful. We will absolutely be back!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The tiny home was cute. The area was private and cute. A couple of things worth mentioning, there was a very strong sulphur smell from the pipes/water the whole time and permeated the house. And the bunk beds are not twin sized they are crib mattresses, totally unable to fit an adult or bigger child. Outside is very pretty and private and relaxing. Loved the DVDs."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely tiny home, nice and private."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Really cute little house!:) definitely not for you if steep tall stairs aren’t your thing. We didn’t get to stay around as we were traveling, but what we saw was pleasant. The bed was comfortable. We did end up killing a couple big spiders and vacuumed a lot of dead flies, but overall it was a place to sleep and that’s what we needed. It fit our needs well."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My two kids and I had a great stay! The place is just like the photos and had everything we needed. The house is really cozy and peaceful. It was simple to find and check in. Highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love this little gem!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed there one night on a road trip. House was cozy and hosts communicated very well. House, especially the sleeping area, is cramped... but it is a tiny house. So definitely worth it if you're into that."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This has been one of my favorite stays! I've always wanted to stay at a tiny home and now I have a standard! There was a SUPER sweet, patient, gentle lab mix that said good night and good morning to us! Highlight for sure! Make sure to read the instructions first and it's so easy to find! Comfy bed, clean hot tub and ALL necessities are taken care of! A major gem!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay, cool little place. Loved how quiet and isolated the spot was."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay at and felt super safe
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our first tiny home experience and it was great! The tiny home matched the description and pictures exactly. We got here late and had a hard time finding the driveway, but Rachel was super responsive and talked us through finding the house as soon as I reached out. Overall a great experience."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a cozy tiny home right off the highway & super easy to access! The property is very private & secluded, no immediate neighbors. Private hot tub was very nice after a long day of driving.
I will definitely revisit this hidden gem my next time passing through!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I ended up not staying at the place. It is more suited to a more adventerous younger set. Being an older traveler and not wanting to drive out in the countryside (it is quite ways out) after dark the place was not suitable for me. The host understood my concern and we worked out an acceptable solution.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a hidden gem! Super easy to find off the I-80 exit and was so close! Loved the secluded little nest that you have! Totally great stay wish we could have stayed another night! Definitely will come stay again if ever back again. :)
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"2nd time staying here. The place is excellent, worth the price and the host is awesome!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"House was altogether wonderful. Loved seeing so much nature while staying there. Deer, fawns, rabbits, sand hill cranes and more!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute tiny home! Spacious for a small place. A little hard to find in the dark but once I read the instructions it was easy to find. Hot tub was a nice touch and an option for a bonfire was super cool. Overall a nice place to stay a short drive away from restaurants, stores and gas stations."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I’m really glad we stayed!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adorable and exactly as expected!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute! Nice, rustic feel. I really liked the corrugated steel walls in bathroom and on ceiling.
Nice location with a country feel surrounded by tall grasses, trees and a mowed walking path. While you can hear the traffic from I-80, it was far enough back that it didn't bother much while outside. Outside amenities include swingset, deck / lanai, firepit, extra chairs, decorative lights and a 2-3 person hot tub.
We enjoyed the hot tub after dark; the deck lights made for a nice ambience. Loft was roomy; two adult daughters slept there; I slept on the couch-bed combo.
Very nice space. Caveat for those with adult / teens; the bunkbeds are made for small children, not those past puberty. That said, the top bunk looks like a single full sized mattress might fit.
My only complaint was that I felt the need to dust the ceiling fan before using it; otherwise, a great place, nice location and lovely country / rustic feel with modern accommodations."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay! We were traveling through the state and Rachel's place was perfect! She was friendly, warm and responded quickly. Directions were accurate and easy to follow. A portion of the road to get there is gravel, but easily managed with any vehicle. Beds were comfortable and amenities were as described; the place was adorable. The loft bed even had fairy lights! The place is close to the hwy, which was convenient, but situated so you don't hear any of the traffic noise at all, making it a relaxing and peaceful stay! We headed out early, but got to see an amazing sunrise beyond the trees! Would definitely stay here again! :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We needed a last minute place and Rachel came through for us. The house was great. Cold air, warm hot tub, and the lights on the deck definitely added to a relaxing evening. I’d recommend staying here if you are good with sleeping in a tiny loft."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved this tiny home!! I’ve always been obsessed with tiny houses after watching the shows on HGTV. This was a perfect space for just me. Wish I could have spent more time there, but was just a quick stop passing through the state. The hot tub hit the spot after a long day of driving!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tiny house nestled just a couple minutes from town was a perfect stop for me on my cross country road trip.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were only there for a few hours as we needed a place to crash on our way home to Minnesota from Denver. Cute little tiny house.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a delightful tiny home stay right off of interstate 80. Dalayna was easy to communicate with and went out of her way to accommodate our schedule. We loved the outdoor deck and hammock, and would’ve tried the hot tub too if the weather wasn’t so hot. The home was well stocked with amenities and comfortably slept 4 of us. Thanks Rachel and Dalayna!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It's little difficult to find the location, probably because we got there in dark, otherwise it's a great value and a peaceful place to live in short term."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cute tiny house! Loved the black and white inside. Kid loved the bunk beds! The stairs upstairs are a little tricky and low hanging ceiling was hard to get used to but all was well. Thank you
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was great. Hosts were responsive. I would be happy to stay here again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First time in a tiny house and it's amazing what can fit. Everything was clean. We didn't use the TV or the DVD player as we didn't know how to get it showing on the TV. There is a nice selection of movies. When we were there the hot tub looked out of commission and the hammock was messed up so if you want to use probably ask about it. Loved the shower...clean and good water pressure. We are all about 6' tall so the only bed that worked was the queen. The sofa bed was too short, but we made do and the bunk beds were for small children and unfortunately one of the 6' boys had to squeeze in. Would not recommend here if you need larger beds. Obviously not the room for it, but our first time so we didn't know better. We wouldn't be able to stay here again, but it truly was a good experience."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"we truly enjoyed staying at this tiny yet wonderful place, it was out first time staying at a tiny house but we were gladly surprised with how space is utilized, super cool place to visit specially if you want to have a private little nest for you to rest"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a great place for us to spend the night as we drove West. Easy in and out. Close to Interstate.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot! Such a lovely tiny home!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a perfect pit stop along our roadtrip from Mpls to Denver!! Such a cute tiny home. We will definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I’ve wanted to stay in a tiny home for a while. Thankful we picked yours. Thanks for a restful stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing stay for our Anniversary! This place seems remote at night when we drove in, but the directions were spot on and so helpful. I appreciated the host's quick responses to my messages and even leaving the lights outside on longer for some added ambience. Beautiful place, great hosts, and peaceful surroundings. 10/10 recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rachel’s place was adorable and perfect for a quick and simple getaway without the kiddos! It was a fun little stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved staying at the tiny house! The instructions on how to get in were clear and the space itself was beautifully made. Would definitely love to come back!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect for us, two adults and two young children, as an overnight stay on our way West road tripping. The place was cozy, private and had everything we needed for the night. Will definitely stay again on our next road trip."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Close to paved walk/bike path. Lots of good birds to see.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stop and stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house is small/cute but very functional. The nearby city walk/bike trail made for some great walks.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My second time staying in this lovely tiny house. It was just as wonderful as I remembered. Comfortable, clean and cozy. You won’t regret this stay! On a road-trip through 11 states, and 8 different airbnbs, this one was the best by a landslide. Thank you, Rachel! Will definitely be back many times to come."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute tiny home that is spacious on the inside. Was easy to get to and get inside.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away from the city
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute and beautiful place. Thank you for opening this up to the world. we absolutely loved it 🥰
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away and get some peace and quiet
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a fun stay! I loved this tiny house and can’t wait to stay again! Cute on the inside, patio was a peaceful place to relax after a day of driving."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This Tiny House is very cute, in a quiet area and has all the amenities you need. Host is responsive. Check-in was very easy and instructions were clear, ahead of time."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Your tiny home is beautiful and so charming. Thank you for the peaceful stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very remote and quiet, perfect for passing through!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I contacted Rachel about an hour and a half before I came into town and her place was available. She got back with me quickly and was able to fit me in! I’ve always wanted to stay in a tiny home, and this was an exceptional experience. I am very grateful for Rachel hosting this place and have saved as a favorite for when I’m passing through in the future. Cozy. Comfortable. Quiet. Very well done. Lots of great amenities as well."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great tiny home!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,we liked it just the mess up
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Unique experience. The house is clean. Had a minor question regarding the location - multiple driveways off of the road, the house was hidden by trees. Able to locate after a couple of minutes. The entry instructions were very detailed - felt comfortable in the house - as noted earlier a unique experience to see and stay in a tiny house in person - a great perspective."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If we were to ever pass through again, we’d definitely stay here."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute place, and very cozy. Excellent for our very short stay passing through. Would recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay while traveling through the area!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is small, as it says. Tight for four adult-sized people (2 adults and two older teens). The downstairs double bed is probably better for one adult or two children. The upstairs was comfortable, but requires some agility to get up there. Otherwise, the place was as described and we had a good stay there. We did have the outdoor lights turned out to avoid the bug issue other guests had mentioned. The kitchen had everything we needed to make our meals there. We enjoyed walking the biking trail and watching the sun set."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place! Super cozy and clean. Quiet spot with a nice bike path nearby.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay. The home was cozy and clean. The host sent clear instructions ahead of time and was responsive.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So great to finally actually STAY in a ‘tiny home’ after seeing them built-out on HGTV.
This one is so cute, and so well laid out, it was just what we’d hoped for.
Rachel’s instructions were good, and this stay met our expectations!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A perfect spot to stay as I was traveling out west. Rachel's tiny nest was comfortable and had all the amenities that I needed. I loved getting to enjoy the outdoor space after a long-drive. The hammock was absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend this place to any and all solo-travelers, couples, and small families. Great location and value!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our family stayed here on our way to Colorado, it was our first time staying in a tiny home. We thought it was very roomy for four, not to mention clean and nicely decorated! We would stay here again, and would highly recommend this place too!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, unique experience in a tiny home! Place was very clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. We were originally worried about some bug issues around this time of year but had none there and they had a bug zapper that helped. Would recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and unique opportunity!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay here, it was super cozy and private while still being close to many places!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable, clean, and well-appointed... near the freeway but very quiet inside with windows shut.
I inadvertently left an item, and the hosts are going to mail it back to me, for which I am very grateful. I hope to return someday!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very cute tiny house. Was clean and fun to stay in. My large boyfriend fit well in it so tall people don’t be afraid. It was a lovely stay and a great price. Only down sides are no functioning fire alarms and next to a busy highway. Would come back again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Darling tiny house!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect stop on our way traveling through. Rachel was thorough and helpful. Recommend

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"cute place! very kid friendly. it was about 30 degrees the night we stayed and we were very warm and cozy!
a little hard to find via G**gle and A**le maps, but host called me right away and explained how to get there."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,our first Tiny house living experience was great. This place is convenient and bunk bed worked well for our 2 yrs old. Surrounding is peaceful and what exactly you expect in the middle of fields in Nebraska.. loved our stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome tiny home! We’d stay again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,adorable tiny house tucked away in a private location. felt right at home
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I wanted to stay!!!
I had only booked for the one night as I was traveling long distance but it was super adorable and the property was very private. I even had a small fire to enjoy. The Tiny House was designed perfectly and had all I wanted in a stay. Cute town as well which was only 5 mins away."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel's tiny house was very cute, comfortable, and had everything needed for a night's accommodations. Loved the deck."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a fantastic stay! Such a cute space :)
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time staying at a Tiny House so I wasn't sure what to expect.
I found that it had everything I needed for a comfortable stay.
The soft water was an added pleasure!
The only con was getting up the loft bedroom. That first step was a doozy going up and down for me. Thankfully, there was a very sturdy handrail there grab on to!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There’s a bit of a dirt road to the house, and it’s close to the Freeway… but the Tiny House is well built/insulated, and I couldn’t hear any traffic when I was inside. I’ve stayed in numerous Tiny Houses, and this one is especially nice in terms of design and layout. Has many amenities for a Tiny House. This is one of the rare designs with a staircase built in, so no ladder, but you will need to step up carefully and then crawl the last few feet to the bed, so keep this in mind. so for anyone wanting to try the Tiny House experience, this one is not to be missed. Very fun. Very comfy."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This adorable tiny home was well appointed and very comfortable! Lots of nice touches with things we could use and very thoughtful books and DVDs and even some games. The triple bunk beds for little kiddos was adorable. it's a nice space back there and we used it to store all our bags and as a dressing room. The kitchen was very clean & easy to use. The bathroom was surprisingly roomy and the shower was great. Towels and linens were very high quality. My husband and I stayed on the converted couch which was nice and firm. We slept really well. My sister slept in the upstairs loft which was very cool and comfortable for her, just needed to be careful walking back down. We had everything we needed and the location was great for going out to see the crane migration (April). The host was super nice and we were very pleased."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super fun place to stay. Bed upstairs was so comfortable.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place. Would be a great place to stay a few days. But it wasn't in the plans.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The communication with the host was so explicit and helpful. The tiny house is adorable. I wouldn’t recommend going there with tall are large people.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the Rachel's tiny house. Close to Kearney yet far enough out of town to give you a country feel. We would stay there again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"House was clean and comfortable - clever storage to allow so many amenities. We made dinner and breakfast and appreciated having some ""extras"" in the fridge and pantry (butter, spices).
We chose this location to be close to Sandhill Cranes on the Platte River and it was FANTASTIC!! -- convenient to local Audubon Sanctuary and to bike trail -- we walked to a pedestrian bridge over the river. Enjoyed watching thousands of cranes fly over the house over in the evening.
Would definitely return!"

Thank you Rachel for sharing your Tiny nest. Would love to come back again !
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfy tiny house with great amenities. Host was helpful and proactive with instructions.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cozy tiny house that was bigger than expected! I've stayed in a tiny house before and this was a very comfortable size with great amenities. Fast wifi, firewood provided for the firepit, comfy bed, and French press for coffee (my favorite). I was in town just for one night for the Sandhill Cranes and this was a perfect getaway off the beaten path. Cranes were flying directly overhead like a personal show. Magical experience!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed staying at Rachel's Tiny House near the Platte River! It was very close to great places to watch the Sandhills Crane migration and had gorgeous views of the sunrise.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, hiking trail very nearby, Cranes in the fields a block away. Very private, quiet, clean, it had everything we could possibly want. There was even a fire pit but the weather did not allow us to use it. Staying there really added to our trip."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a neat little place! Clean and cozy :)
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved staying in this very well-appointed tiny house! Perfect location for a springtime trip to enjoy the sandhill crane migration nearby. Would love to return once it's warmer so we can enjoy the ample outdoor space (patio, grill, firepit, hammock, beautiful big shade trees) provided as well. The host has thought of lots of lovely touches in the kitchen and bathroom. Ample books, games, and even some art supplies. Highly recommended."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a peaceful and private escape. Unexpected abundance if nature. We were simply trying escape for a a day or two. Sandhill Cranes and all the natural surrounding the area!!! We will be back for fishing and more sightseeing!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was off the beaten path very nice though, wanted to see what the hype of a tiny house was about, and now I get it n think it’s very cool. Thank you I will sagest to others needing place to stay at Kearney."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay and great host. The tiny house was clean and comfortable to stretch out and relax in. 100% would stay again.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for us to stay while working in kearney, close enough to town but far enough away to be nice and peaceful."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely little getaway. I would have preferred less noise from the nearby roads, but you can't really avoid that unless you plant more trees. The tiny home could use a bit of repair or updates on them lights as a few area burnt out here and there. The overall experience was comfortable and cozy though!!! Would definitely consider going back."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were able to get the house first in the daylight, however I think it would have been difficult to find in the dark the first time. The space is as described! It had lots of comforts in such a little space. Its well decorated and taken care of. It was a fun experience staying in a tiny house."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for letting me and my friends stay at such a short notice. Lovely place.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My partner and I really loved staying at the tiny home while traveling through Nebraska. The bed situation was so perfect and cozy. My only complaint was the couch. There were so many stains that we didn't even want to sit on it. Other than that, our stay was great."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean! Super cute aesthetic which is a plus for me! Out of town which is another plus! I love the quiet areas. Very cozy! My son loved the bunk bed as well!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We've stayed here before and loved it so much that we came back again! I wish I could pack this place up and take it home with me! Rachel is lovely as always! We definitely recommend this stay for a reset away from the business of life!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great place to stay very clean and organized
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a pretty good stay, it took awhile for the house to warm up when we got there and in the morning. The stairs to the loft were a little harder to maneuver than we thought they would be. The shower was nice and warm and the couch was comfortable too!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachel’s home was the perfect spot for my one night in Kearney. The directions she provided made it super easy to check in and the layout made her home feel much bigger for it being a tiny home. Rachel was also a great communicator and was even kind enough to stop by and provide a spare key so I could get inside after I accidentally locked myself out. If In Kearney again, I will certainly stay here again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed here several times when I am in town for conferences. I love the location (that it is on the outskirts of town) and especially the firepit! I look forward to staying here again next year.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place for rest and relaxation and to experience tiny house living. The tiny nest is a quiet peaceful spot. For those that want more it is close to activities and restaurants. I appreciated the close proximity to a fine walking trail. The fall colors were beautiful and the walk enjoyable. The tiny nest is overall stocked well with needed supplies for a pleasant stay. The outside deck and the area for a bonfire are a great way to relax and enjoy nature. A little treasure with hosts that aim to make your stay a great one. Plan to enjoy the Tiny Nest again in the future.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Tiny Nest was the perfect place to stay for a weekend getaway. The house was so cute!
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay and is a great stopover on the way to CO - convenient and right off the interstate. Our second stay did not include the 3rd bunk mattress shown in the picture, therefore confirm with the host if this is a need. Our kids love the Tiny Nest!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A very cute place. Rachel is a great host. very private and quiet location. we enjoyed our stay.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This tiny house was cute! I was in town for work orientation and worked well for me. I liked that it was outside the city. You can hear the interstate traffic but wasn't overwhelming and it was disclosed in the description. Washer and dryer was a plus. Rachel was very nice and always responded to messages quickly.

It was fully equipped with a fully stocked kitchen, and there were books, videos and games for entertainment. Overall, it was a great place to stay. We'd come back here if we were coming through Kearney again."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful. Extremely quiet. There were a few safety issues that could be improved, such as adding a chain lock, fire extinguisher, labels for light switches, and treads on the loft stairs/safety handles for left-handers descending. The lock-box ought to be replaced. The road was also blocked by farm equipment during work hours and, with only one access point, cars just have to wait until the combines and wagons move in order to proceed south on Sweetwater during work hours. The grounds are nice for walking around, and the setting is very nice for just enjoying time on the deck."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfy, private and unique! The perfect place to stay on our cross country journey. The host is very friendly and responsive."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved this place! Super cute and better than a motel..

Great communication with Rachel throughout, and we especially appreciated her recommendations for nearby places to eat (we loved the Thai restaurant) and hikes as well. We would love to come back and stay longer. Peaceful, comfortable, and everything we needed. Thank you!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place to stay! Very comfortable and clean.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Adam's place was a comfortable, clean, and well-furnished home base for us during the UNK graduation events. The house is nicely situated in the city... close to campus and to amenities and restaurants. The neighborhood is remarkably quiet, and the fire pit area in the backyard is a relaxing place to gather and enjoy some down time.
We recommend Adam's place to anyone seeking a house experience in Kearney for a few nights. We enjoyed our stay."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely would use again.
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was cozy.
Adam didn’t get back to us on a few things. Response wasn’t in a timely matter.
Dishwasher didn’t work, Xbox didn’t work, fuse ball table was broken, which are amenities we were to be able to use. Sheets and linens in the dryer still, there were stains on the basement bedding. Bathtub was a little claustrophobic for us!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This would be a great place for a young family to stay. We were a group with two couples and a single. All of us are middle aged to seniors. Claw foot tub was difficult for the seniors to get in and out of for showers, I hadn't thought about that when I booked. It is a cute house and has a great outdoor space."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adam was very accommodating to our needs, even at the last minute. The house was exactly as described, very comfortable and welcoming. Fire pit a huge bonus! Definitely recommend and we will revisit when we return to Kearney."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were staying for work. This home was set up if we wanted to socialize or wanted some down time, you could get both. Very spacious. The yard and fire pit was great! Also, appreciated the coupons. The only suggestion I would have is to have more ice trays. Otherwise I wouldn’t change a thing!"

I would definitely stay here again! Thanks, Adam!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really liked the home. We felt very comfortable. Adam got back to me right away when I had questions. We visited Pioneer Village in the neighboring town of Minden so the location of the home was perfect with easy Freeway access. Kearney offers many great restaurants! Also we visited the Archway Museum on I-80, it too was awesome! Great place to vacation."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Comfortable sweet little house. Adam and Stephanie were very responsive. We had an issue with a chair, not a big deal to us, just wanted to make them aware. They responded quickly and were very apologetic. Appreciate the response. Great value and very quiet neighborhood. We really enjoyed our stay. Will try to book again if in the area."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A real gem of a spot. A safe convenient place to stop if traveling. Exactly what we needed on our cross country drive.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely one of the best Airbnbs I’ve ever stayed at!!! Definitely recommend
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mary’s place was amazing and very homey. Check in was super easy and the cottage was in a great location.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Clean
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,we had a good stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,we loved staying at the cottage! after spending the whole day in the car it was so nice to meander through Mary’s property and walk to the river at sunset! the cottage was spotless and we felt safe & comfortable!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,owners are opening a pathway to hike to Platte River which is very close to cottage. house could be listed as a tiny house! very pleasant and pretty quiet. a few miles from commercial bustle of Kearny. I personally wouldn't stay more than a couple nights as it is so tiny. I love to cook and no stove but every other kitchen appliance available. the placement of bed felt a little tight.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thus is a great little rental thatvis super easy to get to from the freeway, clean, cozy and quiet. The host is great at communicating and it was a great stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice CLEAN tiny house. Porch was nice and the location is private.
Perfect for a layover type of stay, and the nearby river was peaceful to walk to. I didn't see nor interact with anybody on the property, though there is a security camera covering the parking spot for added peace of mind.
Just what I needed on my trip--nothing fancy, but nothing lacking."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We were here very briefly to check out the sandhill crane migration. It was well situated to get to the sanctuary early in the morning and the free coffee was very welcome! It was very clean and well appointed.
We would absolutely stay here again and wish we could have been there for longer to explore the property.
It was a bit chilly the night we were there and had to have the heat on. Unfortunately the heating unit was quite loud (but very effective) and would kick on and off throughout the night. It would have been easily manageable with ear plugs."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It so refreshing to have a quiet evening and a great nights sleep after the noise and traffic of Chicago. We had a great stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect little cottage - private, clean, cozy, and a short walk to the river! We decided not to drive to the lookout bridge like we usually do and we got a gorgeous view of the cranes flying overhead at sunset. 10/10"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Small, but very clean and cozy. Felt very much at home."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Mary’s place! I was visiting for the crane migration, and Mary’s place was a short, convenient drive to some of the best viewing locations. Plus, it’s right across the bridge from town, which has a lot of good restaurant options, so it was the best of both worlds. Overall I had a perfect stay and would definitely return!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It’s obvious Mary has taken a lot of thought into making the crane cottage, so appealing. Everything is tastefully decorated. We enjoyed walking down to the river, she even had two chairs down there to enjoy the peaceful scenery. We drove approximately 10 minutes to the.SRA park to see the cranes at dawn. Very convenient location near the interstate. Exit. Close to town for food."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic small space. Clean and quiet. We were able to walk Mary's property in the evening to the river to see cranes flying over. This property is also roughly 5 miles from a wonderful recreation area for Crane viewing.
The Crane Cottage has a porch for relaxing and a grill for cooking dinner. We had all the basics needed. Would definitely stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just about an ideal spot to drive quickly to the Audabon Rowe Sanctuary to see Sandhill Cranes.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the cutest little house!! We only stayed the night but it was as described. Loved that they had creamer, coffee, and a few breakfast items for us. There was a nice path to walk down to the river too. We will definitely stay again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This a is a great private space tucked right off the hwy with good accessibility to restaurants and entertainment.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was quite small, but very, very clean. Mary was a great host and was responsive and friendly. She gave great directions and instructions.
It was cute, but very small. The super cute front porch area does not have a nice view...it is of a large fence, another house, and a major highway. Also, there was no storage area at all to put stuff and the bathroom was tiny and hard to get ready in.
HOWEVER...this property was very, very clean. It was cutely decorated. The host was fantastic. The bed was hard to get into but surprisingly comfortable. If I were to travel alone or with my husband, I would stay here again for a night or two. I would also recommend this stay to others, but give them full details to know what to expect."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a great stay at Mary's place! We came to watch the Sandhill Cranes. The location of the Airbnb was perfect! So close and cozy too! Communication and check in were great. We would definitely stay again!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfy and very clean place to spend the night. Location is close to crane migration hot spots. I enjoyed my stay!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary’s place is a cozy tiny home that has everything you need in a stay. Regardless you are here for a day or a couple of days, this place is perfect."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute place but difficult to find at night due to inadequate lighting. And it’s kind of dangerous slowing down, to find the place on that busy stretch of road."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very welcoming and chill. Gracious and accommodating to needs
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great love shack. Tiny house very near the water. Plenty of wildlife, primarily birds. Migrating, and local. About 20 turkeys in the morning. If you are over 6 feet the bed might be short. A wonderful respite from interstate intersection motel rooms just a mile away."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,will absolutely stop through again when traveling for work!!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just a place to lay your head serves its purpose

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great stay
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When I was traveling through Mother Nature had bestowed all her winter wrath and when I arrived the pipes were frozen. Mary quickly addressed the issue and I ultimately was unable to stay. This was totally not her fault! The space it self was SUPER CUTE AND COMFY! I loved it from the moment I walked in. Mary was so polite and gracious that she helped me to figure out other accommodations and went above and beyond what I could have ever expected. If I ever come back through, and as a traveling nurse always on the road, I am more than sure I will, this will definitely be a go to stop for me! I cannot speak highly enough about Mary! She really was a top notch host! I would give her 10 stars if I could!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy and comfortable stay with an easy check in and very friendly host.

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We stopped here on our way home from Utah for Thanksgiving. It was so very cute and cozy inside!!! Perfect for couples. Mary was awesome. It was just what we needed.
Admittedly, the surrounding area isn't much to look at, and we caught the smell of manure from the neighbor's yard when we pulled in. BUT you can't smell it from inside, and it's perfect for when you just need a place to stay the night.
We had a great time and would definitely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This SDU is a perfect place to stop when driving across Interstate 80. Everything was brand new, and it was much faster and easier than stopping at a hotel. There is a home nearby as well as the business. I really enjoyed the walk to the river. Nice, quiet, cozy stop for us. Description was accurate so no surprises."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place overall was beautiful. the exposed brick is what sold me. the place was nicely decorated. honestly it was well stocked and then some. everything was labeled with instructions to make it easier to use appliances and such. the only complaint which in the grand scheme of things was miniscule was a squeaky floor but the building is old with history. we would love to stay again though!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely coming back! This was the perfect balance of cozy and busy where we could find things to do on the street or curl up on the couch with a book. We loved the spacious kitchen with the unique cabinets and so much was provided for utensils and cooking supplies. Access to the gym was a nice perk. Getting in and out of the space and building was easy - loved the option of not having to carry key cards around with me.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"After a long car ride from Utah we really enjoyed the warm welcome! The fully fenced in yard was also great for our kids and dogs to run around in after sitting all day. Finally, the house was very clean and comfortable. Great place to stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had 6 of us and fit very comfortably. Easy instructions on checking in, cleaning up, and checking out. Will use them again if we need a place to stay in Kearney again."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We were there for one night, so the house was clearly too big for us (but WAY better than staying in a hotel). Everything was cozy, clean and easy to figure out. If you are a larger group, you will like the bedroom space, especially if the kids can hang out downstairs in a separate living room area. The kitchen is small, with a tiny table for two. There is a folding table that can be used. For two, the kitchen space was fine. For a large group, it would be less helpful. The backyard space is great for kids/doggos.
A coffee table is needed in the main living room area. The garage was the main reason I wanted the house, since our truck was fully loaded. I should have confirmed the space size as our pickup truck didn't fit. Note that the house sits on a busy road, but road noise wasn't a problem.
The one big negative - I would strongly advise the owners to forego their political views, featured as the password to the house and their wifi password. Enough already."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Shad and Ceann's! The house is in a very quiet neighborhood. It had tons of space for several people to spread out. And the backyard was huge, lots of room for our dogs to run and play in! They were easy to work with and great hosts."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first Air B&B stay, and we really enjoyed it, our children didn’t want to leave! We really enjoyed our stay there, everything was clean, had water, snacks and coffee provided and the owners were very friendly and responsive. The street it is on is a bit busy, but the neighborhood nice and peaceful otherwise. Would stay again, thanks for a great stay!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"House was really cute!! Extremely clean- kitchen was well stocked and had all the necessary cooking items.
Furnace worked well since it was below 0 temps.
We struggled with the keypad but host replied immediately to help us.
WiFi was the only issues as it kept dropping off after about 30 second once connected so the TV wouldn’t work and our devices but we spent time visiting"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay here on our moving trip across the country. Having the garage to park our packed full car took a lot of stress away.

2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Five girlfriend get-together..halfway between CO and MN.. personally we liked being able to do our own cooking, listen to music, dance, play games and just hang out together in our own space. Shad and Ceann's airbnb was clean and in a nice, central location not far from shopping and dining.. and a short drive to Cottonmill Park. Fenced in back yard and patio table was a plus, also the garage to park our two cars was nice! Shad and Ceann were very accommodating. In speaking for myself and the other girls, we all agreed this airbnb was a good find and we'd definitely go back!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Awesome place to stay with great amenities. They provided towels, extra blankets, toothbrushes, tooth paste, shampoo, condition, more than enough of what we needed for my bowling team to stay for a weekend. Even an extra table and chairs which came in handy when playing cards and eating a meal together. It was a great time! The basement space is a tad chilly compared to the upstairs. Turning the thermostat up will cook the upstairs out while the downstairs remains a bit chilly. Perhaps an extra spare heater would be nice. But it wasn’t anything to ruin the stay by any means. Overall, really appreciated everything!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house was a great alternative to a hotel stay for our extended family that came into town, from different areas, to attend a wedding. Great communication with the hosts, everything is as represented in the listing. The home was clean and updated, beds were comfy, plenty of towels and extra blankets, etc., lots of space for congregating and visiting—upstairs and in the basement—with enough room for having your privacy when needed.
As a pet-friendly BnB, the fenced back yard was a perfect area for our furry family members to safely romp and play and have some outdoor time without the need of a leash. Lots of off-street parking area in the driveway, thoughtful touches throughout like bottled water in the fridge, a snack basket in the kitchen, and essential oil diffuser in family room.
We would definitely stay here again the next time a family event brings us to Kearney.
Thank you Shad and Ceann!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a family trip to watch the bird migration and this was a wonderful place to stay. It was stocked with amenities, like lots of Keurig cups, shower supplies, and condiments. It was very comfortable, we used all 4 bedrooms. It was clean and nicely decorated.
The basement had 1 of the bedrooms and bathrooms plus a second living room with a large TV. It was noticeably cooler down there but we all slept well. Plus it has train art on the walls down there and my 5 year old son was in heaven that he got to sleep there.
The hosts were communicative and very nice. It was easy to come and go and we were happy we could use the garage. It was an added bonus that they don't require you to do a ton of cleaning and laundry before you leave. They make it easy on the guests."

Loved being able to have a fenced in area for the dog, so much better than a hotel! Host had thought of so many little details like coffees, travel items (in case you forgot any) and just genuinely made the property so welcoming. It was also really great to be able to park in the garage given it was negative temps and our truck was loaded with belongings. We were very happy after a long day driving.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is so cute, clean, and comfortable. The hosts went above and beyond to get ESPN2 added to their cable package when we mentioned we wanted to watch the NCAA volleyball championship. It was cold outside during our stay, but the heater worked really well. Parking the car in the garage was great for the winter. The house is about a mile from the cute shops and restaurants in downtown Kearney. The hosts thought of everything, including so many adorable Christmas decorations. They responded to every question right away. We highly recommend this home."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were blown away by the cleanliness of Shad and Ceanns place. They were so accommodating to our need for a one night and made it feel very homey. The extra step of adding decorations and having things available in case of items being forgotten (deodorant, toothpaste ect) was such a thoughtful step. Nice backyard and a nice living space downstairs that was perfect for our kiddo to run around.
I recommend this place to anyone needing to stay in or near Kearney."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing Place. The hosts replied so quickly to every need. They are kind, helpful & provided a great home for my family & I. Would recommend 11/10 (:"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is adorable and the beds are really comfortable. The living room has a very warm “home” vibe. Sitting on the couch watching TV felt like I was at home.
The area for our pets was awesome. It took a load of stress off letting our pets roam the yard without worrying they would get out.
We ended up missing our reservation date completely and showed up an entire day late. They first emailed me asking if everything was alright because they were worried about us. They then worked with us and let us stay on the date we got into town instead of when we had reserved it. They could have held us to our date and charged us extra but they were very kind and generous.
They are people I would gladly do business with again and the house is adorable. What else can you ask for?"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were moving to Nebraska for a new job and our house was not ready. Then we found out we were not getting the house we were promised. Ceann and her husband went above and beyond what was necessary to help us. They were able to provide lodging for us until we got a house, they even offered to rent is their own personal rental. I would recommend this air bnb to anyone coming to Kearney. The house is so beautiful and comfortable. We loved our stay!!!!!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"lovely, clean home in a nice neighborhood, with accommodating and nice hosts. Definitely recommend!"
,,,"The host was kind and helpful. The tiny home was cute on the outside. We could not really hang outside unfortunately, we got attacked by mosquitoes and headed inside. Even inside after keeping the door closed it had many insects that got in.
We ended up having to set up our baby tent to utilize the net mesh to protect our toddler and ourselves from being bitten at night by the mosquitoes. We didn’t get the full experience of this place unfortunately because of that.
Another issue we encountered was the water. Not sure if there is a filter or if you could add one but the water was grey and smelled like sulfur. We skipped baths and showers. And took off right away when the sun came up.
The bugs got into our van too. We see why the area is filled with birds, lots of snacks for them. We are so sad our experience was not the best.
Pluses are we appreciated the tv and dvd set up as it helped calm our toddler after a long road trip. It had a cute space for kiddos and the loft space."
