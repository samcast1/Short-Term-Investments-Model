2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay at Alan’s place! Perfect for a small group staying the weekend to visit Holiday World nearby. Peaceful/tranquil with plenty of cute farm animals!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Alan’s place is pretty isolated and rustic. The spiral staircase is a little difficult to navigate with large and heavy luggage buy we did manage. To Alan’s credit he did offer to help via a previous email but he was busy mowing hay when we got there. There is a stray golden cat that was a tripping hazard around the spiral staircase and did jump in our car on our toddlers lap. When my wife lifted up the cat gently to remove her it did scratch her so be careful around it as Alan says it is a stray. The place was very rustic with plenty of wood to decorate the walls and ceiling. Their was a beautiful new handmade dining room table and new stove and washer and dryer which all worked wonderfully. The loft is over a large garage and has a deck that is about 20 ft in the air. We felt some of the wood rails had large enough openings for our toddler to fall through so something to consider for staying. One morning we were awoken at 6:50 EST by barking dogs and there was occasional garage noise
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have a stayed here a few times and it is always clean and welcoming. I really enjoy sitting out on the deck and watching the farm life.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My mom and I loved this property and would like to come back. It was very peaceful and just the getaway we needed. We enjoyed seeing the farm animals and the cats! Highly recommend.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So incredible!!! Wish we had more time to stay longer that’s how amazing it was. The farm, the loft and just everything was a dream. Thank you so much Alan."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,the property was beautiful and well maintained. Alan was a great host and very curious in everyday.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Allen and his family were so kind and made us feel right at home, we had fresh baked cookies when we got there by his amazing wife.
The place was so peaceful right on their farm with a pond to swim and fish with a slide for adults and kids to enjoy!
We booked for one night and loved it so much we had to book for another.
The home was so beatiful and stunning as well.
We will definitely be back!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a unique place to stop! It was just off the beaten path and peaceful. The wood paneling gave the space a ton of charm. I would def stop here again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved it!!! It was so peaceful and his home is so cozy! Getting to places was so easy and not too far from where we were. Kind people and very helpful when we asked questions. would definitely recommend to others. We will definitely rent again in the future!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a really cool loft cabin. Your kids will love it.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had an awesome stay. The covered porch was great to watch the stars and sunsets.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful rental on a farm in the country. Very peaceful and fun to watch the animals, pigs, cows, sheep, lamb, donkey, ducks, chickens, kittens and dogs. The hosts are excellent, very responsive and easy to get ahold of. My husband and I and our two dogs stayed for 6 weeks in the loft. The loft is beautifully done with lots of storage. The kitchen and bath are fully stocked with all the essentials you may need. The king bed is very comfy. I would highly recommend this rental."
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was nice until a local reached out about who the host was. I recommend doing research on who you book with before doing so.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome spot to have some land with an amazing deck with great views of the ponds and animals!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, quaint setting, short drive from local necessities. Nice little farm!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing property and a great place to spend the night.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You can’t help but arrive, take a look at your surroundings, a take a deep breath and let it all out. It’s that tranquil of a place. Listening to the sheep, looking at the ducks and water, smelling the wood from the loft. It’s just beautiful and I will book a stay at a later date when it’s warm and can explore the outdoors. Alan was very accommodating to my last minute needs as I am a travel nurse which I appreciated so much."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and well upkeep. Loved the location and how peaceful it was. Great deal for the price. Highly Recommend!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cookies, kittens, and a cool place to stay! Unfortunately, we were traveling and only had one night to stay here. Great place!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay with Alan and Amy. It was fun seeing all the inventive work they put into building The Loft. For a tall winding stairs it was very user friendly and easy to climb. Also the hosts offered to help with luggage several times. The porch/deck was great and would be a great place to hang out in warm weather. The Loft was very comfortable and livable and very well thought out with lots of ingenious storage spaces. I enjoyed the deep bath tub which was easy to get into and out of. My daughter LOVED the cats that visited us on the porch and playing with the kittens in the morning. My husbands favorite was the plate of divinity Amy left on the table for us. The farm setting and all the animals were relaxing and we felt very safe leaving our car partially packed for the night. We would definitely recommend their bnb to others & will return if in the area again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, quiet and secure parking for our vehicle filled with personal belongings, out in the country. Front door and shower window need coverings for privacy but other than that, great stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This Airbnb was a great stay for what we needed! It had plenty of room and was very cozy.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,super nice place
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I have stayed at both of their places a total of almost 10 months in the past 1.5 years. Always a delight to stay. Both places are always clean and the property itself is gorgeous. Alan and the family are great welcoming people, always happy to go out of their way to make you feel right at home.
Can't recommend their place enough. It's been my favorite out of the 40+ I've stayed at.
Gaslight is near with good food and Schnitzelbank is the best German restaurant I've found in the US."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay. Peaceful homestead/farm atmosphere. Gracious and hospitable family. Would stay again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Peaceful country loft. Would definitely stay again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay at Alan's. It was the perfect location for a weekend getaway with my brother and Dad. The ponds were perfect for fishing during the day and dining table was perfect for games at night. Even enjoyed a few movies on the SmartTV...which included ""A League of Their Own."" If anyone is familiar with that movie, you have to take a tour of League Stadium downtown Huntingburg. Its where they filmed the home games for that movie. The tour was fantastic."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed at Alan's properties multiple times when in the area. They are always very nice!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect place to stay for a weekend fall trip to Holiday World. The loft was clean and ready for us when we arrived. Alan was quick to reply to my questions and was very accommodating. My son and I had a good time. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alan was very kind and helpful throughout our entire stay. The loft was beautiful and the surrounding area was so peaceful and wonderful. It is a bit far from restaurants and things like that, but we knew that going into it. It was nice to unplug for a few days at this beautiful place. Alan was responsive and friendly and even made us cookies when we checked in!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a peaceful place! The cookies are delicious and so thoughtful. Vallarta Mexican grill is delicious.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I came and stayed in the loft for a night on their families beautiful farm. We couldn’t have enough good things to say. It was just what we needed. The farm was beautiful and so peaceful. We enjoyed sitting out on the deck and watching all of the animals. Listening to the ducks was my favorite. We also loved being able to walk around and spend time with each other in such a relaxing environment. We will definitely be back and hope to bring our family.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed here multiple times. Very scenic place off the path. It's very relaxing after a long day or work.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,amazing time first air bnb definitely comeback again and again
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described. Location was brilliant to see my son in Oakland City. Peaceful, relaxing and lovely surroundings. Has 3 fishing lakes which was perfect for us to fish when relaxing. Caught large mouth bass in all three plus a Blue Gill and a Cat Fish each. Just perfect stay. Tarts on the table were delicious. Thank you for a great stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was wonderful! Everything so incredibly clean & it was such a cute loft! There were homemade cookies on the table that were delicious & my kids loved the animals that were all over the place. We also fished in the ponds and caught a lot which my kids also loved! It was a dream weekend.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"fabulous place in the country. super clean cabin, terrace to watch the animals. definitely recommended"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A peaceful, beautiful place to stay. We loved seeing and meeting the animals and found the loft to be comfortable and clean."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We would stay again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an idyllic stay! Great hosts and beautiful surroundings. We enjoyed the farm setting and animals with a nice walk through the property and great views of animal life from the loft deck. Beautifully hand-crafted loft and furnishings with everything we needed. Cookie treats were a lovely welcoming touch. Thank you!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I stayed here with my mom and brother on our way to the Lucas Oil Golf Course. It worked out well. We had everything we needed at Alan's place. The set up is very functional.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"as a travel nurse I've stayed in many airbnbs. this is by far one of my fave! peaceful, beautiful, Alan and his family are very attentive and kind! I was greeted with homemade goodies each time I've stayed! I highly recommended any of their homes. The loft though is just beautiful!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alan and his folks have a great place to stay. The space was very clean and the homemade sweets on arrival were great. We brought our three dogs (two of which are bird dogs) and took them on walks around the farm which was probably the greatest part of the whole place. The three weenie dogs did bark at our dogs a little bit but were easily shooed away with the help of my wife, if you bring your dogs just make sure you bring leashes and you’ll be fine. Overall, this was a great place to stay, super clean, relaxing, and away from city life. Wouldn’t hesitate to stay again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, cozy and peaceful. We will return."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great space for a quite retreat getaway. It was just what we were looking for in the area!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay, it was absolutely perfect. We were greeted by a bunch of little farm animals and homemade chocolate chip cookies! The place was clean and spacious. We will definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very beautiful inside the loft. It was cute seeing all the farm animals and lots of scenery. My only two slight grievances were the door to the bedroom that led out to the garage. I wasn’t too comfortable with the idea of a door that led to outside in the place where I slept. Unfortunately, it led to some difficulties sleeping for the first two nights. My other comment would be, when the dogs were outside, it was a bit difficult to go up and down the driveway. They would get close to the car and make us worried they would get in front of it. As mentioned in other reviews, you are staying over a garage so there will be noise occasionally. My boyfriend loved the cookies that were provided. Reasonable pricing, Alan was very polite, and accommodating. Overall a great trip!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazingly reasonable price!!! Didn't inflate cleaning or service fees. Friendly host and friendly family! Children were very polite and respectful. Alan was very proactive with communication and covered all matters, including messaging me on Saturday to say he wouldn't be available, but left a person to reach for electrical or plumbing issues. Couldn't ask for a better host and experience! Future possible guests should be aware that they are staying over a sometimes-active garage and workspace that was quiet during 'normal' quiet hours. Thanks for a wonderful stay which included delicious fresh bread waiting for consumption upon arrival!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved this stay. I needed a place to stay after visiting Holiday World and this place was amazing. The Loft was so beautiful and had a home-y feel to it. The view of the lake and the different animals was incredible as well. The host, Alan, was more than welcoming, very responsive and helpful, and always open to questions. I will definitely stay here again, it was outstanding. 😁"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing! So peaceful, and surrounding with animals. We felt right at home from the time we arrived. Alan was communicative, kind and went above and beyond. This will be a must-stay for us for future trips!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Alan’s loft is WONDERFUL! My friends and I had a blast! (And appreciated the cookies at check-in AND the ketchup being brought up to us when we reached out!)
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place loved the hand built country feel. The farm was great family moving around the property was very polite. Could tell lots of hard work and care went into this property. Loved the family feel. Great place would stay again if heading to Holiday World
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great host, the cookies where fantastic and kids appreciated the popcorn. The home owners turned on the lights when we pulled up late. Great location and spot, thanks for the nice stay."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place has a rustic cabin feel. It is kind of like glamping.
It has a beautiful deck, which overlooks two ponds, sheep, and pigs. This was our favorite part of the place. There is a walkway and space to take your dogs out.
It has a washer and dryer in the bathroom. It also has a large TV with Roku attached. The beds were comfortable, and there was enough space for our family of four as well as our dog.
The family was super friendly. There were adorable wiener dogs that announced our arrival. They were quiet at night though.
It definitely is farm life, which some may like and some may not. There is animal poop pretty much everywhere—including the parking area. We never noticed a smell in loft or even on the deck.
It is a great value."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed the country loft very much. It was great to have homemade cookies upon arrival. We loved the scenery and farm animals. It was very private. The deck furniture is great. We loved the giant sectional in the living room and the big screen TV with streaming channels. It was only 3 miles to town for restaurants and groceries. I gave it 5 stars. The only thing I want to warn parents about is that the bedroom does not have a door. If you want privacy from your kids while vacationing, this is not the AirBNB for you."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,It was just what we were looking for in a stay. It was private and a beautiful area with a peaceful view of the land from the patio! The kitchen was equipped with plenty of dishes and cookware which was desirable for us as we stayed for a longer period and like to cook at home. Alan was very responsive and provided us clear instructions on how to find the location.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time there and we loved it even more! The host is amazing and super helpful. There was new living room furniture. The king size bed was comfy and there were lots of drawers, cubbies, and surfaces to make you feel right at home. We cooked several meals there and LOVED sitting outside on our private deck! The beauty there seeps into your soul. Watching the ducks in the three small lakes/ponds, the sheep, cows, hogs etc. is super fun too. It is a perfect place for us. It is for sure, a place we will go to again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great stay. Wish we could've stayed longer to explore the homestead and lake a little bit, but the whole place was very cozy."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just as described, cookies at check in, very friendly hosts."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely long weekend at the loft! It was so nice to enjoy the rain from the covered deck, watch the farm animals, see lightning bugs and walk around the lake with our dog. The bed and pillows were comfy and the kitchen was great to cook in; had just about everything needed. Loved the cookies — thanks!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Alan was a lovely host! He greeted us when we arrived, and they had homemade cookies waiting for us inside the Airbnb! The location was very peaceful, quiet, and the animals were all very adorable. We would stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! So awesome to see the homestead and how accommodating they are to guests. Can’t wait to come back with my kids
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I had a wonderful stay. This is a great place to visit if you're looking for peace and relaxation.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The loft is a cozy and peaceful location with a great view of the land! t's private but close to downtown Huntingburg. it was extremely clean and had a great space!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We came out from southern Ohio to be with our kids and grandchildren for our granddaughters graduation from kindergarten . Our grandkids got to pet the farm animals, the views are amazing, I can't say enough about Alan very accommodating fresh cookies on the table after a six hour trip hit the spot as long as his place is available we definitely have a home away from home. Alan we didn't get to see you before we left but from the bottom of our hearts THANK YOU VERY MUCH 😁👍!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Alan’s place was easily one of the coolest Airbnb experiences we have had. From the spiral loft staircase to waking up in the midst of an amazing farmland….This stay was worth it! He was kind and informative, and even left a special treat of cookies for us on the table. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful and beautiful surroundings
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Relaxing atmosphere to unwind. Beautiful loft with a super comfy bed, Roku TV, games, books, and lovely deck view."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall we had a nice relaxing stay
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, very relaxing and easy clear instructions to get to. Had everything I needed and more for a peaceful little get away."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful farm
Really great people
Nice getaway"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alan's place was an amazing getaway for my wife & I. We arrived on Thursday evening, lounged around that night and all day Friday. We went out exploring some on Saturday but came back to relax and enjoy our evening!!
Upon initial check in we were greeted with fresh chocolate chip cookies that were amazing.
I had tons of questions the first night and Alan was super responsive and came to assist with everything we needed.
The animals were fun to just and watch and gave the place an added touch. We can't wait to visit again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very peaceful and quiet, Mr. Alan was extremely accommodating and responsive. The loft was clean and amenities were fantastic. Plenty of room for up to 4 guests. There isn't any easy access if you are not able to handle steep stairs, and make sure to download offline maps ahead of time. Overall an amazing and very comfortable stay."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a genuinely kind family!!!! They made us cookies! Their son offered to help with our bags! It’s a paradise farm with unbeatable views of a gorgeous little lake. Perfect 10!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable and peaceful get-away. The woodwork is beautiful and they even left homemade cookies to welcome us! Lots of little amenities were available for us as well!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I wrote another review before. Nothing has changed. It's a great place to stay. I have now been at the loft for over 3 months. Recently switched to their other place on the same property. Happy to stay at either.
They are extremely friendly, accommodating and accepting. Stayed at many places over the years from bnb, can't recommend either of their places enough.
I'm a DN, the cell based internet is a minimum of 10Mbs at both. So enough to do most jobs and have clear video conferencing. Hasn't went down so far in snow or rain. The recliners are great at both if that's your style."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A cute & secluded loft on a farm, that comes with all the added features a farm has to offer such as the sounds of ducks, cows and pigs! Was nice to sit on the large deck and listen to the animals. We were greeted by 3 orange extremely friendly cats who hung with us on the porch, which we loved! The interior walls/siding was so beautiful and made this loft one of a kind! Our host also had homemade cookies waiting for us upon arrival which was such a nice touch!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Charming, charming, charming! Delightful owner to work with, and just a perfectly quaint place to stay with any small family! Clean, updated, and lots to see on the grounds!! We had a terrific stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quiet, clean, beautiful, accessible.
Can’t say enough good things about staying at the loft!
We arrived late in the evening and to our surprise, two of his sons offered to carry our things up stairs!
The property is beautiful and very restful to stay there. Would recommend staying here time and time again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was an absolutely wonderful stay, but cleanliness in hospitality were beyond. we were greeted by the host and his beautiful family, his wife left fresh baked bread on the dining room table with a lovely note. the location was absolutely beautiful and only minutes from our destination at Holiday world. communication was amazing, and we would absolutely stay again! 😊💚"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alan and family made this such a great stay! Was in town for a friends wedding, and when my the button on my dress broke they provided me with a safety pin within an hour of asking. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Amazing place, highly recommend. Have stayed at both their places now.
I'm a DN and generally stay at places for a few months at a time and loved it out there, already booked again for another 3 months.
Pros:
Comfy chairs/beds
Great heating/AC
Quick hot water
Beautiful views from the covered patio
Good internet ~15mbs
Huge TV
Very friendly people.
Cons:
Spiral staircase can be a challenge for some
There are a number of kids which can make noise, but it was never bad.
Side note:
It is country life, so you will have nature around. Allergies can be worse than in the city.
Highly recommend staying here over the hotels in town."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay at the Loft. We felt like we were back home at our farm.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem of a place. Stayed here in Huntingburg 3 nights while visiting Holiday World. Alan and his family were friendly and helpful with any questions we had. If you are looking for a fun Airbnb with real nice folks, beautiful scenery, and downhome charm then you should stay here."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect for our stay at Holiday World. Slept my family of 4 comfortably and that king size bed was so comfortable!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Alan's Country Loft was a wonderful and scenic place to stay. The bed was comfortable, kitchen well equipped, living room with a great TV and excellent WiFi, and spacious bathroom including a washer and dryer. The view from the balcony of the pond with its many ducks was so beautiful. Highly recommend booking you AirBnB lodging at Alan's peaceful paradise!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely family Great communication and was an absolutely beautiful place to stay. Was welcomed with homemade cookies ❤️ We had a beautiful tranquil stay in this lovely loft
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Myself and my two boys stayed here for our trip to holiday world which is a short drive away. The hosts are friendly and good at communicating. We were greeted with fresh baked bread and jam which was so good. It was great to have a kitchen to cook dinners in. We will definitely want to stay here again the next time we come to Holiday World. We did not have time to explore the farm but the view from the deck was beautiful.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Friendly and helpful!! Location is beautiful and peaceful. Highly recommend
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alan’s place was beautiful! Wonderful scenery, lots to do, and the loft was also beautiful! It had everything we needed and more! He was super friendly and always answered me back quickly! I’d definitely recommend his place!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home. The host built it Himself. It has to beautiful ponds on either side of it that are absolutely gorgeous. And the hosts are so kind. We drove all the way from Florida and they offered to run into town to pick up dinner for us. An absolutely wonderful stay, looks 5x more beautiful in person."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a beautiful place! We loved everything about it!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very hospital hosts and a great place to watch the farm animals.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unique find, great views, lots of storage (drawers and shelves) to spread out a little. Washer/dryer and short soaking tub too. Great experience for my 1st AirBnB with the family! Close to Holoday world would stay again great value and quaint spot!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was overall great. The family were very kind and even offered to help us with our bags. The space was very clean and tidy. Personally, I was a little surprised that the loft was connected to the main house; the lakes and farmland is shared with the busy family. Definitely would stay again; great host."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A welcoming host, property, and space! After coming off of a 2.5 week long belated graduation trip out west to national parks, this was our final stop before heading to our home in Cleveland area, Ohio. After seeing the previous reviews, and pictures, we were sold! As part of our group headed to Holiday World, which was just a short 25 minute drive, it was a great place to lay our heads for one final night of vacation. Alan and his wife were very helpful and gracious. The space was extremely clean, comfortable, and welcoming; including some delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies! Great communication from the host family, and the willingness to help carry items up the spiral staircase. If I return to the area, I will be sure to stay at this beautiful loft again! Thank you again!!!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The host family is very gracious and hospitable. The Loft was spacious and clean and provided everything that we needed. Especially enjoyed the large deck where we could watch the farm animals.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We felt like part of the family on this homestead. We were treated with homemade bread and a sweet spread. Spacious rooms, a space to sit outside and watch the animals, comfortable beds, so quiet and clean, easy to commute to. Indiana is a neat state. Thank you for sharing your home."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brinkmeyer Homestead was the perfect location for our holiday in Indiana. Memories of my childhood summers with my grandparents on their country farm were always just a glance away. John and I enjoyed early morning and late evening walks along the farm road, watching the animals and listening to the birds. My favorite sounds were the ducks, especially the mallards. Doves joined us for coffee on the porch early in the morning. Our host family spoiled us with homemade cookies, bread and raspberry jam. If you are looking for a restful vacation spot, this is it."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Sweet place to stay with homemade cookies at check-in!😊
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a unique, lovely spacious loft on a farm. Very quiet, charming and relaxing. Had everything we needed. Hosts were very. welcoming! A treat. Large deck overlooking pond and farm."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice secluded and private place. It was very clean and had all of the amenities possible. This is a great location if you are planning a trip to Holiday world. This was only about 20-25 minutes away. The hosts were very welcoming and available if you needed anything. Would highly recommend this place, we plan on returning on our next trip to Holiday World!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as described.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very clean and comfortable place to stay! Would definitely return!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a gem! Beautifuly crafted loft that's very private, quiet, and in a beautiful farm setting with a great view from the deck. The loft is above a pole barn, and faces the back of the farm property overlooking 2 ponds. Everything was available that we needed and more! They had fresh homemade bread waiting for us when we arrived and other snacks provided. This place was so clean and unique. I was so impressed with everything! The only thing that could be an issue for some is that you access the loft by climbing a spiral staircase, so it might be difficult to carry large items up, such as a cooler, but there's a fridge, so that's not really necessary. Otherwise, I recommend this place highly!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay! The loft was immaculate and spacious. The host was very friendly and easy to communicate with. We enjoyed seeing the farm animals and the home made cookies!

Off the beaten path, but not hard to find. All the peace of the country life, with every amenity you’ll need. And, if you’re lucky, you might find a home-baked treat awaiting your arrival.
You can feel the love these hosts have put into your home-away-from-home. Highly recommended.
I wish we’d had more than one night, as their guests."

They have the sweetest kids and several times they brought me and my mom baked goods. Which by the way are DELICIOUS. Place was very clean and nice. I highly recommend. Moving to the cottage on the property this month and I’m sure it’ll be a great experience as well.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our hosts were very gracious during our stay. We were greeted personally upon arrival and giving a tour of our place and invited to hike the property if we so desire to. Our state was exceptional. Every amenity was provided that we needed during our stay. I would highly, highly recommend it in a place for a small family or even just a single traveler to enjoy the nice tucked away part of the Midwest where is quiet and peaceful."

Jason is a fantastic host with great communication. Very helpful that he is so specific with directions and instructions for the home and area around it. We spent lots of time hiking the trails (I found an amazing walking stick:), sitting on the porch drinking coffee and reading, sitting at the fire pit, playing games, warming up in the hot tub, and just hanging out inside this amazingly cozy home. This was the perfect place to get away from all the busy hustle of life for awhile. We can’t wait to come back.
Tina."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin and friendly and helpful host. Feels remote even though town is only .8 miles away. We enjoyed the hot tub and firepit and just relaxing. Furniture is new and comfortable. Cabin was very clean and had a little welcome basket with ingredients for s'mores!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The only thing better than staying at Jason’s house is….. staying there again! Second time for us. Even better than first time. Wonderful location.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very rarely do you run into someone who goes the extra mile for a stranger, customer or not. I was traveling with my wife for a conference and it was her birthday. I wanted to do something special. I asked if Jason would help me secure a gluten free cake and put together a surprise for when we arrived. On a gentleman’s agreement he did that and a lot more. We walked into beautiful flowers, balloons and a good bottle of wine. I can’t say thank you enough.
The home was beautiful, the property as a whole was wonderful. Everything was as advertised and exactly as promised. Thank you Jason, you made a friend here."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect house.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jason’s place was a true 5 star experience from check-in to check-out. He delivered on all fronts. The house was spick and span and felt professionally cleaned. It was well appointed with lots to do on the property and very serene. We traveled with our two children 2 and under and he even installed baby gates for us at the top and bottom of the stairs. Every detail was thought through and it felt like a true high-end experience. We loved our stay and can’t wait to come back again soon!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great house! Nice amenities and wonderful location. Will likely come back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,2nd time I’ve stayed here and it was just as great as the first time!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Home was very clean and Jason was very accommodating. You feel like you are checking in to a luxury hotel with upscale furnishing and appliances. The views from inside and outside the home are great and having the pond and surrounding tress on the property offers a nice relaxing place to just unwind. We felt very at home here and plan on staying again when we are in the area.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"BEAUTIFUL house and property. My family had a wonderful week staying here. Fishing, board games and puzzles at night in addition to a few movie nights. Small town atmosphere that was relaxing. Jason was an amazing host and responded within minutes of our questions or requests. He provided us with tons of information up front too which was so helpful to plan. We 100% recommend staying here and would definitely return again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a blast at Jason’s property. His property is so serene and aesthetically pleasing. My kids absolutely loved making s’mores and fishing at the pond.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Jason I wanted to thank you for sharing your place with us. It was a magical weekend. We loved getting up early and sitting on the patio with a cup of coffee and listening to the orchestra of birds welcoming the new day. I can't think of a more perfect way to start a day than that. Your place is beautiful and very comfortable. I couldn't get over how you thought of everything we might need and the charcuterie board was over the top and much appreciated. Thanks again for your hospitality and we hope to visit again some day.
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice place. Great location
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location. Beautiful house. Very nice host. Couldn't be better.
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was the perfect blend for nature lovers and the great indoors! The house is new and beautiful and so clean and comfortable. The views of the forest and lake are beautiful. We saw deer playing in the water and baby squirrels, turtles sunbathing, mother goose on her nest…
The outdoor space was our favorite. This kids could play in the woods and build forts, the porch was so comfortable with rockers and a heater.
We loved walking the trail around the lake and especially loved hiking through the beautiful rock creek.
Mud boots are a must!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was absolutely wonderful. The location is close to town but has the feeling of being remote. The home was everything described and then some. Jason was a wonderful host.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was as beautiful as the pictures showed. Peaceful! Easy to get to and Jason was easy to communicate with. Great host! We did a girls weekend and it was perfect from beginning to end. I would definately stay there again. Great patio and fire pit. Beautiful scenery!
Aaron's review said it all. It was perfect.
They did a great job with the amenities. It had everything we needed and then some. Just a great place to get away to but close to home. Loved it!
Judy"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow! Everything was as advertised - just a little better! Jason is a great host. He contacted us beforehand to make sure he had every detail for our family covered. He went the extra mile to leave a few extra items for our family to make it a great experience.
The house is a gem - it’s the lake house in the woods everyone wishes they had! The location is remote enough to feel secluded in the woods and yet close enough to be downtown French Lick in literally 60 seconds. I’ll bet this place is gorgeous at every time of the year. The house is brand new. So everything is super nice. The appliances are all new and flawless. The washer and dryer were clutch as we were going to the water park.
The house was stocked with toiletries, great soaps and shampoos. Good stuff too, way better than a hotel. The towels were also amazing.
We will certainly be looking Jason up the next time we are planning a vacation to French Lick. I can definitely see this becoming a place we go regularly."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason was an excellent host. He was very responsive and helpful. As in the photos, the home and property were beautiful. My family and I would like to revisit soon."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is such a great, easy stop if you need somewhere out of the way to stay for a night or however long! Pet-friendly for sure! That was so appreciated and helpful for us (was helping my sister move her and her three cats across country). Samantha was extremely nice and easy-going, always super responsive. Lovely basics inside and very clean."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Samantha & Jeff were both amazing and extremely flexible! The place was exactly as they listed it. I found myself in a predicament that required me to stay another day and they helped me out as much as possible. They answered the questions I had about the area. I was even able to purchase fresh farm eggs from them! I’m blown away by the hospitality they have shown both me & my kiddo! We will most definitely return in the summer again. Thank you so much for a wonderful experience!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot to stay if trying to enjoy the surrounding activities but don’t need all the bells and whistles.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great hideaway close to Fort Lick and Jasper. We enjoyed the proximity to Ferdinand State Forest and other hikes in the area. Place was neat and tidy and spices and cooking supplies were great for our hideaway. Will return when in the area 👍🏼

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, Samantha was very attentive and responded quickly to messages. My only negative is that the location is not walkable friendly, as long as you're not an avid walker like me this place is perfect! It's close enough to everything yet secluded & peaceful! We are so grateful she allows dogs & look forward to staying again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Samantha's place was perfect for our needs. We didn't spend a whole lot of time there (mainly needed somewhere to shower and sleep) since we were out most of day. Place was clean, bed was comfortable and check-in was super easy. We would stay again if its available when we return."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband needed somewhere to stay on his way home. This was a perfect spot and just as described!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very quite and peaceful, the host is right next door. They have an adorable lil girl who thought I was grandma lol ! Samantha and her family are very helpful and thoughtful"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We’ve stayed before for an event in French Lick last winter and it was peaceful for sure but very empty. Samantha has added new furniture to make it feel less empty and we really liked seeing the changes that were made! The air conditioner is easy to use and you can set it however you like. We really liked how quiet it was. The phone service is terrible but her WiFi is top notch! Very fast and with iPhones the phone service wasn’t an issue because they can call and text on wifi. I would 100% recommend this stay and with it being our second time down there I’m sure there will be another trip and as long as it’s available, this is where we will stay. 😊"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"During our delightful two-night stay in Dubois, IN, we found the Airbnb to be exactly what we were looking for. The cozy space served as the perfect landing pad for our exciting weekend adventures. After full days of fun, it was a relief to come back to a place that was so well suited for both us and our furry companion. The amenities and comfortable atmosphere made our stay even more enjoyable. We're truly grateful to have found such a wonderful place, and private place to land on our memorable getaway this weekend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Samantha’s guest house is perfect when you are visiting this region. It is an easy drive to many of the major attractions in the area. It is a clean and spacious alternative to a hotel. I particularly enjoyed its proximity to Patoka Lake. It was nice to wake up and drive just a few miles down the road for a morning hike on the Federal Property at Patoka Lake. I appreciated Samantha placing some of her fresh eggs in my refrigerator. They made a great breakfast!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The place was easy to find and she was very quick to respond to messages. Safe area!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My only suggestion is a nightstand. There was no place to put phone or clock or remotes.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet rural location. Close to French Lick, and Patoka Lake."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, peaceful, comfortable place.
Great for bringing your furry little friends to.
Samantha was always responsive to any question or problem I had.
The bed was extremely comfy, the space large and useful for anything I needed, and just overall wonderful.
Highly recommend this Airbnb."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was exactly what we needed. A nice quiet night in a clean place at a decent price.
Samantha was easy to communicate with.
One tip, have your check in instructions printed or saved in a screenshot because there is little cell service. Once checked in the Wi-Fi does work great."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed every minute, everything you need you have ."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,nice
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Samantha was super responsive and we had a great time. Definitely would recommend they to friends and family

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"if you are looking for country side vacation trip, this is the place you need to go. We had a great stay hosted by Samantha and Jeff. will book here again in future 😁"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great accommodations, well worth the price, met our needs."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had canceled the reservation and stayed for 1 day instead of 3 and she was very understanding. I'd give her 10 stars if it were an option. plan on visiting this location in the future if available.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great space, value, and very pet-friendly!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,good clean place to stay
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean guest house out in the quiet country side. The bed was very comfortable. Towels were nearly new and soft. Definitely a great deal for the price. Phone reception is poor yet the host provided WiFi that worked well. The only drawback was the furnishings were sparse. A nightstand would have been nice. The host couldn’t have been more welcoming. 👍👍
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Spacious area for all your traveling luggage. Nice shower with a seat. Comfortable bed! The tv worked but with it not being a smart tv or having a Roku or fire stick plugged in there was nothing to watch which was totally okay with me as I was ready for bed but my husband was a little disappointed that he couldn’t watch tv. She is however working on getting that fixed for the next guest!
The kitchen area has a full sized fridge great for drinks or storing dinners leftovers for the night. There is a table to eat at! Only one bed so it’s not good for more than a couple or a couple with a small child like we have. (We have a 3 year old). With the space we did recommend maybe adding a pull out couch for more sleeping space for bigger families.
Samantha was very responsive and was flexible with our late arrival time. She also made sure the light was on for us since we got in late. I’d recommend the place for a person or couple passing through that needs somewhere to sleep but it is not currently able to hold bigger families."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for a great nights sleep and not far from multiple activities in the area!
2022-10-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Driveway is to narrow if larger than a small car very possible to get the ditch, parking if larger than a small car possible to hit the building trying to get out of the parking. Inside the counter top dirty, possible mold on north wall, large cracks in the floors, I cannot recommend this place"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Nice wide environment. Only issue is any type of WiFi connection. The total area is not WiFi friendly!!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"If you’re in the area, you want to stay with Jeff and Samantha. They are wonderful people with a beautiful guesthouse. Not only is this stay well maintained, with a gorgeous front yard view, but the hosts were quick to meet all of my requests. They provided me the privacy I wished for while also treating me like family whenever I was looking for a conversation. All around, this is a beautiful place at a very fair price. If you’re in the area, you’re missing out if you don’t stay with Jeff and Samantha."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great value, and very comfortable space. I would stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place. Not suited well for boat trailers.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To me ,the solitude & peacefulness I find here , in a beautiful cabin hidden in the woods, is well worth the price of admission. Only wish I'd had found it sooner. You nailed it !"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Walk into the cabin and the world falls away. The large pond (with great fishing!) is steps away. At the end of the day, sit on the front porch and listen to the sounds of nature, enjoy the hot tub out back, or just chill inside. This is a special place."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Stayed here for a week and it was worth every penny. beautiful property and beautiful cabin. definitely a place to relax and unwind. Will definitely be back!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for a private getaway, this is a fabulous place! The property is gorgeous, and the house has lots of space. Our kids loved the lake, paddle boat, and hot tub. The house had lots of space to spread out in plus a beautiful porch to just sit and rest. The shaded area around the house is wonderful to just sit and relax in. Tyson is very responsive and responds almost immediately through the Air BnB app. He was great to work with.
A couple of key things to know:
1.) The house does not have Wi-Fi. It’s in the listing, but I missed it. We only had about two bars of signal the entire time we were there.
2.) There are lots of taxidermy animals heads in the house. It shows up some in the pics.
3.) There is no dishwasher or garbage disposal. The grill was not working when we were there so plan ahead for your meals.
We will return for a space that is wonderful to just chill in and get away from it all. We had a wonderful time."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is absolutely beautiful and is better then the photos!
The hot tub was SO relaxing. The place was spotless! It had a fully stocked kitchen so we could cook/eat in.
The views are amazing!
Our cell service was in and out at the cabin but that is exactly what we were looking for.
We checked out Washington and French Lick during our stay, both of which are great places to eat and grab groceries and were within a 15-20 min drive.
Tyson is an excellent host! We had very clear directions on getting to the place and clear instructions for check-in/out.
Our previous host had canceled on us just hours before our scheduled trip. We stumbled onto Tyson's place and with just a couple hours notice, he had his place prep and ready for us!! We could not be more thankful for all he did for us to still be able to enjoy our weekend get-away!
Highly recommend! Would definitely return!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place, location, and enjoyed taking my parents out to relax around an outdoor fire. Definitely would go back. Some really good eating nearby as well. Very nice place!!"

Of note, and did not impact our stay-grill was not functioning. I was alerted the day before arrival. But, if you plan to use it, you might check before reserving.
The cabin is beautiful, very clean, well-kept and easy to get to. Includes all the basics (linens, towels, a fully outfitter kitchen.) We really enjoyed the lake, campfire, and hot tub."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay was great! The cabin was wonderful & the location was beautiful. The pond was perfect for fishing and relaxing. The cabin was very clean and we had no issues.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Tyson’s cabin was a great getaway for a a couple of nights as we brought in the New Year! We had 4 adults and 3 kids ages 7 and 8. We all had a blast relaxing in the hot tub and enjoying the outdoors. Sitting on the porch was very relaxing and the views were beautiful. The cabin itself is very nice and had all the amenities we needed. The basement/TV room is great and had dish network so we could watch the Bearcats game! We would highly recommend this cabin and Tyson was a great host!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at Tyson’s cabin! We had young children, and the toys and outdoor exploration were great for keeping them busy.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful! The views are stunning! Great sunrises and the sunsets from the front porch are breathtaking! Easy to not want to leave!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for our family to stay. Tyson stayed in touch prior to our arrival and checked a couple times with texts to make sure all was going well during our stay.

Definitely recommend"
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"I booked Tyson’s cabin/property for my good friend’s bachelor party. I have to start by saying, this place looked like something out of a movie scene. I don’t know that any pictures could do this place justice. We brought kayaks to take on the pond to fish and lots of firewood for the evenings. (The bonfire area is lit with string lights) We golfed at the Country Oaks Golf Club and ate at the Gasthof Amish buffet, all within 15-20 minutes from the cabin. Overall, we had a fantastic stay.
Tyson was very easy going and quick to reply to any questions; I would highly recommend staying at his property."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property was absolutely gorgeous! We got to the property as the sun was setting.

2020-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"Very nice cabin, but wish we were allowed to use more of the cabin amenities- fire place. Would have been really awesome! The only other thing is not being allowed to walk around on the property. Other than that, was a great weekend."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very glad we found this place. It worked out perfect while we were visiting family in Jasper. The house was very clean and stocked with everything we needed for the week. The fireplace was nice to have on a couple cold winter mornings!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Way better than staying at a hotel - especially with a group of 4. Jasper is a great town for walking around, and this place was close to everything."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Michael was extremely helpful and responsive to our questions. We loved the house, and it's within 5 to 10 minutes from most food restaurants and parks. The internet was fast, and cell phone coverage was great everywhere. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for our vacation, we plan on making it an annual trip. DEFINITELY worth the price."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great accommodations! Immediately felt like home!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We plan to stay here each and every time we come to Jasper overnight. With two babies under two years old, this home offers more than enough space, privacy and things to do! My two year old loved spending time in the basement and playing with all the rocks around the beautifully maintained yard! My 9 month old daughter loved swinging on the porch swing in the mornings.
This home is well-maintained and includes any and everything you could need for your stay! My husband forgot his toothbrush and there were new toothbrushes for our convenience! We enjoyed the plush bathroom towels, all the amenities for the kids and the price point was perfect! Michael was so accommodating and even offered to help with anything we may need around town. We appreciated all of this so much! Thank you for your hospitality!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for a wedding.. We were able to meet with friends and enjoy Jasper. Coming back after a long day of celebrating we were able to sit on the porch drink some wine and just enjoy the peacefulness. When our plans changed slightly we were able to easily adjust our reservation and Michael kindly let us check-in early and was also flexible about check-out. We will keep it in mind for future visits back and recommend it very highly.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and i really enjoyed our stay! The home was super cozy, spacious, and clean. Excellent communication."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Michael's place is one of the cleanest ABNB's we've stayed in. The bed is very comfortable; bath towels were plush; kitchen well stocked and washer/dryer is nice to have! We enjoyed swinging on the front porch and having morning coffee on the back patio area. Michael communicated well with us during our stay and we will stay again next year when we return to IN.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here while we were in town for a softball tournament. Michael was a fabulous host and helped make it a great stay. Clean, comfortable, and as advertised."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Had a very relaxing stay in Jasper with our family of four. We've been traveling here from the east coast for almost 10 years now and really appreciated having a lot more space to spread out beyond our typical hotel room, and still a very easy and scenic drive to Holiday World. Had a tiny bit of trouble at the beginning of our stay but a quick phone call to Michael fixed the issue right away. Basement is a bit chilly even in June, but that could be a good thing if you're looking to cool down after a hot day! Nice large TV in basement - can plug in your own devices or use built-in apps. Upstairs living room was also very comfortable. Kitchen had all the essentials and allowed us to cook a few meals to save on eating out. Also a nice patio with grill, table w/umbrella, chairs, and even a smoker! (didn't have time to try that one out). Overall an excellent stay and host - looking forward to another stay in the future!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay in Jasper! The host has thought of everything it feels like. Wonderful visit and will stay here again if it is available. 😍
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Michael’s place is very comfortable and more spacious than I had anticipated it would be. The basement is chilly but it’s very large, where more air mattresses or beds could be placed if needed. The house is located right in front of the hospital so I was worried it would be noisy, but I heard not one sound coming from there. We have family in Jasper, so I would stay here again if our budget allows."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My father in law was getting married in huntingburg. This served as a great spot for the whole family to get ready and enjoy each other’s company. If in town we would definitely book again!
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This house met our expectations. It was plenty of room for our 4 teenagers to gave their own areas. Nice, convenient location that made it easy to access everything we needed. I would recommend this place for anyone looking in this area."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Perfect place to stay instead of a typical hotel. Nice house, living room was very comfortable, nice size tv. The kitchen had what we needed and more. Very nice walkable neighborhood directly across the street from the hospital. Well kept area, the home felt like we stepped back in time a bit, yet comfy & cozy and definitely had everything we needed. Michael the host is very quick to respond and on when caring for his Airbnb. We will definitely stay here every time we are in Jasper if it's available. 👍"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very nice place to stay with all the amenities of home plus a few extras.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael's home was nice and cozy for our visit to Jasper. Plenty of space to move around if you have more than 2 people staying. Neighborhood was quiet as well, beds were comfortable, communication was great, and check-in was a breeze. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for place in Jasper."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great slice of Jasper life! Classic Jasper home gives you a real feel to the community. Great location too. Five minutes or less to grocery store and fast food places. Pizza delivery nearby too. Perfect house for a family of 3 - 4 especially if you’re visiting family in the area. Enjoyed our stay a lot, and hope to return soon."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and conveniently located! Host was quick to reply!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Classic Jasper home! This house has all the charm factor of the well built homes in the area. It is spacious with comfortable beds and very clean. The basement is also nice to have as an additional space.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very inviting and so much space. The yard is huge. My daughters softball game got rained out so the team came over and played wiffle ball in the yard. 5 stars hands down.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Great location in Jasper, with cute ‘grandmas house’ feel. Yard is nice for watching sunsets and wildlife. Michael was very helpful and we’d look forward to staying again."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Nice unit (needs a blow dryer!) but otherwise very sufficient! We were in town for the Eclipse and it was a perfect location!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay for adults
Nicely decorated, cute little apartment.
Would not stay with children under 10 or who make noise.
The small space was fine but it should be noted that there were no other children seen in the complex, and apparently we received a noise complaint on Sunday morning.
Re: privacy - There was a motion-triggered security camera at the top of the outside stairs in the neighboring apartment, so in order to enter the apartment, the security camera captured my family. Unavoidable.
Host agreed this was not a good fit."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for such a clean and quiet dwelling.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was very nice and well kept. Felt brand new. If you stay here make sure you double check the parking map as I did get a parking ticket for parking in the wrong parking area.
The bath towels could be a little bigger. They are more child size than adult size.
Overall it was a great stay. Would stay here again."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was clean and walking distance to downtown locations as well as other locations we wanted to see! The apartment was clean and comfortable!
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,The apartment was clean. Two of the amenities listed did not work as well as expected and we were compensated. The air conditioner was so loud and made it difficult to gather in the living area. We turned off the air at night because it was difficult for our kid to sleep in the living area with the noise.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place. Stayed while working in the area. Would definitely stay again just to visit!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice and clean place. The host was very responsive and nice!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We found the apartment to be very cute and clean! We loved being able to walk downtown, and had fun taking our kids to a new donut and coffee shop a couple blocks away. The new Jasper Parklands is also a must visit! We loved our stay in Jasper."

2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Previous reviews indicated that the HVAC was very loud and it was loud on our visit, thus not fixed. Towels in bathroom were very thin and small and no bath soap. Disappointing that there was loud dog barking in lower unit from 9pm to 4am both nights."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Relax
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The location was great right in the heart of Jasper. We loved taking walks down to the square and to get muffins or donuts.
This specific one is nice because you don’t share the bedroom wall with another unit so we didn’t hear anyone around us during our whole stay.
The air conditioner is incredibly loud in the living room. It wasn’t that bad unless we wanted to watch tv then we had to turn it off.
We stayed here for awhile and truly did love our stay! The host is incredibly responsive and welcoming!
We’re are looking to coming back again soon!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pristine and lots of personality. This renovated mixed use property is well located near the square in Jasper. Highly walkable to restaurants, parks, and the new beautiful library. My family and I had a wonderful stay at the newly renovated historic property. We were visiting family in town, and it was nice to come back to a quiet and peaceful environment. The added interior decorative touches (ours was mid century modern) were a definite plus."

We were a group of four but this home could have held twice that easily. Thanks for a great place to call home for a few days!

Worth the stay!"

Probably the friendliest/most understanding hosts on Airbnb! Will certainly stay again in the future."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was spotless and cozy. They provided games and snacks and a variety of coffee. They provided shampoo, conditioner, body wash and lotion. I was very impressed with their thoughtfulness. I wish we could have stayed longer. I highly recommend this house."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a pleasant getaway! Our group had a very enjoyable overnight and had plenty of space to spread out. This feels like getting the keys to Grandma's house for the night. We truly had a fantastic time and will definitely return in the future.

On our downtime at the house, our son enjoyed playing in the yard, trying the keyboard, and practicing his checkers skills."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at Lynn's house. Lynn was very responsive about asking questions before we even started our stay. Itwas very easy to get into the house and we were greeted with some very nice touches such as sweets for the kids and just about everything you could need in the kitchen. There was plenty of room for our big family to stretch out and find something to do. it was wonderful having the three full size bathrooms for our big family stay. It was very peaceful and private. My son and I enjoyed having our coffee out by the gazebo in the mornings and about all you could hear was the birds and an occasional car going by. We also enjoyed the family pictures depicting the homestead that was across the street. There were pamphlets with information on what to do in the area. We went to Holiday World both days that we stayed and it was about a 25-minute ride.The house was very clean. We would definitely enjoy staying here again!

Host Lynn was very responsive. We will look to stay here again when traveling to the area.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,If you need the peace and quiet this is the place. Very relaxing. Not very far from town if you need a store or restaurant.

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a much loved home that is very welcoming and comfortable! Lynn has thought of everything you might need. We have never stayed anywhere so fully stocked, what a relief to anyone who forgot something. The landscape is heavenly. Highly recommend!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a fantastic time at the homestead. The home was large and had everything we were looking for in a great home away from home. The kids loved playing in the basement with the board games and toys. There was plenty of space for everyone to spread out, but large enough community spaces that we could all come together comfortably. We also enjoyed spending time outside away from the town/city. We appreciated the special touches -- like setting up the pack-n-play in advance, the extra snacks, and keurig -- that took this stay one step above the average. Thanks again for letting us stay at your long-held family property."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The ""Hoosier Homestead"" was a wonderful place to stay while on our family vacation to the southern Indiana area. I grew up on a small dairy farm near a very small town in Northwest Ohio, so any vacation with a farm and small town setting is perfect for us. My husband, children, their families and I, really enjoy the view of rolling fields and the small town of St. Anthony. We enjoyed the vintage pictures around the house, which gives a very sentimental journey back in time when life was simple. The basketball hoop, fire pit, grill, pergola and yard was used much for nighttime entertainment. Your location was perfect for all are daily travels like, Holiday World, Abraham Lincoln Homestead etc... Thanks for sharing your ""Hoosier Homestead""!!! P.S....The food at Rosie's Tavern was very good!! :)"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is in such a serene setting and we stayed because of the proximity to Holiday World.

This house has so much room and so many great amenities. The kitchen had everything we needed for meals. The bathrooms were especially nice and having access to a larger shower was extremely helpful. This house is far enough from town to feel like you are truly in the country. However, Jasper is very interesting and not far away if you want to explore a unique town in Indiana. This particular location is very historic. We very much want to stay here again when we go back to Indiana. Thanks, Lynn!"

Walking in to the Hoosier homestead was like going to Grandma's house. We immediately felt like we were at home because it was so comfortable and welcoming. You know how every time you go somewhere on a trip you always forget something? No worries if you're staying at Lynn's place, because there is literally everything you would need. As a matter of fact we even made a game of it. Chopsticks were the only thing we couldn't find, so definitely bring your own chopsticks if you're going to need those :)
Anyway, if you're looking for plenty of room, the comforts of home, privacy, and responsive friendly hosts, stay at the Hoosier Homestead!"

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice home in the country, beautiful scenery and amazing host!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lynn was so easy to work with, quick to respond, seamless check in process and nice touches of extra amenities!"
2019-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"It’s farm land! Which is exactly what we love and is what we were looking for! The house is really big and comfortable! There are plenty of dishes, cookware and utensils if you are interested in the use of the kitchen. There are 2 full baths and the house is laid out in such a way that everyone can have their own privacy. It was so nice to be able to spread out. There are no stores around and no breakfast food in the house. However, there is a very nice, large refrigerator and a bottom freezer. Bring what you want ahead of time. There is a nice sitting area outside and a yard that is big enough to play in. There is even some outdoor sporting equipment in the mud room. They have very comfortable beds and plenty of blankets. We had a great weekend!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Extremely clean and comfortable accommodations. Will be back next time I am in the area!
2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"House was very clean and accessible. The only notes I would make for future travelers would be: 1- go to the grocery store before you arrive in town. There are not many options and what there is closes early (around 8PM). 2- If you are using this property as place to stay for visiting Holiday World remember that HW is on CST and the house is on eastern. I guess our phones didn't update the night we got there so the next morning we showed up to HW an hour before the park opened. It made for a good laugh and good parking spot. Neither thing has any baring on the quality of the stay, which was great, just tips for future renters."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lynn and Sharon were wonderful hosts. Lynn's home is off the beaten path and was an hour away from a memorial service we attended. I was a little apprehensive about staying that far, but there wasn't many options available, that close, at a great value, and for the size of our family. I'm so glad I chose her home. The surroundings were very tranquil. When we arrived there was fresh baked cookies waiting for us...yum! Lynn's home has a lot of family history and it was peaceful, comfy, homey, and cozy. She also provides everything a family needs from the fully stocked kitchen, blankets and board games. My children enjoyed gazing at the cornfields and the pecan trees. If we're ever in the area again, we'll definitely rebook."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Overall we had a wonderful stay at this condo! It is brand new and exactly as described in the listing. The bedrooms are spacious and quiet.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place and a great course. Checked all the boxes. Thanks.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We brought our closest friends/family to see the Leeclipse for my husband, Lee’s 65th bday. I don’t know where to start, it was a fantastic place!! Newly renovated cabin on the grounds in addition to the main house. We were happy to have 7 bedrooms in total. We had privacy, beautiful grounds, fire pit and a large kitchen table that seated I think 14! Temperature in the home was perfect, every bed was comfortable, everything you could need was there. We had 13 people staying on the grounds and another 12 friends/family staying nearby but coming over for meals and of course the Leeclipse!! We golfed, went to the bowling alley, had dinner at the Schnitzelbank restaurant and a beautiful sit down dinner at Sultan’s Run. Chris was responsive from start to finish!! We were in constant contact with Whitney, from the tourism board who gave us a billboard to celebrate Lee!! There were gift bags too for my whole group! The local radio/tv station even did a story on us! It was perfect!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect place for a large Christmas family get together. great communication to allow for planning and very accommodating with questions and requests.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at Chris' place and only wish we could have stayed longer! It was a perfect spot for our family Christmas gathering with plenty of space for everyone in the family to sleep. I have stayed at many Airbnbs, and this one was by far the cleanest! I was pleasantly surprised with how well kept it was, and it made for a very comfortable stay. The view is beautiful and so serene! We enjoyed having the firepit and corn hole for the family. We can't wait to stay at Chris' place again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to rent for that home-away-from-home feel! Very cozy and close to everything in town, but also a quiet retreat!
We were greeted every morning by deer in the drive way and yard!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This was one of the best golf trips we have ever planned. A big part of that was bc of the customer service we got from Chris and the staff . The course took great care of us and the house was absolutely stunning. We have already picked dates to come back and stay at the same spot next year. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND! 10/10
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay for a big group who likes to golf!!
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was very nice. Chris was responsive to our issues. I think this house would be perfect for a group of golfers that wanted to share expenses and enjoy the week or weekend as a place to sleep. To be fair, the listing did not say the house was family friendly so perhaps it was not the best choice for our family vacation with a combination of kids and adults. There is no place for kids to play outside (but the fire pit was a big hit) and no inside amenities other than TVs. The rooms were nice and we did not need the 5th bedroom but it would not have been optimal since it was in a different building. The kitchen is nice but is missing some items such as cookie sheets and a pitcher to make tea. Our biggest issue was that the hot tub had not been treated and the water smelled and was dirty. The spa guy came the next day and he said they test it every week but I find that very hard to believe.
Again, beautiful house - for adults."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect place to stay with a group of guys on a weekend golf trip. Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful place to get away from it all and enjoy the beautiful scenery! Chris is a great host and he was very accommodating!

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Chris was a great host. Super detailed information sent before check in to make everything easy to find. Very accommodating when asked for a later check out time. The place was just as described!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home on the golf course.
The 5th bedroom above the detached garage was a bit surprising but it worked out for our teenage grandson."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Spectacular outdoor space!
Vicki & her husband (whose name escapes me) were fabulous hosts. Truly nice people!
The space was great & met our needs. Found the kitchen to be stocked with everything one needs and the beds were super comfortable.
The outdoor space was the star of the show! We brought 2 dogs and they had the time of their lives in the completely fenced in area, which surrounded a cute lil lake. We stayed for the 2024 eclipse and they were gracious in accommodating our early check in and offered up the backyard for us to enjoy. It was an unforgettable experience and we are grateful for opportunity to let our pups free range it, while we enjoyed nature’s beauty."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Vicki and Phillip were friendly, thoughtful hosts who made every effort for our group of 7 to have an easy, enjoyable stay. We could not ask for better hosts. Thank you, Vicki and Phillip!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"While we waited to close on our home, we stayed with Vicki and Phil for 22 days!! What great people!! We had a dog that fell in love with their dogs and we hope to continue visiting them! They shared sites to see, restaurants, invited us to join with their family functions, we truly felt welcomed, safe and a home away from home. We did not need anything, the kitchen was very well equipped, plenty of linens and everything was perfect! We had a lovely time and if you are on the fence about staying here, don't be, such a lovely, clean place and GREAT hosts!!! Thank you Vicki and Phil.
Ron and Sue Bradford"

She forwarded pictures in advance with options for our grandsons. Just amazing hosts. We will definitely be back!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Don't miss out on this excellent home. Friendly hosts greeted us upon our arrival. The perfect place for a family or small group.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"My friends and I stayed here after a day at holiday world. The town is small, so there isn't much open past 10, but with having a full kitchen, we were able to cook. We actually ended up taking a kitty that had begun coming around! The hosts were kind, helpful, and communative. One of the most helpful/impressive thing was that they built a fire in their backyard, and was built really well. It burned for hoursss. We made smores using their pokers which they kindly provided us.
Thanks for the stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was very friendly and upfront with everything we needed to do and let us know about everything. King bed was very comfortable usually needs a small fan or something to sleep and didn’t need anything that night. Slept like a baby

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,we appreciated the helpful information prior to check in.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"From the get-go Vicki and Phillip were wonderful to schedule a stay with. We were able to spend a veryyyy long day at Holiday World and then travel barely 20 minutes down the road and immediately have a wonderful place to lay our tired heads, and our group took up every bit of it. The ages of our group ranged from 5 to 78 and everyone was happy with it. They went above and beyond on accommodations and were a saving grace for our large group to be able to have somewhere nice, clean, safe, and comfortable place for us to rest for the night-- honestly, after seeing the place I definitely wish we could have stayed even longer. 10/10 recommend!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Group trip,Super cute space! I was surprised that they would be staying there as well in the upstairs. It was completely separate areas and felt safe. A group of young girls stayed with me so we had to be wary but it was good for an overnight stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home and friendly people!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing people and an amazing place!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Location was perfect for getting over to Holiday World quickly and easily. The extra space for kids to spread out and run around some was also a welcome experience after a few nights in a hotel for our kids. Highly recommend.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Vicki and Phil both were super nice and provided baby gate to keep the grand babies off the steps. Greatly aprrectiated!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Location was as expected based on communication and details from pictures. Traveled with my in-laws, wife and adult kids ad had no issues with the space. Would stay here again if we find ourselves in the area."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The only thing that I would say is the temp was very cold and there was no way to control how cold it got inside. Other than that our stay was pleasant.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at their accommodations. Peaceful and quiet as what we wanted and that is exactly what we got. Thank you so much!

Great location for a peaceful, relaxing stay and in pretty quick driving distance from Holiday World. Vicki was a great communicator and on top of everything — she even offered & brought us some lovely doughnuts one morning! Great stay and great host. Flexible & everything was pretty easy-going on our end. Will definitely consider this spot again if we take another trip around the area!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Came from out of state for a family thing last minute. Had a lovely stay way better than a hotel almost like being at home. Vicki was great so accommodating and always made sure we had everything we could possibly need. Would def stay again.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a random get away or you need a place to stay during basketball season when it’s tournament time, this is where you need to stay. This house was absolutely gorgeous. It matched the description and the photos were spot on. It was very clean and overall just a beautiful home. My friends and I were very pleased with our stay and appreciated the complimentary snacks that Shawn set out for us upon arrival. Shawn was easy to get ahold of and responded in a timely manner and was super nice. Will definitely be booking again in the near future!! :)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! very nice atmosphere!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful time at Lakeview Falls. The property provided privacy and access to a nearby lake. The home is nestled in a wooded area with a private path to a Pakota Lake inlet. So it’s a short walk to take the kayaks and enjoy a trip on the lake. We loved the hot tub after a day of kayaking and hiking on nearby paths and there was a fire pit for marshmellow roasting in the evening. The interior of the home looked brand new and had a nice lounging area to watch movies before heading to comfy beds. Ashley was extremely responsive both before and during our stay for a few general questions. We really had a nice time and would recommend Lakeview Falls.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I, and two younger children stayed for mothers day weekend.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cottage is set back in a private location - beautiful wooded area, hot tub overlooking the woods and lake in the distance. We were welcomed with friendly waves from locals on the way in. Original wooden beams are charming with the updated kitchen, bathroom, flooring, furniture. There is one private bedroom (small, but fits the bed and suitcases). The other room on the first floor has a door to separate from the others on the first floor, but is accessible by those in the upstairs loft. Loft has 4 beds. Kitchen is well stocked. No dishwasher, but great big farm sink complete with garbage disposal. Bathroom is beautifully updated! Ashley provides towels galore and fresh white linens - all professionally folded. Great pillows on the beds. There were only 6 of us, but we hosted another family for dinner and church totaling 14. Plenty of room for 3 cars and everyone in the family room for gathering. The deck is great! Ashley has thought of all the details."

Aaron was very welcoming from the start, he had great communication, showed us around when we first arrived, the house was spotless, AND he had the most adorable dog, it can’t get better than that! We saw that he had a fire pit before we went out for dinner and he got it started for when we got back. We asked him if he wanted to join us by the fire and that entire night we got to know each other and had the best conversations with him! Aaron’s Airbnb is perfect for anyone who wants privacy and/or if you want to be social! We were very sad to leave because it was so homey!

The room and bathroom were better than the pictures actually, and we found everything to be super clean and prepared for a comfy stay. Aaron was great—offered us local tips, greeted us when we arrived, introduced us to his dogs, and even opened up other areas of his home (like the living room and kitchen) to us if we needed to use it. We would definitely stay again, and I can’t wait for him to earn “Superhost”. Because he deserves it!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful home that has it all. All the previous reviews are spot on! Book it!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a jewel of place! Quiet, spacious, and comfy!!
I spent 10 days for work, and truly enjoyed the comfort of this place. It is unexpectedly more lovely than the photos could show. And Irene is a phenomenal host - incredibly responsive on even the smallest things. She made a special trip to drop off a steamer basket for my vegetables.
I have a back that requires a lot of TLC, and I was delighted in the ways that this place pampered it. The master has a “Goldilocks” bed - it’s just right!! It is the best bed I’ve slept in - both hotel and owner rental - in 3 years. Also, the pair of recliners in the living room were so comfortable to read and relax in.
The other issue I have is a sensitivity to mold and mildew. I had ZERO problems the whole time I was staying, even when I was in the basement for laundry. There is a dehumidifier running in the basement, which I’m sure helps.
Irene has thought of many little things that make the stay feel more like home. There were sound machines in each bedroom, night lights, plenty of Kleenex, tp, soap, shampoo, etc. The kitchen was very well equipped (TWO crockpots!). And the washer and dryer looked practically new and handled huge loads.
This house is family-friendly, with a play area set up in the basement. There is a power-lift recliner chair in the living room, if you have someone who needs assistance in getting up. Plus there is a grab bar for getting out of the shower. Be aware, however, that there are steps on both entrances to the house.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. A drawback is having only one bathroom - but it is spacious and lovely, with a tub that both accessible and comfortable. Another issue I had was there wasn’t enough internet to sustain my Zoom meetings - however, I expect that when the WiFi password gets re-established that this problem will vanish.
Just as an FYI, the IGA is close by and does pick-up orders with no minimum and no fees. I chose to stay in an AirBnb so that I could make my own meals and avoid eating in restaurants as a Covid precaution. It was easy to pick up my groceries on the way to the house.
Another coworker stayed at a local hotel and paid $35 more a day and got far, far less than I did!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,For sure going to be staying here again! House was very clean and accommodating. Anything and everything you’d need in a great and safe location. Super close to everything and check in/check out was very easy. Couldn’t have asked for a better experience!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were extremely satisfied with our stay here. The house was beautiful and roomy and very family friendly. It was nice to kayak and paddle boat, the lake is smaller than I expected and not exactly water I would want to swim in but it was nice to be on the water and nice to admire.
The host was very personable and responsive and gave awesome recommendations for exploring and food. We were all very happy here!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Went on a girls trip and stayed at Bridget’s. The house is beautiful and welcoming. The property is beautiful and peaceful. We had an amazing time and would definitely book again. I would highly recommend Bridget’s place if you’re ever in Jasper, IN and need a place to stay. It was spotless and smelled amazing!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Bridget's house was an excellent choice for our golf trip! The location was ideal, just a short drive from some of the best golf courses in the area. It was so convenient to play a round in the morning and return to the peaceful setting of the farm and lake in the evening."

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our family has been traveling to Holiday World for years! We have stayed at several different places, and pretty sure the group vote would put this place at the #1 spot. Having the yard, pond, playset, and trampoline gave the grandchildren things to do while waiting on the adults to cook, clean, or get ready to go to the park (instead of standing around asking when we were leaving. LOL This is the first year that we just went to the park one day of the holiday weekend - which meant a full day of swimming, kayaking, paddle boat rides, and just down time! The close proximity to Walmart (seriously - from stepping out the door of the home to walking into the store was less than 5 minutes) meant we could grab groceries as we needed them, and at the end of our stay - we didn't have a fridge full of food we never used. We will be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved that this home was extremely private and peaceful. Inside was spacious and very comfortable. Everyone in our group mentioned how much they liked the house. I would highly recommend if you or a group is searching for a place near Jasper to stay here! You will be thankful!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful place to stay! It was peaceful, plenty of room for all 7 of us. Lots of outside space. Bridget was very quick to respond with any questions. Would defintley stay here again if in the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were four guys on a golf trip and wanted an overnight place where we could hang out and relax. This property was excellent. It was in the middle of corn fields, had a beautiful lake, and great outdoor space to sit and enjoy it all."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Worth staying again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"9 people shouldn’t be able to fit as easily as we did in Bridget’s super comfy, quiet, open and perfect, just for us, space! Even though we weren’t there long, the views were incredible and the house felt like home even after one night! Finding it was a little tricky but made for good fun/laughter amongst our party. If we are ever in Jasper again we will 100% be staying again at Bridget’s spot."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was a great getaway for our family. We took the kids to Holiday World (a quick 35 minute drive). The house is clean and bridget is a wonderful host with excellent communication. We enjoyed our stay and would love to stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We just finished our stay at Bridget's home in Jasper and we are very pleased! We had 4 adults and 6 children aged 9-18, and there was enough room for everyone. The air mattress was great! All communications were timely, we had an easy time finding the place, and entry was easy with the keypad. The lake is pretty and there was a lot of room outside for the kids to run around. Great for a family reunion or get together with a large group. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Bridget's! It was clean, quiet, and comfortable, just what we were looking for while we enjoyed a few days in southern Indiana.
Bridget's place is only a mile or two outside of town, so access to restaurants and so forth was a breeze. Holiday World (where we spent our time during the day) is about half an hour away, an easy drive down 162.
I would recommend Bridget's place if you're looking for a comfy place for some downtime while in Jasper, it was great and we enjoyed it. Thanks!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a wonderful place to stay. The road leading up to it was a little worrisome but mainly because we got there after dark. The house and property were beautiful and everything was as described. We would love to stay here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our group had four young kids and six adults. We stayed here after a visit to Holiday World so that we wouldn’t have a long drive immediately after a long day of play. The house accommodated all of us well. Bridget was also very responsive and gave us an extra hour to check out which was very helpful. She also let us know we forgot my daughter’s special stuffed rabbit and we were able to go back and get him. The house was very nice and clean and there were things for the kids to do. The lake is also a lovely view. If we were able to stay longer (we arrived pretty late in the evening), the kids would have loved to play outside more. Overall, a great stay and we would stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our family loved it. The kids where outside playing and swimming everyday. Very peaceful and the host responded very quickly supper friendly.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Plenty of room inside and out. Great setup for kids. Lots of options for playing in the pond or outside in the large lawn. Nice deck. I would definitely recommend this location and host.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Place was nice and clean! Peaceful with fish for the boys to catch and release.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was an amazing Airbnb experience. The house is right on a pond where you can fish and swim. The kids caught lots of small fish. The host has kayaks, a paddle boat, and lots of water activity items to use. There is also a trampoline and play set that our kids loved. It is just minutes from Walmart and lots of food options. The house is comfortable and well equipped. We would definitely recommend this stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay. Bridget was very responsive and accommodating in every communication and request. It is a very peaceful location, but very close to Jasper and all the amenities of a city. We plan to use this as our ""base camp"" whenever we come to visit our relatives in the area. The only negative at all, which is very minor, is that it was a little challenging to determine the right driveway to turn into. But ultimately, that was not a big deal. The view and the property were worth it! I would highly recommend staying here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a fabulous stay. This home is the perfect place for a family with all ages to stay. The home is nicely updated inside and has many amenities, including toys for the kiddos. We all loved taking the the paddel boat out into the pond. The littles enjoyed the swing set, the teens enjoyed the trampoline and we all loved spending quality time together. We are already talking about coming back next summer for a few days to get away from the hustle and bustle of life."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing balance of fields and trees, sun and shadow, lake and absence of mosquitoes ))) Fishing is a fun. Enjoyed watching our dogs jump into the lake or chase cats ( live in the area) up a tree, be free and wild. Thanks to our host Bridget, we had a blast. Home is great, we had everything we need and even more. Bridget provided us with smallest details we need for our stay and responded within seconds. For those who have kids, they definitely will be busy, there are playground and a lot of toys."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We went to Holiday world for a Family Vacation with 3 Adults and 3 Kids. Bridget's place was an AMAZING jumping off point for our long weekend. The place was better than photos, amazing sunset, and lots of nature to enjoy. We hung out on the back patio most nights and enjoyed all the amenities of the city but being surrounded by the country.
The showers were hot, good pressure, and we even made a family dinner in the well stocked kitchen with brand new pans, knives, and plenty of plates for the whole family. I've stayed at a lot of Airbnb's and most come with goodwill pans. Bridget's place was stocked for success.
Bridget was very friendly and offered some food suggestions and even reached out to us our first night cause there were storms expected in the area.
Overall a REALY Great stay and we're already looking at dates for next year to go back. Thanks Bridget for opening up your amazing property for my family and me to build some memories!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This location was a meeting place for my wife, our daughter, and I, my in-laws, and my parents. We met here and was able to enjoy games and the beautiful scenery.
One day we split and my wife daughter and I went to Holiday World and Lincoln State Park. The older ones went to visit West Baden/French Lick area. We thought it was a great location right between the ventures.
Though it is in the country surrounded by fields, if we needed anything we discovered that Walmart is only about a mile away.
My daughter of 8 yrs old loves fishing for bluegill, paddle boating, and the random sweet outdoor cat that pops up every once in a while.
This is a place we will remember and hope to come back to in the future."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Bridget's home was beautiful! We stayed one night and we loved it. She was very kind and answered right away. I 100% recommend this home to anyone staying in the area or going to Holiday World, it's only a 30 min drive. We will be only be staying in her home whenever we go to Holiday World.
Bridget's home was beautiful! We stayed one night and loved it. She was very friendly and immediately responded. I 100% recommend this house to anyone staying in the area or going to Holiday World, it's only a 30 minute drive. We will only stay at their place every time we go to Holiday World."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful. Was a little hard to determine which house to turn at. The mailbox at the end of the lane didn't say any addresses on it. The drive down the driveway was fine. House was just like it was advertised. No kayaks at all, but the paddle boat was ready for use. if/ when we come back we will def stay here. again, the house was beautiful and it was very roomy."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Bridget was a fantastic host, quick to respond and very communicable, everything you would want a host to be. Our stay was great and the entire home was clean and inviting. We definitely felt comfortable and at home as soon as we arrived. The area surrounding the home is super peaceful and sitting out by the pond drinking a cup of coffee in the morning is highly approved. Would recommend a stay here, for sure."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Lake is very big and nice to be around! Plenty of room and amenities for the house. I really have no complaints!
,,,I would like to say that we were very excited to go. We got there and we have two small dogs she did not control her bigger dog than ours and he ran up and I was concerned there would be an issue. She never left her house and did not bother to do anything. Then when we were laying in bed there was bugs. We contacted her before contacting customer service. Her responses basically it's not my problem it's your default. We tried to get her to do something she didn't. Now she makes up other things why she didn't. We wanted to leave and asked her for a refund. She said she wouldn't give a refund because it's a business and proceeded to tell us she couldn't take care of things because she had surgery and Young kids. She was only 20 ft away. I would say stay away. Also she had an Amtrak on the counter behind the coffee machine.
