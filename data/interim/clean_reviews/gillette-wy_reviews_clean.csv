2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay and fit our family of 6 well. Beware of the glass front door, it doesn't have a way to stop it from swinging shut, thankful it was an adult who discovered this and not one of the kids. The backyard fence could use something to make it more stable as my son was outside when the neighbor's dogs charged out barking and jumped on the fence making it wobble. He quickly came inside and they didn't go out back anymore.
Great assortment of things on hand for the kitchen and having the garage access was very nice as well! We'll definitely keep the Hidden Gem in mind for future stays!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the second time staying at Danette’s place and will stay in the future if we return to Gillette. The size works great for our family. The location is wonderful and easy to access anywhere in Gillette quickly.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This beautiful little home away from home was perfect for our trip, 5mins.drive from Gillette College, which is why I was there.
Danette has everything available to you. The little things is what I loved, the shampoo, conditioner, the items available to use in the pantry ect.

The rooms were spacious. 100% will rent this out again when I come to visit my daughter again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was only at the hidden gem property for one night for work, but my stay was very comfortable. The neighbor does have a dog that barks at all hours, but it didn’t affect me personally. Would recommend when in Gillette."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place!
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Greeted by a very noticeable, musty odor. The home also needs a major deep clean and some TLC. The neighborhood didn’t feel the safest, especially with the cops next door most of the night. We also couldn’t get the bedrooms to cool down during the night… at one point my daughter had to go and sleep downstairs (it was SO hot) and the Mr. Cool (I think that’s what they are called) AC units in the bedrooms just would NOT stop pumping out hot air. However, the beds were clean and for the price, the house worked as a quick stop to sleep for the night and then GO. Danette was also friendly and responsive."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfy and clean. We loved it and we will definitely try to stay here again when we come back.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute little apartment. We enjoyed our stay. The yard had lots of dog poop so the kiddo couldn’t go outside in the back. The house had everything we need. The pull out bed definitely wasn’t comfortable and not made for an adult. But the other rooms perfect. The neighborhood was a little sketchy and neighbors gave off odd vibes. But good little place

The kitchen was well equipped. Thankful that the air conditioning worked well to combat the heat wave. We found a park a few blocks away that was nice to walk the dog.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The house is absolutely beautiful! The linens are luxurious, the bathrooms spa-like, the decor is museum-like in all the best ways. The kids loved the bunk room with a selection of books and toys, we enjoyed the outdoor spaces, and the fireplace was cozy for reading in the evening and coffee in the morning. We enjoyed walking around the downtown area and especially recommend the IceCream Cafe! The frontier Auto Museum is also a great way to spend a morning!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Always an incredible host and an incredible property, it is my go-to place to stay in Gillette. Always look forward to returning, thank you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful, unique home with lots of charm. We loved looking at all of the antiques and especially enjoyed the balcony and the huge rain shower. The towels are great quality, beds are comfortable (although I wouldn't want to sleep in the bunk bed as an adult) and the kitchen is decently stocked.
It's a great house for adults or a family with older kids, but we probably wouldn't stay there again with a baby. We stayed for a week and were terrified our baby was going to fall down the stairs the whole time. There are gaps to the sides of the stairs so it would be worse than a fall down regular stairs. They did provide baby gates which we were grateful to find, but it was tricky to get a gate to stay in the right place. The bathtub is also peeling and paint got in our kids' hair, there are no plastic dishes and the yard is not great for kids.
I still give it 5 stars because it is a beautiful home and a really fun experience."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome old home, with lots of cool, old decorations! Plus the museum across the street is really fun to see!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Well worth it pictures didn’t do it any justice great place would do it again
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolute gem! This house is so beautiful and comfortable and has so much character and charm. Highest possible recommendation, especially for history buffs. It was just as described, only better! The auto museum across the street is also amazing and was one of the biggest highlights of our trip. And they make really nice bratwurst at the cafe!
This was a lucky find and an absolute treat - we'd come back in a second.
The wifi was great and it's an excellent base for working remotely. Lots of shops and restaurants just a couple blocks away. One thing to be aware of is that the space is beautifully open, which we loved, but could make it tricky for larger groups. The upper floor is sort of like a giant (and beautiful!) loft, so it is not closed off from the main living area. As long as everyone wakes and sleeps at the same time it's no problem, and like I said for us it was perfect!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place to stay in Gillette! Walking distance to historic downtown. Far exceeded our expectations, would have loved to have more time to enjoy the place."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was amazing!! Besides the fact that it looked like a castle, the interior was immaculate with every detail you could imagine from old record players, to a fully furnished home with everything you need to enjoy your stay, to an amazing balcony and outside sitting area. We loved every minute and was sad to leave. The host was very prompt and even left a parting gift for us to take with us. I wish i could rate it more than 5 stars because this home definitely deserves it! We will be back for sure!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was absolutely amazing! my only complaint is I didn't stay longer!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our family was in town for a baseball tournament. The house suited our multi generational family quite nicely. The keyless entry is very convenient. We needed extra towels at one point in our visit and they appeared within minutes at our back door. Briana thank you for the great communication and awesome visit.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely beautiful house with a lot of historical things within, kind of like spending the night in a museum!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was very nice. Plenty of room for us all. There were 8 of us.
There was an airbed supplied for use, but it had a hole it in, so didn't hold air, and that person had to also sleep on the couch. We were 8 women, and there wasn't quite enough toilet paper in the main floor bathroom. We brought some down from the bathroom upstairs.
We really enjoyed our stay. The dining table was big enough that we could all get around it comfortably for eating our meals and playing our games. Kitchen was great. Plenty big and all the utensils, etc. we needed to cook.
Great location. We went to the museum across the street, and it was fantastic. Will be going back to visit that. So much to see there.
The hostess was very informative and quick to answer questions. It was an excellent stay. We had a wonderful time."

Very clean.
Everything worked perfectly.
You will not be disappointed"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were able to book Briana’s place very last minute on a busy weekend so we didn’t have much time to really view the listing before booking. Thankfully, this home was pretty great! All the space, amenities, comfort one could ask for. Location is two blocks from heart of downtown Gillette. We enjoyed the unique history of the house as well. Bring your family, this is a great home to reconnect in!"

We were able to cook breakfast and dinner and not have to spend a ton of money getting takeout for our large group. The beautiful grassy areas, front steps, and deck were so nice for a place to hang out with family outside. The coffee shop/gift shop/ auto museum across the street were incredible and so affordable. Quiet neighborhood, close enough to town for groceries/shopping and about an hour drive to Devil’s tower. We enjoyed the stay very much!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing stay in this truly unique home! The host has put in so much attention to detail and the house was spotless!

2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The photos look amazing — so amazing that they’re one reason we decided to stay in Gillette. And the house lives up to the photos!
It’s a unique place to stay, full of interesting vintage knickknacks. Everything is thoughtfully and clearly labeled — light switches, TV, garbage instructions, and so on.
The upstairs patio is a great place to sit and soak in the evening — I meditated up there several times.
The location is convenient for both walking or driving to interesting things to see or places to eat.
Loved our stay and would definitely book again if we were in town."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great stay. The house was very charming and comfortable, with plenty of room for a large family like ours. The town of Gillette was also very nice.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying! Nice value and awesome host!
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Paula’s place is squeaky clean and exactly as it is described on her listing. The neighborhood felt safe. Keep in mind that the bed is a double bed - I am 5’4” and fit perfectly but my partner who is 5’10” had his feet hanging off. But her listing does state the size of the bed. The secondary bed is firm. The shower water pressure and temperature was fantastic! Just remember to bring your own toiletries such as body soap, shampoo, and conditioner. Plenty of towels were provided. The bathroom is shared, as stated. Having access to laundry facilities was a major bonus since we are on a long road trip.
ADA accessibility: Paula was resistant toward my service animal. Upon booking, I sent her a message regarding my service animal. She confirmed the booking. I sent a message reminding her of my service animal on the day of arrival, and she assumed I had made other accommodations since her listing does not allow “pets.” We felt unwelcome in her home. There was tension upon our arrival."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paula was a great host. Very accommodating and flexible with our late arrival. The space was a clean cozy place to sleep a night while traveling!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Both Paula and Chris were phenomenal hosts. They were great conversationalists, I felt like I was at home. Big big plus was the ability to make use of their washer and dryer, so I didn't have to wear the the same clothes for a fourth day. Will definitely book again when I am in the area."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place to stay! It was within walking distance of everything we needed and there was a fantastic museum with a cafe just across the street. The Carriage House was filled with treasures from bygone eras, yet had all the modern amenities needed. I would recommend it for a couple or a couple with small children as it is one large area with bathroom and closet closed off. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I was here for about a month for an internship, and Briana was a fantastic host! Its nice and cozy with a great kitchen and bathroom. Would recommend to anyone!
The only gripe (and not with the host or listing) is that its very hard to have mail shipped directly to the house! So if you are here and want to receive any mail/packages, it'll have to be shipped elsewhere. Luckily, the hosts also own a nearby Auto Museum and we were able to have things shipped there for us to grab later. The hosts were very accommodating!
I loved my stay! 5 stars"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was such a great place to stay! Host is very responsive.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this place in Gillette. It was more than what we needed for just one night, but worth every penny. Had a good nights sleep and ate at a local barbecue place. Very friendly and responded timely!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A great place to stay for one night! Loved that they allowed pets! Close to Gillette restaurants, shopping and High Schools!"

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay. House was very clean. Loved returning after a day of visiting family to a warm and comfortable living room. Only advise to others sensitive to perfume/laundry scents, be aware that it is strong."

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Not great wifi. Nice fenced backyard for our dog. Overall not a a bad place to stay for a few days.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Danette's home has great value, the kitchen was well stocked with pans, bakeware and table settings. Made it nice to cook for the family.
Thankful to have an airbnb in Gillette available like this. We enjoyed or stay"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a spacious home located close to jusr about everything you would need. I was visiting family in the area and it provided a nice meeting place that I could cook and just relax and visit. I appreciated the garage as an added amenity since we encounter a little winter storm during my stay. I book this property every time I make this trip.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved how the kitchen came equipped with just about anything you need to cook .
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice neighborhood, not too far from downtown"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cutest little townhome you ever did see. Handy to have the attached garage to park inside!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. It worked very well for our needs. It was very nice to be able to park in the garage in the winter time. Had plenty of dishes and kitchen stuff to allow us to cook meals there and have our family come there to visit us instead of having to eat out at meal time. Bedrooms were clean and we only used the owners bed but it was very comfortable and spacious to accommodate our luggage, etc."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was spot on and exactly what we needed for our stay in Gillette. I hope it works that we can stay there again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"great place, great host, great value!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a wonderful place to stay! Having a garage to park in when the weather was cold was such a blessing. The house was clean, warm, easy to find and felt like staying at a family member’s home from the moment we walked in. Highly recommend!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,was a clean welcoming place to visit family
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and made for a pleasant stay all around
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The best part about this place was the size of the kitchen and dining area as well as a large living room. It was great to have everyone relax since we were there for the holiday we can have our family come over and everybody had a place to sit and therebwas room for 2 cooks in the kitchen.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We have stayed here several times because we enjoy it so much. Thanks Danette for a great stay!
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Danettes! We needed a warm place to stay for a few days and this house was perfect! It had everything we needed. Danette was very responsive to my messages and accommodating when we needed a pack and play. The bed in the master was very comfortable and everything was very clean! My only suggestion would be that the kitchen could be organized. Everything was available that we could need, we just had to search for it. Backyard was great for our dog, but you have to go through the garage to access it. I’d suggest bringing an extra towel to wipe paws because it was hard for them not to get muddy. Thank you for allowing us to stay here."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place.. good location… awesome owners
2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Danette’s place was probably the best option in Gillette as far as we saw. We looked at many hotel reviews and a lot of them weren’t great (talked about bed bugs etc). Danette had some pretty decent reviews and is a super host so we thought we’d give it a shot.
Overall the pros were:
-Pretty easy checkout instructions which was nice.
-it was fairly cozy (kind of like a home away from home which was nice as well).
-loved the fact that there was a rocking chair (so I could rock my toddler to sleep, it made bedtime easier).
-the bathrooms were very clean
-it wasn’t too far away from some restaurants or stores or the freeway.
-I enjoyed the Christian decor. It was encouraging.
-it was homey.
-it was À fairly quiet neighborhood
Cons:
-the bed was very uncomfortable in the master. Both for my husband and I. We didn’t sleep in the second bedroom so I can’t speak for that. I think it may have been a better investment to provide a better quality mattress and maybe even a king size mattress because the room could absolutely accommodate that size.
-bedding and sheets were seemed pretty cheap (if that matters to you at all). Not the most comfortable to sleep under.
-the kitchen and entry was was dirty. There was some gunk that looked like food and mud on the floor that I could scrape off with my nail. Gross.
-the coffee maker was filthy, with residue all in the pot and also in the area where the filters go. One part of it looked a little moldy…
-there was a screw also found on the floor that my toddler could grabbed and put in her mouth or something- not safe or good at all. Not sure where it came from. But it made me wonder if the cleaners even vacuumed.
-there were crumbs in the counter so it seems that the cleaners really didn’t do a great job at all.
-when I brought this to the hosts attention, she asked what we’d like to have done for us and I just asked for the cleaning fee to be waived. I’m not sure if we have seen that yet or not. I’ll have to double check.
-not sure if it’s really a con but perhaps something for someone to know. The home is on a slight hill and is actually a duplex unit, which would have been nice to know ahead of time knowing that the parking may be a bit tight.
-it was FREEZING when we got in the house. I thought they keep the thermostat at 70 based on the checkout/check in instructions
-we were told the cleaner came almost a week prior to our arrival- so no wonder.
We only stayed for one night because we are moving halfway cross country. Overall it was decent- clean enough that there were no bugs or anything and the bed was clean. Sad we couldn’t use the coffee maker. Just too much to deal with and so after driving 7 hours with a toddler. I didn’t want to wash it out. It looked pretty gross. Like it hadn’t been washed for a while.
Overall we appreciated the stay. Maybe this was just a one off situation."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Superb stay
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This house was perfect for hanging out and was in a location that made it easy to get anywhere with easy access to the interstate! The beds were comfy and having 2 full bathrooms for two separate families was so nice. The kitchen was perfect for slow mornings of coffee breakfast and some work and then lunch and/or supper depending on everyone's schedule. The house was clean and cozy and it started to truly feel like home after just a couple days. I hope we can stay here again when we come back to Gillette!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful little home close to town. All the amenities you could want. I would recommend this place for anyone making a trip to Gillette.

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, pleasant home near i-90. Comfortable furniture and well maintained home. The decor includes numerous Christian religious quotations - this isn't inclusive to all guests and did not make us feel at home. I do understand it's a family home, just something for guests to be aware of. Otherwise a great place to stop off on a road trip."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great for my family's needs to visit family.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was great perfect location and convenient location while we were there for my nephew's wedding. We definitely visit family in Gillette a lot and wirh the families growing and for some reason we can't stay with them we would stay here again.

Neighborhood and nice and quite. Great place to relax and visit with relativizes. This would be our go to choice to stay again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice duplex with a garage. A large kitchen with most spices/etc. and cooking utensils. open concept into the dining and frontroom. nice sized 2 bedrooms with extra bedding for each and we loved having our own bathroom in the master bedroom. A Great air bnb. Danette was so helpful in my several questions. I even left some items and she made it very easy for my granddaughter to pick up. We will, for sure, stay there again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location! Cozy, clean 2 bed, 2 bath airbnb. Kitchen has everything you may need!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a great deal! This was the perfect space for our family of six to spread out a bit and get a little rest before we headed out to Yellowstone. The beds were comfy, showers hot, and kitchen was stocked and ready for any cooking needs you’d have. The location is close to all the main areas, but just private enough to make it a truly relaxing stay! If we are ever this way again, we’ll definitely remember this place."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are going through or staying a couple days, Danette’s place will be a great hub for your time between adventures. The entire place is FULLY stocked, you will not be missing anything you may need or may have forgotten prior to arrival.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are in need of a cute and comfy home to stay in Gillette, WY, book with Danette. It is a darling home with everything you need, right down to something that you may not realize you might need but was there when the need arises. It's a perfect location and Danette was a great host. But the number one reason for the great review was that it is "" PET FRIENDLY"". The backyard is fully fenced so you don't have to worry about your pets escaping.
Do not hesitate to book - you will not be disappointed."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Danette's place was great! Place was incredibly clean, spacious and homey. We stayed with friends, but would be the perfect place for family with kiddos. Kitchen had plenty of dishes, toaster, coffee pot, etc. Bathroom had the basics. Location was great: quickly accessible to other parts of Gillette, but up on the hill, which made it feel like it wasn't in the middle of everything. Driveway parking with plenty of spots on the street. Would highly recommend!"

We only had a brief one night stay but we’re 5 star impressed and will definitely be back!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We only spent one night at Danette's place--our first stop in moving our granddaughter and her family from South Dakota to California. It was a fantastic place to relax after a hectic week of packing. It was very comfortable and had everything we needed. It really did feel like a home away from home! I would liked to have stayed longer than one night!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Danette was a wonderful host! Her home was homey, and my family thoroughly enjoyed their stay. The home is very close to all of the necessities, like WalMart and food, and it was away from town enough to be close to hunting land! Danette was a very helpful host— one day we were locked out of the house after going out of town, but Danette unlocked the door digitally and got us back in. It was very convenient!
Check in and check out were very simple, just the way I like it. I would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a home away from home while you’re in Gillette! We know we will be back to hunt again, so we would love to stay then too."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I would recommend this Airbnb and to all who wish to stay in Gillette, Wyoming. Very lovely place & reasonable price for a full service Airbnb home!

2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay for a week. A Pak N Play was available for an infant also. The only down side was the pull out sofa area is in the living room so not much privacy for anyone using it but we were all family. Would stay there again if back in the area. It is a very convenient location.

The house was comfortable but could have use a few more homey touches and a bit more furniture like chairs in the bedrooms. Overall we had a good stay. I’d recommend it.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ben was a wonderful host and very accomadating. My parents had a house fire and we needed long term housing with an unknown estimated date we would be able to move them back into their home. He was easy to work with on constant changing dates and always very responsive with questions. His place was clean and he had all the necessities needed for even a long stay. For those wanting to be close to the events at the Camplex this is a perfect location, with a back porch and back yard to play and hangout in. Would highly recommend staying at this location."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely cottage. Perfect for one or a couple. Hot tub was so nice! Quiet neighborhood and the patio was very nice. Quaint and comfortable. I needed instructions on how to use the televisions and a brief tutorial would have been helpful for the door lock. I figured the door out, and most probably would too. I liked the convenience of the door lock. No key needed was a nice benefit. The washer and dryer were a great benefit too for a longer stay. I plan to stay here every time I am in Gillette and look forward to the next trip!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I decided to take a spontaneous trip up north to see the northern lights this past weekend. The Cottage was so cute and cozy. The antique pieces made it such a fun place to stay! Briana also had nice goodies waiting for us when we arrived. The hot tub and sauna were so nice to use! She also offers free admission to the auto museum right across the street which was really neat to check out. We also went to Devils Tower which was only about an hour away. Overall, we would definitely recommend The Cottage!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very quaint and well decorated! We loved the location and had so much fun hot tubbing each night. We super appreciated Briana’s flexibility with letting us check in early and move our belongings over from the carriage house where we were staying earlier. The place was smaller than the photos made it look. We noticed a number of ants in the kitchen and had to wash some dirty pots and pans in the drawers before we were able to cook with them. However, overall, we enjoyed our stay here and appreciate Briana’s hospitality."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Had to wait for my check in instruction but they were super easy once I got them. Was a fantastic place to stay! The museum that you get access to is a must see if you are staying in any of their places. The hot tub and sauna were a HUGE perk. Wish I could have stayed for my entire 13 weeks.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute home, obviously created with care and thoughtfulness for a relaxing, worry free stay. Great location, walkable to shops, bars and restaurants. Perfect location for exploring Devils Tower and the Big Horn Mountains. The hot was an added bonus, perfect after a day of hiking."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy to find and close to small shops and restaurants
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Briana's place was great experience. Everything was very well cared for, the period details of the house are a must and everything was really very comfortable. We went for a few days to visit our son at Gillette College and were able to enjoy both him and the city .
The house is very close to Downtown and a 5-minute drive to all the supermarkets and service areas.
In front of the house is the museum of old cars which is the best I have seen in years and also a very cool cafe. Briana leaves you as a gift two entrances to get to know the museum , a rich welcome coffee and a rich cake.
We were able to use the garden grill for several nights and really enjoyed it.
I would be happy to stay here again and would highly recommend it!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was the perfect getaway. Nice and relaxing, with many amenities in the surrounding area that were within walking distance. I would definitely stay again, if we are in the area!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little house was great. You can tell they put in the time and effort to make the little cottage as nice as possible. It’s parked right across from the auto museum. You receive 2 free admissions to the museum upon arrival. The cafe across the street serves some of the best brats as well. Owners were super friendly.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cool place to camp out in Gilette for a few days. Walk to the good spots.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is super cute, decorated with antiques but with an updated kitchen and bathroom. We especially appreciated the well-stocked kitchen and full-sized dining table so we could cook dinner in and have some space for catching up on emails and the newspaper in the morning. The hot tub was a true luxury, and there is even a sauna that we didn't realize until we were getting ready to check out! It was great to have access to a drier so did not have to travel with wet suits and towels after our evening soak. The place is just around the corner from the old downtown where we poked around the shops, and we took advantage of the free passes to the museum across the street and really enjoyed the displays of vintage cars and shop spaces."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay & host! 👍🏼
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Briana was an awesome host!! My boyfriend and I were a little bit late on the checkout, but Briana was so nice about it!! Great place to stay and a great host to have!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy cottage might just be the best airbnb in Gillette. The house has antique touches and all the updated, modern amenities expected. Everything is clean, new appliances with a classic farmhouse style. Sauna, hot tub/jacuzzi, private backyard, high speed internet, multiple TVs, climate controlled environment, etc. Walking distance from the heart of downtown Gillette, near restaurants and iconic attractions. What more could you ask for? Thanks for the great stay!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Weekend trip to see my husband who was working in the area. We had a great time here. Would certainly stay again. Her communication was great with prompt replies. Close to downtown, within close walking distance if you want to see the shops there. Place was clean and cozy. I work online and the internet speed was great for my online meetings. Hot tub was great. Thanks Briana!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little place to stay.

It has a big garden, jacuzzi, dining room, kitchen, 1 bedroom and a living room with convertible couch/bed. Deck at the front and back of the house and a nice bbcue. We enjoyed it a lot. Quiet and close to the old city center. The garden has a fire pit too!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Second stay at Juniper Rising. We enjoy the simple airbnb for sporting events. Nice to have a kitchen and place to rest inbetween games.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great location. Justin and Liz were friendly very accessible. They made us feel at home and wanted to make sure we had everything we needed. It's a good place to stay and within walking distance of library and stores. Definitely would consider for any future stay in Gillette.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and comfortable, easy to access and hosts were responsive. Great place to stay close to town in Gillette!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Myself and my friends were in the area hunting for Antelope. The location and amenities of the house were perfect for our needs as well as this being a great value. Everything worked out great and I wouldn't hesitate to make this my destination if I were to make this trip again..
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was clean and well kept up it was in a good location only minutes away from everything
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Large spaces and comfortable beds. Great location - close to restaurants and stores - and not too far from downtown.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Spacious and comfortable place easily found off hwy 59. Pics when we booked did not do the size justice. A repurposed basement, so layout is a little odd, the finishing is a little rough, and we could hear the hosts above, but clean and comfortable with good furniture and respectable quiet hours. Didn’t have to interact with the hosts beyond initial instructions, because instructions were that clear. Would stay here again if we ever come back to Gillette"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is very convenient to downtown Gillette and the Cam-Plex events center.
It’s an older model basement apartment circa 1980s.
It is spacious and well equipped.
The bathroom lighting is dim.
It was a great value and great location.
The biggest drawback is the upstairs people noise. It sounded like people were coming through the roof and dogs were often barking.
I would not recommend if you can’t handle overhead noise.
But the kitchen is big, the living room is spacious, and the location is good.
There were people drag racing down the roads nearby on the weekend nights - so again - noise was the biggest drawback.
If you have a noisy crew, you’ll be fine."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great for families! Everything we needed. Will stay again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Justin and Elizabeth's place made a great landing spot for our family while we were in Gillette for a week. It was very comfortable and peaceful.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for our family.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Justin & Elizabeth's place is my first choice to stay at. Always glad when it's available. I have found their place clean, well provided, quiet & I feel safe in their neighborhood.. Also convenient for my needs,"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was well worth the price! The house was nice and clean and the beds comfy. The bathroom could use some updating, but it still served us well. The bedroom with the queen bed was accessible only through the bedroom with the two twin beds, but it worked fine for us with our two children. The back bedroom was also rather stuffy, but we found a fan in the closet and that took care of that problem! Very spacious living room and easy to access the house. One side note, the curb into the driveway is a little higher than some and our minivan had to be pulled in on an angle so it wouldn't scrape."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We were here to visit with family. I appreciate that they were accommodating and allowed my grandbabies to visit even though they are young and can be a little excitable and loud.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay; very comfortable and nicely styled. Do be aware that is the basement apartment of the owner's house and a good deal of noise can be heard.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for 4 nights. Justin was very easy to communicate with and accommodating with our needs. The place is spacious, clean, and has everything you need for your stay. The value was outstanding and we highly recommend staying here!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a nicely finished and spacious place to stay. We were only there 2 nights but would have been comfortable for an extended stay. We appreciated that there were very few knick knacks and it was easy to toddler proof with our 2 baby gates we brought along. Of note- you have to walk through the ""kids"" bedroom to get to and from the other bedroom."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Getting to this place seems slightly uphill. Yet it has a good view of part of the third largest city in WY.
The house has two driveways yours is the flat one. There are 3 steps inside the door which makes it not wheel chair accessible. But this older person negotiated them ok.
Found it a very quiet relaxing place. Occasionally heard footsteps seems of a dog. But nothing that bothered me.
Communication was quick. I really enjoyed my time here. Recommend this place"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is extremely clean. The keyless entry is easy, and communication with the hosts is a breeze. Very central, yet quiet location in Gillette"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spending time in Gillette for work. Great spot for a longer stay.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,A little noisy but all and all a great place to stay close to everything. It was easy to access very clean. the hosts are good at communicating back.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay. Super cozy and clean.
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don't give 5 stars unless everything is perfect. Check in was easy and finding the place was easy. Parking was great as you had your own spot in front of the door to the Garden apartment. Side note: Curbs are huge so drive slow!
The place was very clean and the kitchen was well stocked with everything you need. Bring a fire stick or Raku with you as the TV doesn't have cable or antenna but the couches and recliner are great. The layout of the bedrooms are a little different as the one room has no windows and gets really warm. Also, the thermostat was already programmed and basically turned off the heat during the day so keep an eye on it.
The people upstairs own a dog which runs a lot and walk heavy so you will hear them.
I was only there for 2 nights. The beds were good and easy to sleep on."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful basement apartment. Super comfortable for sleeping! Appointed well and easy to get to. Loved it.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment like place had everything needed for a weekend stay. Upstairs foot steps are noticeable but not during sleeping hours. Loved the dark room and great mattress. Temperature was great for winter in living room and bedroom. Kitchen was a little drafty, probably because it's right at the entryway. There were just the 2 of us but they had 3 beds."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Comfortable and clean! Justin and Elizabeth are great hosts!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cozy apartment, perfect for our family for the weekend. I loved how big the table was, and the apartment was nicely furnished. The dining room window could do with some privacy curtains (not just the sheer ones), as the door straight to the bedrooms and bathroom area face that window, but it's not that big of a deal if you keep the door shut."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and quiet! Definitely recommend.

Plenty of bedding and towels for everyone. Great location, on a small street but super close to stores and restaurants.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredibly spacious, practically as big as the whole house footprint. very comfy bed. Nice to have our own thermostat. Although on a quiet, residential street, we also walked to the business area with Walmart, fast food and as far as the coffee shop (that was about 1 hr round trip). We were able to park in the driveway, which was great."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,far enough away from town but close enough for us to get everything we may have needed. hopefully we can stay here again next spring when we come back to work here.

2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,💯 recommend it
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay! Quiet and secluded with easy access to surrounding area. Very comfortable home and amazing hostess.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was perfect, I was able to spend quality time with my grandson's, the house was clean and beautiful. due to the fact it is winter in WY and it's cold we didn't go out much, we didn't need to. everything we needed was in the house. Shantell is absolutely the sweetest thing ever and I couldn't have had a better time. Thank you Shantell!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Shanell's house with 3 adults and two small pups. The space was perfect for what we needed and an easy 15min drive to downtown Gillette. The how was clean and comfortable, with everything we needed in the kitchen and bedrooms. The backyard has beautiful wide open views of the Wyoming plains. Shantell's communication and proactivity was greatly appreciated.
The one piece of feedback I have for the hosts is that it would have been nice to have both upstairs bathrooms stocked with soap and shampoo. There was only shampoo/conditioner in one of the bathrooms. Still this is a 5/5 stay and I highly recommend it if are looking for somewhere to stay in the area."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, cozy home and wonderful host!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fit our needs perfectly
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My family and I stayed with my elderly parents and two furry friends and the house and property were perfect for us! Shantell was very respectful of our time by allowing an early check-in and a late check out if needed. The beds and other furniture were comfortable and clean. We highly recommend and would stay again! Shantell even went as far as getting our two dogs toys and some very yummy treats! 😋
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great night away!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was a bit hesitant with what to expect with the reviews about cleanliness. I arrived, finding the house clean and beautifully up to date living areas. The house is whites and grays so I could tell the house has just been cleaned before my arrival. The house is located on a dirt road, so I’m sure dirt would have been noticed if I had a longer stay than one night. Shantell was always fast to respond when I messaged her and was very helpful. Definitely will stay again and suggest for others."
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice home, great location! Dissatisfied with cleanliness 🥲"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"what a remarkable experience, starting from the host Shantell being super friendly and attentive but not intrusive. the place itself was gorgeous and well appointed. the views are amazing with horses, ponds, wildlife all in view from the quaint porch in back. rooms were super nice and comfortable and the living area was beautiful. will definitely be booking this place again. WELL worth the price."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The location of the home felt very private and safe and had an AMAZING view! We loved having animals roaming nearby and really enjoyed the swing and deck with beautiful scenery surrounding. The home was beautiful and clean inside. All amenities were as advertised. The note book she provided helped answer little questions about the home. The open concept was great for having a dinner with family. Shantell was very responsive and was great to give us some recommendations of things to do in the area. She made us feel very welcomed.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Shantell and Brett were amazing. They were so accommodating and attentive. What a great family and a great home they share on air bnb. The horses and donkeys that walk the fields behind house were a great addition to get to enjoy the sunset and watch them bring there day to an end. Such a beautiful property. Shantell is the perfect “SUPER HOST”. Thank you for all you did to be sure everything was fine.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The house and scenery were very beautiful! Loved the kitchen.
We really appreciated how clean the bedding/ mattresses were.
The only complaints are that there were used coffee grounds in the coffee maker, the lawn was over a foot tall when we showed up and there were no serving or mixing dishes/bowls. Lastly, there was a miscommunication during our stay that was less than professionally handled and assumptions were made."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice quiet location and responsive hosts. Beautiful kitchen!
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,The house looked like the photos and matched the description. The kitchen was large and new. We did have a couple hiccups but the host was fairly responsive. We would have loved more proactiveness on the host in correcting the house not being clean when we arrived. Especially when the cleaning fee we paid was the highest of all the Air Bnbs we stayed in on our vacation.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We really liked this house. Wonderful view and beautiful home. We will be coming back!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice place to use as a camp for family vacay to Wyoming! Peaceful quite and clean!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay at Shantell's house. She was helpful and friendly we would recommend this house to anyone who is heading to Gillette. Close to town and for our group close to the public hunting areas.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"The house is bright, clean and very spacious for lots of guests. Loved the programmable oven & stove. Easy few minutes access to I-90 & town from there."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The farmhouse was just as advertised. Clean, comfortable and at a beautiful location. we would live to stay here again!"
2022-10-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was disappointing as this home simply did not match the listing. The home was missing a full bed, the two upstair bathroom fans did not work, there were basically no house supplies like dishwasher soap, laundry soap, kitchen supplies were non existent not even salt and pepper, poor cookwear and few plates and cups. The fridge didn't make enough ice for one person.
This home might be ok for one night but for a stay of longer than that it is not the place to go.
Our group was four adults which this home should of supported but it was not as it was missing one complete full sized bed.
The host simply needs to spend a little time insuring the home is maintained better and basic supplies are in place to make this home a viable Airbnb."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful large kitchen perfect for a family or group of friends and such a great place for pets

We enjoyed our stay and the host is very responsive to any questions or needs.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Gorgeous kitchen and great fireplace wall in the downstairs living area! It was just me and a last minute one night stay. So I didn’t really need as much space as there is. But ample room for families/large parties. Enjoyed the swing out back and a sunset visit from a deer!

Thank you"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The inside was modern, clean and decorated beautifully with wonderful linens. The outside was concerning, it needs cleaned up and pained. Normally we would use the bar-b-q grill & patio but this area was dirty, messy and the used toilet in view made it not so appealing. If the outside had the same attention as the inside it would be perfect."
