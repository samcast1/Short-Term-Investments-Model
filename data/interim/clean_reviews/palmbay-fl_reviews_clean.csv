I give her 10 Stars for personality and professionalism!!!‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place in a great location. The space was clean. We were supplied with everything we needed for our stay. We were able to utilize some of the beach things supplied. We really appreciated the access to child supplies like a pack and play, stroller, high chair, etc. Short drive to the beach and parks. We can't wait to stay again!"

There is a Turkey Creek Sanctuary within walking distance. I walked and explored every day. We went to Canova dog beach daily. It‚Äôs close and the best dog beach I have ever been to. It is nine miles long!
There is a fish restaurant within walking distance that is fantastic.
The Shack Riverfront Restaurant & Outback Tiki bar. You can eat outside if you want and watch for dolphin in the inner-coastal waters.
If you want to be entertained or just enjoy your time at the house, this is the place to stay.
Thank you so much Kathleen (and Mack) for all of your kindness and hard work!"

When I enter the room it was beautiful and so welcoming! It was beyond clean and the decor was very boho. There was a little courtyard with a fountain that was lit up at night. It really was beautiful. The nights were very quiet bed was super comfy. Unfortunately, I was so busy with family, I wasn‚Äôt able to enjoy this lovely place as much as I wanted to. I highly recommend staying with Areen. It‚Äôs a little piece of boho heaven!"

From start to finish they have been amazing with outstanding hospitality and responsiveness. They have exceeded our expectations by going above and beyond to help us celebrate our anniversary. We were welcomed with 2 red heart balloons, roses, bottle of raspberry sparkletini, bath towels decorated as swans and a handwritten anniversary card. We were in awe!! In addition to our stay, the Boho Studio was so clean and fully stocked with snacks, beverages, and a goodie bag. They had a folder with suggestions to local restaurants and attractions. We recommend that if you stay here to visit the nearby Turkey Sanctuary center and walking trails. For dinner, we tried Osaka and were not disappointed! This beautiful place is a hidden gem and we highly recommended that you stay here! Thank you so much, we will be back soon to stay again!! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying with Areen was hands down the best Air BnB experience I have ever had, everything was perfect! The bed was comfy and clean, there were snacks and drinks waiting for us, a very nice bathroom with a bidet, an ironing board, tooth brushes incase we forgot ours, and a hand written note for us! If they are available next time I‚Äôm heading down to Melbourne, I‚Äôm 100% booking with them again, I would be hard pressed to find an Air BnB this amazing for this price range anywhere else, my fiance wants to live there now haha"

I would love to stay in their home again in the future when I returned to the area. Definitely my favorite home that I stayed in so far.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Francisco‚Äôs place was perfect. We came for a relaxing week and that‚Äôs exactly what we got. The home was in a great location where it was quiet while still being a perfect driving distance to beaches and many activities.

We‚Äôre so glad we got to spend the week here at his beautiful home and I would 100% recommend for anyone looking to book in the future.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've been to many Airbnb's all over the world, some good and some bad, but Francisco's was quite possibly the best I've been to!

Would book again in a heartbeat!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Marisa was very nice to work with and very responsive to questions. The house and pool are are all very clean and everything looked like new. The neighborhood is quiet and its a nice place to walk. Shopping is close with lots of options. Parking in the garage was a real plus. The bed was comfortable ( master bedroom) We did not use the others.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family really enjoyed this place! Marisa went above and beyond to make us comfortable and even left a hand written note with a few age appropriate toys.

The Lowes‚Äô"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Marisa was very responsive the home was well kept.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Had a great experience from the very beginning .The host was incredibly helpful and responsive. Beautiful home, so relaxing and peaceful. My family loved the home and we enjoyed the pool and the hot tub. The day we checked in, the host noticed the water dispenser from fridge wasn't working so she bought us two gallons of water. WE WOULD DEFINITELY BOOK AGAIN!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay at the house. The pool and hot tub area were especially impressive. Marisa was very responsive and helpful. We enjoyed using the Three Forks Marsh which was nearby and drove to the beach most days during our stay (about a 20 minute drive depending on lights and traffic). The house was perfect for our family of 5. Highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We just spent a week in Marisa‚Äôs home and it was perfect! The house was spotless and the pool/hot tub area was amazing! Marisa was so attentive to our needs. Definitely a 10/10 and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a place in this area.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was spotless & super clean. The host had excellent response time & was very accommodating. We were a little concerned about the jacuzzi being turned on by the host because it's a huge requirement anywhere we stay. We use it nightly and even sometimes in the day depending on the outside temp. But Marisa had great response time and changed the time settings to what we requested. The jacuzzi was hot and clean and perfect for what we were looking for. The location is great.....super quiet and private. The bed was slightly hard for our taste but I know everyone is different. One tip I would give is the space is a bit bare, it almost seems like a staged home. I forgot my steamer & it would have been nice if there was an iron there, which I couldn't find. Along the same tone I would say a towel closet with multiple beach & shower towels vs just the 2 pool towels that we were left. These are just minor things....overall the stay was great and Marisa was a fabulous host."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marisa is a phenomenal host, she was so quick to respond to all of my questions & emails. She would check in with us to see if we needed anything. The house was super clean and had plenty of space. The pool was amazing! We enjoyed our stay and will be back again!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our family Christmas was delayed due to illness so we decided to reschedule and get an Airbnb, best decision.
Booking was super easy. The house was very clean beds and shower were like high-end hotel quality.
It was almost just like being at home. We had everything that we needed. We could‚Äôve used a little bit more in the kitchen as far as being able to cook and prepare food for our family. We had brunch served for them before we started in on our Christmas celebrating.
We were comfortable in the bed. I had to ask about the pillows because I want to set for my home very comfortable. Everything was clean and the hosts communication was perfect.
We really did enjoy our stay and will be doing this again next year for our Christmas again and I‚Äôm talking to my husband about using the same place. The pool was warm. The spa was just right and we felt secure with the cameras around the house.
Great stay and we will be doing it again!!!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here to visit family nearby over NYE weekend. Nice Palm Bay house; well maintained. The heated pool was a hit with the kids even in January, and the hot tub was a relaxing feature for our family to use. House smelled fresh and clean upon entry which was also a nice touch.
The only minor critique I can think of including is to have more variety of cooking supplies and kitchen essentials for meal preparation. However, this seemed like a fairly new Airbnb listing, so I‚Äôm sure that will improve with time.
Overall, we‚Äôd definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Seriously the most spotless ever. Great communication. Beautiful pool and hot tub. Amazing!!!! I will definitely go back üòÅüòÅ
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place. We saw dolphins, manatees and stingrays that swam right up to the dock. Beds were comfortable. Place was clean. We loved the back porch and the dock of coarse to watch the wildlife. Would definitely recommend! Stay here and see your own private wildlife show without the tour boat prices!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our girls weekend was perfect! we had an absolutely amazing time! such a beautiful spot! The pictures and amenities were exactly spot on, and Lindsey was extremely responsive, and quick!
LOTS of spices, utensils, cookware that made it so easy to feel right at home and make our own meals. The outside porch was so peaceful and so pretty!! if you didn't see a dolphin, (or stingray and zillions of fish) you weren't looking!! The Lazy Turtle was practically steps away,and such a chill vibe. We enjoyed downtown Melbourne as well as the beach, and they were so close as well!! we will definitely be back!! loved it!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely coming back in the future. Quiet place with a beautiful view of the river behind the house. There were actual dolphins swimming by!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,we always enjoy staying here. Lindsey quickly responds if needed and checks in to make sure our stay is going well. we look forward to staying here again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Lindsays home. We were in the area to visit family and do some fishing. The home was above and beyond for being clean and spacious. I was extremely impressed with how clean the home was upon arrival. Having a washer/dryer was a plus. The screened in patio& dock were amazing! We saw dolphin, manatee and caught many different fish you dont see up north. Lindsay was so kind & we will definitely return again. Thank you!!! Also a close drive to melbourne beach area!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great vacation staying at Lindsey's! Located right on the water with our own dock was a wonderful place to hang out and we were constantly entertained by dolphins, seabirds, and all manner of fish. From what we heard from the local fisherman it is the best fishing spot on Turkey Creek. The huge Florida room was a great place to have meals and spend our evenings - truly a gem!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is on a beautiful bay, and the yard is lovely. There is a train track right across the main road, so the Brightline train ran at all hours, which was a bit noisy. The location is great for getting just about anywhere on the space coast easily."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying at the home of Lindsey and Gerald. We always have such an amazing time and the place is always a joy to use while we vacation in the area. Lindsey, as usual, was a 5 star host. Everything is so clean and organized! We hope to continue to be her guests in the years to come as we love bringing the family here!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,All in all I would love to stay here again great times
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful spot & host. The home is well appointed and in a beautiful location. We will be back - Thank you Lindsey!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lindsey‚Äôs place is absolutely beautiful! It was clean, roomy, and the view of the bay is gorgeous! I would definitely return in the future!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great host - great property - awesome experience ... Everything was setup very nicely and the property was outstanding ... I wish the weather had cooperated with us enough for me to bring the boat, but next time I'll definitely bring the boat ... the kids had a blast in the yard and fishing off the dock and there was plenty of open areas on the porch and living areas ... Lindsey was great - allowed us to check-in early since we were arriving several hours ahead of schedule ... Overall, this is one of the better places we've stayed at and we will be back again in the near future."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was wonderful. Lindsey was a great host and very responsive. My husband fished every day off the dock and saw dolphins and manatees everyday. The home was clean and had the most comfortable beds. This is a home we would gladly stay at again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot. Feels like home. Would love to come back
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lindsey was very accommodating to me and my family over the Thanksgiving break. I needed to get in early to set up for my family. The neighborhood is very special!
I loved the house on the water. It was a little piece of heaven!
Amy"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice old FL home with huge yard, grill, dock, kayak. Lindsey was super responsive and nice"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful stay in a beautiful home and location! Enjoy sitting in the screen room, watching the river and sunset. House was clean and had everything anyone could want/ask for! Will definitely come back and recommend to everyone. Very clean home and responsive host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful place to stay, lots to see on the dock"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lindsey and Gerald are on top of it. Thank you both you were a blessing. Place is great. We fished off the dock. We caught two kinds of catfish, crab, tarpon, sheephead, mangrove snapper, mullet, and stingrays (3). We saw manatees, dolphin, sharks, and alligators.
We strongly suggest fishing after dark because if you catch something you can see bloluminesance in the water. The sharks came about 10 to 11 pm. You could see them swimming because of the bloluminesance.
The place was very clean and conveniently located. You cant beat the views. Manatees swim right next to the dock every morning and evening.
Great trip. Thank you both. What a great stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you! We had a wonderful stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a wonderful property! Everything about the property was top quality. The photographs did not do it justice. The kitchen was well stocked with condiments we weren‚Äôt expecting, pots, pans, and dishes of high quality. The property is obviously well cared for. The bathrooms were spotless with plush towels and wash cloths. The outdoor space suited us perfectly. Having access to a BBQ grill was great and the patio area was very peaceful. The dock accommodated our boat perfectly and we were able to fish right there. The dolphins and manatees put on quite a show for us every afternoon. Always special to see them. This is a special place and we plan to return."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came specifically for snook fishing and this spot didn‚Äôt disappoint. We caught all sorts of fish, saw manatees and dolphins, and had dinner every night on the screened porch. This house is well-stocked with everything you could possibly need on your trip, to include things you don‚Äôt necessarily need, but would probably want to have on hand! Not only that, but this home was impeccably clean. Perfect getaway; we had an amazing time here and will be back! Thank you for having us, Lindsey!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we opened the door we felt right at home! This home is beautiful and spacious, a perfect place to unwind and spend with family. Lindsey was a gracious host and even allowed a few of our family members drop by to say hello. The kids brought their fishing poles and we all sat out front watching the dolphins play while the sun set. Everything in the home is easy to locate and the beds were super comfortable. It's so wonderful to stay at places like these versus hotels. If you get the chance to book this home please do not hesitate. Huge thanks to Lindsey for allowing us to stay and create memories to last a lifetime!"
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cleanliness of the house was spectacular. The kitchen is appointed ok, could use more dishes, bowls etc. the back porch overlooking the yard and water is wonderful. The only negative about the location is the nearby train tracks and main road were loud at times.
We did have one major issue during our stay. There was a very strong sewer gas smell coming from the bathroom by the bedrooms on the second day of our stay. The owner, who lives nearby, was very responsive to address the problem. The smell went away, returned a day later, then went away again, which was very frustrating for both us and the owner as the cause of the smell could not be determined. Not wanting to risk the smell returning, we were not able to use the bathroom the remained of our stay and no partial refund was offered by Lindsey or airbnb after we asked which is very disappointing. So, if the source of the very foul sewer smell has not been discovered and corrected, beware."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was our 2nd time staying here, and we enjoyed our stay. We liked being on the water and frequently used the dock to fish and watch the dolphins and manatees. It was a great neighborhood and the location was convenient to all that we wanted to do in the area. The house was clean and well equipped with everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A great experience, a unique place in a unique location. Large, clean, comfortable house, very well stocked and furnished, with many welcoming touches. Magnificent screened room overlooking the harbour, perfect for eating and relaxing. Great dock and grounds to watch the dolphins, fish, birds, and wildlife, and lovely quiet neighborhood for walking. One thing to note: the place looks across the water to A1 highway, which can get busy and loud, something which took getting used to in contrast to the perfect serenity otherwise. Lindsey was great to deal with, very quick to respond, very attentive and helpful, everything you look for in a host. Thank you."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I highly recommend this place. It's absolutely beautiful, clean and relaxing. Lindsey was a great host and very good at communicating. We will definitely be back!!"

the views were beautiful and peaceful. Great place to get away and relax!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,One of our all time favorite stays and we will be back. We brought our paddle boards and went on the creek every day. Just sitting on the enclosed porch with coffee in the morning is worth the stay.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and great views. Loved having access to a kiayak!! Manatees swam right under the deck!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a neat little place right by the water! Peaceful yet close to everything. A great place to go for a walk and relax. Didn't try the kayak but hoping to next time I am in town!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful setting and a lovely Florida Style Home on the River, perfect spot to relax, unwind, take in the wildlife.
Well maintained and very well considered letting with the hosts being fantastic to deal with and very good at supporting you whilst you stay.
House is well stocked, well maintained and should meet all your expectations as its exactly as described. Would love to stay again and hopefully with sunshine next time."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We absolutely loved our stay. Amazing wildlife viewing, so many great spaces to enjoy the views. The screened porch was a fantastic space for lounging and outdoor dining. I came to work remotely and had great internet, no disruption on Zoom calls. Definitely a great place for a work-cation. The owners thought of every detail and we had everything we could have needed! The guide book covered every detail perfectly. We happened to be here during Hurricane Nicole - the host updated us quickly and we felt safe and in good hands the whole time! Thankfully the storm impact was minimal but we would have been prepared for anything! The home is situated close to so many things - I went running on the causeways, visited local sanctuaries, popped into a few yoga studios, and checked out dining hot spots. My grandfather accompanied me and mobility is an issue. We were able to park right at the door and it was easy for him to get around the house too. Absolutely recommend this home for anyone looking for a relaxing stay - especially if you like sunset on the bay front!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This has been one of our best staycation ever. We did not want to leave the house and go out like we usually do during vacations. The house was so clean and welcoming. It was sufficiently stocked with everything we would need - making us feel at home! Who would have imagined seeing dolphins right from the living room?! It was a treat to sit in the living room and watch the shimmering waters and the diving dolphins. The yard was always so inviting and we enjoyed hanging out there whenever we weren‚Äôt in the screened porch area or the living room. The owners have an awesome barbecue grill set up Everything about the property was just awesome! The dock where we did some fishing was our next favorite. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay there and we would do it again of we get a chance."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice home. Fully stocked. Exactly or better than described views. Saw fish, sharks and dolphins from dock. Clean and convenient. Will definitely book again in near future"

2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing Spot!
Dolphins swam up to us daily.
The VIEW IS IMPECABLE. The rooms are a little outdated but the service makes up for it. We travel all over the world and this is by far one of the most unique, coolest places, we‚Äôve ever stayed at. The dolphins will swim right up to the boat dock and show off to you.
We saw manatees, dolphins, opossums, all sorts of cool fun nature. I highly recommend this place 10/10 stars."

The kitchen is nicely equipped, with dishes, pots and pans, utensils (serving and eating). Washer and dryer very convenient, too.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Oakar's place for more than a month as I transitioned to the area. While I was there alone, with 4 bedrooms, it's set up well for larger families. the place was very nice and clean. A couple of big TVs were a big plus for me. New appliances. As described, it has easy access to I-95 (2 minutes), but the pleasant surprise was how quiet the house is. No road noise at all. Oakar was always available and emailed me regularly to see if I needed anything. Would also highly recommend for a good value."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our 2 nights stay in the place. The room was very comfortable and homely and looked exactly the same on the photos. Instructions on how to check in were clear and precise and Anthony was a responsive and helpful host! He made our stay in Palm Bay relaxing since we were a little bit busy out during the day time. I would recommend Anthony's place to anybody and will probably book again the next time we go to Palm Bay.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sensational place. I will come back for sure.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place to stay. Good pricing for just a place to go back to rest after all the fun activities close by to the Airbnb. I enjoyed it all. Thank you for making it also very personal feel.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"very nice accommodations
looked brand new"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night at Anthony's place, but wish we could have stayed longer. The photos are exactly what was there, but in person it was way better than the pictures. It was a beautiful place and immaculate. A lot of care is put into the suite to make it just right. The bathroom was huge, cute walkway coming in, and overall was great. Host was very responsive to all my questions. All the places we have stayed are very nice, but this one has been the prettiest and our favorite so far. Would definitely recommend, and we will stay again if we are ever in the area and need a place to stay!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Simply put - It was a great place. Host thought of everything. I'm talking 100% organic cotton sheets, whole bean coffee with grinder, to-go cups, amazing bathroom, microwave, etc. Seamless check-in, check-out. Extremely clean environment. Quick to the highway to get to local attractions like Brevard Zoo (amazing by the way!) and downtown Melbourne. Very professionally done and we highly recommend."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I can't say enough about Anthony's place. It was so n8ce and clean. We felt right at home and Anthony was a supberb host. I would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was very clean and new looking. There were plenty of extra blankets and the bed was comfortable. Most everything that you need for a night or 2 was provided. The shower was great with plenty of hot water. I liked that the lights on the walkway to the back were motion activated. I would have liked it if the 2 lights on either side of the the garage stayed on at night, that would have made unloading the car at night much easier. I only had one real problem with the place. There is no controllable thermostat. If you like it between 69 and 71 degrees Fahrenheit you'll be good. I like it a little warmer and it was a very cold day and night. I texted Anthony and he raised the temperature a little and it helped but I would have liked it a little warmer. I didn't want to pester him so I didn't text him again. The extra blankets helped a lot for the overnight. Putting in a separate heating/cooling system is a major expense, so I would understand if he leaves it as is."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just as advertised and ideal for us in our brief visit to the area. The place was impeccable clean. The night lights in kitchen and bathroom were a nice touch. Airbnb should think about requiring them. Would certainly recommend and stay again.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect one night stay for a wedding we attended up the road. Place was extremely clean and well kept.

Additionally Ruth informed us a day prior about people who needed to come by in the morning.

There are no ceiling fans and the air conditioning controls are locked behind a lock box. When we arrived it was set to 73, and in Florida, it was too hot. Definitely be prepared to bring a fan.

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I really enjoyed staying at this home. It felt like home away from home. The house had almost everything we needed for our vacation. If you are looking for a home in a peaceful area but still close to the beach, this is the home for you. There were plenty of beds to sleep on for my family of 7. The only negative thing I could say would be, I wish there was a grill and wash cloths. Minus those, everything was great!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would rent this property again without hesitation. Hosts Kathy and Jamie are excellent communictors and run an excellent rental. Very fast and helpful. I could not be happier. The property is a recently refreshed home and in very good condition. All rooms were very clean and clear instructions were given. I had asked Kathy, if by chance there was a chess set in the house and she said ""no, sorry"". When we checked in, there was a brand new game set that served our needs perfectly. What a pleasant surprise and gesture. The home is located in a very quiet neighborhood, about five to ten minutes from just about anything you need, 10 miles to the Indian River and 16 miles to Melbourne/ Indialantic Beach. Rent his house, you will be happy."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kathy is such a wonderful host. Very easy to talk with. The house was clean and well equipped. Highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed our holiday week at Kathy‚Äôs place. The home is located on a quiet street, there is some new homes being built around the area but didn‚Äôt bother us. Neighbors were friendly.
There is lots of shops and restaurants a quick drive away, great movie theater up the road.
Will stay again when we are back in the area."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Omg the place was wonderful and my family loved it. Everything was in place and clean. The back yard was huge and the kids loved it. They ran around playing tag for hours. The rooms were spacious as well. The only issue we had was that we couldn‚Äôt sign into our prime accounts to watch tv we were stuck using the owners account. It was a great stay. I live in Palm Bay so I rented the home for my family who came into town and I stayed with them. I loved it

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very nice! We stayed at James's place for 3 nights and really enjoyed the room and backyard. Feeling the Florida sun in the morning surrounded by the pool and the palm trees was a blessing. The place was relatively close to anywhere we wanted to go.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quaint Beach Bungalow. Had everything we needed.
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Accommodation is outdated, a bit dark, furniture is very old and bed is well laid out. Cleanliness leaves something to be desired.
Amenities for cooking could also be better, there is very little equipment available.
Swimming pool and open space are shared with owner Pool was not cleaned and therefore could not be used during our stay.
Highway is not far away, so it's noisy in the garden.
Price is too high if you look at all the details. On our Florida Road Trip, there were significantly better Airbnb's in this price range."

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was pretty decent sized, with very dark wood paneling and blackout drapes, which made it great for sleeping. The bed sags in the middle, but was more comfortable than it looked. Quiet neighborhood. It was nice to park under the carport. Close to downtown Melbourne. 8 minutes to Apocalypse Coffee, best coffee in the county!"

2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was quiet and the pool was clean, big yard but the kitchen stove was filthy under the burners and there were ghost ants everywhere in the kitchen and bathroom. They got in my bags of food I sat down on the counter. There were noises I didn't recognize at night in the kitchen and it appeared there were people in the main house connected to mine. The house was more like a hotel room with a full kitchen...It was old and needed some updating.. The price was ok for what it was..The bed was very comfortable..and the host was very prompt with answering back my emails.
I stayed for 6 days coming from Maine to Florida while a friend recuperated from illness..I would not recommend for a lengthy stay until the place is cleaned thoroughly and updated.. FP from Maine"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Overall experience was great and will suggest for other trips to come.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was so grateful to James. we needed a place last minute over Christmas due to an ill family member. he made exceptions for my little family and helped relieved a ton of stress this weekend. the bed was very comfortable, everything was clean and exactly what we needed. his yard space is great and if it had been warmer I would have taken advantage of his pool. The yard had nice lighting at night also. Thank you so much, James, even though this weekend was hard emotionally you giving us a place to stay helped so much."

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"James‚Äô place is convenient for few nights, the position is good. The bed is very comfortable and bed sheets are soft. Check-in was smooth.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay close to the Beaches
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Lovely place. Great amenities and the bed and sheets where delightful.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Perfect spot for two people. Nice to have the option to cook or grill instead of having to go out or order for every meal. Place is close to everything! Beaches of Melbourne were 10mins down the road as well were the stores. Lovely pool to relax in every day and night!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place! James is a great host! Very convenient location with great amenities.
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place could be so much better if only it was upgraded. The towels are old and stained, the coffee pot was too dirty to use and the kitchen utensils are so cheap you can‚Äôt use them. This place was so disappointing. The Wi-Fi comes and goes just like the hot water in the shower. I‚Äôm not sure what the $50.00 cleaning fee is for. I had to spend time cleaning the kitchen because it was very dirty, before I used it."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great location to everything you might want or need.
The pace was clean and perfect for one person or a couple.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2022-05-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"We had problems with the lock and we finally got it to open but never heard back from the host or any follow up. Very poor communication. The Wi-Fi kept going out every few minutes. We had to restart the TV 6 times to watch a 2 hour movie. This morning, we started watching another movie and we had the same problem. It worked for a minute and then froze so we had the exact same problem but ended up just giving up on the movie. Pretty disappointed honestly. This was the first Airbnb we've stayed at, that had no water in the fridge or even a hairdryer. Every single place has had the essentials, even a gallon of water. There was no soap in the dispenser and hardly any body wash. The towels were obviously clean but very used and had stains on all of them. The bathroom door needs to be fixed because it scrapes and gets stuck. It's very noisy. The photos on Airbnb were misleading because certain things were not in the bathroom and the shower needs to be redone. This place could be nice if time and care was put into it."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed myself very much. The property was very nice. Loved sitting in the s
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,James and is place is fabulous. Go stay at Ann‚Äôs rat invested nasty place in Palm Bay. You will see that this place is worth the money. Great set up James has and is an awesome host.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great place in a quiet neighborhood, very nice pool in the back yard, and comfy bed! What more do you need in an overnight stay? Communication with James is/was terrific, very fast response. Would most definitely recommend."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay no problems or complaints. Everything went smooth.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our favourite place to stay during our 2 week trip around Florida. We booked it last minute and only for one night but it ended up being our favourite AirBnb. It was really clean, comfortable and quiet. James was really helpful when we arrived, telling us directions for all the best places. We really loved the area too. Non touristy with amazing bars. restaurants and shops and a stunning beach. We want to return to James's. Thank you for a great stay."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was such a great location and perfect for two people! It was nice and clean and the pool was super convenient!
2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"The pool was terrific! Bed was comfy, basic kitchen utensils were provided and the space in the suite was roomy enough for two people. Trains are nearby, so bring ear plugs if a light sleeper. Deep cleaning of suite would be a plus. Covered parking was an unexpected surprise!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this airbnb is exactly as advertised. super clean and comfy. amazing quality. very easy to use kitchen. one of my favorite airbnb's ive stayed in. wish i could have stayed longer to spend time in the amazing backyard. thanks james
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful location. Literally righht down the street from amazing downtown Melbourne. Beautiful backyard. My boyfriend and I didn‚Äôt get a chance ti enjoy the gorgeous pool but we did love sitting outside and the awesome pool table! The bed was sooooo comfy and I enjoyed my stay and will def be staying again soon
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A unique and comfortable place to stay. Quiet and well situated with easy access to the main highway. I did not have time to enjoy the outdoor recreation area but it was nice to know it was there if I did.
It was a great location for my local travels to points of interest both to the north and south for my birding adventures.
Comfortable climate control and a good sleeping environment."
2022-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet and perfectly adequate for a several day stay. Basic accommodations with comfortable bed. Convenient to Palm Bay, Malabar, and SE Melbourne. Use caution with hot water as it can be scalding hot. Parking under car port keeps car cool. Internet was intermittent but adequate otherwise. Pool is an extra bonus. Kitchen okay, includes basics for two people but also has a bullet blender...but no ice trays for those frozen drinks. Again, adequate, not luxury, quiet, comfortable bed, good value relative to other properties in the area."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and nice welcoming at check in and the property owner is super awesome! Great guy! Thanks James!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host very cool and respectful also was very flexible
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great space, we grilled in the BBQ that was in the private patio. The common area with the pool and billiards was a great plus. The space was very accommodating plenty of space; there's also a stove and fridge to cook inside as well. James was very attentive and we had an overall great stay. The beach is very close by I highly recommend."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. I will be staying here again.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for a long weekend in Florida. Quiet neighborhood, house has everything you'd need. It won't blow you away, but it is most certainly maximum value for the low price and looks exactly like the pictures. If you're a couple and just looking for a place to sleep for the night while spending all day out and about, this is the place for you.
Just a short Uber-ride to Downtown - about 5-10 minutes by car. The backyard is as-advertised and while we didn't actually use it (weather was too cold) it looked very nice and I can see people having a good time back there with the pool table and in-ground pool. Covered driveway and easy check-in with the keycode for the door. James was easy to communicate with and was around the entire time we were there. If we needed anything I would just catch him outside or knock on his door.
I usually have trouble sleeping outside of my own home, but not this time - this is probably the most comfortable bed I've slept on between hotels/AirBnBs and it's not even close. My wife and I were both pretty surprised at how comfortable the bed was and we have both traveled quite a bit!"

2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"check in was super easy. the space was plenty for my husband and I. We stayed for an event in downtown Melbourne. Less than 2 miles from downtown, we ended up walking there and back. wouldn't suggest doing it alone, as you pass a lot of old junk yards and acrossed a seedy bridge. it's also a 4 minute drive/uber. bed was pretty comfy, temperature was good. I slept great, but my husband is a light sleeper and the road sounds/train kept him up, so plan accordingly if you are sensitive to noise."

2021-01-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Grossed out man! Food crumbs on the kitchen counter when i arrived and cobb webs by the sink. Cobb webs hanging from the ceiling...and the grand finale...four large spiders in the shower. Dust on the couch. Dust on the coffee machine and overall dusty. Floors were not swept well.  Smelled a little like stale smoke when you first walk in. I wanted to enjoy the porch and outdoor areas but the cushions, table and everything outside was covered in dust and dirt and with more huge spiders and cobb webs in places. Dirty bowls, plates, and silverware with old food dried onto multiple dishes... Didn't trust anything after all that so i had to clean everything. I wanted to give the host the benefit of the doubt because he seemed like i friendly guy but i would never stay here again. If you do stay here, the lock is broken so you need to type the code in twice for it to work. The first time, the lock blinks red so it makes you think its the wrong code. Type it in twice so it works."

Very quiet location -- the street it's on is a dead end and barely traveled so no traffic noises and no ambient light at night so you can sleep peacefully. Super comfy bed. Apartment was spotlessly clean and cozy. Great television set if you want to watch -- free cable. Love the towels and all the little touches that remind you to go to Palm Bay which is super close and pristine, beautiful. I'm a runner and there are lots of places to jog past -- parks, the Bay sit and watch spots etc. Cindy is super responsive, kind and friendly and though you never get to meet her IRL, it feels as if she's taken pains to ensure you have every single bit of info you need, and pictures to guide you through your stay.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for one or two people. Wonderful for my personal retreat to refresh and relax. Very quiet and in a great location.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"convenient location, very clean. had everything we needed!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy‚Äôs place was cute and cozy, Impressive efficiency for such a small space. We loved the two burner hot plate, and there were enough implements provided for preparing simple meals and dining in. The location was quiet and peaceful.
We enjoyed buying groceries at a nearby market called ‚ÄúThrifty‚Äù on Palm Bay Road. We greatly enjoyed Spessard Beach, recommended by Cindy. Free parking, clean restrooms. Overall, a nice place to stay, with a gracious, conscientious, non-hovering host."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy was a great host. Great communication. The place is small, especially the bathroom, but you have everything you need. Location is good too, close to restaurants, 15-20 minutes to the beach. We wish we could stayed more... maybe next time.."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,5 star experience. Would highly recommend.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We recently stayed here for 5 nights while visiting relatives. This place is just right. It has everything you need for a stay. It's cozy. It's artsy. It's eclectic. A great place to be to kick back after a full day out. It is outfitted for all your needs. There is super nice little nursery just down the road that you can walk to and explore his creations. To be honest, this is a tiny but really neat place to stay but if you're on the larger size, say 6+feet and 200+lbs you may be cramped. As long as we have relatives in the area we'll be back to this place. Oh, and you'll love the roosters crowing from somewhere in the neighborhood - that was a nice surprise! Not enough to wake you up in the morning but to appreciate the area while sipping a cup of coffee in the morning or a cocktail at night on the outdoor furniture. Thank you Cindy."

will definitely be back"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Hibiscus üå∫ Studio was easy to find, easy to check in, easy check out, access to stores, restaurants, gas and beach. Studio was clean, cozy and comfortable.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"After my second extended stay in this unit, I can highly recommend it for a single night or an extended stay in the area. It's very clean and in a very quiet area.

2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one cute set up!! Perfect for one or two guests looking to get away for a bit.
The location was perfect: A quiet neighborhood without a lot of traffic or touristy nonsense, but no more than 20 minutes from some beautiful beaches, shopping, and dining.
Overall, this place was *spotless*. No dust, no dirt, no grime, no critters. So clean and relaxing.
The bed was nice and cozy, and the sheets were sooooo soft! There was even closet space to hang some clothes and cubbies for my jammies.
The kitchen/dining/living room area was everything could have wanted. I loved coming ""home"", kicking off my shoes, grabbing a drink from the fridge, and collapsing onto the couch to watch Jeopardy.
The bathroom was immaculate and... small :-) I'm 5'10 and struggled a bit. If Shaq is reading this review right now, think twice. Elijah Wood, you'll do fine here."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,It's close to everything. 15 minutes too beaches. Only the bathroom is a little small. Rooney's around the corner is great. Good value for the money.

Perfect thing about it - it‚Äôs only 15 minutes to the beach!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The room was in great condition and located really close to some local restaurants as well as gas stations. Very convenient location if your looking to spend some time on the water. Highly recommended! I will definitely be back.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am a former local to Melbourne and normally stick to my same Arbnb spots if at all possible. With it being snowbird season they were all booked. I was nervous to book elsewhere but same as everyone else the Arbnb was perfect for my needs.
Orlando was responsive and flexible to my arriving late. He left the lights on for me so I would feel safe and gave me detailed instructions that were super easy to follow. The bed is comfortable and the shower is great! Which as we all know both can make or ruin your night."
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,The kitchen chairs were plastic and not comfortable. Why would you charge people extra to use a stove washer and dryer in there that you were not allowed to use not worth the money I‚Äôve stayed at much better places.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this home! Had everything we needed inside! Love that there was a tv in the bedroom, Ceiling fan, and ac unit! Super comfortable stay worth the money . Plenty to do nearby"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved our stay, it was close to our son so it was perfect for us.
Easy access to highways if you want to get to international drive which takes just over 1 hour.
Orlandos place has been one of the best air b&bs we have stayed in.
Thanks for hosting us."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Listing was clean, nicely decorated, and is close to Walmart and restaurants. There is a stove, washer, and dryer in the space, but not available for use. B/c the space is attached to the main house, I could often smell food being cooked throughout the space. I messaged the host about a clothing iron and curtain for the bedroom window. Host was quick to respond, but unable to accommodate requests. As others have mentioned, the home is located on a frequently traveled road, so backing out of the driveway will take a bit of patience. Also, If you're a light sleeper, you will NEED ear plugs. Overall I had a good stay and the price point fit my budget requirements. If it weren't for the road noise, it would have been a great stay. I would recommend this listing for singles or couples who plan to dine out a lot and don't mind noise."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I will 1000 percent stay here again! We loved it. I was here for a business expo and this was the perfect set up for me. Thank you!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,David was a very nice host and answered the phone very late at night (4AM) to help us with checkin mishaps we had since our flight came later then expected. He was very nice and accommodating and the place was very nice for two people and there were great surrounding areas. I would recommend this place for sure
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Orlando & Maria thank you again! we would definitely coming back.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the shower was nice and the water was hot. the owner is a very responsive and quick communicator.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This adorable and stylish guest suite checked all the boxes. I especially loved the shower and the remodeled garage made in to a kitchen. Everything was comfortable and super clean. I never heard anything from the main house, just the main road noises. Overall it was a great stay, with only one draw back. The lawn crew showed up and I had to get my vehicle out of their path. This is a great place for 1 or 2 guests needing a very nice place to stay for an extremely reasonable price. Thank you to the hosts!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Orlando's place had everything we needed for a weekend stay. the private access was convenient and the place was clean. Very much worth it.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great accommodations, it was clean with great amenities and host is responsive."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From start to finish this was such a great experience. We had a super late night flight that had us checking in around 2:30am and Orlando and Maria were beyond accommodating. They left an outdoor light on and door open to help us access easier in the dark. The space is completely separate (great privacy) from the main house and is connected to the garage which has been converted into a kitchen. Both rooms were air conditioned and spotless.
We especially appreciated the amenities. They provided all necessities, bath essentials and kitchen items. They also stocked a few water bottles in the fridge which was great. They even had a box fan for those like us who can‚Äôt sleep without some noise!
It looks like they‚Äôre in the process of hooking up the stove and washer/dryer. Other than that, this place was awesome. The price was perfect and it was exactly what we needed being about 20-30 minutes away from exploring Melbourne, Vero and Sebastian.
Thanks for a great stay!!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the only thing I'm uncomfortable with is that at 9: 40 am they were already knocking on the door because they had to clean the stay. I understand check out is before 10am. But 20 minutes before? They could have waited a little longer. Also, we left everything immaculate. Clean, no trash, and even the picked up bed. Otherwise, everything is excellent, clean, good location, comfortable and spacious. I'd stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here while taking the motorcycle class at Harley Davidson. Less than 15 min from class, about 6 minutes from I-95. Walmart, 4 gas stations, many restaurants very close, some you can just walk. BEST airbnb we have stayed, very beautiful, comfortable and so clean."

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Orlando's place was very clean and they were very responsive to needs. Overall for the price, it's well worth it.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I did not speak to David much but his mother (Maria) is a real Sweetheart of a woman. She drove us to Melbourn, the mall, the beach, etc.
The apartment was VERY clean and we appreciated that! I mistakenly thought that the place was a lot closer to the beach than it was but that was my mistake.
My wife worked from the apartment, via remote access, and it was fine. Internet and TV was good. The kitchen is nice but it is located in a converted garage area. This did not bother me much but it might be a problem for others. The bedroom and bathroom are inside the house (Very Nice).
I would stay with David and his mom again if the opportunity presented itself."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very nice. Clean, classy, and lots of room! The shower was hot and water pressure was great! The only negative would be it's on a very busy road and you get all the things that come with that. But the items that were in the hosts control were superb. One of the best Airbnb's I've stayed in."

,,,"Run away from this listing! No cheaper price is worth your safety and cleanliness. Weird situation, house is orange in picture, but lime green in person. Bunches of cars & boats parked all over the front yard! Debris in ‚Äúcloset‚Äù that was really a makeshift plywood wall separating two spaces. Connecting doors with a hook type of lock. Shower was old and in bad need of calking and repair. I wouldn‚Äôt put my dog in this place. Neighborhood In run-down area with scattered garbage and junk in yards piled high. Not a safe area."
