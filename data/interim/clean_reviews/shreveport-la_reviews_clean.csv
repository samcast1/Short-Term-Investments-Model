2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay.

Quiet neighborhood located a short drive away from shopping & restaurants."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a very roomy home with a genuine ""lived in"" feel. Eclectic old nick nacks and artwork in living areas coexist with thoroughly modern appliances in the well-appointed kitchen. Enormous fenced in back yard. A truly interesting home."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a great place. The backyard and enclosed patio for our two Goldendoodles was worth every penny. Soft beds and lots of room. We were hauling a 12 ft trailer and the parking was a pull in half circle . It was easy in and out; we parked right at the front door. Thanks Annette for an excellent experience!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location/great space for our family this past weekend. Loved the multiple rooms/beds to spread out and kitchen has everything you could need. Even had some waters and ice in the freezer for us. Well stocked with Kleenex, toiletries, garbage bags, dish soap etc. It rained quite a bit during our stay so we didn’t get to enjoy the large yard as much as we would’ve liked. Great park and restaurants close by. Easy to get around. It is an older house, as are most in this area, but has a lot of charm! Annette was very helpful and excellent communication."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable place to relax and chill for a few days. Close to downtown Shreveport. Quiet neighborhood. Felt safe to walk the dogs at night. If we were to ever return to Shreveport, would likely look here first for our stay."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The beds were very comfortable & clean. House was very spacious & comfortable.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"I'm sorry just now seeing your text. There are a few things that I would like to speak with you about.
First, we thought that your house was really nice. We really enjoyed how spacious it is. We also liked the fact that you had plenty of towels for us to use.
Second, there are a few things that we think that needs to be addressed that we believe will make it a better experience for your clients. When we arrived at your property the back door was not completely closed and locked. Most importantly and urgent the sliding door would not lock. We tried several times to get it to lock but it wouldn't. There was and issue with the shower in the main bathroom. There is also a gaping hole in the wall next to the sink.
I hope that you don't think that I'm being overly critical I just wanted to offer my feedback. Overall we enjoyed our stay at your property.
Thank you"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed staying at Annette’s home. I love the Highland neighborhood being close to almost anything you could want to do in Shreveport/Bossier. The bed in the master bedroom is super comfortable and once you’re in it you’ll never want to leave. All of the instructions were very clear and we were very happy with our stay. We would definitely stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I use air bnb a lot because I travel with my dogs and a lot of times, my grandmother. Annette’s houses are home. You feel like home when you walk in, no matter the time of day or night, it just feels like you belong there. This particular house is very retro which I love! I rarely leave a review- because they are rarely to the attention and quality of Annette’s homes :) Hope to see you next time!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The beds we very comfortable, the whole house was clean. Lots of room. I think the showers need some attention. I really hope to rent from Annette again in the future. I definitely recommend this place."

I was offered food every time she cooked. I'm a dog person but even if you're not little miss Eva doesn't get in your personal space. Overall great experience and I would definitely stay again.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I are repeat visitors to Shawn's BAFB, close to Hospitals, Broadmore Paradise. First, I want to say that Shawn is the BEST host. He is extremely quick to reply and accept our reservation and is extremely accommodating to our every need.
We feel that this is the JEWEL of Shreveport AIRBNBs. We really rather stay here than any other place. It is in a very quiet neighborhood, but close to everything; behind the main house, and still very private; plenty spacious and has everything we would need.
Everything is neat, clean, and tastefully decorated. The sofa is so comfortable, I wish we had one like it at home.
Since AIRBNB considers anything below 5 stars a bad experience, please always give Shawn a 5-star. It is WELL deserved. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.
We definitely plan to stay here again when in Shreveport, if it's available.
THANKS again, Shawn!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our very first Airbnb stay and I think we’re hooked. This apartment was perfect, had everything needed to feel comfortable. Cute neighborhood, felt safe, the apartment was clean.
If we ever have a need to be in Shreveport again, we will check to see if Broadmoor Paradise is available! Thank you Shawn."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my first Airbnb and it was the best first impression ever! The place is in a very quiet peaceful neighborhood and it is tucked away from the streets.

I found my home away from home!!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I both felt very at home in Shawn's Broadmore Paradise close to Hospitals. First, I want to say that Shawn is wonderful host. He was extremely quick to reply and accept our reservation and was very accommodating to our needs once there.
This JEWEL is in a very quiet neighborhood, but close to everything.
It's behind the main house, but still very private.
There is a nice covered area with patio furniture to sit outside.
It seems like it would feel small inside, but the separate bedroom, bathroom, and laundry room, along with furniture placement throughout makes it this guest house quite spacious... lots of room to move around in the kitchen too.
Everything was neat, clean, and tastefully decorated. The sofa and chairs in the living room were very comfortable. We had Great water pressure and nice HOT water almost immediately in the bathroom. We slept deeply in the quiet, dark bedroom.
If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.
We definitely plan to stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shawn was very friendly, easy to talk to and if I had a questions he responded quickly. The house was very clean and inviting.

He answered all of my questions within minutes of me asking them and always ended his communication with, ""Let me know if there is anything else that i can help you with.""
His home is very clean, cozy and accomodating. He keeps it well stocked with all that you could possibly need.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here twice and the quality has been consistent each time. It's quiet, safe, very clean, and has amenities that you could not get from most if not all of the hotels in Shreveport. I'm speaking as someone who lived in that Shreveport area for years and knows the quality of hotels around the area..which aren't even halfway decent no matter the price you pay.

The hosts focused their attention on all the right things to make my stay comfortable. The mattress was high quality as well as the linens. Kitchen was well equipped and they even had coffee, cream and sugar for the Keurig waiting. Perfect touch! Highlight of my stay, being an avid golfer, was that it is butted up next to a golf course and every morning and evening I would gather balls in the yard!! It was like an Easter egg hunt and I have some great Taylormades, and Calloway’s that should get me through the summer!!"

Only con was it being located directly behind the owner’s actual house. I don’t recall it being in the description. Owner seemed cool, however if I had known this, I most likely wouldn’t have booked. Despite this, if I had to visit Shreveport again, I would definitely book here again."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Right near everything! Place was very clean with everything we needed.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Shawn’s place was really nice and cozy with pretty decor. We really enjoyed our stay.
2021-07-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"This host’s place is a successful garage renovation turned into a clean and thoughtfully decorated one bedroom bungalow. It is situated behind his nicely landscaped home. I must warn you that the host must invest in a actual mattress in the bedroom. The hard foam left my body numb and my back in knots. I thought my son booked 1 day, to find out I had to stay two days, I almost cried. I paid higher than average housekeeping fees thinking it would add convenience to our checkout. Upon check out we were asked by the host to remove bedding, bring garbage to his curbside, clean this and clean that. Him giving us NEW house rules to do the job of a housekeeper is when I realized his housekeeping fee was a sham. Just a heads up there is no dishwasher and the Ice Machine on the fridge is broken. He also texted us “Don’t leave anything behind as I will not be returned it to you.” This was undiscerning. You will NEVER get repeat guests with an attitude of Ray Liotta in Goodfellas the movie, “F you pay me.” This is NOT what I have come to expect from any Airbnb host. This is not what the Airbnb community is about!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shawn’s rental was exactly as advertised. It was well-appointed, clean and beautifully decorated."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Shawn’s place! It was perfect for my visit to Shreveport! The Broadmoor area location is perfect - in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood, yet walking distance to restaurants and shopping.
The interior appears to be brand-new! Beautifully decorated, spacious, and equipped with everything you might need. I appreciated the fluffy white towels, the thoughtful touches in the kitchen, and the tasteful decor throughout the place. The bed is super-comfortable, with high-quality linens - I slept great! Everything in Shawn’s place was spotlessly clean, which I really appreciated traveling at this time.
Shawn was a perfect host, always quick to answer any questions I had. I hope to stay again, and I highly recommend!!! Thanks, Shawn!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy backyard bungalow with a very comfortable bed and space. Clean, well appointed and worth the price. I would stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what can I say? This is a hidden gem in Shreveport with amazingly hospitable hosts. This was my first airbnb experience, and I would definitely recommend Grant and Lauren’s listings to anyone looking to stay in Shreveport.
The price was well worth it for the private cottage with access to the pool, sauna, and conscience the location."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Grant and Lauren were fabulous hosts! I loved how calm and peaceful the space was. It was quiet enough for me to work without distraction and I slept great. The space was exactly as described and the bed was really comfy with lots of pillows to choose from. While I did not swim in the pool or use the sauna the additional amenities were great. I loved the extra touches such as water bottles in the fridge and a tide pod to wash clothes. Lauren even gave me more water bottles half way thru the week which was amazing. Finally, the surrounding neighborhood was beautiful to walk around in and stretch the legs. When I return to the area I will definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cottage is very attractive, spacious, and thoughtfully appointed. It is located in a nice residential part of town and we felt very comfortable walking around the neighborhood. We really like eating at Orlandeaux's and had a large, late lunch. We skipped dinner, so no comments on places to eat nearby. We did enjoy coffee at Rhino Coffee (uptown location) in the morning on way out. Yes, if we come this way again, we would like to stay here again and would definitely recommend it to friends."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! This will be my top choice when I am in town!

Close enough to everything you need and we had a very easy time getting all the places we needed to between the event we were attending and family we were meeting.

It is a very cute little spot in the host's backyard complete with all the amenities you could possibly need including washer & drier. They had a lovely pool available though it rained almost the whole time we stayed, but would have loved the opportunity to swim otherwise. Spoke with the host, Grant, a little bit before we left and he was very friendly. The location is very cozy and fun. There were lots of good recommendations for food and other fun activities. I would definitely recommend this spot to a friend and if I'm ever back in town I would be very happy to stay with this airbnb again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was so cute and affordable for me and my husband. It was easy to get into and the instructions were very clear.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Really quiet & nice street. Felt very safe and private. Really nice for 1-2 people.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Grants place was in a beautiful historic walkable neighborhood. The outdoor space was perfect for sitting outside. The sauna was a great perk too.

I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a small comfortable place to stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Host was very responsive. Room was clean. Having shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the bathroom would be a nice touch. Appreciated having coffee creamer available with the coffee. Nice to have access to the sauna too. This was not a concern for us, but it might be helpful for others to know. These accommodates would not be accessible for anyone with a physical disability since you have to cross a brick/stone pathway and climb steps to enter the room. We would stay in this airbnb again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Thoroughly enjoyed our short stay. Very Homey and clean. Grant and his wife are great and responsive. Thanks again y’all

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would stay here again and definitely recommend this cottage to others. I was here to study, so I didn’t come out much, but the area around the pool was very inviting with lots of plants and lighting.
They knew I was here to test and stocked the area with lots of Tim Horton coffee, (only the very best!) and I took full advantage…it’s what kept me awake:)
Thank you for hosting me, and being so responsive to all my questions. The bed was comfy, the place was spotless, and it was a nice little retreat away from home:)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Grant & Lauren's place reminded me of a Hawaiian garden with tropical plants (i.e. guava tree, banana palms, etc), & private swimming pool. I swam every morning. The water was the perfect temperature. Even had pool inflatables on request. The flamingo🦩 was my favorite. The place was so peaceful & quiet. The washer/dryer combo was really handy before packing up. Would love to stay there again if the opportunity comes up. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

The location is nested about 10-15 minutes from anything you’d like to do in Shreveport. Their backyard/pool area seemed very peaceful, I would have sat out there if it hadn’t been 100+ degrees out. Pool looked very clean, they offered complimentary body soap bars, wash pods for laundry and coffee k-cups and creamer. I would absolutely recommend it. I actually ran into Grant in the backyard as well as his two pups and the pups were well behaved and Grant was an easy to talk to host. 10/10 would recommend for a weekend trip or even an extended get away. From what I understand, the cottage is also cleaned by a professional cleaning service! Just book it and enjoy yourself!"

Sauna, grill, pool, shower with changing lights, and a very responsive host to any issues. Last night my power went out and grant immediately came over with water, lights and snacks offering his own amenities while the storm happened. They were incredibly sweet and respectful to me having a service animal! The location is quiet, gorgeous and close to all the local attractions you could want in Shreveport! The mini kitchen is stocked with many appliances and a small variety of cups, silver ware, plates as well as laundry supplies for in house washer and dryer. Lastly I ended up staying a day later and they were more than happy to accept me for a last minute rebooking with no issues!
If you’re in the area highly recommend grant and Lauren’s quaint but cozy cottage!!"

You can’t go wrong."

2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"This place is in a very nice neighborhood, the yard is beautiful, the security is great, and every picture and description is very accurate.
There was only one issue, and it was with the bed. The mattress sinks into the middle. If you come alone it won't be a problem, and probably won't even be noticeable. However, if you're coming as a couple you will find yourself to be a bit cozier than maybe you expected 😉. Other than that I would give this cottage 5 stars, and yes we would not hesitate to return."

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This place was ideal for someone wanting a quiet place with beautiful surroundings but close to the action. We really enjoyed our stay and the instructions were easy and access was simple. The only downside to the room was the bed. My honey and I are 230 and 275 so the middle of then bed dipped down extremely too low for our comfort level. Luckily I had a huge oversized pillow that we were able to place under the mattress in order to keep us from dipping down so low. This was something we did not communicate to the owners because unless they were going to give us another mattress it would have been nothing they would have been able to do
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice, well appointed cabin. We only stayed one night but would be a great place for a long stay. It had everything needed and was really cute."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second stay at this quaint backyard cottage. The actual cottage is pretty bare bones. There is coffee and a mini fridge. There is a great TV and a comfy bed. An unexpected little bonus is that this tiny gem holds a washer/dryer. But the real treat is when you step outside the cottage into the back yard. I was in town for work, and sitting with my feet in the pool at the end of a long day was quite restorative. The back yard is a little oasis for the travel weary. Great stay! HIGHLY recommend."

Lots of light from the windows throughout the house. Very, very quiet neighborhood. We did a lot of cooking and the gas stove was nice! I appreciate not having those awful fragrance plug in’s in every outlet as some homes do. Just one scented stick holder which we placed on the porch since we are sensitive to fragrances. Back yard was lovely. Mattresses were comfy too. Will be staying again!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After a previous bad experience with an AirBnB, I was very reluctant to stay at one. Our stay at Margie's place has renewed my confidence to try another AirBnB in the future. She answered any questions I had very promplty. The home was very welcoming and relaxing. I'm sensitive to odors, however that wasn't an issue at this home. It had a fresh scent whenever we walked through the door. The extra amenities such as coffee supplies, pantry items, and even bathroom spray were a nice surprise and very much appreciated. The complimentary bottles of water in the 'frig were a great welcome after a long day of traveling to Shreveport. The fenced-in backyard was maintained well and the deck big enough for four adults to hang out on and enjoy the weather. I would definitely stay here again if I am in the area. I highly recommend a stay at Margie's place."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Very clean and beautiful property. Would highly recommend this lovely property 🙂
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I needed a last-minute place to stay and found this little house - it’s in a great neighborhood, quiet and private, beautifully renovated, and close to plenty of places you may need to go (by car).

Soft lamp lighting. Great bed linens and soft, comfortable towels. Our stay was brief but we really enjoyed the back deck!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wish we had found this place when our son was a freshman and stayed here for the entire four years he has been at Centenary. But we did find this gem of a place and have been fortunate to have stayed here for the last two years of his college journey. We love the location to Centenary and SheHee (baseball field) Stadium. Margie, Tim, and Pam are great hosts. They are super helpful and so responsive and accommodating. I travel for a living and to come into a place that feels like a home not a sterile environment or hotel is such a pleasure. We will miss our frequent trips and stays to Shreveport and this lovely home, but do plan to book it for our son's annual alumni baseball golf tournament and baseball game in the fall."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve stayed here a couple times and love it! Margie, Tim and Pam are super accommodating and friendly. Their place is close to SheHee Stadium and Centenary College, so it’s really easy to get to our sons baseball games.

Thank you, Margie, Tim and Pam. Our stay was delightful as always!!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Adorable home. Felt safe. My daughter and I enjoyed greatly. The rain shower and pressure were so great! Not a complaint one and never even had to reach out to the owners for anything while on a busy schedule.

The beds were super comfy. And i have back issues. So this was perfect. Couches and dining set cute and comfy. Nice *rain* shower in master bath. Everything was perfect! We will definitely be booking this home again!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s very rare I stay at an AirBnb and feel like it could be home and that’s exactly how it felt here. The mattress in the master bedroom is one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept on. Margie, Tim & Pamela were excellent hosts and I highly recommend staying here if you have the chance."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at Margie’s place. It was clean and very comfortable. We are traveling with our two small children and the clutter-free space was perfect for curious little explorers. The house was spacious and had everything we needed. We only stayed one night but I could imagine staying there longer and having a great experience. The neighborhood is very cute and all the neighbors we met were friendly and welcoming. The fenced in yard felt private and safe for the kiddos. I would absolutely stay there again if passing through the area and would highly recommend to friends. The place felt like a deal for the price. The hosts were responsive through the whole time we stayed there and made sure we had an easy and simple check in and checkout.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first time using an Airbnb and it was so easy. We’re glad this was our first experience!! The host was so quick with responses to questions! We had a great time and if we’re ever there again I’m looking up this property first!

The area is very cute with a college-town feel and also very close to cafes and restaurants. The home itself could not be cleaner. Everything was perfect.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The lakehouse is a gem. Beautiful and peaceful surroundings. We spent some of our time fishing and ended up catching our fill of catfish and panfish from the private dock. Finishing off the night frying up the fish on the Wolf grill was an absolute pleasure.
The interior is spacious, clean, and thoughtfully decorated. The master bath with its oversize tub and shower is marvelous.
Would love to stay again if we've ever in Shreveport."

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,This house is fabulous! It was very comfortable for our large family and felt like a 5 star resort.

2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We loved the house - it was perfect for what we needed. The WiFi needs to be improved - it didn't work well at all. If there is a way to spray or control the number of may flies (we know there will always be bugs at the lake) that would be beneficial as well. The seating was great, having the box fans to put on the back deck to control the bugs was also great, and the kitchen was the star of the house!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Lovely home. Everything was great and loved the deck. I would recomend this house.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joey's Lake House was just what our team needed for a manager's retreat. Four spacious bedrooms and bathrooms.

We would come back and book again!

It is a quiet and peaceful location, but it’s not too far from stores, the airport, and the 49x20 interstate corridor. We arrived on the heels of a local water advisory, but Joey was super helpful with navigating it. I highly recommend this lake house, and I anticipate my next visit!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"We had 7 adults stay so we could all attend our son's graduation. The home was beautiful and spacious. Access to the home was easy. The entryway was large enough to bring in all of our suitcases and other belongings without tripping over everything. The kitchen, dining area and living room were large and we all enjoyed watching the NCAA Women's Volleyball finals together! All of the bedrooms and bathrooms were comfortable, but the master suite and bath were beyond our expectations. This was the perfect home for a large family, or extended family to stay."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fabulous serene getaway. The home is beautiful, modern, spacious, and has a great outdoor deck. The kitchen is huge and has all necessary items, and top level appliances. Amazing lake view from kitchen and dining area, with outdoor seating as well. The master bedroom has a deck as well. You wake up with a wall of windows with a relaxing lake view. The masterbath is a dream.... huge soaking tub and extra large shower. The other bedrooms are all nice with their own modern bathrooms as well. Joey quickly responded to any questions, gave suggestions for the area. I cannot say enough good things about this home I appreciate them sharing it for the week with my family. My grandparents lived on this lake and I grew up going often as a child with my mom and dad. It brought back many great memories, this was very warm, relaxing home. It deserves more than 5 stars. Thanks you Joey!"

We defiantly will be back. Thank you for having us."

2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"After four years of return trips, we can definitely say this is the absolute best vacation home in all of Shreveport. If you’re looking for a wonderful getaway with glorious lake views or fishing (pics don’t do it justice!) this is your place. The house manager - Kim - is super nice and helpful. Joey was very flexible and collaborated with us to make the best of our stay. We recommend bringing fishing rods and enjoy some relaxing time on the dock with your family. We can’t wait to come back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best homes and host we've ever stayed in. The property is simply gorgeous and clean. We will surely put this place on our return list. Thank you so much Joey.
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"This place exceeded my expectations! It was beautiful! The views of the lake were amazing! It was cold and rainy while we were there so we didn’t get to enjoy the decks or outside activities but we were perfectly fine with that. The home was so comfortable, we had no problem just staying in. We enjoyed having a bathroom in each bedroom. The master suite was simply spectacular!! Shreveport would not typically be my vacation spot of choice but my parents chose to spend their 59th anniversary there and the house was definitely a highlight of the trip! In fact, they want to return in July!! Wonderful place, great location and amazing views!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property was a DREAM! We didn't want to leave. There was something for everyone and a space for everything. The home was set up so that everyone could be included in activities indoors or out. There were toys for the kids, shampoo, conditioner, soap, and more towels than you could imagine. The stairs were a little intimidating, but then we learned that not only is this property beautiful, but accessible! My sister is disabled and was very pleased that she could comfortably and safely move around the home. All of the bathrooms were wonderful and bedroom As soon as we arrived, we started planning our return. The perfect weather, this home was perfect. The large windows allowed us to enjoy the beauty of the water and boat docks from the comfy couches, kitchen area or the bed! This Home is a fisherman's Paradise"
2022-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay a few days with the family. You really can't beat the view of the lake! We couldn't get the fire going outside or inside, this would've been nice for the colder weather. The showers are amazing in all 4 bathrooms. There were a lot of ants in the kitchen and master bath, but this is perhaps due to the cold. However, this didn't take away from a wonderful family vacation, in a fantastic home! I definitely recommend and will surely return!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home on the lake. We loved getting to be on the water and enjoyed the house. It was my second time staying at this home and both were equally enjoyable! Huge master sweet, amazing kitchen, beautiful views, easy communication."

The house has an incredible master suite and every one of the bedrooms has a private bath which made it a perfect stay for 2 families with small children and 2 single adults. Loved all the amenities, the gorgeous view and the special time my family spent at the lakehouse!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is amazing. The photos do not do this house or it's views justice. It's absolutely beautiful. It has everything from high end kitchen appliances to resort style bathrooms. You won't regret staying here.

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful lake home in a safe and beautiful neighborhood. I visit Shreveport often for work and this is by far the best home I have stayed in. VERY spacious, top of the line appliances, quality linens. Oh and I must add…. A master bath and closet to die for!
I can sum it up in one word…. PERFECT!
You will not be disappointed with this home choice."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"This is a gorgeous house in a fantastic location. The master suite is unbelievable and the kitchen is very well equipped. We saw bald eagles over the lake every day, and the minx even put in an appearance. We made some fun memories during our stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely house, beautiful location!
This is our family's second year staying here. This house comfortably accomodates our two families (one with young children, the other with grown children) as well as hosting our in town family. The spacious kitchen and dining area is perfect for preparing and enjoying meals together. Our family enjoys the deck and dock for spending time together and taking in the beautiful views of Cross Lake. We're counting down the days until our next stay!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Spent a week for an end of summer family vacation. House was very spacious and comfortable allowing for time together as well as privacy with each room having its own bathroom area. Plus sized kitchen and equipment allowed for large family meal preparation as well as a large dining table to gather around. Dock was in good condition allowing us to store both a ski boat and pontoon onsite for great convenience. Large parking area to store boat trailer and multiple vehicles. Great host who made sure our needs were met and that we enjoyed our stay.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Great house! The scenery is great and would say the place has a nice home feeling to it during your stay!

2021-04-01,5,Group trip,Great home to visit one the best lake properties hands down
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"This place is absolutely fantastic. A bit pricey at $400, but fair given the location and decor of the house. Our party of 7 were comfortable and loved staying here. A problem that I noticed (it is stated in the description) is that there are a bunch of bugs due to it being right by the water. Still, 10/10 stay."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,A responsive accommodating host. A modern home with relaxing decks and great views.
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"Another great stay at this amazing home! Beautiful, relaxing and very stylish experience."

2020-12-01,5,Group trip,"Joey’s place is modern and pristine. Our family of 6 was more than comfortable and appreciative of all the amenities as well as the sprinkle of holiday decor. This is the best Airbnb in Shreveport! Joey responded quickly to any and all messages we sent. Waking up to cross lake during our holiday stay was so peaceful and serene. We’ll miss our duck friends and boaters. However, we look forward to returning to stay again in the near future.
Thank you Joey, Happy holidays!"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, very spacious, Joey was a great host"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful house on Cross Lake perfect for accommodating a large group! We had plenty of space for a family of four, two married couples, and a single adult to stay as well as have local family from in town to visit. We enjoyed having plenty of room for everyone to hang out in the living room to watch football, enjoy the beautiful lake views from the deck complete with a fire table and chairs for cool nights, as well as the dock for lots of fishing. The huge kitchen allows for plenty of room to stay in and cook your own meals and is well stocked. This place was absolutely amazing, and we can't wait to come back!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was beautiful. Waking up to the water in the morning and falling asleep to the sound of the waves hitting against the rocks has to be the most peaceful house I have ever stayed in. Every room had a bedroom and an extra pull out in each rooms. Even though we most of our own things their were enough: blankets, towels, tissue, trash bags, paper towels for everyone in the house. The kitchen was huge, which encouraged us to cook all our meal excepts one. The only issue we had was the bugs, but once we learned that you keep the lights off in the door way area the bugs were less of an issue. The place was sparkly cleaning. The back yard was biggest enough for 10+ to have a water balloon and gun fight. We were not able to catch and fish but we do know their are some fish that can be caught right off the dock, which my son enjoy doing every morning. Overall their is a lot of space in this home"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joey's home is absolutely stunning. The views from the lake make the experience very relaxing and memorable. Joey and his lovely wife are such a nice couple and were very accommodating to my needs. They provide everything you need during your stay including local recommendations. I highly recommend Joey's home on the lake!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. 20 min from Downtown Shreveport, but also away from it all. Beautiful view, so peaceful. The Kitchen, living room and dining room are really nice and furnished well. As noted the bugs outside were insane and almost impossible to not let them in at night, but what do you expect at the lake I suppose! We had a nice stay!"
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place!
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place! Joey was awesome and responded very quickly to all questions. Place was sparkling clean. Amenities were great. Dock was perfect for fishing. Location was within distant of everything. 5 stars and definitely would recommend!

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay!!
2020-07-01,4,Group trip,"This place is great. I definitely would recommend. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the grill was in really bad shape (not usable in my opinion) there were a few door issues and the A/C went out on us on a really hot day. With that being said the host was really quick getting someone out to fix the A/C and we were aware of the door issues after we arrived. If those few things are fixed, this place is truly perfect. Great views and location. Clean and stylish house."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,A very good experience for family meet-up. Plenty of room and privacy. The lake is everything described. If you're looking for a peaceful get away this is it.

2020-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place. Being in the lake was so relaxing. Joey checked on us halfway through our stay to make sure we were ok and if we needed anything. He was always responsive if I had a question
2020-01-01,5,Group trip,"The house is amazing. Such a spacious living room and kitchen. Perfect for a large group. The subzero fridge and the awesome cooktop made meal prep enjoyable. The master bedroom and bath were equally amazing. We enjoyed the view of the lake in spite of the rain. Our January trip was great, I can only imagine a summertime trip. Joey, thanks for the excellent hospitality, great communication and just making everything so easy for us."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joey is a great host with a beautiful place. I highly recommend!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time and loved the location. The living room is very spacious and fun for a big group. Loved the thoughtful touches and information regarding the city. My only critique would be some of these glass sliding doors did not open. This was all known to me prior to the stay.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great views from both decks. If you’re staying with a group the upstairs will sound a bit noisy from the master bedroom. It has an amazing kitchen with luxury appliances and cookware. I’d love to visit again when it’s not storming and a bit warmer outside. Plenty of parking is available!
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing and contemporary home on the lake. Beautiful scenic view of the lake with all the comforts and very modern amenities, highly recommend this location"

2019-08-01,4,Group trip,"The LakeHouse is just simply the right name for this Airbnb. The lake view is beautiful and tranquil. Our mornings with coffee on the patio watching the birds, turtles, and boats was so relaxing and picturesque. The home has such a great layout, spacious, clean and updated. My family and I where so at home here during our stay. Thank you Joey!!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This has been the best experience I have ever had. Joey was an excellent host, very accommodating and helpful. This place was magical, comfortable, relaxing and quiet. The lake was the most peaceful place and has amazing sunrises and sunsets. The view is breathe taking with lots of wildlife. The house is very clean, spacious and modern. The host really did an amazing job with decorating and interior design. My family loved this house and it was a bit hard to leave when it was time to check out because we adored this place so much. I am definitely going to be back. Thank you Joey for all of your help and for having us at your beautiful home."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic lakehouse. Incredible view. Modern amenities. The dream in Shreveport.

2018-09-01,5,Group trip,Amazing house with a great view on the lake
2018-09-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful and stylish with amazing lake views. Thinking up excuses so I can rebook again :)
2018-08-01,5,Group trip,"Joey’s place offered a great space for our guys trip, but would be perfect for any group. The kitchen and living areas were fantastic and the 4 bedrooms offered great privacy when we needed it."
2018-06-01,5,Group trip,Super view. Lake was gorgeous and views from family room and master bedroom and two large decks was awesome. Lake was also dark enough at night we had magnificent views of night sky with our portable telescope. Sleeping was great and bathrooms spacious.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Well, I now have a new favorite Airbnb spot. And I’ve stayed in a lot of truly fantastic Airbnbs. The view over the lake = STELLAR. Can’t beat it. Just can’t. What is it about looking over a body of water that’s so soothing to the soul? The house itself = CLASSY. Simple, uncluttered lines and design. The amenities inside the house = PRIMO. The ice machine that provides “Sonic ice” was a huge hit with kids and adults alike. Also liked that bedrooms were on three different levels. Seemed to give everyone a little more privacy. Loved loved LOVED our stay here."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. Nice place.
2018-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Joey's house is absolutely beautiful. Very spacious and very clean. What a view of the lake! We rented it for three nights because of my son's April wedding. We had additional family members coming in from SC and we needed a roomy house and this was perfect! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the house and we all had a great time staying there.
My wife and I said that we should come back and rent Joey's house again for a summer vacation on Cross Lake. Then we could use and enjoy Joey's incredible boat dock!"
2018-03-01,5,Group trip,"Joey was an amazing host. He is very detail oriented and provided great instructions on how to operate the different components of the house. The house was not only beautiful, but amazingly set up and designed. We had a great time and loved everything about the trip. We will definitely be coming back to stay again. The house is perfectly placed just outside the city so its not too far of a drive but you also get the peace and quiet on the lake to relax when you are not gambling or playing golf. Thanks again Joey for letting us stay."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would love to keep this secret gem to myself but I can’t in good judgement deprive the rest of the world this beautiful home. We had an amazing time at Joey’s place at Cross Lake. This place is beautiful. Breathtaking lake views. High end appliances, magazine worthy bathrooms and state of the art amenities. Joey is an outstanding host and was readily available should a need arise. I can’t wait to find a reason to come back and rent here again. Thanks again!!"
2018-01-01,5,Group trip,"We felt right at home as soon as we walked in, this is an amazing upscale, well-equipped home located on Cross Lake. The view and access to the lake is spectacular. Joey, the owner is extremely responsive and works diligently to ensure everything is in order for your stay. We had an amazing time and hope to return soon!"
2017-12-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful stay. This house was perfect for our family. We have older children so the privacy of all bedrooms having bathrooms was perfect! So many amenities I have a honey do list for my husband to make upgrades to our house! I would love to stay when it's warmer to enjoy the lake but the fireplace and board games kept us occupied.
2017-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The House was great for the 7 adults and 4 kids for the few days we were there. Everything we could’ve needed was easily accessible to us. Even shampoo, conditioner, soap, and hair dryers in every bathroom! The huge kitchen had all we needed to cook for every meal. We wished we could’ve extended our stay! We came in the winter time but we would really have enjoyed coming in the warmer weather when we could fish or hang out on the amazing dock. Every question we had was easily answered with the well organized house binder of information."
2017-12-01,5,Group trip,"This is an amazing place! Great location! What a view to the lake! House equipped with all high end equipment! Joey, the host, was so helpful in everything.

2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joey's place is PERFECT. FIRST, the view is asluce of heaven - so relaxing!! Second, the location is perfect - your far enough to be away from the hustle and bustle, yet close enough to hit stores, malls and casinos!! Restaurants are close by, but you have a fabulous kitchen - no need to dine out!! I could go on and on about Joey's place - the accommodations is perfect! 4 bedrooms with baths - sound proof is a dream come true. The perfect spot!!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brent’s house was exactly what my family and I needed while visiting my brother and his family in Shreveport. Beds were comfy and I had a place to work while out of town. My parents were able to stay on the bottom floor since a bathroom was available, and I appreciate that they were comfortable while also not having to traverse the stairs. We were close to different parts of the area so everything we needed was very close by. This was a great place to stay for our family trip."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brent’s place was very clean and cozy. When I walked in from work, it smelled of cleaning products (my fav smell). I checked in kind of late bc I had worked a 12hr shift and Brent didn’t mind. Very responsive! I liked that it had covered parking! Came during an ice storm. The decor of the home was beautiful! Loved cooking in the kitchen, it was equipped well. The tv was big. I can’t wait to stay again! Thoroughly enjoyed. Nice neighborhood and close to lots of food and shopping (Pines Rd)"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brent’s place was everything we’d hoped for when choosing the Airbnb. The townhome was as described, kitchen had plenty of cooking utensils and the bathrooms were fully stocked with towels. I will be definitely booking one of Brent’s three properties when I’m back in Shreveport."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Will be booking again in the future
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was great for the price. Three fully furnished bedrooms and two bathrooms.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely weekend with our family and dogs. The location was very convenient with quick easy access to the stadium we were in town to go to and the boardwalk shopping and restaurants. The home was clean, stocked and comfortable. Would definitely recommend."
2023-12-01,3,Stayed one night,"Shreveport is a hard area to find good lodging, so I like to think I had realistic expectations going into our stay. Brent was great with communicating, and his instructions were spot on. With that said, I did not find the unit worthy of the price. It was not clean. The baseboards were lined with dust; the floor was dirty, and I’m pretty sure the bed linens were not clean. The shower rod downstairs was diagonal and falling off the wall. I had to fix it. When my wife finished showering, she dried off and a few long hairs rubbed from the towel onto her. It looks like someone renovated the place with their eyes closed. The paint is peeling off the walls in multiple places; the place smelled like mold, and the water faucets are wonky. The good news is the ceiling fans worked, and the water was hot. My advice is simply to never stay in Shreveport."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Me and my family really enjoyed our stay. The place looks like the pictures. It felt like home away from home. Very cozy and clean. I would rent again if in the area. I also recommend anyone visiting the area to rent. Bret was an excellent host. He was quick to respond if you had any questions. Shout out to Brent! Keep up the good work.

2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We had a good time and enjoyed the townhouse. My older sisters didn't like the stairs because there legs couldn't take them but they just need some exercise. I will most definitely book his place again and tell others about it.

All the bedrooms was nice and accommodate my party it was more then enough room everything was clean he had all the essentials we needed I even washed some of the towels fold them and put them back lol

So I wanted few day getaway with kids for Spring Break. Ask my aunt to book room & I let her talk me into Airbnb & I’m so glad she did. Traveling with kids I was really unsure about not being in hotel but was sold on the fact Airbnb would be like home. My first experience was eased by Brent’s place & more so when met Brent. Everything was as listed and was very clean, fresh & homely. No problem with anything parking was great & Brent communication skills are AMAZING!! Thanks for a wonderful first Airbnb experience & many more to come. Look forward for next trip & hope your available to host again."

My best friend’s bachelorette weekend was a success and having a comfortable place to stay for 2 nights was amazing!!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was exactly like the photos. Brent was responsive to all questions and even sent a list of recommendations for things to do and places to eat. I would definitely stay again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We definitely enjoyed our stay. Comfortable beds, clean home, very peaceful."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed the stay, all the stores were in the same area. We Loved it.Thank you again"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our party of 8 adults and 1 child enjoyed a comfortable and relaxing stay. Brent was an amazing host and we will definitely stay again if we are ever in the Shreveport area. We were in town for LSUS graduation and the proximity to the Brookshire Arena was within 20 minutes. The price, location, space and cleanliness were exceptional! Bedrooms were very spacious, beds were super comfortable, and the bathrooms/kitchen were nicely upgraded. Zero complaints! Coffee pods, sugar and cream and popcorn were an added bonus that we really enjoyed...also loved that shampoo, conditioner and body wash was provided. Thank you, Brent!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I polled my brother, sister, and brother-in-law and tried to compile a review. Everyone was very happy with our stay especially since we were all new to AirBnd.
""I think it was great. When I couldn't get in on the 1st day, he took care of the problem even before I could call him. He responded quickly to every one of your questions and request on how to fix things (i.e. tv channel access). Loved all the extras that were provided. From popcorn and coffee to cleaning supplies and kitchen utensils.
It would have been nice to have access to local stations though (esp for local news and for pro football fans).""
To conclude: The property was spotless. The neighborhood was relatively quiet and felt safe. Wifi was available so that I was able to do some personal work after enjoying the holiday. This location gave everyone in my group a room with a TV set for personal viewing in addition to the large TV in the den. Our host was available to answer questions over a holiday weekend."
2022-11-01,2,Stayed with kids,I was not satisfied with me stay and we had a family emergency and the internet was not working so we had to use our hot spot to watch TV also the last tenant took the remote so we had to download the remote on our phone which was not a problem but when we got ready to go to bed we check to see if the sheets was clean and found out the bed was broke so me and husband had to sleep o the couch our whole stay and the communication was not good.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had no problems finding the apartment. We were extremely pleased with everything, from the lock code to every square foot of the apartment. Everything was as advertised, and more. We were home for a funeral, and didn't know it at the time, but we were only about 5 minutes from where we had the service. We loved everything and our host, Brent was excellent. He kept in touch, and provided any requested information within a few minutes. When we return to Louisiana with our family, we look forward to another stay with airbnb, and if available, this same location."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved this place! Cute, exactly what we needed! All amenities, nice communication touches by Brent throughout. Look forward to staying in the future."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful place! The setting could not have been better. Right on the water, lots of outdoor space. Having coffee or an evening drink on the swings at the end of the dock was perfect.
The outdoor kitchen is unbelievable! So well thought out and perfectly appointed. It’s shared with the other rentals on the property but that wasn’t an issue. Had it to ourselves the whole weekend.
The house is amazingly well stocked and the shower is fantastic! Mattress is a bit firm but not an issue given the rest of this amazing property! Buz was a great host!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Red house was beautiful, even better than pictured. We truly felt like we were staying with friends. Really, a fisherman's dream...Kayaks, the use of Buzz & family's private peer and outdoor kitchen. Lots of thoughtful touches. Snacks in the pantry and breakfast in the fridge because we arrived late in the evening.
My husband lost his wallet and Buzz's son went out of his way to dive off the peer for it. This family and this place seems like one in a million.
Tips for out of towers:
If you are visiting from out of state like us, Tubbs Hardware in Bossier for souvenirs. Special order a King cake from a Bakery beforehand if you want one to take back with you.
There is no bad food here.
Bossier City was the better choice when we were out wandering and didn't know our way around well."

The house was beautiful and spotless. It was very homie and comfortable. Everything we needed and more was provided. I couldn’t think of a complaint if i tried. Buz was outstanding and a great communicator. He stayed on top of trash pick up and dry firewood. I’m thrilled that we got to spend our time in Shreveport without a worry in the world.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here was such an amazing experience all the way around. When we first got to the Airbnb the sun was setting over the lake, and if that wasnt a welcome i dont know what it. The cabin is so cozy and homey. They have gone above and beyond to make sure this place encompasses all the southern charm. You wont regret staying here. I left from the weekend feeling refreshed and relaxed."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Back twice not a disappointment very nice place.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough good about Buzz’s property on Cross Lake. It was so nice and peaceful… just what we needed! It’s close to town, but somehow you didn’t feel close. What a gem of a find! We will definitely be back!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is absolutely adorable. We are repeat guests and will be back again next month! Great place for rest and relaxation!!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved The Red House on Cross Lake! Its ideal location is one plus, but the little cottage was also fixed up so that you were completely comfortable and felt welcome. I highly recommend a stay there. My husband enjoys fishing and even though we were there in winter and it was too windy for kayaking, he was able to catch fish off the pier and by the side of the lake. If you book The Red House, you won't regret it!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great spot RIGHT on the lake and I wish we could have stayed longer! The hosts really thought of all of the best amenities - a sleep sound machine, some breakfast ingredients, wood for a fire, and the comfiest couches and giant bed. Thank you for a great stay!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it's a hidden gem! couldn't gave asked for a more perfect getaway while being in the Shreveport area.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t know where to begin! This place is absolutely gorgeous, the photos truly do not do it justice. Buz, the host, is such a kind man & has really created such a peaceful place to share with others. We are so thankful that he allowed us to have a very small & intimate wedding ceremony in the backyard by the lake. It was absolutely perfect, and the views of the water were the best backdrop and didn’t require any added decorations. We caught some fish off the pier. Had the best shower of our lives with the rain-style shower head. Buz has recently added an outdoor kitchen & pavilion, and although we didn’t use it, it is such a nice added touch for any guests to use. It is so peaceful, yet continently located to town where there are many things to do or places to eat if you choose to leave. I’m so glad I found this hidden gem, and cannot wait to go back someday."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING!!!!! This cabin is perfect!! Even though it sits between 2 other cabins, it is very private!!! We can't wait to return!!!"

The owners have put in so much work and detail in this place which makes it feel like home.
The WiFi is great too if you needed to work on your computer.
Thanks so much for the visit! Will be back soon."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve been to many air bnbs and Buz definitely put a lot of love into this place!

The history behind this gem is endearing and just adds to the charm. The lake is lovely and oh-you can walk barefoot throughout the lush grass in the expansive yard and enjoy the breeze on the patio, after catching catfish off of the bank!
FIVE STAR HOST, FIVE STAR DESTINATION!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third time at the Red House. It is by far our favorite Airbnb. The amenities, views, and hospitality are unrivaled. We are already looking forward to our next visit! Thank you Buz and Jo Ann!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I wanted to get away for a couple of days and found the cabin Buz has listed on Airbnb. We loved that it was on a lake and offered us use of their kayaks and canoe. We were also impressed with so many good reviews regarding his place. So we booked it and found that the reviews were true. It was a very peaceful and quiet place. We tried our hand at fishing and enjoyed a canoe ride. Buz was readily available when we had a question or needed help but wasn’t intrusive with our privacy. And the kitchen was stocked with many extras you may not find elsewhere. We highly recommend it!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was such a great place to stay! The hosts were helpful, kind and available for any questions or help. The bungalow was clean, unique, and relaxing. It was great to come back after visiting family and relax to the view and sound of the beautiful Cross Lake. This place is truly a treasure. We only wish we could have stayed longer. We will definitely keep this location as our first choice when visiting the area again!"

You couldn’t be any closer to the lake, which was nice.
A full breakfast was provided, which was a very nice touch. You felt comfortable with your privacy, but if you needed anything, Buz was right there within moments and so pleasant to visit with.
You will love the dogs. Friendly and beautiful.
It is a great place to stay, and you will absolutely love it.
We can’t wait to go back again."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the third time my wife and I have stayed here and like always it was a welcome respite. The rainy weather kept us mostly inside but the cozy fire and wonderful view of the lake still made for an enjoyable and restful weekend.

The place is sparkling clean, has every amenity you need, and is a dog lover’s dream. Buz and Joann are two of the nicest people you’ll meet.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely fantastic. Words cannot quite explain the care and thought that has gone into making this cabin into a peaceful and serene place of refuge.
Not one detail has been missed; for example from timed candles on the mantle, to white noise in the bedroom, to a full first aid kit, flashlights; a well equipped kitchen, good knives, fishing gear; and interesting books to browse through; just to name a few.
We went to the cabin for a respite from our busy schedule and a place to unwind; rejuvenate and recharge. And Buzz and Joanne it’s a check, check, check for us and we thank you for making it possible."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin, incredible backyard overlooking the water, and such friendly, thoughtful, and responsive hosts. We will definitely go back!!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! If you are in Shreveport and you want a place to stay, stay with Buz! I HIGHLY recommend not just the place, but the kind of people Buz and his family are. The house is SO stinking cool! The amenities are above and beyond! The view of the lake and the access to the dock are just astonishing! We were in town for a very hectic long weekend, but the time we got to spend at the house and on the lake left us recharged! Towards the end of the trip we had the chance to meet Buz and the dogs. He offered to take us to the airport at the end and asked for nothing in return. You will not be disappointed. Thank you, Buz! We really enjoyed our stay!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an AMAZING place! Beautiful setting, immaculate, with every luxury you could ask for; pictures do not do it justice! We loved our stay here & will definitely go back! You will not find a better Airbnb or better hosts! You will fall in love! Guaranteed!"

We will definitely be back."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,To say the Red House is a hidden gem is an understatement! It was home away from home with more amenities than we expected and more spacious than the pictures advertised. The view was amazing and being right in the water was a fishermans paradise! The dock was such a wonderful spot to relax and enjoy the sunset. Buz's hospitality made us feel right at home! We cannot wait to come back again!! Best Airbnb we have had the pleasure to stay at
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Red House on Cross Lake was a lovely and relaxing getaway. It’s in a beautiful and peaceful location with herons and egrets hanging out on the front lawn. The hosts were eager to offer anything we needed and the amenities were beyond any other airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. The cabin was clean and wonderfully decorated and the bed was incredibly comfortable. We really enjoyed being able to kayak every day on the lake, especially at sunset with the sun setting on cypress trees reflected in the water. I highly recommend this airbnb experience and hope to return soon."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. The house is much beautiful than the pictures. Everything in the house is carefully selected and walls are filled with great pictures. The lake is right in front and amazing. The sunset from the deck is awesome. Our puppy probably had the best time chasing squirrels. Would love to visit again.

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gorgeous spot! Absolutely breathtaking as soon as we walked in. A feeling of being at home is the best way to describe being at the Red House. It was really hard to believe it was time to pack and leave at the end of our stay. BUT, as we live only an hour away, we will surely be back soon and often. Don’t miss an opportunity to come to the area House and spend some relaxing time at the Red House!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Oren was a great host for my families outing to Louisiana, nearby lake and only a few minutes away from Shreveport"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our kids deemed Oren’s place the holiday house, and we will be back when visiting family again. The house was super clean upon arrival, not a lot of things around the house my kids could break which was a plus for us, lots of land for my kids to run around on. As specified in description the water is accessible by a small walk which was perfect to wear my kids out. If you’re wanting to cook larger meals here you may need to grab extra pots and pans which wasn’t an issue because we just had family bring some over, but for small meals everything in kitchen was perfect for that! Hot tub set up in back was perfect for the adults and children. Tons of towels were available which was super helpful."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Perfect for a getaway!
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,My family and I rented Oren’s home for the weekend. We enjoyed it with our friends watching the Super Bowl. The home was nice and clean and the host responded quickly to our questions. The outside bar area was an amazing plus to our stay. I highly recommend this spot!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay over Thanksgiving.

Oren was super responsive and even returned an item we left behind to our family in the neighborhood!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Oren was very helpful in his messages throughout the trip. The area was beautiful and just walking around the island was peaceful. The house was clean and very cute with everything we needed for our stay. The hot tub and bar area in the back were an extra bonus that made our trip even better.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great value and honestly an amazing stay Oren got us squared away with extra tvs too which we greatly appreciated
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice house with all the amenities for a nice relaxing stay in the countryside. .
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Oren was so easy to work with and the house had what we needed for a short vacation.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very great place!!! We traveled for work, but so far one of the best AirBNB in Shreveport."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Orens place was clean and comfortable. The surroundings were beautiful. We enjoyed exploring the area and had a nice clean place to relax afterwards.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I had a wonderful time at Oren's location. The home was clean and well maintained. The home was fully stocked with linens, cookware and supplies needed during our stay. It's a peaceful, spacious, country setting complete with a local rooster crowing in the distance (which tickled my 12 year old niece who'd only heard a rooster crow ""on TV"" :-) The only issue was that it is not on a lake or have a lake view as I'd hoped, but we pivoted and drove about 30 minutes to tour and view Caddo Lake State Park. There are beautiful views of water bodies driving to this location, but if your goal is to sit in the back yard and fish or view water, you won't be able to do so here. But, again, there are water bodies within walking distance of the home, and Richard Fleming State Park is about a mile away; we visited each but chose to travel to Caddo Lake State Park because of the views it offered. Nevertheless, I would stay here again, and Oren truly deserves to be a Super Host, he was great!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place to stay, responsive host. Nice amenities"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"very cozy, great host !!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,RELAXING!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was awesome, worked perfect for our family. It's nice to have a home when you travel as a family versus multiple hotel rooms. The hot tub was a delight. All furniture, appliances, and upgrades were in brand new working order. Oren has really went above and beyond upgrading this home and making it comfortable for guest. will definitely stay again when we come back."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"LOVED staying here. Brought my mom here for her 50th birthday and this house was awesome! Super clean, adored the hot tub/outside patio. May have inspired some of us to do the same kind of layout at our houses. Oren was great! Super responsive, proactive, and friendly. 10/10 would go back. Thank you so much Oren!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Oren was great with everything!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was very nice. We had plenty of kitchen space. The outdoor space with hot tub was a plus. Loved the location. It was very relaxing. A great place to get away, but not too far away. Would love to return for another stay. Oren was great!"
2023-05-01,2,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home but that’s about it. Nothing much to do for entertainment. Would recommend board games, cornhole, darts, etc. The property lines can be confusing and the lake is pretty far from the house.
House looks bigger in photos. Video cameras provide very little privacy as well as the many windows with no curtains (even in the shower). Coffee maker was missing when we got there and there was dirty laundry in the washer and dishes in the dishwasher. Just expected better for the price of the place. :( disappointing"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I love the touch of personal photos through the house! Beautiful couple.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely beautiful and comfortable!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Oren’s place was perfect! Very clean and the beds we’re comfortable. Oren was very responsive with any questions we had. We brought our bass boat but due to weather we were able to spend much time in the lake. Although, we did catch catfish down by the fire pit. If we come back to this lake, we will definitely see if this place is available!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was very comfortable and updated! Plenty of space to cook and hangout! Beautiful during sunset. Will definitely stay again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Oren is an incredible host!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! hot-tubbing and grilling! The scenery is really nice out there as well. There are some wild black berry bushes around the property! Oren provided all we needed and was very quick to respond to any questions I had!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was a home away from home.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a wonderful place to relax! Spectacularly clean and comfortable (make sure you use the hot tub!). Oren instantly responded almost instantly to any texts. Highly recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A fantastic stay with a beautifully remodeled home. Loved the privacy and the short walk to a pleasant and peaceful lake view. A definite unique and serene surrounding. Can’t wait to return and take another couple or grandkids. I would highly recommend this location as it is close enough to activity if you want and far enough away to feel like your away from it all. And the hot tub is an amazing addition to this stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I live in Norway so I was looking for a place to gather my family and enjoy ourselves. We enjoyed this place so much. I got to have all 6 of us for dinner. We fit around the kitchen bar, no problem.
I got to spend a very peaceful few days with just my sister. I woke up to birdsong for the first time in a long time. I sat and watched the sunset over the lake and had a drink in the hot tub.
I told my husband anytime we visit we will stay here, fantastic house and a fantastic experience."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Oren was a fantastic host. He gave recommendations on food places to fish. He was willing to do anything to help and provide what we needed. Definitely worth the stay! Will be back!
