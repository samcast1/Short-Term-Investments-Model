2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and very quiet area. The large driveway was helpful for parking my trailer and three additional vehicles.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely loved this stay! Jeff was super friendly and responsive. The home was clean, and the kitchen was hands down my happy place. Every morning waking to see the beautiful lake and sun shining through the windows was serene.
We realized last year when traveling with kids ages 8-15, we need space where we can feel at home and relax. This was everything I could ask for.
After hours of travel, everyone had their own space. The beds were very comfortable.
We will absolutely look to stay here again for our next family reunion."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hello everyone, let me just start off by saying God is so good. This Air BNB was a wonderful experience we loved it. My family and I (family of 5) had to stay here for 1 month because our home flooded. We really enjoyed staying here it was really nice. The owner of the Air BNB is super friendly. He was in contact with us the whole time. We didn’t want to leave this place because it felt some much like home. The Air BNB accommodated our family size plus it was really clean and spacious. We will be booking again in the future.
Thanks so much Mr. Jeff for your warm welcomes, and great hospitality."

This home has its own boat ramp and dock for your toys. Our family had plenty of bedroom space, and living room seating to enjoy the football games. Even though we didn't cook during our stay, there was
a very nice kitchen to cook with plenty of seating for the family of 8 or more. We will definitely be back in the future. Thank you Jeff for all your communication."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff was a great host and has a beautiful home!!! I took my husband there to get away for the week after the hurricane came through our hometown. He is a lineman and worked very hard so we just wanted to get away and relax. Jeff’s home was very homey and welcoming! Jeff is one of the nicest home owners that I’ve dealt with and we look forward to booking with him again in the future! Beautiful, peaceful, and relaxing home again! We thank you for allowing us to stay!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Lake House was everything we could have asked for. It was nicely decorated - with a spacious open floor plan. Everything was well stocked with necessities and plenty of linens, towels etc. The kitchen had everything you would need to prepare your own meals or it is only a short ride to a number of local eatery's if cooking is not part of your vacation plan ;-) The night before our stay there was a bad storm and Jeff drove 70 miles to check everything out and resolved some electrical issues but there was one unforeseen problem with the well caused by the storm that was not apparent until two days later - he rushed a maintenance crew within the hour after we reported the problem and also made the drive again personally thankfully they were able to resolve the issue quickly so that we could continue to enjoy our stay. We hope to return again!"

2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Spencer’s home is located on a spectacular lot overlooking Lake Blackshear. Our family enjoyed a long weekend celebrating a college graduation. The house was large enough to accommodate 8 adults and a few children. The kitchen is spacious. The pool table was a fun activity for our group. We thoroughly enjoyed the screened porch and outdoor deck each morning and evening. Be sure to spend time on the dock but if a larger party bring an extra chair or blanket. Sunsets are amazing! We will be back!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The family had a great time at the lake house. We had 4 adults and 6 kids. The location of the lake house is great, close to the marina and easy to get into Cordele when we needed to. Will definitely rent again."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely property with beautiful views of the Lake, especially at sundown and we had the chance also to see the light of a full moon reflected on the water. The house is all one level which is attractive for people like us who are avoiding steps. The interior has been remodeled; decorated in up-to-date, sophisticated style. Quality furnishings. Well stocked and outfitted for convenience and comfort. There is a carport and covered walkway that will get you and luggage to the entry without getting rained on. Quiet and private neighborhood yet close to the recreation features of the Park. We liked everything about the house and our stay."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome house; so much space. Two beautiful docks.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is 2nd time I’ve stayed at Robert’s place. It was great and Robert is very responsive and makes the entire process easy.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and peaceful stay at Cabernet Cove! We were in the area for a work trip and Robert’s place was conveniently located near several good restaurants and our work location.

The welcome basket full of goodies was a special touch! We would definitely recommend staying here!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great spot. a real home away from home.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a perfect and quiet location. Beautiful setting and the kitchen was fully stocked. WiFi was a bonus as most places we have stayed have not had such a great connection.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our time at the lake house. Beautiful setting and great place to watch a sunrise over the water. Owners were very responsive. The personal touches that were added (e.g., welcome basket, kayaks and life jackets ready to go, and fishing equipment) made it perfect. Convenient to Georgia Veterans Park and Cordele. We would definitely rent again when we are back the area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,A beautiful setting. Peaceful and quiet. Robert was great at communicating. A great escape from hurricane Ian.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful quiet place to get away and enjoy time with your family. Don't forget to stop up the street and try a Booger burger!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cabernet Cove was a perfect fit for our family lake trip! I love to cook and the kitchen was extremely well stocked. The house was super clean and we loved the goodies left out for us. The dock was a good size for us to all fit while fishing. There’s a small cement ramp that made putting the kayaks in and out super easy too. Loved the seating options as well! The beds were super comfy and the master bathroom was really roomy. Anything I forgot, they had! Q-tips, body wash, seasoning, etc. Thank you again for your quick responses and hospitality, we loved Cabernet Cove! I’ll be using my custom coozie at home to remind me of a great weekend :)"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The most wonderful stay! Robert answered messages dang near immediately so communication was off the charts good. The house was spotless and such an open and beautifully decorated space. They provided board games and cards and a marvelous little welcome basket. My favorite spot was the little deck off the dining area. Perfect morning coffee or bedtime tea spot. The dock was safe and clean. It felt like our own little lake oasis. The kids enjoyed their selves immensely! Definitely will stay here again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, we enjoyed staying for the week. Perfect getaway"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love this spot & have stayed multiple times. Susan is a wonderful hostess!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This Charleston style home on Lake Blackshear is a must visit. From the ample space to the convenient pool to the dock and lake, it's all worth it! My family had an awesome time, it's really better than the pictures can show. The huge screened porch with a swing and plenty of seating while watching the sunset is phenomenal! Should check it out for yourself just hopefully not when I want to return! 😆"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great family get away! Great place!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing! My husband fished off the dock all weekend and caught tons of fish! I could have relaxed on the Ernest Hemingway back porch all weekend! The pool is spectacular! I would give 10 stars if I could! Highly recommend and will be returning!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"This space is magical! Feels like a Tuscan Villa on a quite part of the lake. Sunsets are stunning, spotless home and fully stocked with everything you could need to prepare a meal to enjoy with family and friends on a lovely screened-in poolside porch!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous view ! Beautiful home ! Wonderful getaway !
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our third summer in a row to come here and we absolutely love it. It’s a beautiful house with an amazing pool and view of the lake. We feel like we found a hidden gem the first time we came here and we’ll keep coming back!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Susan was a wonderful host! The house is a gem and met every expectation I had. It’s spacious and we felt right at home. The kitchen has everything we needed. We plan to come back here year after year! Fishing off the dock was also amazing. My husband and son caught several fish while we were there. The pool was perfect and we spent most of the trip with our children in it. Can’t say enough good things about this place! ❤️❤️❤️
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,"A very beautiful home and the pool was an extra. 2 flaws with the pool , the lawn guy slung grass in the pool. There were also thousands of mayflies in the pool and area. We cleaned the pool and dealt with the bugs . Other than that we had a very nice stay ."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The pictures don’t do this beautiful space justice. The decor was inspiring and comforts were luxurious! We loved it and Susan was a great host. Very responsive! Our only suggestions is to bring extra coffee and Tupperware if you plan to cook!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our girl’s weekend at Susan‘s place. Her friendly professionalism, helpful hints, and tips of what to do and super timely responsive nature was incredible."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved staying at Susan's home at Lake Blackshear. The house, furnishings and grounds were spectacular! This house is hands down one of the most beautiful properties we have stayed at. Pictures simply don't do it justice. The pool was beautiful and refreshing and we thoroughly enjoyed relaxing on the screened porch. The house had all the amenities we needed and Susan was a delight to communicate with at check in and check out. We loved this house so much, we decided to extend our stay a couple days. When we are back in the area, we will definitely plan on staying here again."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay in this beautifully sophisticated, well-maintained home with its stunning lake views framed by trees draped with Spanish moss. The wide screened porch on the back of the house was perfect for everything - dining, game-playing, watching the kids splash the pool, or just enjoying the view. When inside, the high ceilinged, light-filled interiors make this house feel more akin to Alys Beech than rural Georgia. The quality of everything was excellent, from the well-curated furniture and lighting to the beautifully designed pool. This home is truly a retreat."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely getaway at this well appointed home on the lake. It felt like home since so much thought had been given to the amenities in every room.
We look forward to returning soon!
Joyce"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything about this place is a ‘10’ - the home, the view, the location. We’d even give the screened porch an ‘11’. The host provides all you need and was very responsive."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is beautiful and the lake and serene setting in the back are picture worthy. The decor and attention to detail is very apparent and made for a wonderful stay. The house is in a community with construction but the noise was not intrusive.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,A beautiful home with everything you need for a relaxing stay! Our family enjoyed a quiet relaxing mini vacation.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous home. Decorated so nice and so cozy! Highly recommend. We enjoyed it so much …had everything we needed! This is our 2nd time back for girls weekend and not the last!

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"This was our second stay at Chez-DuVernet and it was as wonderful as the first. This home is both beautiful and comfortable. The pool and back porch were where we spent most of our time. Our family has agreed this will be our go-to place, hopefully for years to come!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome place to stay. Great communication and my children enjoyed it very much as well!! Highly recommend if you are looking for a house on the Lake!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! This home is stunning. The view is just breathtaking!! My family and I had a wonderful stay! We spent a lot of time fishing from the dock and the kids swam in the pool. I've told everyone back home they must take the trip and stay here!
We can not wait to come back!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"This place was great, can't wait to stay again!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,This place is amazing. We will for sure be back! Girls weekend 2022 was the best yet! We loved the location and would not change a thing! Next time we hope to use the beautiful pool! It was just too cold! So peaceful and beautiful!
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home in the most perfect, quiet setting. The view from the back porch is breathtaking. The pictures provided don’t even come close to capturing the beauty of the home and property. This is by far the best listing I’ve stayed in, and I hope I am able to visit again in the near future."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I had a wonderful stay! Everything was as described, and the pictures don't do the space justice. It was perfect for our little weekend getaway, but would also be a home I would enjoy spending a month. We are hopeful to be able to return soon!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My family has been vacationing in various homes in Georgia for about 20 years. This is the best on. We hope to come back here year after year. The setting is on Lake Blackshear and there is a boathouse that you can fish off. The pool is the perfect size to swim in and has very comfortable lounge chairs with umbrellas. The house is perfect for vacationing with each of the 3 bedrooms having its own bathroom. The decorating is French Chic and besides being beautiful, it is comfortable and thoughtful. The back screen porch overlooks the pool and lake, and birds are plentiful. Next time we're bringing binoculars. The kitchen is well equipped with everything you need."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely perfect place! The location was close to the state park and about 15 minutes from anything else we needed. The home is large, comfortable and lovely. The pool was our favorite place to be!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"As previous reviews have said, the pictures do not do this home justice. It is spectacular! We have stayed in many AirBnB’s and this was our favorite so far. The home and decor are beautiful, the location on the lake can’t be beat, the pool is amazing and the back porch is the best! We did not leave the house the entire time we were there. We can’t wait to return!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The pool was great for my two daughters. The house is great. it was wonderful escape from the heat. we found just enough to do in the area to keep everyone entertained. it was lovely and easy .
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. I really don't know what else to say. We felt like we were transported straight into Southern Living magazine for a getaway. Everything was in top notch shape and our host, Susan, was perfect. We had kayaks delivered and we could enter the lake right off the end of the boathouse. When we weren't on the lake or in the pool, we were playing board games on the screened in porch or inside where the AC was more than enough to handle some hot, midsummer Georgia days. It was a perfect location for a family of four looking to recharge. If you find this property available, don't hesitate to snatch it up!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Susan's house is nothing short of amazing! The large screened porch was great for dinners and relaxation. The pool was clean and refreshing, beds were comfortable. Susan was very responsive to messages. We had a fabulous time and can't wait to book again next year!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the most gorgeous property we have ever rented! Our children couldn't stop talking about it as well as all the adults. The decor was amazing as well as the renovations and the air conditioning worked so well after hot days on the water. We spent a lot of time on the dock and at pool as well. We will definitely book again.
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with a gorgeous view of the lake! We spent a lot of time fishing from the dock and just enjoying the view and sunsets. The screened porch and pool was a favorite hangout too.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Susan's place is straight up an issue of Architectural Digest!! BEAUTIFUL. Hands down the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at! We were all sad to leave, especially the kiddos. Susan's place had everything we needed for our family of four trip to Lake Blackshear. We definitely have Georgia on our mind!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love, love, love this house and the setting. Felt at home even though it was a rental. Home had everything we needed. Lake is beautiful and the dock gazebo is a perfect place to watch the sunset. We spent most of our time reading on the porch, which has privacy shutters so you don’t see the neighbors, and in the pool."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Picture perfect peaceful retreat~ Absolutely gorgeous home with stunning lake views~
Susan is the perfect host~"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The home is more beautiful than in the photos! It is true. The space is wonderful. The decor feels like you are living in a magazine. The beds are very comfortable, the amenities are all there. Susan has excellent communication skills. She responded so quickly and took care of what we needed without hesitation. We stayed a month and we marveled everyday at the beauty of the lake, the sunsets, our fortune to find such a beautiful home. Susan left some items from her own home to make our stay even better, she answered all of our communication with easy answers and made our stay very special. We had everything we could have wanted. You can not go wrong. This is a gem."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a dream! The house is beautiful and the back porch is the best hangout place. The pool is amazing. 5 stars! Would totally go again.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Beautiful home with a gorgeous view of the lake! Can’t wait to stay again!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Susan's place is truly amazing. The house has a unique charm and yet is extremely functional. The location on the lake is outstanding and left us with memories of unbelievable sunsets. It is by far the best AirBnB experience we have ever had. Also, communication with Susan was perfect from A to Z."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is stunning. Large rooms and a beautiful view. Very clean! Loved the screen porch on the back to sit outside. Would love to go back in warmer months. Host is quick to respond and made our trip easier with her suggestions and accommodations.
2019-12-01,5,Group trip,"Amazingly beautiful home. Sparkling clean with comfortable beds and cozy linens. The views of sunset from the porch over the lake are spectacular. Our host,Susan was responsive to our one question we had and our stay was just perfect."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is beautiful!!! We enjoyed our stay! I recommend this location for lake Blackshear! It is much more beautiful in person!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! This house is gorgeous! You feel like you are walking into a home from Atlanta Magazine. It is well appointed and has every need. The beds were comfortable and each bedroom had a TV and bathroom. The back porch is huge and a lovely space. Susan is a great communicator! We would definitely stay here again.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is as advertised. It is beautiful, right on the lake and had everything we needed. We highly recommend this property."
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,"Thanks for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home. The pictures you have online do not capture the true beauty of the home. The home throughout has the feel, beauty and warmth of an HGTV home. When I walked into the house I felt as though I had walked in a home that Chip & Joanne remodeled. The home has modern and had that old southern charm that you would expect in any southern home and the back porch with it's beautiful water view is amazing. When I visit Georgia this is the only place that I want to stay at."
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A Beautiful and stunning home! A total dream experience
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Peaceful getaway spot! Very clean with comfy beds. I will definitely return for a lake adventure!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfect for us. We attended a family reunion and all other options were two pricy for a couple. This worked out perfect. The place was clean and provided linens, coffee, ice cube tray, already filled...bonus. A few chickens came to visit..Great stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The little “river shack” is a great place for people who love the LAID BACK lake life - There’s nothing fancy about it BUT IN MY EYES IT IS PERFECT! It is exactly what Margaret described - There’s space for a family . The shower isn’t built for tall people but we are tall and we managed just fine! The place is efficient - most certainly… and Margaret is a great host!
If you’re allergic to poison Ivy then keep your eyes peeled if you plan on walking around in the yard; the parking area, the walkway and porch are clear of poison vines though. Porch is great- neighbors are laid back and nice. We will most definitely be back to the little “river shack”. Perfect little place if you’re looking for a place to eat, bathe and sleep after a day at the lake- Oh! The beds ARE super comfy- I’ve traveled alot and I’ve booked some of the most high-end houses- I usually have a hard time resting on the first night at a new place- but not at the river shack! 10 stars for it being a peaceful place!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described, great place to stay near the lake on a budget"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it's a single wide. Description of the property is clear. Great spot for the value!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was exactly as described. It was very clean. Location is close to the lake and boat ramps. It is an expensive location for a fishing trip. We would definitely be back.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, I would stay here again, and I thank Margaret so much for her hospitality."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Nice place, would deff stay there again."
2022-12-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"The home was hard to find at night, even with the porch lights on. The flooring felt uneven and like it was caving in under one of the beds. Was unable to utilize kitchen fully as there were roaches."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I just want to say we were looking for a secure place to park our small uhaul car trailer driving from Florida to Ohio, so we wouldn’t have to worry about it at night like we would at a roadside hotel. I was familiar with the area from 25 years ago and found what we were looking for. After we checked in we had a family health crisis develop that we did not plan for and it delayed us about 5 hours from planned arrival. Margaret was very helpful and understanding about our evolving situation and was very flexible under our emergency. It is a fishing camp. It is very reasonably priced and it is clean. The beds were wonderfully comfortable and we enjoyed the very peaceful porch on a Sunday morning. It happened to be foggy the entire time we were there and with the Spanish moss hanging off the trees gave it such a cool atmosphere.
I highly recommend this fishing camp. It is not a high end airbnb so dont come expecting, come expecting a great place to quietly enjoy South Georgia."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was such a lovely home in a quiet neighborhood. Very clean and provided all we needed for our stay. It is also close to restaurants and stores if you need anything. We hope to visit again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You know when you go to a new place and they have terrible beds that affect your sleep? Well it won’t be an issue at this stay! The beds were incredibly comfortable and the cleanliness was a 10/10. I loved that it also came with a washer and a dryer that saved our clothes after attending a wedding nearby. I would absolutely stay again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, very quiet"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice quiet place to stay, loved going out in the morning and sitting on the big covered porch"
2022-09-01,2,Stayed with a pet,I was disappointed. Not expecting luxury but this was very far from it. No microwave or lamps.
2022-09-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Nice little place just for the guys to do some fishing, it had some bugs and only two beds and no satellite or cable tv"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Margaret was very nice and a great host!!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,This is a perfect pit stop for anyone driving to or from Florida back North! A very cute little neighborhood. The bed that we slept in was unfortunately extremely uncomfortable and sinking towards the middle which made it a little difficult to sleep with two people. But it was okay for just one night. Also worth noting if you’re over 6ft you also may have a little trouble showering (the shower head is at around 5’).
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice people and very comfortable relaxing environment
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely little spot!
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Great for a one night or weekend getaway for close access to the lake. Beds were comfy.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this listing is everything and more! location was perfect!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute gateway on the quiet part of Lake Blackshear. We walked around and visited family who live here, we had the best time. Perfect size for a couples retreat and SUPER comfy beds!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place right by the lake and convenient to everything. Place was very clean and great for a short stay. Hosts were easy to communicate with.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at this airbnb for the weekend!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home and very clean. The home was amazing and definetly would love to stay again some day.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed for overnight on a drive up from Florida. The home was exactly as the host described. Communication was quick and helpful. She even sent a walk-through video before we arrived. The neighborhood is so quiet and we loved walking the dog past all the homes on the lake. The home was neat and tidy, tastefully decorated, and the front porch was perfect for my morning coffee. Would definitely stay again the next time we pass through."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just as described. Great location
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay! The place was really cute and perfect for a weekend on the water. There are some soft spots in the floor especially in the back bedroom. I recommend a microwave and a couple extra chairs at the table. The bed in the back bedroom could use a new mattress as the one there caves in the middle so you feel as if you are in a hole. The septic tank seems to need emptied as when you shower the toilet bubbles up and the tub doesn’t drain correctly.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! very quiet and secluded
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The absolute BEST host!! S. Margaret went above and beyond, out of her way to accommodate us!! Their place is perfectly clean and great location right by a beautiful lake!! Definitely Recommend!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place is very clean and nice! We needed a last minute stay and the host was very accommodating. The beds were comfortable and we had a nice rest. It worked out really nice being able to bring our dog. Thanks again for the stay.
2022-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,If your not picky this really is a cute little place beside a beautiful lake.
2022-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Small but cosy! Definitely a hidden gem
2022-01-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Small but cute, with nice vintage touches and good amenities. Check-in was super easy. Would probably have been a lot quieter on a night that wasn't New Year's Eve (sigh)."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So quiet and quaint. We took 2 kids 2 dogs and our boat. Everyone was comfy. We enjoyed the porch and walking the dogs. Must try the Railhouse Tavern it’s SO good!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Simple trailer home, but it was clean and met our needs. We spent most of our time on the covered porch."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute Comfy Getaway!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"An absolutely charming location, quiet clean and comfortable. we stayed only one night and loved the big covered deck. grilled and sat by the fire enjoying the peace. recommend if you are just passing through and want a place for the night or vacationing in the area. excellent!!"
2021-11-01,2,Stayed about a week,This is a small mobile home with a large attached porch.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect here
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My fishing partner an I enjoyed our stay at this little place. Had room for my truck&boat and was only a 10 minute drive to Veterans State Park.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Small, quiet wooded area. Large front deck that was enjoyable. Cute and clean ♥️"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host! Lovely home!
2021-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Great place. Small and hidden. Small little get away. Is smaller than pictures seem. But is a great little stay.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, quiet area, excellent host! Clean and fresh, easy to find, ample parking. Front porch is fabulous too!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was a great house, perfect weekend getaway. Will definitely stay again"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and very quiet neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stop during a road trip, well equipped with the basic stuff you need to spend the night. You are literally in the middle of the nature, enjoyed all the crickets at night!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a quiet quaint space for an overnite stay. But i would return to enjoy that quiet for longer times in the future.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is trailer with new outfitting, air conditioning, fridge, high speed internet etc. The front porch is awesome to hang out on. The location is very quiet and in the middle of nature, but still only a 16 min drive from downtown Cordele. The price for this deal is great. Don't expect large bedrooms in a 3 bedroom trailer of course. We enjoyed our stay & would be happy to come back. The yard would be big enough to park a boat w/ trailer as well. Next public boat ramp is a 3 min drive."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love this place! Beautiful view of the water and beautiful house. We feel at home there. Christina is a fabulous host. She is quick to respond if you have a question and very congenial. Wonderful experience.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,This place was incredible. over and above our expectations! we had 8 people and were very comfortable.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house. Very peaceful. Did not want to leave. Would definitely book again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Very quiet and peaceful!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This probably is our 4-5th house we’ve stayed at on Lake Blackshear and by far this one is the best all around for us. Location , views and layout of house. The house was clean and comfortable. Perfect for two families! This was the first time staying this far south on lake and I think it’s our favorite new spot. I’m booking my next stay in January here . Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and very peaceful.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I arrived earlier than expected and Christina made the arrangements to let me in the home quickly. Thank you
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second year staying at this home for our Church retreat. We love it here and cant wait to come back next year.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place with an amazing view.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and excellent location on the lake! Was not a fan of the extremely small shower that the two larger bedrooms had to share and the fact that it’s jack and Jill lay out so not super private. We all ended up using the kids bathroom off the living room due to the shower being large and the third full bathroom is outside downstairs so not convenient. Did not have internet or dish for the kids to watch/use the entire time which was a bummer for them. Also be aware of wasp! Our daughter was stung the first day followed by two other members of the family. Overall the house is beautiful and we would consider staying again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Family vacation with 5 grandchildren. We all had so much fun boating, tubing, swimming, and fishing. The kids caught a big catfish ! We taught some kiddos how to waterski ! It’s a great area with not too much boat traffic. Lots of room for all our floats, tubes, and skis the outdoor kitchen and bathroom was so convenient. The entire home is beautifully decorated and comfortable. We are already talking about returning next summer. Thank you for sharing your home with us."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This rental was such a treat! Beautiful interiors with water views from every window!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had the BEST time here! Beautiful inside and out! I’ve rented a lot of places and this one was the best of all!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and very peaceful.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoy our stay every time we've visited the area.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay on Lake Blackshear.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Another great stay in Warwick.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay! Thanks for the quick response on the air conditioners!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Beautiful and relaxing.

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,What an amazing stay! The house was stunning and fully stocked with everything you could want!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and prompt coordination prior and during my stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We have stayed at some pretty fabulous Airbnb’s but this one takes home the prize for the best ever! I hesitate to even share how wonderful it was because I do not want to be competing with others for future dates. Christina has lightning fast response time. I stupidly booked another rental only to arrive and find it was not as expected. I fortunately was able to get a full refund and within 15 minutes I was booked with Christina. I’m so glad it worked out. The internet is spotty through no fault of the hosts- it’s just the area the house is in. I recommend doing what we did and just not trying to use our devices to focus entirely on friends and family. Every guest was celebrating our liberation from our devices. The phone reception was just fine. The interiors of this place have inspired me in my own home renovations. I just can’t say enough nice things!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a perfect spot, and a beautiful home! We enjoyed our stay immensely and it has quickly become our favorite place.
Quiet and peaceful if you’re by yourself, but spacious enough for a family gathering.
The host communication was excellent, and we had no issues while we were there."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is exactly as described and more! Location and amentias were great. The host was easy to communicate with and made the whole check in and out easy. Would give this house 10 stars.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This lake house was beautiful and in a prime location!! Our family loved the long weekend on the water!! Host, Christina, was great and very accommodating! She willing to help with any need we had. Downstairs was huge and right on the water with plenty of room for boats to tie up. There is also a full bathroom with shower and a kitchen downstairs so no need to go back and forth when hanging out on the water! Upstairs was really nice and up to date, just remodeled and very very clean! Plenty of room for everyone to sleep and hang out. We really enjoyed our time here and I believe we would buy this house if it ever went on the market! The two recommendations we had after our stay is to add a ladder on the dock to use while swimming and shades/curtains for the upstairs windows at night for privacy."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,The house and location is awesome. No complaints at all.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We just can't say enough good things about this little gem. Waking up on the lake was just amazing. We were down in the area visiting family who was sick and made the reservation very last minute. Larry was not expecting guests and quickly contacted the cleaning crew to come in and get the place in great condition in a matter of hours. Such a wonderful break at the end of the day to come back and have such a peaceful place to relax. The back porch was such a wonderful and unexpected treat!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved the place and enjoyed our stay! Definitely look forward to returning.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ HOST"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All was wonderful. Very cozy and relaxing time. We enjoyed spending time at the GA Veterans park. Going on a train ride at SAM shoreline and exploring the area.
Would book again."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome Host. Wonderful place with amazing views and things to keep u occupied. Definitely would recommend and stay again
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Larry Place was very comfy, and relaxing! Enjoyed coffee on the dock, it was so peaceful watching the fog rise up off the lake and seeing ducks and geese fly in. We enjoyed a fun game of darts on the back porch while we were grilling on the grill! We spent the whole weekend at the house and did not leave to explore the community.
We plan to come back and launch our boat and fish (weather was too cold for me this time)
What a wonder way to celebrate our Anniversary!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place was awesome! Good fishing, good restaurants nearby, and quiet. Nice little place on the water! Highly recommend!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. We were able to check in early which was much appreciated. Cabin was just what we were looking for for a weekend stay. Larry also notified us that we could check out late if we chose. All in all cabin was clean, yard and dock were great! We really enjoyed ourselves. We particularly enjoyed the screened in porch with the television set and dart board."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay. Perfect little place.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Larry's place was amazing. I would definitely stay again!! The house was super duper clean and very well maintained. It was the perfect size for my family. We enjoyed the dock and lake access. The fire pit was a bonus!! The kitchen had everything coffee, sugar, pots, pans, cups, etc. We cooked breakfast and dinner at the house. The 3 bedrooms are nice and cozy. We had 4 adults, 2 children, and a baby like I said it was the perfect size for my family. If Larry's place is available BOOK IT you will be happy you did."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful and peaceful place! Mr. Larry was available 24/7 for any questions we had.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't have been more happy with staying here. Host was great, location was great, house was amazing. We'll be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This lake house was a sweet little gem. Larry also provided plenty of amenities for the family. Our favorite part was the dock with lounge chairs. The house was clean and felt like home.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect for a weekend getaway. The home has comfy beds. Sitting on the dock and watching the scenery was peaceful. So many things to watch on smart tv. Enjoyed playing board games. Everything was perfect. I highly recommend staying here if you are looking to get away.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay. Beautiful lake house. Clean and very cozy. Would definitely stay here again

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little cottage in a charming small lake town! This place is home to me and it was perfect for what my family needed for the holidays. Thank you!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was perfect for our group of three. We had other things going on in the area, so we weren't able to take full advantage, but it was great to end our evenings on the screened porch, and begin our day with a beautiful sunrise. The beds were very comfortable, and the house was very clean. We would recommend, and will rent it again when in the area! We were there for a ride on the SAM Shortline railroad, which was great fun!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This cottage was absolutely relaxing and incredible! My wife and I enjoyed waking up and relaxing on the screened-in porch looking out onto the lake.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Larry's cottage on the Lake was the coziest place ever. Larry was very responsive when the lights went out due to thunderstorm in the area which didn't last long. There was no iron since I stayed there for work but Larry made sure I received an iron which was very accomodating. The cottage was very clean and stylish and comfort at it's finest with everything I needed. I will most definitely return to Larry's cottag on the lake.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay! The house was clean and had everything we needed. Larry was easy to communicate with.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect lake house for a small group or weekend get away! Very clean, fully stocked kitchen, the dock is perfect to sit out on and go for a swim. I definitely recommend. Also great location to local restaurants including Booger Bottom!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We cant say enough great things about Mrs. Lauri's lake house. My family and i were in town for our annual hunting trip and everything about it was perfect. My 2 boys enjoyed the incredible dock and the big yard to throw the football in. The house was absolutely spotless with everything you could possible need. The beds were comfortable and clean. It was extremely convenient to stores and food. Owner was extremely accomadating when our schedule shifted and we needed a later check out time. Wish i could give 10 stars!! We will definitely be back again. You will not be disappointed with beautiful little cottage.

Just bring your toothbrush and enjoy porch sitting overlooking your own private paradise. Owner is very responsive and provides easy instructions for your stay. Will definitely stay again!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I have been staying at Airbnb places for years now. This place was such a treat. With its off the beaten path location it is a perfect spot for a peaceful relaxing resting place. The kitchen was well stocked. We plan to visit here again.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great location, in need of some updates, paint, etc… BUT overall was a great stay! Very clean, great location… We would definitely stay again, and the host was very accommodating, responded right away to any text or needs we had."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Sherry and Trae’s place is a peaceful and relaxing setting with a rustic charm. Kitschy and shabby chic decor had us feeling welcome and at ease. The inside of the cabin was clean and well appointed. We stayed over a long weekend and found it relaxing. One suggestion is to use bug spray- we found it buggy when we were enjoying the outdoors so we recommend snagging the bug spray when you come. The lake view was worth it- you’ll love the tranquility! Thank you for sharing your home with us!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cabin was the perfect spot for a quick romantic getaway.
Definitely will come back.
I have no complaints. Very clean, on the water and the decor was so cute.
Thanks for the experience"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherry and Trae's cabin was the perfect getaway that we needed. It was so peaceful and private. The setting was tranquil. The sunsets were magical. They provided extra touches, such as robes and wine. We highly recommend this secret, hidden gem!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,My boys and I had a great visit here. it was very peaceful and we made some great memories!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"better than pictures! we loved this stay for our honeymoon. everything is comfortable, we had all we needed!"
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Be aware that there is a slanted bank down to the dock. Unsafe dock, nails and screws sticking out of wood, much of the dock is rotting, and it’s leaning and wobbly. The hot tub cover is heavy and falling apart so it was hard to move. The windows and sills were filthy and didn’t have screens. They were disgusting. The grill had food stuck to it when we arrived. Bring your own pillows. Needs Comfortable chairs for outside. A few details and this could be more romantic. It would have been nice to have the windows open with the nice breeze. It was hard to sit in the sun in the wood chairs for any length of time. A beautiful view and overall peaceful. Bathroom and kitchen were clean. Fresh sheets provided."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful time
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great private cabin! Bed was comfortable, place was clean and view was amazing! Perfect place for us to get away for a few days . Thank you for the great stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was exactly what I was looking for!!! Beautiful deck for relaxing with amazing view of the lake. The house was clean and we arrived to a bottle of wine. Great place and weekend with my wife for her birthday
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Most peaceful place we've stayed in a long time. Beautiful surrounding lake. Lovely cabin. We enjoyed the hot tub and relaxing on the dock and by the fire. The sunsets over the water were amazing sights to behold. Very private and quiet area. We will stay there again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was great
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin was situated in a beautiful area on the lake. It was so very quiet! It was the perfect place for getting away and taken in nature. When I had a question, they replied back right away. I loved my stay at the little cabin on the lake! ￼"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was beautiful!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything absolutely fantastic. 100% recommend staying here and can't wait to come back.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I came with our pups last minute because we had a 18 hour drive ahead of us, so we decided to find an Airbnb on the way home to break up the drive. We found Sherrys airbnb and decided to take a 2 day driving break, when we showed up we both immediately took out our cameras and were snapping pictures. It was 5pm and it was golden hour and the lake was breathtaking, we walked inside and just kept saying “omg wow, wow, wow this is gorgeous wow, I’m so happy we are here”. Over and over again, we were both so excited to be there. It’s private, has everything, gorgeous, the hot tub was so nice and great (the cover is heavy, that’s my only complaint). We plan on coming back for another stay, but longer. 2 days wasn’t enough.
Lots of homie touches, she left us a bottle of wine and it was nice to read everything everyone wrote in the guest book about their stay, what they loved and things Sherry did for them. Overall, 5 stars! Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space. Relaxing atmosphere. Very quaint and romantic. Had a wonderful getaway.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was great, very private, clean and had everything we needed. They left a bottle of wine which was great. Charcoal grill which was great for our dinner. Unfortunately, the weather was pretty cold so didn't use all the amenities for the lake but the hot tub made up for that . Was a great stay and will definitely go back.
Phil"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even though the weather was terrible, it was still a relaxing and romantic weekend. Really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a day to relax between job visits and found this cabin to be a perfect spot to do so. I was able to work without distractions in a beautiful setting. The cabin is extremely comfortable. I look forward to another visit!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place! The view is insane and the cabin was cute! Thank you!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place was even nicer than the pictures and the view over the lake was beautiful from inside and outside the cabin. We stayed for Thanksgiving and the neighborhood was super quiet and peaceful.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a relaxing stay! We booked for our 11th anniversary and it was perfect. Bed was comfortable, place was airy and felt very homey. The hot tub was clean and perfectly situated to relax while looking out over the water. We would love to go back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cordele, oh Cordele!
Our stay at Sherry and Trae's lake house was phenomenal! The drive down was gorgeous with the leaves changing and wide open farm land, the check-in process was a no-contact breeze, and the home itself is the perfect size for a couples getaway. A stunning panoramic view of the lake from the kitchen/den area and the sliding windows that let in fresh air and sounds of the lake were incredible, but my absolute favorite luxury amenities would have to be the clawfoot tub and in-deck hot tub. Sherry & Trae also thoughtfully provided nice and thick robes for us use. Although we brought our own, now we could keep them dry and wear them around the bnb to feel extra warm and cozy. We felt safe, and secluded immediately upon walking in and because we mentioned that this was our first anniversary trip, and they were kind enough to leave a bottle of wine for us! 10/10 would visit this bnb again and recommend it to friends!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved it!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This lake cabin is cute, cozy, and peaceful. The location is beautiful and we loved watching the sunsets from the dock, the decks, and even inside the cabin - fabulous views everywhere. Is was great to bring our dog and have use of the water equipment (my first time paddle boarding was so much fun). Finishing each night in the hot tub was relaxing and delightful. Thanks Sherry and Trae for sharing your lovely cabin and your friendly hospitality."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay. Will definitely be on our list of places to stay again. Dock could use some work, it has seen better days. But it’s usable. Quiet peaceful cabin. Clear directions from host to get there and well it was just a great stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet & cozy, beautiful lake views. Would stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was amazing….pictures don’t do it justice. Sherri and Trae thought of everything. The place was so comfy, and decorated adorably. The views of Lake Blackshear were outstanding!!! We will definitely rent this cottage again!!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay it was nice and relaxing on the water had a great time fishing and just kicking back and it was in a quiet neighborhood good times.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second trip to this home. The owners are very friendly and accommodating. The home was clean and inviting and perfectly decorated. We came for the quiet and that is what we got. Beautiful sunsets on the dock. FYI, bring your mosquito/gnat spray. You are in Georgia and the mosquito is the state bird. 🤣"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, romantic stay on the lake."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to enjoy the water! Amazing views from every room. Plus a strong AC to fight the heat. Dog friendly as well. Highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I found this place completely by accident. I wanted something peaceful for my birthday. It turned out to be perfection. My partner and I were blown away at how quiet and beautiful it was. The hottub was an added bonus. The cabin fit so beautifully in the lake area. Great communication from the host. Well done!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful cabin and peaceful spot on the water. The dock made watching the sunset feel like paradise.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"From the start, we experienced great communication with Sherry and Trae. They made sure we had all the information we needed for a smooth arrival and checked in a little afterward to make sure everything was in order. They were welcoming and hospitable and though they were onsite at another residence, they did not impose whatsoever. The cabin is lovely. It is very cozy and though it has a smaller footprint, we never felt crowded with 2 adults and 2 dogs. Each space in the cottage is thoughtfully furnished and arranged. With ease you can watch tv from the living room, kitchen, or bedroom if you like. There is a beautiful view to enjoy through lake facing windows in the living room, kitchen, and the bedroom via french doors that serve as the main entrance. We enjoyed peaceful mornings on the dock drinking coffee. The area is quiet without feeling remote. The kayaks provided are easy to get in/out of via steps into the lake by the boathouse. We had a wonderful stay; highly recommended!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place for relaxation. you'll enjoy your stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The view from inside the cabin is breathtaking! The perfect place to just relax, reconnect, and enjoy nature. Hoping to return soon!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and get away, beautiful views of the water, and smokies bar b Q about 15 minutes away is some of the best BBQ ive had."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just got home and I’m already missing this cabin. ☹️ Such a gem of a find and I’m already planning my next trip back. Thank you so much!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a couples getaway, this is the place. Very cozy cabin feel with a view of the lake every way you look. The secluded hot tub is awesome to! Definitely looking to stay here again soon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly what my boyfriend and I were looking for. The home is so cozy and bright!! Ample space to cook your meals and an AMAZING view of the water inside of the house from every angle. The view from the hot tub is also breathtaking. Plus, plenty of room to stretch your legs around the home. Truly a gem."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location and view of the lake is amazing. We enjoyed fishing off the dock. The kayaks were a plus event hough we didn't use as much as I thought we would. It was very hot outside but AC kept it comfortable inside. Their nephew stopped to meet us and chat with our son. They are both teenagers. We didn't get wood for the fireplace but made stores in the microwave. The barn doors and horse theme was adorable. Very good vacation..
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay at Sherry & Trae’s! Hope to be back soon!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really cool & unique cabin. If you're looking for waterfront + hot tub, this is your place! Faces west so sunsets were awesome, too. We boated in and got to meet Sherri & Trae...very nice folks. Til next time, cheers!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Well, after six wonderful visits here I cannot wait to come back again. Sherry and Trae deserve accolades for being outstanding hosts. The cabin is exactly as described always neat, clean, and very comfortable. Since I am technically challenged, Sherry made every effort to come right over and help me deal with the smart TV. Home sweet home!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We definitely enjoyed our stay at the cabin and all that comes with cabin life. There was plenty to do from fishing, kayaking, hot tub, & bbq’ing. Sherry and Trae were both friendly and accommodating. When one of our fishing rods broke we were able to use one of theirs no questions asked. We had a great time out on the lake and the scenery was beautiful day and night. Thanks both to Sherry and Trae for making our summer cabin experience wonderful!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My 2nd time staying here and I plan on many more!
2023-05-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Cabin is very basic, as in the pictures. The outside lacks basic maintenance and cleaning. Cabin was not well stocked at all and some spots lacked cleaning. It is private-ish and has a good lake view. Not sure how well I trust the dock. The water equipment was available but it is on someone else’s property, or at least that’s what it will feel like when you try to go use it. The beds are comfortable and it is quiet at night. We had nothing to light the grill with and no firewood for the fire pit. It was an ok deal for the price but I would not stay again. The property has a lot of potential but unfortunately zero investment or interest from the owners."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We traveled here for our 10 year anniversary and it was absolutely perfect! Felt like we were staying in a tree fort in the woods. This is a lake cabin so you should expect to get a cabin feel. The hot tub overlooking the lake with lights and a little fire pit can’t be beat. If you need a slow down of pace for a few days this is the place to go.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very Nice layed back good Host. I would recommend to all.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A very comfortable place to unwind . A beautiful view of the lake. The listing was just as pictured. we are frequent fliers to Airbnb I would absolutely book this location again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Sherry & Trae's in April for our weekend honeymoon & it was wonderful!! We are locals & only live about 20 minutes away but we couldn't have picked a better place to stay. It was very clean & decorated nicely & had a very homey feel. It is a very quiet & private piece of property right on the water. Sherry & Trae were wonderful host's & I highly recommend their rental to anyone.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place with a great view.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,this place was great! we got to have a lovely vacation with great fishing and kayaking
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was absolutely gorgeous and peaceful out here. Being able to watch the sunset from the hot tub was amazing. It felt very homey and was overall a great getaway. We can't wait to book again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying at the cabin! Very cozy, well equipped and accurately described."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my birthday weekend with my husband and the rain made it even better. It was so cozy to me. Ready to go back
2023-04-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Great location. Definitely an old cabin with some needed tune ups like kitchen drawers, sliding barn door in bedroom didn’t stay closed. Not really a 3 person place as the queen bed is the only suitable sleeping area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was exactly what we were looking for! Honestly, it exceeded our expectations. It was very quiet and private and a lot bigger than the pictures appeared."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very enjoyable stay, even if the fish didn't bite. We are already looking at dates for next year and a return visit. Several restaurants were accessible by water in a 3-5 minute boat ride."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"father and son fishing trip on lake Blackshear, we had a great time on the lake. easy to dock boat and access to the cabin. would go back again next year for spring break."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the cabin was lovely. The hosts were responsive anytime I had a question. The hot tub was a highlight on the deck looking over the lake. The place was clean. They were pet friendly which was a huge plus. We would definitely recommend staying here for anyone who is looking for a quaint cabin on the lake.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I rented this cabin for my birthday. We arrived on Sunday evening. The place is cozy, clean and very inviting. There was a bottle of wine (not sure how she knew what I liked, but it was perfect)
The view from the deck was amazing…and although there was a chill in the air we got in the hot tub and relaxed. Again with amazing views of the lake.
The bed is extremely comfortable and allowed us to sleep in (which we NEVER do)
I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to unplug and unwind as well as reconnect with your significant other."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying there. It was absolutely beautiful and so peaceful. The place was so clean and so unique. It was a much-needed getaway and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a relaxing, peaceful getaway that is on the lake. It's like a private lake house. We will definitely be back. Thank yall for making our little vacation amazing."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was wonderful. Kind of out in the middle of nowhere, but that's exactly what we were looking for. Very peaceful, very quiet. Cabin was clean, well equipped. We had a great time."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing spot on the lake. Sherry was very quick to respond. The cottage is very nice.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay here! It was a great place to reset and relax. The hot tub was the best part and the views were great too
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly, this was a little diamond in the rough kind of stay. There aren’t many cabins in South Georgia! Sherry and Trae left instructions on how to enter their guesthouse and were very responsive to us not being able to get the heat on! We really loved the personal touches. We were even left a bottle of wine! It was quaint, peaceful, and romantic. We enjoyed the hot tub, sound of the water, and the amazing sunsets. Even though the hosts live next door, it was still private. My husband was so surprised at his little Birthday get away and that’s just what I wanted. We hope to return someday! Thank you so much!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for the short honeymoon our hectic schedules permitted. I accidentally locked us out of the house - don’t even point at the electric door lock, lol - and Sherry came promptly to our rescue! (I’m sorry, Sherry, but that complimentary bottle of wine is partly to blame!)
The cabin was so clean, sweet, and romantic. We had everything we needed, including our choice of coffee (drip or Keurig), and beautiful sunsets while relaxing in the hot tub.
Thank you for authentically representing your cabin on the site and for a wonderful stay! We will definitely be back! 💙"
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place is really all about location, location, location!!!
You are right on the lake with the most beautiful views. It is also very quiet, peaceful and relaxing. We enjoyed our stay but to be completely honest; we were not impressed with the outside of the place. It desperately needs a lot of TLC. Loose boards on the deck as well as some rotting boards. I understand with all the trees you can't keep it leaf free. But it would be nice to just blow the area off before guests' check-in to make sure it is somewhat cleaned up. It is obvious it has been a while since anything has been done to the outside. By the hot tub, while sitting in their chairs, there was a small tree that had actually grown up through the deck. That doesn't happen overnight and just shows how long since anyone has done any upkeep.
As for inside, the living room area does need some updating. The couch and chair are old and very uncomfortable. For the price, I would at the very least expect comfortable furniture."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location the view is incredible, my husband and I loved to stay there even for a short time."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at the cabin on Lake Blackshear, the location was perfect with beautiful views.... We had a few issues due to unusually cold winter weather for the area with freezing temperatures, the owners were very responsive to messages and went above and beyond to fix the issues so we were able to enjoy our stay more comfortably... It warmed up enough for us to enjoy the hot tub one evening, the chimnea made it warm and cozy... We cooked on the grill and really enjoyed the dock area... The fishing was great, my huband caught probably 40 big catfish right off the dock.. It was too cold for us to try out the kayaks they provide, but they did allow us to use the dock and live well at the main house at the bottom of the hill, which helped a lot. Things to do within a 30 minute ride, so great location. Would love to return in warmer weather. Would recommend if you are looking for a getaway at the lake..."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherry And Trae's cabin was very clean and beautiful, love the ceilings and the look of the cabin, the lake was also beautiful, would definitely stay there agin!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay - we visited in December and the weather was absolutely perfect The owners are thoughtful, accommodating, friendly, and very responsive. The cottage is beautifully designed and furnished. A perfect neighborhood for walking pets. We would love to return."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was nothing less than what it was prescribed to be. I really enjoyed my stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very cute romantic getaway
2022-11-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"I really like the location of this cabin. It’s right on the lake at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac.
It has a full kitchen, the bathroom was recently renovated, and the living area is fine for a couple.
This cabin would have received great reviews if it wasn’t for the fact that the exterior has been sadly neglected. All the patio furniture is moldy and mildewed. The cabin has beautiful window boxes and pots for plants. But the plants were all dead and hadn’t been cleaned up.
If the owners cleaned up the outside, I would recommend staying here. However, units current state, it’s not very conducive to spending time outside on the deck."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Charming cottage on a beautiful lake. Peaceful location. Lots of fantastic sunsets and we loved the sun porch in the mornings.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Just an amazing cabin. Perfect views and even better sunsets.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay here and would highly recommend to anyone wanting a quiet getaway on the lake. We had some sunsets over the lake during our stay. everything was very clean and inviting.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cute and cozy little cabin was just what we needed. The location on the lake is perfect to catch beautiful sunsets.
The bed was super comfortable, it was clean, the hot tub was fabulous and perfect for star gazing.
Pup friendly had us sold. We enjoyed using the kayaks on the lake as well as drinking some complimentary wine while building one of their puzzles.
The location is pretty remote, which we didn’t mind, but do suggest you buy groceries prior to arriving. The local store is quite expensive due to the rural area.
We took a day trip (about 1hr 15 min away) to Providence Canyon and highly recommend.
The door to get in and out is kind of hard to get to lock so just be mindful when leaving that it’s truly locked. Honestly you likely have nothing to worry about as it seems like a very safe area but just FYI.
The dock was a little run down so be sure to wear shoes and there may be quite a bit of bugs but the sunsets were unbeatable.
Overall we highly recommend staying at this cute little cabin. ☺️"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place on the water! Sherry and Trae were very kind and accommodating! Highly recommend

2022-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Cute and cozy cabin. If you like to fish, kayak and just take in the outdoors/lake view, this a must. Could have stayed longer than a weekend if I didn’t have to get back to work."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"So relaxing, so comfortable, so clean and our hosts Sherry and Trae are the best. Still feels like coming home so we will see you soon ❤️"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I booked this place literally last minute (hours before) and Sherry was sooo accommodating and kind. This place was the perfect getaway and exactly what we needed for a quick reset. The photos are accurate and the location is literally in the middle of nowhere lol. Kayaks were an awesome touch and the weather was perfect for it when we went. I would definitely recommend this stay. I’d love to come back in the colder months and enjoy a cool, breezy night by the fire pit. You won’t regret the choice!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Cool place with an amazing view.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, comfortable cabin on a peninsula with a lovely view. My husband and I loved our stay in this quaint little place on the water. Everything you need is provided. We enjoyed getting out on the water and exploring with the kayaks. We had a very quiet and sweet stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin was the perfect place for a mental health break. We spent the day outside on the lake or hiking, and when the thunderstorms rolled in at night we curled up on the couch to watch the lightning. Our dog, Rocky, also had a great time being a lake dog."
2022-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Photos need to be updated
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful spot! We had such a beautiful weekend getaway, were able to kayak around the lake, and spend our evenings under the stars in the hot tub. There were so many nice touches like the bottle of wine. We are already planning to return!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thank y’all very much for a much needed little getaway….may try to come in the colder months and try out that hot tub. Very sweet little setup y’all have there. We think we may have left a computer charger in the living room area…if y’all see it, would it be possible to send it to us?"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is exactly what is presented! Absolutely beautiful views and the layers of decking and two sets of steps give great access and provide resting spots galore! Shade, sun and everything in between. We had great fun watching the birds, geese and the hawk that made twice daily trips across the lake with catches of fish. The docks gave us many options of sitting, sipping, casting and watching. Will definitely book again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This cabin was perfect for our stay at Lake Blackshear. We enjoyed the lake view and fishing off of the dock. The cabin was clean and had all of the necessities to make the stay enjoyable. We caught plenty of bream and catfish off of the dock. My kids loved using the kayaks. The owners are very nice and communicate well. We plan to come back and stay again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great birthday get away for my boyfriend and dog. Had everything we needed to cook meals and use the area! Would definitely recommend !
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Once again we enjoyed our stay at the perfect location. Sherry and Trae are the best hosts you could ask for. Can’t wait to go back again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay at this cute cabin on the lake!!! It was very clean and we loved the decor. My husband and I had a great little getaway; our dogs enjoyed watching the squirrels out of the windows and swimming around in the lake. The kayaks and paddle board were a lot of fun. The sunsets from the dock were absolutely gorgeous (make sure you wear shoes down there, got a bad splinter!) Would recommend bringing bug spray but other than that we had everything we needed to cook and everything supplied at the cabin.
I would 100% recommend taking a little getaway here, we will likely be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is clean and equipped with everything you need. It has an excellent view of the river and beautiful sunsets. I would highly recommend.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The views and sunsets were beautiful. The cabin was clean, cute, and comfortable. It was a very relaxing stay."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved everything about this beautiful cottage! Super clean with a lot of nice touches. Wouldn't change a thing!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this place for an unplugged and relaxing get away from the city. The view was absolutely amazing and better than the pictures. Besides the view, the amenities helped to sell this place for me. We enjoyed having the ability to be active if we wanted and explore. Kayaking during the day, grilling dinner and bonfires at night by the jacuzzi. The surprise was all the bird watching we were about to do in the mornings. We appreciated the personal touches inside the cabin as well. A bottle of wine was left for us and the kitchen was well stocked with stuff to help us cook with. Everything about this place was very welcoming and cozy."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place! The view is perfect.. the cabin is so cozy and has everything you could need…
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"expect to have a nice time. Fishing off dock was very relaxing. nice view of the lake. I hope you enjoy your stay, we did.."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views in a quiet, natural setting that was relaxing - perfect for a little get away.
The hosts were super easy to communicate with and the directions to get to the cabin were easy to follow. Everything was just as described: a nice, quaint cabin on Lake Blackshear with awesome views and decorations.
The wife and I enjoyed the hot tub, fishing and the peacefulness.
Thank you Sherry and Trae for allowing us to stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cannot say enough great things about this place! Well-stocked kitchen, we just brought Tupperware for leftovers. The lake was wonderful, the house is situated on a peninsula and being on the windward side was great for blowing any bugs away in the afternoon, would still bring some spray for nighttime sits outside though"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really great spot! We had a wonderful time and look forward to coming back again!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful and beautiful place to stay, with great views of the lake from anywhere inside the house. Really has everything you could want in a lake rental!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so awesome! What a beautiful location! Just can’t say enough about the location and the views. And the cabin is just perfect for what we wanted, so cozy and comfortable and had everything we needed for our getaway. It was so quiet and peaceful except for when the construction crews were next-door working on the big house. And even they weren’t very loud just a saw every once in a while. So I’m sure when that’s done it will be even more peaceful. We would LOVE to come back! We actually love this area so much we were looking at property listings before we left. The lake is gorgeous and the people are very nice."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful peaceful setting. Loved drinking my coffee on the porch in the morning listening to the birds. We had everything we needed and then some. Owners are very responsive and have many thoughtful touches. If you are looking for a peaceful getaway, you will not be disappointed. Pet friendly is a big plus 🐾"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for being a great host! The cabin is exceptionally clean with lots of cute decorations. Kitchen and bathroom are equipped with all the essentials we needed for a good vacation. The space outside is great, the view, the hot tub also.
We are truly recommending this cabin."
2022-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Great view and quiet retreat!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing experience!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome cabin and location.Couldn't ask for anything more for a romantic getaway, the perfect place.So enjoyed our time there and can't wait to get back soon."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a gorgeous atmosphere at this quaint cabin at the lake!! Watching the sunsets from the hot tub is unbeatable! We had so much fun with the kayaks and paddle board, and were welcomed to dock our boat securely at the owners boathouse. Communication with the owners was fast and pleasant. The cabin was well-stocked with coffee, seasonings, and toiletries. The bottle of wine was nice as well! We’d recommend packing several extra sets of clothes since there is not a washer or dryer, and some paper plates and plasticware since there’s not a dishwasher. If you’re looking for a small, quaint place to stay a few days - with excellent views- this is your place!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful cabin stay we had!!! Pictures don’t do the place and view justice. It was everything we needed and more!
A perfect little getaway! :)
We also highly recommend the Providence Canyon state park too! Truly a magnificent and breathtaking experience"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back. Cute little house, very clean, great view. Thanks for the bottle of wine!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the ideal place to stay and get away from the busyness of life. We were able to relax and unplug and feel refreshed to get back to real life. Thank you for sharing your place. It was perfect!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cabin was organized and clean. The view was great and it was a very relaxing stay.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great little cabin on an amazing property. The lake views are beautiful, the hot tub, the living room, and the socks are all in the perfect location to watch the sun set. We will definitely be keeping this piece in mind whenever we need some rest and relaxation!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was absolutely amazing nice spot for couples for vacation’s anniversary’s or just a weekend getaway,"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing location! We enjoyed breakfast on the deck overlooking the water and watching the boats pass by. We arrived late and after dark, but Sherry and Trae provided excellent instructions and we found the place very easily. There's several low key attractions near by that we really enjoyed such as the Veteran's Park, downtown Americus and local restaurants. This is a great place to recharge your batteries! Thank you for sharing your place with us Sherry and Trae!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Place, Great Hosts"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful spacious cabin set in a quiet residential area on the lake. The hosts have provided a homely feel without being cluttered. We appreciated the amazing views from everywhere, the hot tub and the private fock for fishing. The kitchen is well stocked if, like us, you prefer to cook. The Kuerig was a blessing for us!
The cabin is in a residential area, very close to the hosts property. This in no was was a problem for us but of you want that middle of nowhere feel this is not the place for you. The only downside we had was a lack of curtains, so when the dun comes up the cabin gets really bright quickly.
We would highly recommend this place, it was a truly relaxing weekend away for us."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was amazing
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time in this cozy lake house cabin. The living area with its wraparound windows was the best place to just unwind, read, journal, and chat. It has great views right over the water and got great afternoon sun for the cold winter stay.
The hot tub was also heavenly! Especially the second night when we moved the chimnea by it and had a fire for the cold night. The first night we took the cover off before it warmed up but learned our lesson the second night to let it warm up before taking the cover off.
I was also pleasantly surprised by the full kitchen which isn’t pictured in the listing.
Also, the view of the open whitewashed rafters when laying down in bed is a real treat! We felt like we were in a boathouse.
Such a luxurious and relaxing girls’ weekend! Hope to come back again soon!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just spent five cozy days in this darling cottage. The lake view was beautiful every day even though the weather outside was cold. Already planning our next visit back here. Can’t wait to see Sherry and Trae again soon
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin exceeded our expectations. It is spacious with plenty of windows and light, not to mention phenomenal views. The lovely hosts had the lights on and hot tub ready for our arrival. We enjoyed paddleboarding and relaxing. Would love to visit again!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place and I really enjoyed my stay. I enjoyed the cabin, access to the water, and of course, the hot tub. Thank you Sherry and Trae for your hospitality."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was more than I imagined it would be. Everything was perfect even in the middle of a storm, I’ll definitely be staying here again when I visit the area."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome lake !!!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is seriously a little slice of heaven. The location is gorgeous, right on the water, and easily accessible. Sherry and Trae have outdone themselves on these properties, there are so many cute little details and things to make your stay feel like home. After 3 days, it truly did feel like home and it was so hard to leave! The perfect getaway!! Very private. The hot tub is amazing."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is absolutely perfect. It has a great view overlooking the lake. The hot tub was perfect. The cabin had little extras for you incase you forgot to bring things you needed. We fished off the dock and around the property, caught all kinds of fish. definitely a gem. Will be back."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolute gem! The cabin is beautifully decorated and we went without nothing! The hot tub was hot and ready when we arrived! It was easy to find and surprisingly close to restaurants and town while still feeling very secluded and romantic!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was the most amazing place! The views are spectacular and the host were amazing! We hope to visit again one day!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is incredible! If you are looking for a quiet and peaceful getaway with a wonderful view, this is the place for you. And the hot tub is just an added bonus! Highly Recommended."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had three relaxing, perfect days at Sherry & Trae’s cabin. It’s almost a Nordic cabin in its simplicity (my favorite type). The cabin’s placement on a small peninsular gives you lovely views from each of its windows. We were in the hot tub a couple times a day - it really is a little slice of heaven. We are so grateful to have stayed here and are leaving much refreshed!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful hidden away escape! Loved this for a little vacation honeymoon, even in 30 degrees it was truly amaIng."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My parents had a lovely time at the Cabin! It was clean and decorated nicely. A great place for a couple to enjoy a lakeside retreat. Check in was simple. The outdoor space is great with a beautiful view of the lake. It did not affect my parents, but I will add that the outside has a bit a decline in order to access the dock so proceed with care. When we visited my parents, our kids had fun sliding down the small hill. Lol! And the bonfire near the water is a nice touch. All in all a very nice experience for my parents. Would rent again no doubt."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an awesome spot to get away! Amazing view and romantic feels. Only problem we had was that the hot water in the shower lasted for like 2 minutes. Highlight was definitely the breath taking view while sitting in the hot tub. We definitely will be coming back. 😁
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,I loved this little cabin so much. And it looks more amazing in person. I appreciated the complimentary bottle of wine and bottles of water. Thank you again. Georgia is beautiful :)
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cabin with a great view of the lake
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The other reviews were exactly right. The panoramic view was my favorite part.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I booked this beautiful cabin for a 3 day getaway. It was just what we needed. It was very cozy and relaxing, especially waking up to the sun coming over the tree line onto the lake.
We would recommend bringing breakfast foods, as you can use the fully equip kitchen at the cabin for a nice breakfast.
There are a few restaurants in the area, about 20 mins to get to, if you want to explore the area. We also highly recommend 'Rail House Tavern,' which is in downtown cordele for food and drinks."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was perfect. Everything was clean and it was so quiet. The views were amazing and it was so easy to relax.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this location. Great place to unwind and relax. Amazing sunsets from the dock!
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We very much enjoyed our stay in the cabin on the lake.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely amazing. Such a cute little cabin, every detail is so well thought out. The view is amazing, especially the stars you can see at night out on the dock. Definitely recommend looking at the stars if you stay here! My dog also had a blast, she loved swimming in the lake!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy space. Beautiful lake. Loved sitting on the dock in the morning watching the birds and the water and chatting with the fishermen.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was even more beautiful in person. Really enjoyed the lake, the scenery, and the Hot Tub was perfect for a cool fall night. The host was awesome and very great at communicating. Will definitely add this to my favorites list."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend the view & cabin we’re excellent.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our stay in Sherry and Trae’s cabin. It is so peaceful and beautifully decorated, positioned right on the water. We spent all day relaxing by the lake and using the kayaks and paddle board, and then would go in the jacuzzi at night. While they do live on the property, they were not home while we visited and are spaced out enough to give you privacy. Would definitely recommend for your next getaway!!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Just spent a very relaxing two weeks sitting on the deck enjoying the view, peace and quiet and watching the squirrels play"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherry and Trae were excellent hosts. They were very friendly and responsive. The cabin was wonderful and exactly what we were looking for, which was to get away and disconnect from our electronic lives to spend some quality time together. Everything in the cabin was well thought out to accommodate guest needs. We highly recommend and will be back ourselves!"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, clean cabin with lovely updates and cute lake-inspired decor. Lots of attention to detail with plentiful essentials, such as sun screen, bug spray, shampoo, conditioner and herbs and spices in the kitchen, which was well-appointed. The lake is gorgeous with beautiful views from every room. Very private, dark and quiet at night, so we slept very well. We took some lovely rides to area attractions, and had our best meal out at Daphne's Lodge, which is just ten minutes away."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location on the lake and above average hosts! We had wifi issues and they solved the problem even though it was after 10pm. We can’t wait to stay here again soon!!!
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, cozy place that was I able to book super last minute! Kayaks were great, and the town was pretty close for necessities, but mostly we just hung around and definitely utilized the hot tub to truly relax out there! Probably just a seasonal thing, but I should note that the gnats were insane; we could barely sit outside in the day time. On the last day, the AC actually went out as well, but we just ended up checking out early since our stuff was all packed. The host was super quick to respond and get it fixed though, even let me know what went wrong and apologized. Thanks so much for the stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is perfect for a weekend get away. The only thing I didn't like is that the weekend went too fast. The cabin is cozy with spectacular views across the lake.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best airbnbs I've stayed at! It was so well designed and quaint. My boyfriend and I loved our stay for our one year anniversary. The hot tub and the kayaks were so fun to use. Sherry was very accommodating and gave great recommendations for local grocery stores and restaurants. Overall, our stay was amazing and we plan on booking it again soon!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, 100% would recommend to anyone"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you are looking for the perfect getaway this is the place!! Sherry and Trae’s place was so cute and cozy and it was so relaxing to wake up and see the lake every morning. We loved the town and it’s only 1.5 hours to Providence Canton which is worth the day trip!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I spent the weekend here for our Anniversary. It was better than I ever expected. It was so cute inside. The views are so pretty and relaxing. We loved sitting on the porch with our morning coffee. The trees kept it a comfortable temperature outside. I definitely plan on coming back here again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have a great experience here. Everything is exactly as described. Very comfortable and cozy
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely amazing stay here for our 5th anniversary! If you’re looking for a private, clean, cozy, couples getaway you will 100% be happy here. Sherry was very nice and responsive. We definitely want to come back!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for an amazing trip. We enjoyed the kayaks and saw a beautiful sunset from the private dock! The views from the living room area are outstanding. I can’t wait to visit again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This waterfront cabin has incredible views. We felt immediately relaxed the second we arrived. We enjoyed kayaking, paddle boarding, fishing, swimming in the lake, and exploring Cordele."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect cabin for our little family. We came last year just my wife and I. This year we returned with our brand new-sweet baby boy and had a great stay! Our favorite cabin on Lake Blackshear. Great hosts!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect space for a couple’s getaway. Everything you need and a few extras like seasonings and coffee. The outside space is just as enjoyable as the interior. The main house is only a few yards from the rental space so if you prefer privacy, take note. The occupants of the main house were away during our stay so it wasn’t an issue but I think the proximity between the two is worth mentioning. We did not use the hot tub but it was clean and warm. The bbq grill and fire pit were nice editions but unfortunately the firewood is kept outside and it had rained before our arrival and was therefore wet. The back deck and the dock at sunset were worth the stay alone! The cabin was a lovely experience overlooking the lake! Would definitely stay again!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything is just as described if not better!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little Gem was exactly what My wife and myself needed! Perfect little lake cabin, very relaxing and private! And good little golf course up the road!! Thanks again"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Probably the best experience my partner and I could ask for. We will 100% be back again but this time for longer. Really a miniature paradise. If you love someone, bring them here!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t wait to return. I fell in love once I opens up the door. So much thought went into decorating. Our fur babies enjoyed them selves also. We had everything we needed and everything was clean and cozy. We had trouble with the WiFi staying connected, but that wasn’t anyone’s fault. We love the large TV! Hot tub was AMAZING!! Love the lake (we come all the time), but my favorite was the hot tub. Hope to meet Trae & Sherry on our next visit. Thanks for opening up your home to us! See y’all soon 😉"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is a beautiful get away located on a small hill with a stunning view of Lake Blackshear. The town is only a 15 minute drive for restaurants, Walmart, etc. If you are looking for a romantic, relaxing trip - this is the place for you."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a fabulous lake cabin. Beautifully and whimsically decorated. Everything you need to stay awhile and a breathtaking view from every window. The hot tub is really nice even if you decide not to heat it. A very relaxing and easy place. I highly recommend!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly a gem in a great location. You can sit inside, on the porch or on the dock and have a great view from any of them. We loved all the plants inside and outside. It made it feel super homey. The cabin was very clean and the check-in was super easy. We loved having use of the kayaks and paddle board as well as the hot tub. It's so hard to find a place that allows dogs, so we were very happy the cabin was available. A great place to relax and we hope to go back soon!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully located on Lake Blackshear, with stunning views across the water. Don't miss the sunsets! Clean and comfortable with a well stocked kitchen. Great communication before and after our stay with the hosts. Well recommended. Sue & David"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an adorable cabin on the lake! We thoroughlyenjoyed ourselves and we didn’teven have time to take advantage of the kayaks. We slept well on the comfortable bed and enjoyeall of the amenities.We hope to go again.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home on Lake Blackshear is so cute and peaceful. Beautiful sunsets on the deck grilling and relaxing in the hot tub. The host was so nice and accommodating.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing. Loved our time there.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is just as all the other reviews suggest- perfect. My husband and I had a restful anniversary trip. All the other reviews are 100% true!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sherry and Trae's cabin is absolutely amazing! The views are gorgeous and everything about our stay was perfect. By far the best airbnb I've visited. This is a must book for anyone looking to escape life for awhile.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the perfect stay. The one small issue we had was resolved quickly with clear communication from the hosts. It was everything advertised for the perfect romantic weekend. The hosts really went above and beyond. We would love to come back!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was amazing! We did not want for a thing. Sherry and Trae were the most wonderful hosts. The bed was heaven, we slept like babies The kayaks and paddle boards they offer are so nice. We used the kayaks daily. We had fresh caught fish from the lake our first night. Sherry and Trae invited us to their farm and we were able to meet all their furbabies! We can't get back soon enough! Tammy Hembree and Bob Hornfeck"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is high on a bluff overlooking Lake Blackshear. It is a higher spot than the surrounding properties, so it has a view for miles. It is very shady, so cool enough to sit out and enjoy the view no matter the season."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"PLEASE UNDERSTAND... All the reviews are absolutely positively correct and accurate... THIS PLACE ROCKS!!!!!!! It is totally UNDER advertised. I have no shame admitting that upon entering the space, I literally clapped my hands and shed a couple of tears of joy.
It was better than the photos and the description. There are plenty of stores and eateries near by, like 15 minutes away. Stores and eateries that you actually know and recognize. There's plenty of to do on or off the lake. The getting there was an equally beautiful adventure.
I do desire to go back myself AND strongly recommend this property to anyone vaguely interested an absolutely beautiful, luxurious, peaceful vacay."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,All around a great place to stay....
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy cabin. Sherry and Trae were very responsive and friendly.

-Close to the water.
-Relaxing hot tub to enjoy at night
-Very quiet and relaxing.
-Great hosts!"
2024-01-01,4,Group trip,It was nice
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home right on the lake exactly as advertised super clean and just all around a wonderful place to stay
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We needed a place to stay for a family reunion and it was perfect. The view out to the lake was everyone’s favorite. We all wished we had more time to sit on the porch and soak up the view. There was plenty of space of all 9 of us to spread out and not feel on top of each other. The house was clean and had everything we needed for the weekend.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Thank you for allowing our employees to stay there.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay and will be back again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Spent the week with family and had the best time!! The house is comfortable and the dock was great for hanging out and swimming! Everything you need for cooking inside and outside with grill and black stone. Would definitely recommend! The dock has a small fridge! Pool table in the house! Local restaurants just down the road. Go and enjoy!!!!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, fun and clean. Big back yard and nice private dock to tie boat off to."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a really nice stay at ""Paradise on Lake Blackshear."" We had to travel there for a funeral, but the beauty of the Lake was helpful for all of us. After a long drive from Western NC, it was very relaxing. A few of us even swam in the Lake.
The house was exactly as described, and the 4 bedrooms were great to have. Our baby even had his own little room in the bunk area. There is a lot of comfortable sitting area inside, and of course outside was fabulous as well.
If we ever have a reason to head down to South Georgia again, we would definitely stay here again. Thank you!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for a peaceful get away. The kitchen offers a good variety of cooking and baking supplies, the sun room has a beautiful view of the lake and the host is extremely responsive."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful property and very peaceful. Susan was great to work with.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Susan was an absolute life saver!! They have am absolutely gorgeous property and very cute animals! This is a great escape for a romantic night away. Loved sitting and drinking coffee outside and watching the sunset. Perfection!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Aussie Acres was so beautiful! My kids loved all the animals. We were only there one night but we had a blast! We went fishing for about 30 minutes at sunset and we all caught fish! My youngest caught 4 fish! It was so fun! We can’t wait to go back and stay for longer than one night!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Susan's place was absolutely amazing. My 4 year old Daughter was in heaven with all the animals around for her to check out. Super peaceful and relaxing environment. The Sunset from the backyard was stunning. Definitely will be making a trip back.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Susan and Barry are great host! We planned a last minute trip to their property for a quick relaxing get away. They accommodated everything we needed from the hospitality to the necessities for a get away. My favorite part was a baby longhorn was born the day we stayed and Susan introduced us to all of the animals and told us a little bit of their history. We went fishing by the pond and caught 3 bass and laid out in the swing. 10/10 recommend this place for a quick cute farm stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Susan and Barry were amazing! Their property, animals, and the views were breathtaking. Next time we are traveling I’d def try and make a stop there. It was just a few min off the interstate and Walmart delivers to the location if need be. They were the best hosts! 10/10"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful time and hope to make a trip back in the future!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This has been one of our favorite places to stay! We booked it as a quick stop on our way back home & wish we could have stayed longer! Susan & Barry were excellent hosts-so friendly & kind. Since we were getting in a little late, Susan asked if she can make the extra beds for the kids. Very thoughtful & that same thoughtful shows in this property. The place itself is super clean & stocked with all you need. The views are amazing to wake up to, such a beautiful & peaceful place. (& only 10 mins off I75). Our kids went out in the morning as Susan & Barry were tending their animals & they let them join right in! To say they were excited would be an under statement-they were begging to stay longer & have more of their questions answered about the animals. We spent a great morning watching the animals & learning about farm life. It was quite the experience and we hope to be back next year! Thanks so much for everything Susan and Barry-it was so nice to meet you! God bless!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my very first solo trip! I enjoyed my stay and I miss it everyday. I wish I had more time to explore the ranch more but it was a very peaceful trip and I enjoyed every part of it. I will definitely recommend this place as the perfect get away if you have a busy life.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We rented a house on Airbnb from this lovely family couple, and we couldn't be more pleased with our stay. They genuinely care about their farm, and it shows in every detail. They have wonderful animals and breathtaking nature that simply takes your breath away. It was especially nice to find a postcard and little hearts left on the table for us upon arrival - it was a truly heartwarming touch. The atmosphere of this place is simply magical, and we felt like we were in a fairy tale. We definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for coziness and peace surrounded by nature. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay in Susan's house. I appreciate the lake and the animals.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful Place with all the animals roaming. Looks brand new inside would definitely recommend staying there.🙂

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved staying here. it was fun to see all the animals and walk around the property!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a place to disconnect from your daily routine and relax this is it. You wake up to a beautiful view in the morning with the animals, and farm work and the sunset also hits the spot beautifully. Loved waking around the lake, fishing for the first time with the kiddos, the paddle boat, it’s just relaxing! Susan and Barry were so friendly and kind, gave us a tour around the property and the kiddos loved them! This was an amazing find! The house was also so neat and organized, very kid friendly."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another outstanding Airbnb where I only wished I could stay longer! The location is a particular standout, in beautiful countryside with acreage, lake stocked with fish, birdsong, starry nights and the friendliest cows (and dogs and goats) I ever met! The cottage itself is SPACIOUS, nicely decorated, spotlessly clean and well stocked for comfort. The big kitchen with seating and views to the pasture is lovely, as is the living room for cuddling up on the couch with a book. I also appreciated the adjustable climate zones, and Susan and Barry's fast help when I couldn't figure out how to set the temps! I look forward to the opportunity to return."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Susan was so very accommodating during our stay, we had to extend a night waiting for our moving truck to arrive and we were made to feel very welcome! A beautiful property with picturesque south Ga views, and a beautiful pond our boys enjoyed very much! Thanks for everything!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a unique Airbnb to stop at overnight while driving through! We brought our baby and Australian Shepherd and both loved the animals and surroundings. Susan was super helpful and responsive and her place was spotless! We’ll definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay. Susan was very responsive and helpful. Enjoyed our stay and will be back in the future.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Susan was the most gracious host. Her response time to my inquiries was within a few minutes. The accommodations were wonderful and being greeted in the morning by friendly cows and a horse and mule, and goats was so fun! I would definitely want to explore their beautiful property more than we did. Thank you, Susan!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really nice place , parking , clean linens .
Everything was perfect"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Susan was hands down the most accommodating host that I’ve ever encountered. I was beyond grateful for the flexibility of her check in/check out process and clear line of communication. The property was beautiful and the living space was remarkably clean and welcoming.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Susan’s home was perfect! It was clean, well furnished and had everything we needed! You could tell that lots of care was put into making this a lovely place to stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a BEAUTIFUL home for a get-away! We were traveling and needed a one night stay. Just a short drive off I-75. The beds were super comfortable. You will be surrounded by nature and feel very secluded. We wish we could have stayed longer to just relax. Kyle is a great host!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you want peace and quiet, this place is for you! Awesome host, clean and spacious."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Silva has a five star place to get away and for us it was the prime location and was comfortable for all of us 6 that stayed. she was very responsive and easy to get along with. thanks again for the nice place. 5 stars all day..
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a great stay ! Very clean and comfy
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Welcoming, cozy, yet spacious enough for a family of six to sleep comfortably. We felt very safe and it was so quiet, perfect after a long day of driving. Sylvia was very accommodating, quick to reply and very helpful. The lights were turned on for us at the house, as she knew we would be arriving after dark, which was very nice. The house itself was SO charming, had super comfy beds, and very clean. So many little touches that made you feel right at home. I would highly recommend. Very reasonable, which was a great final touch! I look forward to staying again in the future."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic host! Very responsive.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful and totally private property. No nieghbors nearby and an absolutely beautiful view of the sunset, sunrise, and night sky. Clean and well-stocked for our short stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"cute house, we had everything we needed. My family has stayed here twice."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a wonderful place to stay! Beautiful inside! Extremely Clean!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"these people are super kind and compassionate. it's obvious that they take pride in this venture. although the home is older, it's definitely the cleanest older home I've ever been in. places spotless. I'm a maid and it passes the white glove test :))). we did not use the master bedroom as we had a sick dog so we slept in the guest room in the Twin and the queen air mattresses. us being older, the air mattress wasn't very comfortable. it would be fine for a child or younger person. the twin was super comfortable but the frame did make noise when you roll over. there is a train that goes by occasionally. we always travel with a white noise machine so it was no problem. will definitely book again on the next trip from Florida. Also, looks like a tiny house in the backyard that appeared to be occupied. not sure if it was the owners or another rental. Thank you Dennys:)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The Denny’s are great hosts. The house has everything you need for an overnight stay. Trains do announce their presence throughout the night if you are a light sleeper.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was great place to stay close to restaurants and everything you could need. The host was nice and very responsive.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stopped at Dennys's place to break up our trip from Florida to North Carolina. We always travel with our pups so finding a place that welcomes dogs can sometimes be a challenge so discovering Dennys's place was great! It was so convenient, quick and easy from 75. Everything we could possibly need was there! The coffee bar was so appreciated! And the beds were comfortable. Dennys's is the perfect host. I will look to stay here again on my next trip."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The hosts were friendly and communicated well. So helpful when we discovered that we left something behind!
Home was so clean and perfect for our overnight stay on our way to FL."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wish we could have stayed longer. Place was very nice & well taken care of. Would highly recommend this place!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Easy location quick access back to 75. Neighbor's dog barking during night was an issue as it got our dogs going, but this is not something they can control. Just stating for awareness."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,fantastic host!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, clean, spacious stay! Fantastic deal and great hosts!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, exactly what we needed as a pit stop on our way to Florida. Also got to meet the neighbor who was super kind as well. Would highly recommend to anyone."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is a gem !! We only stayed for one night but this place is set up for a nice long vacation Denny was super friendly and is right there if you need anything
The house was super clean and had everything you need
Bring a host myself I can highly recommended the place."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was stocked and ready for our stay. Can’t ask for anything more. Thank you for everything!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay on our way down to Florida and conveniently located right of Rt75 . Denny was very responsive and a good communicator. He provides an great place to stay overnight. It was clean and well stocked. We felt right at home. I would highly recommend staying here to anyone traveling through the area. Well worth the stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay and well kept house! So many amenities thank you!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Totally happy with Dennys hospitality.
We were visiting Providence Canyon Park for the first time since Florida and we were taking our little dog, we needed a good rest in our long ride,then one more person was added to the group who was kindly placed on a mattress by Dennys, which was very appreciated.
The house is very well equipped and warm in a nice Cordeles neighborhood, close to one of the main routes, so it is easy to choose a good place to have dinner. very satisfied with the choice."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was more than I expected. The decor was amazing! What a hidden gem in Cordele, GA. I visit Cordele several times a year and I will definitely book this location again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was such a hidden gem. The neighborhood was so calm and peaceful you would never know you are 5 minutes from the interstate. The house was beautiful with so much old character. My husband and I along with our 2 dogs and 1 cat found this place to feel safe and welcoming for our night of rest. I am not someone who uses Airbnb on a regular basis and am still skeptical most times when booking. This place far exceeded every expectation. We will definitely book here when traveling in the future. The accommodations inside were so thoughtful down to a fully stocked coffee bar, soaps in the bathroom, towels, WiFi, local tv, dog bowls, and a purified water spout. I could go on and on about our stay here, but honestly if you are on the fence about booking, get off the fence and do it you won’t regret it!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very nice stay at Denny’s. They thought of everything that you might possibly need, from shampoo to kitchen essentials."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We only stayed one night but this place is a hidden gem. Close to I75, literally has everything you need inside plus provides coffee, sugar creamer, butter for toast, comfortable king bed, plus a nice yard for your dog to play in. Will definitely book again on our way to Florida."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Dennys's place was comfortable, clean, ready to get in and out of.
I love the neighborhood trees and flowers, felt safe while walking with my dog. The place inside is big. Our dog enjoyed running back and forth after her ball like we do in our house. It is a wonderful place to stop over on a long trip."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for my kids & I to stay on the way down to FL. Some of the best hosts I've ever had! They went above & beyond.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Accurate listing actually looks nicer than the pictures. You’ll have the whole house to yourselves ; it’s clean and comfortable with a full kitchen and king bed in the master bedroom
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our first Air B&B experience. We couldn't have been more pleased with all of the accommodations. It was spacious, clean, well appointed, and in a very lovely neighborhood. The Dennys were easy to communicate with at all times. we will likely stay there again in the future. 5 stars on everything!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place had everything we needed
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was really cute. We only got to stay a few hours to sleep. But the bed was so comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a comfortable stay. Quiet house on a quiet street in a nice neighborhood. Sparkling clean and excellent communication. Five minutes from the interstate but a world away.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"we enjoyed the home very much, right down to the dog bowls and dog snacks. we hope to get back soon. It will be the place we always stay while leaving TN and heading to Florida. The host very pleasant. 5 stars for sure.
McDermott., Mr and Mrs"
2024-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"The place inside is farmhouse pristine. Adorable.
However, not easy to find. Mailbox hanging sideways with only partial numbers. No driveway to speak of so we didn’t know where to turn into. We passed it twice. I messaged her that we couldn’t find it she told us to go to the road near but it didn’t have a road sign so that didn’t help. After driving all day we just wanted to relax. My husband was frustrated. We use air bnb every trip for the past 5 seasons and this was the most frustrating experience we have had. There was no welcome page to let us know house instructions nor WiFi.
Disappointing.
But have to say the bed was comfy!!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Impeccably clean, was just what we needed for a stopover."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Adorable little place and perfect for us! Thanks for the getaway.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was exactly as described in a cute little country setting and spotlessly clean! The communication was fantastic and I highly recommend this getaway. ￼ 10 minutes to restaurants and stores, and I can imagine it will be spectacular in the spring. ￼You won’t be disappointed! ￼"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks, I will be staying there again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is so beautiful I’d stay again definitely. The outside does not do it justice the inside is immaculate.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This space was great, super peaceful! Perfect for our stop over after a long day of travel, with the most thoughtful pick me ups of water and soda! Coffee machine was a wonderful touch, and Britni was so great. Will be back when traveling!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was very clean and not cluttered. Location was perfect for what we needed. Plan on staying at the same place again in the future. Bed was very comfortable. Loved the large outside area
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is adorable and I would definitely stay at Britni’s again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first Air BnB. The house is amazing. It's beautifully furnished, very spacious, and has everything you need to feel at home. Highly recommended."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay..It was very peaceful..I would definitely refer others to this location.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family enjoyed our stay! We were in town for a graduation and all ages were pleased. Leon promptly responded and answered questions. We would definitely stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed the stay at Leon’s. This was the perfect house for our men’s golf trip. The pool and spacious rooms met our needs. We would definitely stay here again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"let me tell you, this place is INCREDIBLE!!!!!!! The pictures don't do it justice. so much room. such an amazing home. the outdoor area is perfection. the host was amazing and flexible. if we are EVER in this area again, we'll do anything and everything we can to stay here again!!!! cannot say enough amazing things about this place and host!!!!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Worked perfect for us for a family gathering for a wedding at a nearby wedding venue. Leon was nice to allow us an early check in since we had multiple guests arriving from out of town who needed to freshen up and dress for the rehearsal and dinner that early evening of check in. We utilized all 5 bedrooms so everyone had their own space.
We were so busy with the rehearsal dinner and the wedding that we really didn’t get to spend any time enjoying the amenities, but I am sure the pool and the ability to dock a boat for a longer stay would be wonderful.
With our hectic schedule we only had time to enjoy one quick lunch and 2 breakfasts during our visit, but we had everything that we needed during our stay, and it was very convenient that we all got to visit during what little down time we had instead of having to all stay in separate hotel rooms."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Leon is an extremely responsive and engaged host. The property was perfect for our extended family.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,This house and location was amazing! Well appointed with amenities! Gorgeous spacious rooms and beautiful view! Our group will be back!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location considering my families plans. Could not have worked out better, and Leon was always prompt with communicating and answering any questions we had. Would stay again in a heartbeat."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Great stay! We had a great trip!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Our family travels to Cordele a few times a year and this will most definitely be where we are staying from here on out! Thank you for providing such a lovely space for our family to stay!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"beautiful views ,great place well stocked and just lovely 😍"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Our stay here was nice and peaceful. The owners of the property were very pleasant and accessible. Everything was nice and clean and everyone had a great time. I would definitely recommend this place to visit. 10/10🙂
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful time! Started with a few minor hiccups but overall everything was great! Leon I’d definitely a Super Host! So responsive to all your questions.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect family getaway. My family and I took a last minute getaway to Lake Blackshear and Leon’s place was perfect. Clean, gorgeous and private with a beautiful view of the lake. Comfortable beds and furniture had young and old feeling right at home. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a little piece of South Georgia heaven."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had to take a large family to Cordele with very little notice for a funeral. I found this house and it had enough beds to accommodate everyone. We loved the space in this home. The kitchen was large and dining table was fabulous for us to enjoy meals together. We were able to gather in the living room for fellowship. The outdoor space was beautiful and peaceful. The kids loved the game room. There is plenty of parking space and the host was very responsive. They left us a basket of snacks and a note of condolences which was an extra special touch. Highly recommend for anyone with a large group.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great place for small and large families. Great view and very peaceful. Leon was a great host very welcoming and responsive if any questioned came up during our stay.

I definitely recommend this home for family vacations. We will be back next year.

Our kids fished from the dock, we had great family, gatherings, played games from the game closet, enjoyed the outdoors, and it fits all of us comfortably! The game room was a bonus!
