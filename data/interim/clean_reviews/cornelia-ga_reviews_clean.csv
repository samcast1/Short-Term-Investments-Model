2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent, we arrived later than agreed, and the hosts were very aware of our arrivals, the place was super clean, there was everything you can imagine, Jade thought of everything, many towels, blankets, the huge place and very, very Equipped bathroom and kitchen .. Thank you very much for your stay, I will definitely come back to spend more time. Thanks"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful place to stay. The driveway is a little hard to find in the dark though. The kitchen was well stocked and the place was super clean. On top of that, you get to meet two most amazing hosts - Judy and Ralph."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very warm and homey place to stay. Our hosts provided everything we could want. We would definitely stay here again!
2021-12-01,4,Stayed one night,This is a great location near to local restaurants and necessities. We ate at Bigg Daddy’s and highly recommend. There were no issues with our stay. Judy communicated well and she and her husband were there to greet us when we arrived. The only warning I will give to travelers is that the queen bed is very firm so anyone with back problems be aware. Otherwise the stay was just as advertised.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,My favorite place to stay in N. Georgia!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We were in the area for a college visit and Judy's place offered just what we needed. Judy was welcoming and understanding of our late arrival after a long day of travel. I'm sure we will stay there again!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place for a quick overnight if not in the area long. Close to many nearby towns. Nice set up and clean. It would also be nice for a longer stay.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Judy and her husband are wonderful hosts. The rental is very clean and spacious. The setting is beautiful in the woods/hills. Judy has truly thought of everything one might need while traveling. She is a great communicator. You won’t regret staying at this place!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is neat. Its a lot bigger than the pics show. Lots of room for getting together with friends and family. Lots of extra too, snacks, coffee and a really well stocked bathroom in case you forget your shampoo! There were board games galore too. Nice hosts, really nice location, especially great for Helen. I bet its even nicer in summer. Looking forward to visiting again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great host and delightful time. 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The hosts are wonderful!! Judy communicated often. The accommodations were wonderful! It was clean, spacious and peaceful. If you forgot it, they most likely have it. They had snacks, extra towels, blankets, pillows, toiletries, games, books, and brochures for things to do in the area. We will definitely stay again next time we are in the area! I don’t think we could have found a better place and the price is better than a hotel."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was as advertised and very clean
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Judy was the PERFECT host. She was quick to respond via text, and her and her husband Ralph actually met us at the door to show us around when we arrived. They were the sweetest, and my 7 month old girl just smiled and smiled at them, she knew right away that they were good people. The location itself is fantastic, secluded and beautiful, and we felt very safe. They have so many ""extras"" that make you feel right at home! Popcorn, coffee, water in the door of the fridge, blankets everywhere, ceiling fans, board games, box fans, all the bathroom essentials you could ever need (even toothbrushes if you forgot them!), and comfy seating area. Once we put the babies to sleep, we played Uno at the kitchen table for hours, it was so much fun.
Note: If you're a coffee drinker, bring your own creamer. There's only the powdered stuff there, but that was literally the only negative I could come up with haha.
Thank you so much, Judy and Ralph, we will definitely recommend you in the future. The best AirBNB stay we've had so far!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were in town for our son’s wedding in Cleveland GA.
We arrive so late and Judy and her husband were waiting for us, so grateful. Quiet place in the wood, everything we need for one night stay. We don’t have to find the place anywhere else if next time we are in the area. Thank you."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Judy and her husband were very good hosts. Made us feel welcome. We had the entire basement to ourselves. The rooms were very clean and she had snacks, drinks, and other things to make you feel at home. I would definitely recommend staying here."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We could not have been happier. Mrs. Judy was phenomenal. One of the best experiences we have had renting a place to stay. Highly recommended.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Accommodations were clean and comfortable. Judy & Ralph have just about everything you may need. Very quite and secluded. Plenty of space. It was great.
2021-10-01,4,Group trip,Nice place to stay. Hostess was very hospitable.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was such an easy place to stay, out away from the noise and crowds. I had both my mom and 2 kids with me, and we were all happy with the accommodations Judy and Ralph supplied. We would definitely stay with them again."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Welcoming and accommodating hosts make this spot a great stay!
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Judy’s home and customer service exceeded our expectations. The home was lovely and clean. It included many extra thoughtful gestures, like mirrors in every bed room, well-placed extension cords, and an abundance of cozy blankets. It felt like home and that’s because Judy is intentional about making guests feel that way. The setting was cozy and relaxing. Judy was a great communicator and very friendly. I would recommend her stays."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I see why Judy is listed as a super host! Her and her husband were very kind and accommodating! The apartment was so nice and clean. It literally had everything you could ever possibly need. We felt so comfortable and relaxed. It was so peaceful. If we ever come back to Toccoa Falls, we will definitely try to stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We would highly recommend staying here. We enjoyed meeting and visiting with the hosts and loved their recommendations of places to go in the area. We found the location to be great for where we were going. Thanks again for sharing your home.
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,We were going to Toccoa Falls for a wedding and needed just one night nearby. Judy's place was beautiful. A downhome treasure in the middle of a woodland wonderland.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Excellent communication throughout. Would highly recommend.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Judy and her husband are 2 of the nicest people you would ever want to meet. Their place is a true value, You get so much more than what you pay for. They thought of all your needs and then some. We were only there for a short stay this time But plan on a much longer stay in the future. We highly recommend their place To anyone wanting to enjoy the many attractions in the area."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time!
Tons of amenities and lots of space to rest and relax :)"
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean and was correct on ill amenities. It was definitely quiet. Place is kinda tucked back into the woods. I only have a few gripes. 1: no alcohol is allowed on the premises. I'm sure that they have it somewhere in the description of the place but that could be a hard not for some people. 2: the internet is not good. I travel for work and bring a computer with me too game and work on other projects which was barely possibly while I was there because of that. 3: the bed that I stayed in was pretty hard. After a long day of work, a great bed is a must.
you are also staying beneath their home in a renovated basement. the pros are basically everything else, just know what you are getting into. The kitchen is stocked well with all the essentials. they provide a keurig with k cups (huge plus!). They have dish TV with what seems like every channel known to mankind and the location is close enough to where you can visit a few different towns but far enough to where you get peace and quiet at the end of the day."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,We really enjoy our stay. Judy welcome us and was so nice to make a fire for us to do smores. we felt like so welcome. if you want to enjoy nature and get some me time this is for you. I am looking forward to come back next year.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was awesome!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Judy’s place is so clean and is amazingly well-stocked with all the extras from coffee to marshmallows.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,It's a lovely apartment! Judy and her husband are very friendly and have great suggestions about the surrounding area if you're from out of town! My friends and I had a wonderful time visiting Georgia! I highly recommend!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Judy and Ralph were Awesome! Waited for us to arrive so they could give us a tour even though we got in late. Will stay here again in the future for sure!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful time here. Many added bonuses to our stay too- washer & dryer, games, many brochures about the area, extra things in the bathroom in case we forgot anything, full kitchen, which included instant grits & coffee. Plenty of box vans in case we needed them, extra blankets & pillows too! Judy made a fire in the fire pit & told us where the marshmallows & roasting sticks were! Made for a perfect night!
Judy kept in touch w/us & quickly responded to any questions we had.
Would definitely recommend you stay here & if we return to the area we would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a gorgeous place with the woods as your backyard. It's stunning, quiet, secluded and perfectly relaxing. Judy and Ralph are amazing hosts, full of suggestions of what to do around their home, as well as having a lovely space. Plenty of room for the whole family to eat, sleep and enjoy the woods right outside. I hope to come back one day! My stay was too short!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The property is awesome. The photographs do not do justice with the surroundings only adding to our experience. 😀.
It was comfortable within the house but was even more beautiful and peaceful outside with the lightning bugs adding to the charm. Walmart, Ingles and restaurants are within 10 minutes drive. Being close to the highway, it was easy to get around places."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Judy's spacious, clean apartment has a pleasant patio area and is in a tranquil area. It's a great option for families looking for a base from which to explore NE Georgia."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Judy and Ralph met us as we pulled in, they made sure they made all three of our children welcome. They provide all the little extras that you might forget while packing. There are snacks and games to stay occupied with. Judy even built a fire for the kids and gave them marshmallows to roasts. By far our best experience traveling with three small kids. Just like visiting family."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This Airbnb and hosts were inviting and made it feel like home away from home. The location is so serene and stay was so comfortable. We would make it a point to stay here again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had lots of room to spread out, and Judy was sweet and excited to have us stay. Nice touches like popcorn, cocoa and a Hallmark movie made for a perfect girls weekend! Trying to start a fire in the outdoor pit was fun, but all the wood was wet from previous rain. Would definitely stay here again if in the area."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean and convenient. Everything you need and plenty of extras
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great hospitality and a great place to stay.

2021-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Mrs.. Judy was an awesome host. There was plenty of beds to choose from. It was so peaceful. I wish we had more time at the house just to sit on her swing.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Judy was a great host. She and her husband met us when we arrived and showed us where everything was and gave us some tips for things to see in the area. They did not bother us the rest of the trip. They have a number posted if you do need anything though. The space was clean and it felt like home. Location was quite and it was peaceful. We would most definitely stay again when in the area. Thank you Judy for making our first Airbnb stay a success.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"As usual, a great stay"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, thanks Judy!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mrs. Judy was so sweet, very very kind host! Everything was clean and so homey when arriving. It was back off in the woods a little bit and it so nice and quiet. My toddlers are usually a bit nervous being at new places, but immediately they loved it there and I think it’s because it was so homey and cozy. Will definitely be booking again next time we are in the area!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to stay! Beautiful property, fire-pit in the back, and very generous, friendly, and helpful hosts."

The location worked for us. Judy and her husband are very kind and even gave us recommendations of places we can visit. We felt welcome and at home."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"While the review asks for a few words...I'll do my best to be brief. Thank you for a perfect getaway. This cottage is charm-personified and so very comfortable. Kayla has thought of everything you could possibly need during your stay. So many little thoughtful touches, fresh flowers, bundles of lavender, and soft and cozy blankets for curling up on a rainy day (which we had and loved the thunder and sounds of a mountain storm). We put the porch swing to good use while watching the fireflies at night and playing music outside. Cooking was a breeze as the kitchen was very well stocked with everything you could need. The beds were great, everything was squeaky clean and while we were secluded in our cottage space everything was close by. Your choice of several small towns to visit, (Clarkesville, Cornelia, and Demorest) for dining and shopping and several good hikes close by. I highly recommend a stay at this darling and roomy cottage. You will not be disappointed!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a great stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to stay! Perfect for 2-4 people. This Airbnb was very clean and well stocked with everything we needed and very close to downtown Clarksville and my job. It really worked out great and Debbie was very accommodating making sure we had everything we needed and so forth.A really nice place to stay and we will be back again!

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in several bnbs and Debby outdid them all! She thoughtfully prepares every detail of your stay and her hospitality is the gold standard. The place itself is so peaceful and cozy. Perfectly clean, very comfy, and easy to access. We felt right at home. Thank you for everything, Debby!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the best airbnb we have ever stayed in. Debby was super nice. She offered places to go and restaurants. The cabin was impeccable. The hot tub was so relaxing. The swing was even relaxing. So fun! We visited Tallulah Gorge which was only about 20 min away. Clayton is only 30 min away with a really cool downtown area. The cabin itself is incredibly well thought out for space. It has charm and privacy with a view of the trees that makes it so homey. I would 100% stay here again. We loved it!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best place we have stayed. The description, location, cleanliness, convenience, everything new, all essentials, comfortable beds, WiFi and cell signal was strong, everything was perfect. The value is in the privacy and quite surroundings that you can't get in a hotel or motel where you would have to spend about the same per night. Would recommend this to anyone that plans to stay in the area and is convenient to all area attractions. The best."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Debby is a great host! Very responsive. The cabin was super cute; country chic!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was beautiful and had everything we needed.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is adorable with so many thoughtful touches. It more than met our expectations. We didn’t explore the area much as we were there for a family wedding in Cornelia and were busy with that.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this AirBnB. Clean, comfortable and quiet."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I enjoyed our stay, beautiful area, very clean and we really enjoyed the outside activities (fire pit, swing, & hot-tub)."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was perfect - the cabin was situated on a property that faced the woods. There were so many special touches that made me feel like I was on vacation. My 2-day getaway was really made special because of this cabin.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our stay! I had a conference in Toccoa and my wife was able to come along. She loved having space to work at the cabin while I was away. It was a great location too for different things in each direction - Helen, Tallulah Gorge, and super convenient Clarksville which had great food options! Debby was a proactive host with prompt and helpful information. Appreciated her recommendations for food when we were looking for a place. We loved the Attic and the Copperpot especially. The cabin was just like the pictures - lots of thoughtful details. (I think Debby must be blessed with the gift of hospitality because you could feel it in the cabin!) Also a plus that there was a hot tub - that was a great way to end the day after our hike through Tallulah Gorge! Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again if the opportunity arises. Thank you, Debby!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! I’ve stayed at many AirBNBs, and this is one of the best I’ve Ever seen. It feels like home.
While the space has an efficiency (tiny house) vibe, it has everything you could want for a cabin in nature. The space itself is well designed, and has every amenity you could need in a cabin. The hot tub and swing were nice touches as well. Very peaceful and comfortable beds.
I was at a conference in Demorest at Piedmont University, and this AirBNB was a far better option compared to a generic hotel off a highway exit. The proximity to Piedmont University was super convenient."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gosh, I don’t know where to begin! By far, one of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve ever had. Debby is a wonderful host and so kind. The place itself was incredibly clean, the beds were super comfortable - my husband and I slept better than we had in a long time. We really loved the hot tub, too. Excellent location - short drive to Helen, Clarkesville, and Cornelia. Cannot say enough wonderful things about this Airbnb! Cozy, quiet, and wonderful!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the MOST wonderful time staying here! Such a nice cozy and clean cabin with everything we needed for our stay. Debby was very helpful and kind before, during and after our stay. We will definitely come again in the future!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I got this place for a sisters’ weekend to just lounge, read, and spend time together. Everything was amazing from the cute decor to outdoor hot tub and trampoline swing to a well-supplied kitchen (though small). Debby was very friendly and answered all questions promptly, including topics of typical weather and things to do in the area. It was the relaxing venue we wanted and we can’t wait for another sisters’ retreat here!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful place, had everything I needed! Really appreciated the microwave which was also an air fryer and oven!!!!!!"

The living room was so cozy and made us feel right at home. The cabin was nicely labeled with little sticky notes telling us all of the details we needed to know for our stay. We enjoyed being close to all of the local places and events in downtown Clarkesville. The house was just so inviting and made it hard to leave. Definitely recommend!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely AMAZING! The “cabin” is so quaint and cozy in a peaceful, rural setting. Very clean with everything you could need/want. It was the perfect size for my adult daughter, boyfriend and myself. We were looking for a place to get away for a weekend and get back to nature and we were NOT disappointed! My daughter and I hiked a few trails in the vicinity & spent the evenings by the fire. My boyfriend especially loved the hot tub. Debby was so accommodating from start to finish! I have rented many places, however, Debby is one of the best hosts I’ve experienced! Highly recommend!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was just what we expected. Peaceful with privacy. The house was decorated adorable and it’s close to many areas we wanted to visit. Sitting on the porch in the morning with our coffee was ideal. Definitely will rebook when we come back to GA!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ms. Debby and her retreat were amazing! She was very helpful and quick to respond.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Debby was a phenomenal host and her place was cozy and felt like home. The location is secluded enough that it was quiet but not so secluded that it took hours to get to a restaurant. Perfect location!

We look forward to staying again!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Debbie and Mike’s Tree-Mendous Retreat has got to be one of the best places we’ve ever stayed. Everything about it was absolutely spectacular; from the driveway (lots of cool rocks), to the inside (amenities/toiletries/linens/snacks, and everything was spotless) to the backyard (hot tub AND a trampoline swing). Yes, you read that correctly…they have a trampoline on a cable suspended by rope. If that’s not a selling point then I don’t know what is. We will definitely be booking again when we come back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Debbie and Mike are delightful and quick to please. Setting was quiet and so relaxing and they had thought of every possible need. Cabin is new and fresh. We can’t say enough about our great stay. The name says it all tree-mendous retreat. The extra touches, (rose petals) TLC and a touch of whimsy made our stay delightful. Highly recommend it."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved my stay. it was so incredibly peaceful and was the perfect weekend getaway. I am definitely planning a second trip and many more in the future.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Debbie’s place. We came for the Tour of North Georgia (TONGA) bike race. The location of the airbnb was close to all of the biking locations which was amazing! At night we really enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub, playing board games (provided by the host), and sitting around the fire roasting s’mores. We were also thankful for the kitchen, it was small but it did the job. Due to the fact that we were there for the bike race we pre-planned/ prepped all of our meals and cooked daily which was totally doable with the supplied tools/appliances. We brought our 22 month old son and he really loved the swing, rocking chair, and the fact that we had access to YouTube. Debbie and her husband even came down and said hi and checked on us (they asked first). Check out was a breeze and refreshing in comparison to over stays. Overall we loved everything about this stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ms. Debby communicated stupendously from the start. The rental was cozy and our host showed great hospitality. Everything was clean and amenities were outstanding. Rental is in a great location, there's plenty to go do in any direction of the home with a short drive. Will most definitely book again in the future."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow! What can I say. This cute little cabin is tucked away in the woods. Although it’s near a main road and on the owners property we had a very private stay. Debby and her husband are so sweet. They’d love to meet you if you are open to it. My husband and I almost wish’d we could of hung out with them longer after a quick meet and greet! This home is in the middle of everything. Helen and Talulah Falls are a hop skip away. There is another town called Sautee. If you are visiting be sure to check it out and find the Farmers cheese. So good! We ate at the Attic in town. It’s pretty fancy but folks in T-shirts and hats rolled in so it’s ok! The whole experience was perfect and Debby left us delicious grapes which my boys loved as a welcome gift. The home, the kitchen, and the amenities…. It’s just fabulous. We will 💯 be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was everything we wanted it to be! Mrs. Debby was very friendly and gave us privacy. It was so nice to relax some where that's secluded. We will be back.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and clean Airbnb with good amenities!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We chose this house because it is close to my sisters house and even closer to town. It's about a half mile to town, and most of that is through the neighborhood, so it's an easy and safe walk to the coffee shop. It's also right between two grocery stores and close to a Walmart for quick shopping.
The house is perfect for 2 people. There's plenty of room all around with a comfortable living room and functional kitchen. We felt right at home. We made breakfast everyday.
The mattress is on the softer side which was comfortable for us. Two closets and a dresser for us to unpack and live like at home.
We'll be back next time we're in town visiting family again."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Hickory is a go-to for overnight accommodations when I visit the area for work several times a year. This visit I was in and out of the apartment two times over the course of two weeks. The place is comfortable and always clean. It’s located in a quiet neighborhood and convenient to walk around the Piedmont College campus. I’m sure I’ll be returning in the future!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We chose Ally’s place as our home base while we visited our daughter for Parent’s Weekend at Piedmont University. Her place was easy to find, super clean, and very attractively decorated.

We definitely hope to book Ally’s place again when patent’s weekend rolls around next year!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I highly recommend Ally's place! The apartment was extremely clean, the bed was very comfortable, and the kitchen had everything I needed.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ally’s cottage is the perfect spot for any Piedmont athletes families to stay. I shouldn’t mention that, since we’ll probably never get back in since the secret will be revealed. The place was everything we’ve looked for and more. The appeal that Ally has mastered, is you immediately feel at home as soon as you walk through the door. A lot of places are nice enough, but they don’t have that warm feeling you get from this place. We’ve stayed in 5 or 6 places in the area and this was by far our favorite."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hickory House was cozy and comfortable. Very open and spacious. Never felt cramped. Felt right at home. Close to so many places and sites.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at Hickory multiple times. The property is clean, comfortable and located in a perfect place for my needs. Ally is always responsive and flexible.

We can’t wait to come back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I am not sure if my words will do this charming place justice. Betsy has created the perfect Southern home. She might want to consider a career in interior design.

We will definitely be back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Sweet Tea Cottage was an amazing experience for my family. It was laid out nicely with a game room, office, and space for everyone to hang out separately.

Betsy helped make a bad situation better through being a responsive host and assisting us with last minute accommodation changes. She did everything she could to offer assistance and make sure we had what we needed. At the end of a stressful day, her cottage was exactly as pictured and I felt a sense of calm just arriving at Sweet Tea cottage. The place was clean, nicely decorated, and sweetly aglow with decorative lights. The beds were soft and comfortable with plenty of extra linens and towels.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed in Betsy's cottage for two nights as we were attending a wedding in the area. I chose her Airbnb because of the reviews on the cleanliness, and we were not disappointed! Everything was spotless, and the cottage was perfect for our needs and so welcoming! When I contacted Betsy she responded right away, and she went above and beyond to meet our needs and to make our stay so special. The beds were all very comfortable, and the home is spacious with lots of comfortable space to sit and talk. We also enjoyed sitting out on the front porch with the ceiling fan going. We hope to get back to that area some day, and we will definitely stay at Betsy's cottage again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was clean, bed sheets were soft, host was very easy to communicate with. Excellent stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Every little detail of this home was perfection! Our family will definitely be back to this beautiful and peaceful home! We enjoyed the game room, the outdoor sitting areas, the coffee bar and the simple comfort and beauty of this place. It was so fresh smelling and clean! The host was top notch in her prompt communication and was truly so kind! Our family is grateful to find this gem!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Sweet Tea Cottage was well worth the money. It was extremely clean and the description was on point. Betsy did an awesome job by being responsive to any questions I had. Overall, it was a great experience."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed our stay at Betsy's place very much! The house has been beautifully renovated and decorated, and was immaculate. The bathroom and kitchen were stocked with various items that might be needed. The coffee bar in the office was a nice touch! We enjoyed a cup of coffee in the morning while listening to some tunes on the turntable. The game room got a lot of use at the end of the day when we returned from site seeing. The beds were wonderfully comfortable and we all slept very well! We wouldn't hesitate to stay in this little gem again. Thanks for a wonderful stay, Betsy!!"

Really enjoyed the fire
(Thank y'all for the wood)
Would definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the beautifully decorated Sweet Tea Cottage. The house was sparkling clean and the location could not have been better. We enjoyed day trips to the Dillard House, the quaint towns of Helen and Dahlonega, the Foxfire Museum, Tallulah Gorge, the Consolidated Gold Mine, North Georgia Wildlife Park, Babylon General Hospital and Osage Farms. It was truly a week to remember and all the extra touches provided by Betsy helped to make it one of our best trips ever. Thank you Betsy! Sweet Tea Cottage is the best! We cannot wait to return!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Betsy's place was a cozy, little piece of country tucked away in beautiful North Georgia. The decorations throughout the house tied each room together so perfectly that they could have been featured in a magazine, yet I still felt at home.
The coffee bar station, record player, and the fire pit were great editions that brought joy to our stay.
We would definitely recommend a stay at Betsy's and will do a repeat stay if we're in the area again."

Miss Betsy is a wonderful host and responded immediately to all of my concerns. I will definitely revisit. Thank you for such a great stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family had a wonderful stay and only wished we could have stayed longer
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,If you’re visiting Clarkesville or Helen this place is a must stay! Betsy was very accommodating on a super short notice and very quick to respond. As someone who travels for a living I have stayed in countless airbnb’s all over the country. This was hands down the cleanest and best put together place I have experienced.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had the perfect girls trip celebrating my daughters bachelorette weekend. We had a great stay at Betsy’s place. Very good location, convenient to everything. It was a beautiful house that has been beautifully done. Had everything we needed. Betsy was very nice and helpful and always responded quickly. The best AirBnb I’ve ever stayed at. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Betsy’s sweet tea cottage is a home away from home.
I did not want to leave. The house is quaint and very clean. My family will definitely rebook this Gem in Clarkesville. You won’t have to second guess booking this Airbnb for your trip!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved this well appointed house! Adorable kitchen and nice touches throughout! Coffee nook was perfect and the master bed was super comfy! Perfect for our second night of BRAG (bike ride across GA)!

Betsy was extremely helpful and a very gracious host! Thank you for offering such a wonderful place to stay in Clarkesville!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This little cottage was spotless and clean. Very easy to find and close to town. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in the Clarksville area.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,It was a great stay and had a good time! Definitely would recommend
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"I absolutely loved our stay at Sweet Tea Cottage! Betsy was an incredible host and made sure we had exactly what we needed!
We were in Clarksville for my sister’s bachelorette weekend and I had told Betsy that we planned on going to a few of the local wineries. Betsy went above and beyond sending recommendations and pictures of the places she suggested!
Incredible host! Incredible experience! Book now!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay at Betsy's Sweet Tea Cottage. It was nice and roomy with plenty of bed space and very modern and clean. She provided resources for local attractions and hiking. We did day hikes each day to get out and about and cooked in the kitchen each night. My kids loved the foosball very much and we took advantage of the firepit and free firewood.
We would definitely stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Betsy's Sweet Tea Cottage was absolutely perfect for us! This home is charming and spacious and had beautiful finishes and decor all throughout. Internet coverage and speed was superb. Our group spent hours on the front porch and back deck, sipping coffee from the coffee bar, playing cards, or just talking and enjoying the down time we had together.
We were in town for a family member's graduation from Truett McConnell University and her spot was an ideal location for us. We also ended up making a trip up to Tallulah Gorge State Park about 20-25 minutes away.
Because of the nature of our group, the house was also ideal in that there were three distinct sleeping areas so we could go our own way at night.
On top of this home and this spot being perfect for us, Betsy was an excellent host and was always quick to respond. We asked for an accommodation for our group and she was so kind to honor it - thank you again!
We can't recommend Betsy and her Sweet Tea Cottage highly enough!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is so beautiful! Its setting is idyllic, tucked in the mountains of North Georgia. I can't say enough about how charming this cottage is. So many lovely touches in each room to make your stay perfect! Betsy provided the warmest of welcomes, and everything was immaculate. So very grateful to have found this little treasure and will definitely return many times in the future!! Already planning my next trip! Thank you, Betsy for your attention to detail and care for the well-being of your guests!!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful cottage - spacious - super clean - towels and bed linens are far superior to any airbnb and most hotels we have ever stayed at - appreciated extras like coffee bar, incidental basket, and cookies - host could not have been nicer and easier to communicate with. Would give 10 stars if allowed.
Will for sure stay at again if available."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Such a beautiful home and a great host. Betsy was great to reach out to me before I checked in and even checked in with me to make sure everything was ok. I highly recommend booking with Betsy and will definitely be back anytime I am in the area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home and Carol is so gracious. The bathroom is almost spa-like with the claw foot tub, robes and slippers. The home was spotless and very nostalgic. Things I haven’t seen since my childhood."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We fully enjoyed our stay and the vintage decor. Much attention was given to make us welcome includingfresh flowers, cookies, coffee bar, luxurious towels, robes, and slippers! We were very comfortable and enjoyed relaxing in the private back screened porch and yard, including a double hammock. The house is near a busy highway but it did not bother us. Carol has thoughtfully placed ear plugs and eye masks on the beside table for those with more of a sensitivity."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and place with many amenities
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carol was very accommodating and very quick to respond any questions during the trip. The space had all of the necessities for two night stays. It was very cozy and warm. The house is within 20 minutes from Helen and Yonah Mnt which is perfect place if someone plans to travel mountains.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I spent our honeymoon at the Blueberry Farmhouse, and it was everything we hoped it would be. Packed full of character and charm, the Blueberry Farmhouse was comfortable, cozy and private. Our favorite part was the fireplace! We spent hours warming up beside it after dancing to the jazz record they had. Carol was responsive (I got a response from her within 5 minutes) and was kind enough to provide a list of fun places to go for food and fun. We would absolutely recommend this place and stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING about this stay. Carol’s finishing touches on everything was noteworthy. You’d be a fool to not book this place. Without a doubt, we will be back. Thank you Carol!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When we review places on this app, we, as reviewers will often say things like ""would stay here again"" or ""hope to come back again"" or something like this.
For us, we felt SO at home, the sentiment that my wife and I feel is more like ""what can we do with our vacation schedule to provide us an excuse to go back to the blueberry farmhouse in Cornelia?""
We only stayed 2 nights but could have stayed a month. We LOVED sitting on the back screened-in porch and just watching the leaves fall from the trees while sipping coffee.
We LOVED sitting in the living room listening to old records on the record player.
We LOVED sitting at the small, intimate kitchen table with the fresh flowers and enjoying a meal or snack.
We LOVED the comfort of the king sized bed and the retro feel of the kitchen.
We LOVED the location. We felt like we were as close to anything we wanted to do, but had enough privacy to make us feel like we were miles away."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A Step Back In Time!
My husband and I booked the Blueberry Cottage for my birthday weekend. This little place is a gem!
We were able to unwind and really feel at home. The cottage is cozy and Carol was a fantastic hostess. She added so many
awesome little details for our stay. Flowers, cookies, robes, and slippers just to add a few!
We loved the fireplace as well as the firepit outside- this made for an at-home feeling.
(Really you could pack to stay and never leave the premises!) The bed was comfortable with nice linens.
We found that our place was close enough to Helen and all that the area had to offer.
We ate at Fender's twice- the food is fantastic and not what you expect from a diner. We also made
reservations for the new steak house Community Brew and Tap in downtown Cornelia. This is a MUST if you
stay at the Blueberry Cottage! It's a little swanky- and perfect for a romantic night out.
Over all, we absolutely loved our stay- would love to go back. Thank you, Carol!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home! Carol was very responsive and the cottage was very cozy! Definitely recommending this and would certainly stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect quiet location in the country outskirts of Cornelia, near Hwy 441. The decor was elegant and period correct. The working 60’s kitchen appliances were the pinnacle of our visit. And the screened in back porch was a welcomed relief from the Georgia heat after hiking all day at the many state parks close by.
We will be back!! 😍"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, centrally located and easy instructions on location and how to enter the house. Carol was a great host. We loved our stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly like the pictures! Great value, beautiful scenery, and a very kind host. There were many extra little touches that really make you feel right at home. Only possible downside is being disappointed by other Airbnb listings after staying here. Would definitely come back for another stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farmhouse was precious! It was uncluttered and relaxing while including special welcoming touches and amenities from the hostess. I was in the area for a volunteer event, so it welcomed me after long days of activity, just like home. Carol was easy to communicate with for my stay. It was perfect! I hope to return with my husband sometime soon."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable retro cottage. Very clean and nicely stocked. High quality linens and towels. Comfortable bed. I normally prefer wood fireplaces but it was so easy to just flip a switch and have a fire. Good internet and television. Cute porch and sunroom that I didn’t get to enjoy. Would definitely come back if I’m the area again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carol was a fantastic host that showed great hospitality and recommended lots of things to do in the area. We loved her cottage and it provided the perfect place for a couples trip.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carol’s place was amazing! My husband and I spent the weekend for our 18th wedding anniversary and loved every moment of it. The house itself is cozy and peaceful, Carol provided great information about the stay and the area. I would highly recommend this stay!"

We really appreciated all the personal touches Carol added in the home, too! We will definitely stay here again when we come back to visit."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage feels so private and whimsically lost in time. The house was clean and neat with fun themed appliances and decor. We loved using the antique record player while sitting by the fire. The host went above and beyond in supplying complementary supplies like extra blankets, towels, robes, slippers, sleep supplies, toiletries and sweet treats. In warmer weather, the covered porch and outdoor fire pit would probably be awesome for an extended stay. The house feels very bright and private."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little home, loved our quiet weekend there!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was peaceful and relaxing. The home was clean, cozy and the host was very attentive. We were very pleased and would def return!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My [now] husband and I stayed here the weekend after our wedding and it was the most perfect stay! You can tell that Carol really cares about her guests. She adds so many thoughtful touches and makes sure you have everything you need to make it feel like home. She was also very accommodating to us. I love all the cute antique furniture and appliances. I would definitely stay here again and 100% recommend it to anyone staying in the area!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and a short drive to Helen. We were visiting Helen for Oktoberfest. Would recommend this place to anyone. Has everything you need.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed a cozy and comfortable stay at the farmhouse. The property's location was close to town and the University where I was attending a conference. Carol was a great hostess, the house was very comfortable and well-appointed, the fireplace was perfect for a fall chill, and I loved the vintage touches all over the house. Would definitely stay here again or recommend to friends."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Every time I stay at Carol’s place it’s a pleasant experience. This latest time, she asked specifically what my favorite snacks were, and when I checked in I had them waiting for me. She’s an incredible host. 10/10 would recommend"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"As usual, Carol was an exemplary host. The place is wonderful as well. Looking forward to staying here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is great! We went for my baby sisters graduation and she lives in Cornelia and she met us there and when I showed her around the first time, she said, omg it the cutest house and it’s smells SO clean. The stove is amazing and was so fun to cook on. Every time we walked through the door, all we could say was, omg, it smells so clean in here. The next time we go back, I will definitely stay here again. 🙂"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My stay here was amazing. Very cozy, nice location, and Carol was always quick to reply, usually within a few minutes whenever I had a question. I won’t hesitate to book this place again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a cute little country house. We enjoyed a lot of time on the screened in porch looking at the woods behind the house. The house was very clean and well decorated, and the bed was comfy! Carol was such a great host and provided lots of information about stuff to do in the area, along with some nice touches to make us feel welcome, like a sweet note and fresh flowers. There was some road noise, but I always sleep with white noise so I didn’t notice it. (And Carol provided ear plugs in the bedroom—another nice touch.) Definitely recommend this stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay, Carol & Frank were excellent hosts, I loved the small details in the home. The vintage charm is really special. Also I didn't realize until the end of my stay that there was a bonus sitting/sun room! So many special moments all around. Would definitely recommend staying."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hard to find the exact words to describe the warmth and charm of the Blueberry Farmhouse. A great place for a getaway! The house has amazing amounts of room and wonderful little breezeway and surprises. Clean, bright, charming, and features lots of retro touches. If you like the woods, love style, appreciate an expert decorator's touch and just want a cozy but roomy getaway, this is the place! We absolutely loved our four night stay! Carol is an excellent host."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Blueberry Farm! Everything was so clean and Mrs. Carol is the best host! We absolutely enjoyed every moment there! We will definitely be back!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mother and I recently stayed at this lovely little cottage home. Carol’s Airbnb was more than just inviting, it was beautiful, thoughtful, cozy and serene. Carol’s attention to detail is superb! When we first walked in we were greeted with a card, flowers and a lovely mini birthday cake for my mother (we were celebrating her bday) How thoughtful was that?! We were also greeted with a lovely scrabble message saying, “Welcome Our Names” and yummy chocolates. It’s the little things that really make you feel special. It truly felt like we stepped back in time in this cozy cottage. The fireplace was definitely my favorite part about the home. It was so perfect and cozy for those cold Georgia mornings. The cottage is in a great location and was only 25 mins from Helen and close to other surrounding cities such as Dahlonega. We had a blast! I would highly recommend this beautiful home to anyone in the area! I can’t wait to come back and stay again! 10/10! Thanks again for such a lovely stay Carol!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it ! We spent four nights there and everything was perfect. From the check-in to the check-out.
The house was away from the town, with a beautiful view of the forest. It was really close to several state parks.
It was really clean and smelled awesome. Carol was really kind and thoughtful, she even left a welcome letter for us.
I recommend it 100%."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely fantastic. If you’re looking for a cute little spot with an old time touch then you found the right spot.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hotel luxuries with all the comforts of home!
We had a wonderful stay at Carol’s place. She went above and beyond to provide little luxuries: there were cookies, chocolates, fresh flowers; a bottle of local wine; a spa bath robe and slippers; eye masks and ear plugs; wash cloths, makeup-removing towels, facial cleansing wipes, miniature toiletries; coffee; and more.
She thought of everything we could possibly need - from necessities like trash bags, cleaning supplies, and a laundry hamper (+iron & ironing board) right down to instructions for every single appliance. There were even personal touches, like a welcome message spelled out on the scrabble board.
House was sparkling clean and smelled wonderful. Communication was great, too!
If, like me, you like the idea of a cozy fire but not the hassle of lighting one, you should know the fireplace is gas/electric; turns on and off at the touch of a button; and features a timer so it will automatically shut off after 30, 60, or 120 minutes. LOVED the fireplace. I mention this because it’s a nice feature we didn’t think we’d use, and ended up using daily.
Not one single complaint or even suggestion. The house is quite close to the road; HOWEVER, ear plugs were provided and helped tremendously with road noise (which was intermittent, not constant), and, come on, where the house/road is isn’t in the host’s control.
The vintage appliances are adorable and the claw foot tub is to die for.
All in all, highly recommend this place. It’s an adorable house offered by someone who clearly takes great joy in hosting."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a quiet getaway and this little cottage was PERFECT to recharge. You can tell there is a lot of care that is put into this location and I enjoyed all the thoughtful touches within the stay including the personalized scrabble board, the Alexa message upon checkin, and baked cookies.
The place was very clean and the surroundings serene. I will surely be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My 2nd visit to the quaint and quirky cottage was as remarkable as the 1st. Ultimate cleanliness and attention to detail. Lisa is an amazing host. The description provided is spot on. you won't be disappointed!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don't waste your time looking elsewhere! If the cottage is available, book it and get ready for a great experience! The cottage is great as is, but all the little extra details and touches that Lisa includes makes it a truly amazing stay.
Highly recommend and will book again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything about the stay was sheer perfection. Lisa was so helpful and kind and there wasn’t anything missed. She had a playlist with my favorite music ready at my arrival and was always at the ready with tips - even letting me know when the cattle were in the field near the home to catch a glimpse. I can’t wait to return for more peaceful retreats from the daily grind.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are debating on whether to come here... Stop thinking and just do it! Lisa was wonderful, friendly, and informative about the area. She thought of EVERYTHING. From the time you walk in until you leave, you feel special. The homemade cookies, the welcoming scrabble board, down to the greeting as you say Abracadabra, this cottage was fantastic. We want to make it one of our yearly escapes. We added the homemade biscuits and smores options and so glad we did. Yall... those biscuits...... so yummy, and she brings them hot and fresh! The detail and thought that has gone into this property is amazing. We didn't have time to visit Teapot and other animals, but we can't wait to come back and do that! If you're on the fence, BOOK IT! We are going to try the Chandelier Farmhouse next. Thank you, Ms. Lisa, for a wonderful experience at Chandelier Cottage. My husband and I enjoyed having some us time, playing board games, and seeing some of the various things around."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is what we needed I just had my cancer treatment The week before, and Blue’s was good for my soul no noise just peace and quiet close to Helen A beautiful place to visit.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time here! Everything was as pictured! Private with things nearby or within 15 minutes. Lisa had left many brochures with things to do! Lisa had made sure to make us feel at home!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely time staying at the cottage! Everything was pristine and the personal touches made us feel right at home.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved the Chandelier Cottage. Lisa was an amazing host. Her cottage was so beautiful. I was truly blown away when we walked through the door. Homemade cookies, farm fresh eggs, sparkling water and freshly picked flowers were waiting for us when we arrived. My favorite part of this whole cottage experience was the rain on the metal roof, it was so peaceful. It was an unforgettable weekend and I can’t wait to go back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really don’t even know where to begin. This trip wouldn’t have been possible without Lisa taking the time to talk about the properties with me to help surprise my husband for our anniversary. We have traveled quite a bit, stayed at many Airbnb’s and let me tell you THIS WAS THE BEST ONE YET!!! The property is beautiful, minutes away from several neighboring towns, lots of fun, and just peace. It brought tears to our eyes to have to leave and have already had multiple conversations about going back! Lisa is a FANTASTIC host and we thoroughly enjoyed meeting her and getting to know her a bit. So don’t even question this place, BOOK IT!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was even more beautiful in person. The personalized Scrabble board and homemade cookies were a sweet touch.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Oh so much to say! But Lisa is an amazing host and so thoughtful. The cottage was stunning and perfect! We are already planning another visit! This is not just a place to stay but an experience!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa is a wonderful host. She has painstakingly arranged every detail of the home for your comfort, luxury, & intimacy. We visited her farm house last year for our wedding anniversary and enjoyed it so much we booked the cottage stay this year. Both accommodations are wonderful. book it! You won't regret it. The homes look exactly like the photos... but smell and feel even better!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There are not enough words to truly describe the magic of staying at The Chandelier Cottage. Lisa is goes above and beyond to create not only a space where you can relax and unwind, but makes the entire stay a complete experience in itself. From the sweet, personalized message upon entering to the garden fresh flowers throughout the cottage to the line dried and ironed bedding, she makes sure your experiences is top notch and memorable. Lisa was very helpful in giving recommendations for the area and even included a self created guidebook of the surrounding area.
The cottage itself was perfect for two and decorated beautifully. We felt at home immediately! Don’t second guess yourself and just book it! We waited too long to finally go for it and it was worth every penny.
Thank you Lisa for such a wonderful time in your beautiful cottage - it was just what the soul needed!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nothing short of amazing! If you are on the fence, DO IT! It is a slice of heaven on earth. Every single thing was perfect, including Lisa! It replenishes the soul."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I wanted to have a peaceful weekend close to home but far enough to call it a getaway. We had such a wonderful time, loved the personal touches, met some super beautiful farm animals and truly enjoyed our stay. It was so nice to unplug, sit on the sofa, nap and have a restful weekend. We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa is absolutely amazing and makes every guest feel like family. Her cottage is immaculate and even the smallest details are taken care of. You certainly know when you leave that you have stayed somewhere very special. I am in love with Chandelier Cottage and I know you will be also! 💗
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa was by far the best host we have every had. She communicated well, was available if we needed anything, and added so many personal touches to our stay. The cottage is full of so much history and Lisa has put her heart into making your stay the best! The bed was so comfortable (ironed sheets) , the bathtub was so relaxing, and she had all of the extra amenities we needed. We enjoyed flipping through the albums and playing them on the record player. The farm fresh eggs and homemade peanut butter cookies were delicious and a surprise!! We dod not have one complaint about our stay!! Do not hesitate to book this cottage especially if you like farmhouses! We wish we would have booked a feeding with Teapot the cow!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect! Rustic house decorated in an elegant way. The description was accurate with impeccable attention to detail, which made for a romantic weekend getaway. Property was very clean, quiet and had everything we could possibly need. Bed was very comfortable. Host was personable, helpful and super friendly. Host is also close enough to handle any issue yet distant enough to have more than enough privacy. We enjoyed the outdoor two person tub and fire pit. Highly recommended."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa is an exquisite host whose attention to detail and love of her farm makes a guest feel pampered and yet at home too.
The unique antiques and cozy atmosphere of Chandelier Cottage makes this a place you want to visit again. I've already booked my next stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa's cottage was absolutely perfect in every way. It was the best little get away my husband and I needed!!!! We will definitely be back!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second Time staying here. It was as great as the first time. Love the Chandler Cottage!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding, responsive, and gracious host. You can’t go wrong staying here - the property is a gem and a great place to get away from it all."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time my wife and I stayed here and it was just as good the second time around as the first. This is a great cozy and romantic space for a couple. We stay at a lot of vacation rentals and this one, by far, is the most charming one we have ever been to. This is not your typical log cabin in the woods. This place is truly unique.
Great location near shopping, restaurants, etc. but far enough away where its not a nuisance. Located in a tucked away corner of a farm, you are 100% secluded and completely private.
Lisa (the host) is AMAZING! We stayed the week of the ""Big Freeze of DEC 2022"". She alerted us on our arrival date of some issues she was having due to the cold. She busted her tail off getting the place ready. She was in constant communication about the issues and never left any doubt things would be taken care of. The cookies and farm fresh eggs were a bonus!
We would 100% recommend this place to anyone."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charming cottage with extreme attention to detail. Homemade peanut butter cookies and farm fresh eggs added a personal touch. Everything about the place is first class. Close to so many amazing places. We especially loved Lake Rabun restaurant. Our mission was waterfalls and the area delivers. Had a blast and so enjoyed being away from our stressful lives!! You will not regret booking this beautiful cottage. We have booked all over the world and I think this was my favorite so far. It was truly amazing and worth every dime. Thank you Lisa♥️
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cottage! Everything was perfect and relaxing and just what we needed for my 21st birthday weekend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Chandelier Cottage was truly amazing! From the moment we walked in the door Alexa welcomed us with a personalized greeting, our favorite music was playing, the temperature was set to our liking, farm fresh eggs and sparkling waters were in the fridge, fresh flowers were all throughout the cottage and homemade peanut butter cookies were in the kitchen!
Our Airbnb host, Lisa, went above and beyond to make our stay an enjoyable one. The cottage is perfectly decorated with curated vintage decor, the bed linens are sun dried and immaculately pressed and everything you want or need is right there at your fingertips. Lisa checked in on us several times throughout our stay and even recommended local dining options.
If you are looking for a quaint little getaway to relax and unwind, Chandelier Cottage is it! The claw foot bathtubs both inside and outside the cottage allow you to soak the stress away!
And don’t forget the meet and greet with Lisa’s adorable cow, Teapot, who loves when you feed her Sunbeam bread! A perfect ending to our already amazing stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is a beautiful place to relax and escape for awhile. Lisa’s attention to detail is unmatched, and she put so much care into making this a special anniversary for my wife and me. We loved the vintage feel of the cottage and really enjoyed sitting by the fire pit at night. We hope to be back soon."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Out of all of my traveling experiences, this was my best one ever. I have never stayed in a more perfect & thoughtful home. Every detail was nailed to perfection. Communication was impeccable. The Airbnb check in with the Alexa was so thoughtful, along with the farm fresh eggs, homemade cookies, & sparkling water. You have an eye for detail and it shows. I will most definitely be coming back❤️ thank you for making my sisters birthday trip so special"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Relaxation. Rain on the tin roof. Oldies on the record player. Central location. High end hotel amenities. Fast WiFi and streaming. Privacy. Great price. Amazing host. Don’t hesitate to boom this hidden gem !!!!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was so remote, peaceful and a wonderful place to get away from the hustle and bustle. Lisa thought of everything."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our second visit. Lisa is a wonderful host. The cottage is beautifully furnished and immaculately clean. Chandelier Cottage provides a perfect retreat and we look forward to returning again soon.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Do yourself a favor- and book this wonderful place!! Loved everything about it! Lisa is the best hostess I have ever seen! The details are amazing. We will be back!
Sheila B."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stop scrolling & book this now!!!
The attention to detail by Lisa is like no other. She has truly thought of everything.
Had the best weekend in this beautiful cottage💗"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa was so intentional about making a stay in the cottage a comfortable and relaxing experience! The cottage itself is beautiful, as is the farm, but it was all of the little details and personal touches that make this a must stay! Highly recommend to everyone!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A little piece of heaven! From the personal welcome note to the homemade cookies to the outdoor tub, The Chandelier Cottage at Green Hill Farm was the perfect break from reality. Lisa attended to our every need and made our stay just what the doctor ordered."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A take back in time with all of the modern necessities. Quiet and restful! Close to fun things including the town of Helen. You will sleep very well. I am coming back for sure. ❤️
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We almost don't want to leave a review so we can keep this place a secret. If you discovered this home, then book it now and read the reviews afterwards - you don't want to wait and miss this experience. The host is by far the best in the industry, and she way over delivered more than necessary. Every little detail shows her commitment to excellence and she's willing to open up this home to strangers like us. She has such a huge heart that she went far beyond any expectation or previous stays we've joined in our many travels. This little gem is absolutely perfect. When first stepping in the door, my wife was left speechless and finally mustered ""its magical"". The only regret is we wish we stayed longer. We rarely stay at the same place twice, but this one is a keeper and we're looking forward to making this a recurring get away each year.
The farm is centrally located to many great towns, vineyards, outdoor adventure, antique shopping, great local food, and more. Recommend making dinner reservations well before your arrival at The Attic and Community Brew. You'll want to stay the week to truly unplug and enjoy all the options in the area. Did you book it yet?"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa goes above and beyond for her guests. Fresh flowers, fresh eggs, all from her own property and even freshly baked cookies! I could go on and on about how cute the cottage is but I’ll just say it’s a very unique place. Every single piece of furniture is well thought out and charming. Lisa has thought of everything you could need. The bed was so comfortable! I look forward to returning. Her communication was impeccable and she is a very sweet woman."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa is spot on with every detail she provides for her guest. Love it.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place -
This cottage was the PERFECT weekend getaway for a solo self care trip!! Of course if would also be wonderful for couples as well! Immediately upon walking in I felt so welcome and everything was so personalized for me. It felt like my new home, I was ready to move in! I am a bit behind when it comes to technology but I absolutely loved having Alexa she made the trip much more enjoyable & effortless. Everything in the cottage right down to the dishes, the bathroom knick knacks the decor - it was easy to see it was all so well thought out & set up so beautiful! A lot of time & effort went into making this spectacular place what it is. The tub was just what I needed & the heated toilet seat was a favorite of mine, so cool!
The host -
Lisa was by far the best host I've ever experience on Airbnb. I have taken a lot of trips, even hosted myself as well as co-hosted! I could learn a lot from her. She was so welcoming & no only greeted me upon arriving and departing, but also was fantastic about checked in with me during my stay! I have never had another host who was so attentive. It is usually expected to have someone say let me know if you need anything and be within reach. However, Lisa truly went above and beyond! It was very easy to see she pours her heart into not only making the cottages look beautiful but taking wonderful care of guests. I will absolutely be back for a longer stay & I can't wait!!!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The pics do not do it justice! It is absolutely adorable! Ms. Lisa is AMAZING!!! All the small and perfect touches make it such a great experience! I was blown away by all the thoughtfulness put into it! It far exceeded any expectations I had! Would 100% recommend anyone staying here!!!! Can’t wait to come back again ❤️
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly suggest staying here for a weekend! It was so relaxing and refreshing!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend🤩🤩 The house was beautifully styled and so clean. Our weekend was relaxing and quiet. Definitely visit CeNita vineyards for amazing wine tasting and Old Clarkesville Antique Mall for wonderful finds - 100/10‼️
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was definitely a weekend my husband and I will never forget! We loved everything about the cottage, I wish I could elaborate on all the little touches Lisa has done to make the experience so special but I don’t want give all the surprises away. I really don’t know what my favorite part of our stay was because it was all amazing! It was so fun cooking on the old stove and I loved the claw foot tub. We can not wait to come back!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can't recommend enough! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Looking forward to booking a future trip."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is the kind of space worth creating an excuse for booking. It truly is a special spot. Every square inch is carefully designed and Lisa (the host) has lovingly thought of every way to make each persons stay memorable. From the fresh baked cookies and hand picked lavender, to the romantic, perfect king bed with air dried linens. It’s spectacular, truly. We cannot wait to visit again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,She was amazing and made our stay feel so individualized! All the personal touches made us feel so welcome! Will definitely be coming back
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far one of the best places we’ve ever stayed. Lisa adds personal touches that make your stay special and unique. If you have the opportunity, do not hesitate to book!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is lovely and cozy! Lisa goes above and beyond to add touches to the cottage that make this stay exceptional!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was absolutely perfect! We couldn’t have asked for anything more. We loved relaxing while enjoying the fire pit & the gorgeous bathtub. Amazing for a relaxing weekend!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic getaway for our anniversary. The cottage was outstanding and all of the little touches that Lisa added that makes this such a unique and welcoming place. We enjoyed visiting some of the quaint nearby towns and shopping in the local stores. Lisa is a great host and was available for any question that we had. The communication from the moment we booked was the perfect mix of making us feel welcome/seeing to our needs and allowing us to relax/disconnect from outside distractions. We are already talking about when we might be able to return.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a property that exceeded our expectations.  From the moment we entered the cottage, we felt so welcomed and loved!  Lisa really puts so much into all of the details in this lovely place:  personalized greeting upon opening the front door, peanut butter cookies made fresh and waiting on the stove, line-dried linens, aromatics that will make you feel like you’re in a spa, outdoor tub in which to bathe, and music genre of your choice pre-programmed to play throughout the cottage.  We loved our time here and feel you will, too!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this amazing Airbnb at green and it did not disappoint! The host went above and beyond. Everything was personalized, from the programmed Alexa welcome message, to a homemade dinner warming on the stove upon my arrival. She even left a handwritten thank you note (with a cookie recipe) and personalized the scrabble board for me! I spent the time listening to rain on the tin roof, meditating, practicing yoga, journaling and simply relaxing. Taking the time to focus on just me. I highly recommend everyone take the opportunity to spoil themselves at this charming getaway."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'll start this at the end to save you time... go to the calendar and book this cottage. Dont think, just book. Your expectations will be exceeded not only by the space but also by the host who created it. Both are equally amazing. Someone we plan to stay in touch with for some time. 
Farm/rustic finishes, sun dried linens, nights by the fire, outdoor showers and baths. Take her up on all she has to offer from the sausage biscuits and mimosas to homemade soup and s'mores. But most importantly, make certain to meet Teapot! Till next time Lisa..."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! WOW! WOW! WOW! I do not know if I can clearly communicate how wonderful our stay was. Lisa is a 5-STAR hostess that coordinated with me to make the most memorable and romantic weekend possible. She was able to have a unique set up for us as we walked in the door. She had music playing that we requested, a meat and cheese tray (there is a fancy name for it) that was a making, a personalized message on the scrabble board on the game table, and a movie I requested on DVD loaded and ready.
The furnishings we beautiful, tasteful, welcoming, and very cozy. The linens were so clean and fresh... it reminded me of the times in my childhood when we would line dry our bed clothes. The bathroom area was AMAZING... if we had forgotten anything, it was there for us just in case. Maybe next time we will pack a bit lighter ;-). We enjoyed the shower and we also used the bathtub (plenty of room for 2).
This old farm cottage had so many modern amenities, too many to name. One could jus lay and the comfy sofa and control just about everything. Lisa was kind enough to supply a cheat sheet in every room. Last thing, evidently I need to go shopping for a new toilet seat; you must discover why on your own.
We suggest going Clyde's to eat dinner or Sunday Brunch; it's in Cleveland, GA. We also went to The Attic in Clarksville, GA.
WE WILL BE BACK! A perfect get away for couples!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chandelier Cottage was a wonderful retreat! Every detail was thought of, and Lisa’s personal touches add so much charm and character to the cottage! As a host, you can’t get better than Lisa! We loved it!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed at Lisa’s cottage to celebrate our anniversary. Our expectations were exceeded. The cottage was charming and very clean. Lisa is the very best! She went above and beyond to make us feel special. She made sure we had everything we needed. We will go back and I highly recommend the cottage!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect, special, quiet, relaxing are some of the words I would use to describe the Chandelier Cottage. We stayed 2 nights and wanted to stay more. Lisa made everything about our stay special. We will visit again on our next special occasion."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa everything was absolutely perfect!! We will definitely be back soon!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have been coming here for 3 years now, and Lisa never disappoints. She always makes sure your stay is special and spectacular. I am always so excited to stay here! Can’t wait til next time!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! Lisa is a true pleasure. Everything was so clean, cute, and my wife just loved it. Great place for relaxation in nature and I can not express enough how wonderful Lisa is. If a couple needs a get away this is it! PERFECT place my wife and I had a wonderful experience. Best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. 5star stay, no doubt."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect place to stay if you are coming to the area. We are Airbnb hosts ourselves and we know a good experience when we have it! Lisa is truly the perfect host and her cottage is THE perfect place to stay. Do NOT miss this spot.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was the perfect place to escape the world! Every detail was perfect and cozy! Lisa was very kind and made me feel special and welcome! I will definitely come back to visit!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The absolute best! Everything about this cottage and all of the special touches Lisa does to make each guest feel special and so thoughtful and amazing. My husband and I have already discussed going back again. We have already referred the cottage to our friends and families, and we just left the cottage today…thats how great and perfect it is."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW this place is fabulous. Lisa has put so much love and attention into this little cottage, you can't help but fall in love with it. The smallest details make this place a magical getaway. Thank you so much for opening your cottage so others can slip away to the dreamland you so graciously provide. So many surprises everywhere you turn. You must stay with Lisa if you ever get the chance, you will NOT regret it."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I booked a trip here because we needed some peace and quiet after several stressful weeks. Lisa did not disappoint!
As soon as we walked in, I started feeling so much better. There was music playing and homemade peanut butter cookies. The place is absolutely beautiful with many interesting pieces (I had to ask Lisa where she bought a few of them and ended up finding some similar items while antiquing). The decor is just phenomenal! I took several candlelit baths in the claw foot tub while listening to music in the background.
The line-dried and ironed sheets reminded me of staying over at my grandmother’s, and my husband and I slept really well.
Lisa was very quick to respond to any questions, and I could tell she wanted everything to be perfect (it was!)"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our time at Lisa's cottage!! Her attention to detail and her hospitality is something that's truly hard to find these days. We hope to make this an annual trip!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Cottage is the most amazing place ever for a get away, off the grid, just to relax and forget the world. A true escape from reality. Lisa is the most amazing host and goes above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect. You’ll fall in love from the first moments you arrive."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to unplug and relax. Secluded from town and perfectly safe to enjoy the facilities provided by the amazing host. You will not want to leave and will definitely be back.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is outstanding in every way. This unique, immaculately clean property provided everything we were looking for in a vacation rental. The host, Lisa, is exceptional. She is very welcoming and responsive."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is EVERYTHING! After a very tumultuous year for us personally, we needed a quiet place to escape and reset. We entered the home to music playing, fresh baked cookies, and personal notes placed throughout the home. Lisa literally thought of everything. Crisp sun-dried sheets, the lovely scent of rosemary throughout the home, a seated toilet seat, games to play and books to read. It truly was an escape from reality. The cottage was pristine, cozy, and just a delight to stay in!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit to Lisa’s beautiful cottage, and it was every bit as perfect as it was the first time. We arrived to chilled wine and fresh cookies (and had pre-ordered some AMAZING homemade biscuits with sausage!). Alexa had a personalized greeting for us, and there were other personal touches throughout the space. After three days of relaxing in the outdoor tub, sitting in front of the fire pit, and taking in the beautiful scenery, we didn’t want to come home! I can’t recommend this place enough~"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is a wonderful getaway. Lisa has thought of everything to make your stay unforgettable. I will definitely be back!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's Chandelier Cottage is everything. I took a 3 day mommy-cation at this property for a much needed respite after a year at home with the kids. Lisa made sure her cottage had everything I needed to relax. I was able to cook most of my meals on the gorgeous stove. I slept soundly in the comfortable bed (complete with sun dried and pressed linens). I did my morning yoga practice comfortably on the screened-in porch. I showered multiple times a day in the outdoor shower, and soaked in a claw foot tub every night before bed.
I enjoyed two vip packages: The bath bombs and soap were the perfect accompaniment to the tubs, and the firepit with s'mores was amazing. Lisa builds a beautiful fire and supplies an impressive s'mores spread. Yum!
I took a few excursions to local wineries based on Lisa's recommendation: Sweet Acres and Curahee. I also attended the Helen hot air balloon race, and as Lisa stated, it was mesmerizing.
You can't go wrong with this property and Lisa will do her best to make sure your stay is absolute perfection.
I can't wait to go back!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved every minute of our time at Chandlier Cottage! It was an exceptional experience and Lisa does so many special things to make your trip unforgettable. Everything was immaculate. Lisa is an outstanding host and her attention to detail is unmatched. We especially loved the homemade cookies, music, outdoor tub and shower, the sun dried pressed bed linens, the personalized notes and flowers. We enjoyed the option to add additional things such as wine and charcuterie board, s’mores and campfire, homemade biscuits with sausage, and mimosas each morning. The cottage is pristinely kept. Every little detail has been thought of and is so well put together. My most favorite part of the trip was meeting Lisa. She was like meeting an old friend for the first time. We will definitely be back again! Thankful for such a wonderful experience to celebrate our 19th Wedding Anniversary."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is awesome
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique & awesome place! We felt like we took a step back in time (brought back sweet memories of our grandparents/great grandparents & visits to their farms) while mixed with the perks of ""Alexa""! Lisa has thought of so many details . . . everytime you turn around there is an awww moment! It would be impossible to pick one favorite thing about the cottage . . . the fresh smell & feeling of sun dried linens, the romantic outdoor shower & tub, the delicious homemade peanut butter cookies, farm fresh eggs, sweet personalized messages, Lisa's desire to make sure we had everything we needed and so much more! Our only regret is that we had not planned for a longer stay! But we will be back!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being hosted by Lisa was an absolute delight! She was attentive, informative, and thoughtful--all of our needs were met and exceeded (fresh batch of peanut butter cookies awaiting us??) before we even arrived.
The cottage was charming and picturesquely situated at the foot of a sloping hill between the main house and a lovely wooded area. It was thoroughly appointed, with even the smallest details thoughtfully considered. Most delightful were the unexpected luxuries of antique silver, crisp, sun-dried linens, and farm fresh eggs. Even the sunlight bathing the farmhouse and fields seemed to have a magical quality that is hard to describe.
The cottage was immaculately clean while staying true to its rustic character. If there was a speck of dust or smudge to be found, we certainly could not find it!
Lisa's cottage was the perfect launchpad to explore the area, and a sumptuous respite after a strenuous hike in Tallulah Gorge. The weekend was just the treat we needed, and we would love to be hosted by Lisa (and Alexa and Teapot) again soon!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa has such an Amazing/ Incredible Place To Visit. From The Sun Dried Pressed Sheets That Make Your Night’s Sleep in the Most Comfortable Bed Ever!! The Clawfoot Tubs Yes!! Indoor and Outdoor!! Pictures Don’t Do This Place Justice and Lisa is The Best Host Ever!! Best Airbnb I have ever stayed at. I will be back.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about the stay was perfect! There were so many thoughtful details - the personalized music that was playing upon arrival, the message on the scrabble board, the handwritten card, the peanut butter cookies that were still warm... I could go on and on. The outdoor shower was a unique experience and very enjoyable, probably my favorite part of the stay. And the location was very convenient to hiking and restaurants. I hope the cottage will be available again when I plan another trip to North Georgia."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have been anticipating writing this review since I walked into the door of this perfect little cottage, and even still I am having a hard time finding the words to use.
Every single thing about this slice of heaven is pure perfection.
It's not just a place to stay, it's a whole mood.
Lisa's attention to detail makes you feel welcomed and comfortable from the very beginning. Beautiful decor, great amenities, communication, and location.
I was impressed with this being a ""smart cottage"" and enjoyed having the speakers to play anything we liked.
I thought the outdoor bath would be the highlight of this place, and as far as the home it was. But what turned out to be the best was the hosts hospitality and the little surprises around every corner.
You won't want to leave to see the sights (especially if you're lucky enough that's its raining on the tin roof!) BUT if you do venture out, definitely go to Sweet Breads for brunch, and Ruen Thai for takeout!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A charmingly, quirky place to stay indeed! And beautiful, cozy, romantic, private, and thoughtful. Lisa was such a wonderful host even before we checked in. Very easy to communicate with and very responsive. From having our favorite music playing when we walked in, the personalized greeting from Alexa, the handwritten birthday card, to the homemade cookies and farm fresh eggs (literally laid that morning), she considered every detail and made us feel like royalty from the start. The cottage is gorgeous and very comfortable and the bath and kitchen are stocked with everything you might need. One of the selling points for me was the outdoor bath and shower, which made our stay over the top! I had concerns about how secluded the cottage would be and how much privacy we would have, but not to worry! The outdoor tub and shower face acres and acres of woods and though the main house is up on the hill on the other side of the cottage, there's very limited visibility to the cottage below as was confirmed on our tour of Lisa's home.
This was a surprise trip to celebrate my husband's birthday and Lisa helped make it even more special with a meet 'n greet with Teapot, her chickens, and a tour of her private home. Thank you, Lisa, for sharing your cottage with us and for the way you care for your guests. We can't wait to come back!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There aren't enough words to express how much we enjoyed this cottage and Lisa; but here are a few:
Lisa is a fantastic host who has truly put herself into everything you see at this cottage. She truly cares about making sure you have what you need. We loved playing games, the clawfoot tub inside the cottage (didn't get a chance to try the outdoor one but will next time), loved how the cottage encouraged intimacy on so many levels as well as meeting teacup, her precious cow and getting to feed her. The only negative was leaving to continue our travels.... wish we could have stayed longer. This is THE best airbnb we've started in so far and will definitely return! Thank you Lisa for everything!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at Lisa’s place. She was so welcoming and she is an excellent communicator - if you reach out about anything, she responds instantly. The space itself is super clean and so cozy. The bed is so comfortable and the shower is amazing. Highly recommended!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I have stayed at a few Airbnb‘s but never someplace with the level of service that Lisa provides. I literally felt like I was staying in a friends guest house who just wanted to make my stay as comfortable as possible. There were fresh flowers, homemade cookies, books, games, toiletries, etc to make you feel right at home. She offered lots of tips on places to go and things to see and every suggestion she made was spot on. The location of the cottage is also perfect with the majority of places we visited no more than 20 to 30 minutes away. We did not want to leave and cannot wait to come back and visit again! This cottage is a gem and Lisa is the true definition of a super host!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing space. Lisa has put so many amazing touches all over this Airbnb and it shows! The place is immaculate and we enjoyed our weekend away immensely. highly recommend
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I came to Chandelier Cottage to have a private retreat and wanted space, comfort, and freedom from busyness and distractions. I got that and a whole lot more! Fresh baked cookies, flowers in every room, fresh eggs from her chickens, my preferred music on arrival and freshly ironed sheets. I have never experienced this type of hospitality especially from an air bnb! I will be back and I’m telling everyone I know to book a stay!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we walked in, we knew we were in for a very special stay at Chandelier Cottage. Lisa took time to add really nice touches that made us feel spoiled and pampered. She had fresh cut flowers in every room, homemade cookies waiting for us, our favorite music softly playing when arrived, and little personalized notes and welcome messages.
The cottage is absolutely beautiful inside and out. The chandeliers are gorgeous, and her decorating style creates an atmosphere that is inviting and comfortable. Lisa made herself available to us, and made sure we had everything we needed.
We will definitely be back - we had a wonderful time."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am having a hard time formulating this review because truly nothing was left undone. I have never personally seen such acute attention to detail. When I say there is nothing missing I mean it. Lisa's place is the nicest Airbnb experience I have ever had (and I almost always choose Airbnb over hotels and love my stays). This little cottage is magical. I took the best bath I've ever had outside in the clawfoot tub with rain coming down and crisp country air! Lisa ironed our sheets! What!! I don't think I have ever had my sheets ironed personally. The toilet seat is heated! The linens are such fine quality. The cottage has something to look at in every corner.. you can't help but fall in love. And Lisa herself is such an incredible down to earth and fun host. She makes you feel like you are her 1st guest ever.
I am so completely impressed at each and every detail Lisa puts into your stay. I feel completely refreshed after being here. I felt utterly pampered.There is a little bit of magic as you step into this little cottage. I didn't want to leave."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little getaway!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful cottage!! This was everything we were expecting and more! Such a cute cottage and Lisa’s hospitality is second to none!! Will definitely be returning!!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best airbnbs I have ever stayed at. Lisa is so communicative and has countless incredibly personal touches all around the cottage. She even brought us red velvet and peanut butter cookies which were delicious! The cottage is adorable, warm, beautifully decorated, and very romantic. I can't recommend enough. We will definitely be back. Lisa goes above and beyond in every way."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When I say Lisa's place was a breath of fresh air, I mean it in every way possible. It was beautiful, clean, the little details were so thoughtful, Lisa was so responsive and so caring, and the peace was rejuvenating. I took a weekend retreat from ""being a working mom in 2020 to 4 kiddos doing digital learning"". Lisa's place was perfect for a mom to ""do nothing"" for a bit. The cottage was elegantly decorated in a chic country style with white walls, brilliant chandeliers, antique mirrors, vintage appliances, and crystal glassware. The bedsheets were ironed-- I've never slept on ironed bedsheets-- the feeling is amazing. Lisa prepared her VIP touches: mimosas and a wonderful creamy wild rice soup-- it warmed me from the inside out. I teared up at her farm fresh eggs, the peanut butter cookies, her personal welcoming note and the fact that she had music playing for me when I walked through the door.
I spent my hours looking at the exquisite decor in her cottage, listening to jazz and easy music through the Alexa play list, reading on the couch and soaking in the clawfoot bathtub. Though the weekend was rainy, it was perfect to slow down and regather my spirit.
Lisa even provides slippers to walk around! Her home is so different from any other place I've stayed in-- truly belongs in a magazine. I intend to stay again-- and have already recommended her place to three of my friends who were in awe of the pictures I brought back. Lisa's place is my new favorite hideout from the world!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to slow down and escape from everyday life! Lisa is an amazing hostess. Her attention to detail and personalized touches made our stay truly special. We can’t wait to go back!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m not often for a loss of words, but this little three room cottage and all of love Lisa puts into her guests experience leaves me with a lack of words to do the cottage and our stay justice. There’s not one single thing I’d change about our time, with the exception of making it last much longer!
My husband and I had so much heavy that needed a soft place to land and Lisa provided that in the most thoughtful ways. Walking into the cottage is quite literally a calming exercise for all five senses and Lisa gives to everyone what she knows is needed by all; respite, the feeling of being seen and known and so thoughtfully and intentionally cared for. It’s the most beautiful little retreat and we can not wait to come back again and again.
Stop looking and book your stay now. I’ve been many places all over the world and not a single one compared to the attention to detail and warmth of this air b and b. Lisa is one in a million, in a million little ways! The cottage is a treat, but the experience Lisa curates is a treasure."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great shabby chic getaway. Great attention to detail and amazing hostess.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The rain on the tin roof was so relaxing. We loved seeing the cows go to pasture. Also loved the crazy amount of real silver all over the cabin. Lisa was an amazing host. She made sure we had everything we needed and that we felt at home. The cabin was so clean and smelt amazing when we walked in. We will be coming back!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely do not hesitate to book at the Chandelier Cottage! It was seriously the best Airbnb my husband and I have ever stayed at - from the thoughtful welcome of Alexa breaking down all the need to know info and the homemade PB cookies (of which Lisa gives you the recipe for to take home with you!) to the beautiful space, thoughtful amenities like bath supplies and robes, to the meeting of Teapot the famous cow - everything was just perfect and magical! Lisa was such a delight she even invited us into her home and gave us a tour of that as well and had lots of great recommendations for sights to see and foods to eat! We were truly so impressed by her hospitality, her responsiveness, and just the true beauty that is the cottage and the farm. We had a lovely time as well in Helen, Clayton, and hiking Tallulah- all of it was just the perfect post-Christmas get-away and I can honestly say we would go back in a Heartbeat! Book now! You won’t regret it!!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent Christmas weekend at the cabin. It was the perfect getaway since we couldn't be with family this year due to COVID. Lisa is simply the best host I have ever experienced. The communication before and during the stay was exceptional. She truly thought of everything anyone could not only need, but every part of the cabin had such special touches. From the moment you walk in to a special personalized message, to the homemade cookies, then to the freshly ironed sheets on the bed! The list goes on and on! If you are looking for a quiet, magical get away The Quirky Chandelier Cottage is exactly what you want!! So very special!!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Run, don't walk, to book this amazing cottage! The pictures and descriptions truly don't do it justice. The Chandelier Cottage is imperfectly perfect. It is a charming place full of character. The hostess, Lisa, thinks of every little detail to make your stay better. I have only wonderful things to say about our stay here.
The cleanliness is superior to most other places and I am overly critical of this detail. Lisa's genuine caring nature and warm hospitality was icing on the cake. We will definitely return for another visit and we highly recommend this beautiful cottage to anyone looking for a quirky, cool spot to relax. You won't regret booking the Chandelier Cottage."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. I was happily suprised by the fact the toilet seat was heated!! the bed was so pretty and the fresh cookies where great.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful and unique place to stay. This cottage was gorgeous and was in great proximity to Helen and dahlonega. We enjoyed the outside fireplace and how cozy and relaxing the cottage was. We can’t wait to return.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed this cottage so much. It was just what we needed. So many nice details and thoughtful touches that makes your stay unique and personalized. Great location, we explored so much and the cottage was a great place for us to come back and unwind. I would highly recommend this cottage and we would love to come back again!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,More than we expected from Lisa and her cottage! It is really an amazing cottage! You will want to stay here for sure and the best part if closeness to a lot of areas to visit and great restaurants around the driving area. Lots of neat touches in the cottage that wow you! My wife was super excited about our stay.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy little cottage was such a treat for my husband’s and my first anniversary. The location was perfectly located 15-20 minutes from every attraction we wanted to visit, and Lisa made sure to provide brochures and travel guides for the surrounding areas should we have needed ideas on where to visit. From the fun welcome by Alexa to the handwritten note, homemade peanut butter cookies, and personalized Scrabble message, Lisa made certain we felt welcome at the cottage. We spent our time sipping coffee and tea, listening to old records, playing board games, cuddling up next to the fireplace, and taking baths in the beautiful claw foot tub. Lisa was very responsive, and we felt so spoiled with the lovely decor, luxury robes, heated toilet seat (which was amazing itself), bath salts, and Alexa. If you’re on the fence about booking, take each of these reviews to heart. They speak for themselves! We’ll definitely be back for a visit!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to do nothing. Beautifully decorated cottage with all modern amenities. All the small touches Lisa (and Alexa)provided made everything even better. Don’t forget to sit out at night and stargaze. We were lucky to have a dark night and it was a hell of a view.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfection! The cottage is adorable and well-equipped for a lovely weekend away. It is a perfect place for a romantic getaway. Lisa was so kind and thoughtful in all of her communications and special touches she provided upon arrival. From the handwritten welcome note, to the homemade peanut butter cookies, and more you will not be disappointed during your stay. We will most definitely be returning!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay in the cottage exceeded all expectations! The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. This is a unique experience that you won’t find anywhere else! I would definitely recommend this to any one looking for a great getaway!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is THE Airbnb of all Airbnbs! We travel internationally and have stayed on some cool spots; however, Lisa’s was a notch above all! Excellent across the board and the cookies are to die for! We cannot wait to come back!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,There aren’t enough stars to rate this experience and cottage! It was beyond beautiful! Smelled wonderful! And in the perfect location! The host is so kind and accommodating! The experience was personalized and had fresh cookies waiting on arrival! I cannot recommend this place enough!!!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really can't say enough about this cottage. Lisa added so many personal touches that made you feel instantly at home the moment you walked through the door. We had everything we needed & more during our stay. The cottage was close to all of the spots we wanted to see. Unfortunately, the hurricane took out the power to some of the state parks we wanted to explore, but that didn't take away from the experience ... we still had a great time driving around & enjoying the scenery. I would absolutely recommend this cottage to anyone staying in north Georgia."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All the other glowing reviews for this gorgeous cottage are true. Not only is the space beautiful and immaculately clean, the amenities divine, and the location ideal for enjoying the North Georgia Mountains, but Lisa is truly the Air BnB hostess with the mostest. She went above and beyond to make my retreat dreams come true, and I bet she'll do the same for you. Highly recommended: Take a moonlit outdoor bath followed by candlelit outdoor shower; read the many books and magazines about local waterfalls, pick a couple and go hiking; enjoy coffee and homemade peanut butter cookies on the front porch with music of your choice playing (compliments of Alexa); pass at least one evening with a fire in the front yard. Perfect size space for singles or couples who want to treat themselves to a mountain getaway with soul and fantastic value!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I booked this place for my parents as a surprise weekend getaway for their anniversary. Lisa was so accommodating and helped me pull off a great surprise! We did the morning breakfast and I heard it was delicious. Lisa also baked some peanut butter cookies as well. My parents said it was the cleanest place they'd been and that the space was decorated cute and welcoming. During their stay the TV stopped working and Lisa came at night in the rain to help fix it. Would definitely recommend and they want to come back!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Quirky Cottage is a gem of a place to stay! The proprietor exceeded our expectations upon arrival. Every detail was in place. The aroma, the music, the cleanliness, the plush towels for indoors and outdoors. Coffee or tea available for the mornings. Plus, Alexa took care of lights, music, wake-up, check in and check out. It's a perfect place for a couple wanting to get away."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa’s chandelier cottage was everything we had hopped for in a place! It was so stylish and very vintage! We loved the two claw foot tubs. The one outsides provides a lot of privacy too! Lisa was very accommodating and sweet. She let us feed her famous cow teapot before we departed for home! The cottage had everything you can ask for as far as amenities. She also has a nice arrange of brochures and tips on where to eat and where to hike! 100% would stay again and 100% would recommend! Also her homemade cookies....perfect!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is wonderful and it is just as she advertises it. Well, better than she advertises it, really. It is truly a mixture of country and modern living....so if that's what you're looking for, stay here! It is private, romantic and comfortable. Ahhhhhh.... :)"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will not regret staying at this adorable little cottage! From the moment we entered the driveway, there was delight after wonderful delight! Lisa made our anniversary get away so special! We entered the cottage to a very special greeting message and homemade peanut butter cookies! We enjoyed the cookies the entire four nights we were there! There were lovely little touches throughout the cottage. Thoughtful things like travel size commonly forgotten toiletries (I forgot my deodorant so it came in handy!) were available to us. As well as coffee, individual creamers, spices, teas, everything we could possibly need! The toilet seat was heated y’all! The outdoor bathtub and shower were so cool and it was so refreshing to bathe outside amongst the trees....There’s a bathtub and shower inside too, for the not so adventurous types! The bed was a king and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on! The linens were crisp and clean, freshly ironed by Lisa. Too many wonderful touches to list them all. It was a five star experience for sure! I highly recommend this Quirky Cottage ❤️"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If AirBNB had 10 stars available, then that’s what this cottage and Lisa would receive! If you’re looking for a cottage that is out of the norm and completely satisfactory in every way possible, then don’t hesitate to book this place right now! The pictures just do not do it justice!! We loved every little touch, and believe me, there are MANY!! One of the most amazing places my wife and I have stayed. We will most definitely be returning for another trip! You won’t find anything else like it. There are so many details to list that it would take me an hour to do, so to save me from that, book this cottage and find out for yourself what a 5 Star experience feels like from start to finish with Lisa @ The Chandelier Cottage!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is as good as it gets. Thoughtfully designed and decorated, the space incorporates both throwback charm and modern conveniences. Lisa is a spectacular host and her personal touches elevate the experience: line-dried and ironed linens, exquisite bath salts, oxidized silver flatware and accessories, soft waffle weave towels and robes, homemade baked goods, fresh flowers from her garden, indoor and outdoor clawfoot tubs, heated toilet seat (!), chandeliers and candelabras galore...the list goes on. I was lucky to run into Lisa as I was leaving and the woman is just as lovely as her handwritten notes. If you're exploring North Georgia, do yourself a favor and stay at one of Lisa's properties."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A spectacular stay with a courteous hostess! Definitely a quaint, quirky stay you won’t find anywhere else. Plus the surrounding area has much to offer!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such an adorable place and perfect for our weekend getaway. The cleanliness and amenities were superb! We loved the little extra “touches” that personalized the experience. We will definitely be back!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa is an excellent host! We loved our week long getaway. She makes the trip memorable and personal! Do yourself a favor and book yours now!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing and so clean. It is so beautiful. You will never want to leave this place!!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful cottage with amazing touches.... home baked cookies, fresh flowers, crisp linens, very private and a gracious host who truly cares about every detail to make your stay extra special and unique"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’d like to say this place was ‘as described’... but it was way beyond that. The pictures do not do the cottage justice. From the stylish 50s style kitchen, to the outdoor shower, this place is incredible and there is thought and passion poured into every element of the property. The owner is also very communicative and detail oriented with her cleaning. The place was spotless when we arrived. We will be back 100%."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Please please please stay here! You won’t regret it! The cottage is adorable. So much attention to detail in every aspect of the Airbnb. The location is great and surrounded by lots of winery’s. We easily drove to 2 different beautiful hiking spots. Went tubing down the river in Helen. So many experiences we won’t soon forget. We had the biscuits for breakfast which were delicious. Meeting teapot was so fun! Very clean and cozy. Bathing outside is my new favorite thing. 10/10 would stay again just wish we lived closer.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted to do something different for my birthday and I happened upon this gorgeous cottage of Lisa’s. She did everything to make sure our stay was unique and comfortable. The decor inside of the cottage was absolutely beautiful and cozy. The outdoor shower and bath were intimate and perfect for a romantic, secluded retreat. Lisa was very attentive, communicative and accommodating. Her hospitality was outstanding. If you have the opportunity to listen to her story on how she started with her Airbnb, you will further appreciate the amount of love she’s poured into her place and the experiences she helps create. Thank you so much for such a memorable weekend! We will definitely be back!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First, a little note about me: I am, what some have said, nearly impossible to please when it comes to accommodations. And it's true, I am an exacting, expectant, extraordinarily picky traveler. So, please, please, please, hear me when I say that I could not find fault with this special, magical, enchanting cottage if I tried. Traveling during COVID makes everything more complicated, but Lisa made it all seem so easy. The space is as good, if not better, than pictured. The attention to detail is astonishing. From the wine chilling on the screened in porch at check in, to the waiting cheese and charcuterie tray and peanut butter cookies, to the homemade marshmallows at the firepit, I just cannot say enough good things. If you forgot it, she's got it. If you get lost, Lisa will tell you where to head for lunch or wine or a waterfall hike, just ask! We also loved asking Alexa to dim the lights and set the mood music . . . for a rousing game of Jenga - also provided! I also love, love, LOVED getting to meet Teapot and the sweet blue eyed goats nearby. Just a splendid getaway nearby to hiking, waterfalls, and wineries. I will recommend this place to all my friends. If you are lucky enough to snag a few nights here, do not hesitate!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancée and I had a much needed getaway and I found this little gem. The photographs can’t even describe how special this little cottage is ! Lisa is an exceptional host and is quick to respond to any questions you may have . She also puts cute little special touches in and outside the cottage and, it smells AMAZING inside !!! Lisa has full instructions on Alexa and how to turn everything on and off. It is a quiet, romantic little spot for a couple’s getaway . Everything you want to do is within a shirt driving distance. We will definitely be back!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is the most unique and truly incredible little place! Everything was immaculate and incredibly clean, she was willing to help out in any way possible, was quick in responses, and had special little touches and surprises throughout the cottage. The outdoor shower and tub are amazing and the soaps provided are very nice with unique scents! It is a “smart cottage” with everything hooked up to Alexa as well which is a nice feature. There are instructions for everything and tons of suggestions for great things to do in the area! Could not rate this Air BnB any higher! We highly recommend staying here and hope to return!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is the perfect get away any time of year. Beautiful space, quiet & cozy, and very clean. Host does an amazing communicating all instructions, is incredibly gracious, and she has not missed a thing as far as set up, including fresh cookies, robes, and ironed sheets!! Loved the outdoor bathtub and shower (don’t worry, there is indoor shower too Emoji). Can’t wait to go back!
Thanks Jenny!

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the amazing place to stay during our vacation. The outside bath and shower were just what we needed at night after a day of hiking to the waterfalls. The cottage was beautiful clean and cozy and we love the Decor. Getting to meet and feed teapot Was the highlight of our trip. Look forward to hopefully seeing you again.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After not being able to see one another for months due to COVID, my fiancé and I were so excited to plan a weekend to just relax. Lisa’s cottage absolutely blew us away!! The thoughtful touches as soon as we walked in the door just meant so much. My fiancé and I use air bnb pretty often, and we’ve never had an experience as personal and sweet as this one. Lisa makes a point to make you feel like you’re in your own personal resort, with everything you need (including homemade cookies!) We loved spending the morning exploring Tallulah Gorge and turning around for afternoon drinks at Tantrum Brewery— Lisa’s cottage was in a very convenient location to do all the things we’d planned to! 10/10 would recommend for a relaxing getaway or staycation!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect place to get away with someone and just enjoy the beautiful space that's been so thoughtfully designed. It's so comfortable that is was hard to want to go out for any reason. Lisa had everything set up perfect for our arrival and communicated ahead of time. We definitely recommend this place and hope to make it back ourselves.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot for a weekend getaway. Lisa’s cottage was very clean and had great little touches. She really thought of everything! We would recommend to others!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa is a wonderful hostess and the cottage is perfect. The space is perfect for a relaxing getaway.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very relaxing 2 nights at The Cottage. So adorable and neat! My favs - the record player, screened in porch, meeting Teapot and the outdoor shower! The place was spotless with extra sanitizing materials available for personal use. Charming, charming interior and super comfortable King bed. Thank you so much for that experience! Highly recommend."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"To say this cottage getaway met our expectations is an understatement! The moment we walked in, we were welcomed by a personalized greeting from Alexa, as well as a cute Scrabble message from our amazing host, Lisa. She had spent her morning ironing our bed sheets, baking peanut butter cookies, arranging flowers from her garden, and adding all kinds of other unique touches to ensure that my husband and I had a five-star experience. And lemme tell you, we did! This cottage is beautifully appointed, stocked with all the amenities you need to spend a weekend doing nothing but relaxing. I can’t imagine anyone NOT falling in love with this place!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t even know where to begin with Lisa’s beautiful cottage. From the moment we pulled in the driveway we were immediately impressed. The home was easy to access and we were greeted by Alexa when we walked in the door and she gave us the weather, told us about the home and gave us tips and hints on how to use her. The little details throughout the cottage were all so thoughtful including homemade cookies, and our names spelled out on the scrabble board... the rest I will leave for you to experience yourself! We found ourselves leaving so refreshed and relaxed and jumping on Amazon to order ourselves a heated toilet seat! We also LOVED the outdoor shower & bath... was so wonderful after hiking Yonah mountain! We will definitely be back for another long weekend and if I could give this 20 stars I would! Beautiful area & home, tons of amenities and extras, great VIP treatments for options upon booking, super clean and comfortable..! Book your getaway here ASAP!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is so beautifully decorated and charming. We arrived to freshly baked cookies and felt very welcomed by Lisa. Meeting Teacup and the chickens was so special. We Loved the cottage and the area so much we didn’t want to leave. We will definitely be back!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you have a chance to stay here, don’t hesitate. You won’t regret it! Lisa’s place is awesome. My girlfriend and I loved everything about our stay here. It’s by far the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at, and Lisa is the best host we’ve encountered. She has thought of everything you could possibly need to have an amazing stay, from kitchen essentials to bathroom amenities (which surpass even some five-star hotels). Also, the place was SPOTLESS, which was really important to us during the pandemic. Lisa does the cleaning herself, and she had gloves and disinfectant waiting for us at the door. We did the fire pit VIP experience, and it was great. We mostly hung out at the cottage, but we did do the short, easy hike to the Duke’s Creek waterfall. I won’t list out all the amazing personal touches that Lisa has in store for you because the surprises are fun, but just know that you’ll enjoy everything about your stay here. The farm is beautiful and peaceful, and you’re in the best hands with Lisa. Our only regret was that we didn’t stay longer. We’ll be back ASAP!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Chandelier Cottage was perfect. My friend and I went for a weekend stay for her birthday and Lisa’s attention to every detail was impressive. From the moment we walked in we were felt welcomed. It was better than any five star hotel. The linens and towels were soft and super clean. There was even a heated toilet seat (one of my favorite things!😉). There’s an outside shower and bathtub that we enjoyed more than the inside one, no kidding! The decor in the entire cottage was amazing. Lisa answered every one of my questions very quickly and always had a kind response. The charcuterie board and wine were tasty and filling, more than you get at any restaurant. We were able to make a fire and even make s’mores, that were delicious! Lisa has thought of every possible situation and she caters your stay! If your looking for a few days away with your significant other, this is your place! But, even with as girlfriend (as I did) our a solo stay to de stress, this place is perfect. I cannot day enough good things about our stay. Thank you so much Lisa once again!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Probably the best getaway I have ever experienced! Lisa and her amazing and quirky chandelier cottage is a magical place where everything is done with such love and she has left no stone unturned.
I was looking for a quiet getaway under two hours from Atlanta and stumbled onto this gem.
Walk into this antique white wonderland and you’ll feel right at home. All you have to do is tell Alexa you’ve arrived and she is ready to welcome you with your favorite music and suggestions. The scrabble board was already set up with a personalized message, homemade cookies were ready and waiting, fresh eggs from her chickens and a hand written thank you note. These were just my discoveries in the first five minutes!
This quaint property is great for a solo getaway or a romantic night or two or ten! The bed was firm and comfortable with fresh sheets that had been line dried in the summer sun and freshly ironed. There is a gorgeous clawfoot tub inside as well as an outdoor tub and shower with complete privacy. The kitchen is fully equipped and I was able to dine on antique china and use beautiful glassware. There is also a nice grill outside.
The house comes with an enormous fire pit and for a small extra fee, firewood and a lighter is all set up for your arrival. Lisa offers lot’s of extras as well which were not expensive considering the care she puts into every detail. S’mores set up, wine and cheese upon arrival, sausage biscuits for breakfast. I ordered everything!
The list goes on! Board games, cards, a real record player complete with several dozen albums and books galore. Basically, I never want to leave, but since I have to return home, I suggest, you book this dreamy place stat!
Oh! I forgot to mention the heated toilet seat!!!!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa’s cottage made for a picturesque vacation with its cozy touches and welcoming atmosphere. We felt so welcomed from the moment we walked in the door until the moment we left. I would recommend this cottage to anyone.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is unbelievable! The level of detail and care is like no other place I’ve stayed in with Airbnb. She’s literally thought of everything. It manages to be incredibly thoughtful, luxurious and so comfortable at the same time. I cannot wait to go back."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As soon as you drive up to the cottage and walk in you feel a calm come over you. This charmingly quirky cottage is so much more than the adjectives that describe it. You have everything you need plus special and thoughtful touches that you didn‘t even know you needed. You are surrounded by impeccable, innovative, and inspiring decor. Lisa is a superb hostess! She is great with communication and makes you feel like a vip guest. We highly recommend this dreamy cottage!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hubs and I needed to get away from the city and life for a couple days. This spot was perfect. Romantic, adorable, clean, and close by to lots of outdoor hiking, waterfalls, etc. Lisa was so quick to respond and took great care of us. Could not have been more perfect! We will definitely be back!!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely little gem of a place! Lisa is a fantastic host. The location inside and out is absolutely charming, and her personal touches make you feel so welcomed. We also loved the great cookie recipe we got out of our stay! Thank you Lisa and Teapot for making our vacation so fantastic!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing weekend! Everything about the cottage was simply wonderful. Lisa was such a gracious host, going above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and more. Beautifully decorated, just a short drive from Atlanta - we’ll definitely be back!!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa goes well out of her way to make your stay special! She had fresh baked cookies waiting on me with a hand written note. 10/10 would recommend this charming staycation!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most beautiful cottage I have ever seen. I love the fact that Lisa herself renovated this cottage. Every piece of furniture has a story! You need to see before and after pictures on Facebook. Homemade cookies were yummy. Lisa has thought of every little detail to make your stay perfect!!! This is our new FAVORITE romantic weekend getaway. I did not want to leave. I give her 20 stars! You will be blown away by this cottage. I encourage everyone to have this experience. Great food, antiques, waterfalls all close by and don't forget the winery's!!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oh my goodness. All I can say is this was perfection in every way and we did not want to leave. I have never stayed in a an Airbnb before that I did not want to leave the house. Lol.
Blown away by the place itself, Lisa’s hospitality and all the touches. Do t even pass this one by. If you are staying anywhere near Helen- don’t make the mistake of renting elsewhere. Truly amazing."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful sleepy cottage! Great small touches like homemade cookies made for a lovely stay. Thank you Lisa!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What can we say? This cottage is the most special place to stay. It has a fully stocked kitchen to prepare meals, and the linens were so wonderful. We had such a special honeymoon, and Alexa was very helpful with the ambiance."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I spent a weekend in Lisa's cottage to get away from our quarantine life in Atlanta. Only an hour away, it was such an easy escape. Lisa's cottage is located on a cattle farm. It is private and l lush with nature. Lisa was an excellent host -- she provided all of the little details that made our stay special. Besides a hike at the gorge 30 minutes away, we never even left the cottage! I would definitely recommend Lisa's place :)"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best place to relax, feel pampered and get away!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an impromptu Birthday celebration weekend for hubby and I. Quickly found this place and knew it was the one. Great communication with host from start to finish. This 'Quirky Place' truly has a touch of both past and present amenities for you to enjoy. For example, cuddle up on the retro swing next to the HUGE fire pit offered outside. There are plenty of other extras for you to enjoy, but I would rather you be surprised!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an amazing trip...very peaceful and relaxing!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had excellent communication with Lisa! I am not a “planner” at all and Lisa assisted me with arrangements to surprise my girlfriend on Valentine’s Day weekend. The cottage was beautifully set up for us. I can tell Lisa put in a lot of thought into this home. My girlfriend loved the cottage, the farm and north Georgia. We were lucky to meet Lisa which was one of main highlights of the weekend too! It was exactly what we needed. I know we will be back here again soon! 5 STARS ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa is an outstanding host and our stay at Chandelier Cottage was absolutely perfect. The cottage is beautifully appointed and so luxuriously comfortable. We can’t wait to return and enjoy another escape from our usual routine into the peaceful beauty of Chandelier Cottage.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was fantastic with heartwarming touches! Will definitely be back again!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We travel very often and have been in very nice places, but Chandelier Cottage has a magical feel, the attention to details, the beautiful decor, Lisa’s personal attention makes it a complete experience, we loved waking up to the sound of birds singing, the Cottage is very private, romantic, like something out of a movie, we’ll definitely come back!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Every minor touch in the cottage was immaculate. From the fire pit outside, to the front porch, to the moment we opened the front door. Lisa had decorated the cottage for Christmas, personalized the scrabble board with a special message for us and had even made us fresh baked peanut butter cookies (which were to die for by the way!). The best part, she even left the recipe on the back of the sweet card she left for us! There was a cute camera sitting with a guest book next to the record player in the bedroom and we enjoyed that small touch as it reflected over the wide variety of people she has shared her little slice of heaven with.
There was a book on the table that had information about the cottage; from connecting to Alexa and controlling the lights, to the Wi-Fi password, to how to control the heat/air, to local places for breakfast/lunch/dinner, boat rentals, etc., she literally thought of everything! Even the bathroom necessities (razor, shaving cream, shampoo, conditioner, etc.,) that one may forget when going on a small trip were provided. We were also shocked by the heated toilet seat. We had never used one before and now Hubby can't wait to install one at home.
The Chandelier Cottage was absolutely wonderful! It was our first experience with Airbnb and we truly cannot wait to go back to the Cottage."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our time in the cottage was intimate and personal with every detail thought of to make this rustic, elegant cottage our home for the weekend. In the chill of winter, the gas fireplace flickering, along with the Christmas tree lights, was the perfect setting to relax and enjoy the romantic music provided by Lisa."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was everything we could’ve expected and then some! Lisa went above and beyond to make us feel special and important. Perfection is hardly the word for it!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place! Lisa has to be to best AirBnB hostess there is. So many amazing touches and personalization, she has thought of everything! The Chandelier Cottage is PERFECT for a quiet or romantic getaway. Extremely well decorated and a perfect blend of rustic charm and modern tech. Beautiful, quiet setting yet close to town. We will definitely be back!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a stylish yet very comfortable cottage set in the middle of a working cow ranch. Lisa is an amazing host and provides special extras to make you feel right at home. Close enough to Helen, Ga without being in all the chaos. Lots of antique shopping throughout the area. Great restaurants nearby with Southern hospitality. Was the perfect place to relax and unwind! Looking forward to a return visit."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovingly furnished with detail and a peaceful retreat. Comfortable and super clean. Wonderful claw foot tub.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You would not be disappointed with booking the Chandelier Cottage for a sweet little get away very clean, quaint and charming cottage."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This may be lengthy but the world needs to know!
We have never visited this area before and when I found this cottage, we went for it based on others reviews!
From the time I hit “reserve”, we had zero regrets! From the start Lisa answered any question I had! The price was so reasonable for what she offers, location and all the extras you would NOT get anywhere else guaranteed!
We arrived and Alexa greeted us with instructions, a welcome message and she even had some fun jokes! Lisa left fresh flowers from the farm, homemade peanut butter cookies (sooo good), let’s not forget the warm heated toilet seat! Umm yesss, this cottage was perfection. The history, the host, the pressed sheets, robes, personalized scrabble message, the little notes around that made you feel like there was nothing she didn’t think of to make you feel special, and you were the only ones in the world ever staying there. We can’t wait to go back, or even stay at her Sunflower Cottage (which she graciously gave us a tour of) as a family!
Look, she pours herself into this to make your experience the best. She should get 10 stars!
Awesome, awesome, awesome!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spending time at this adorable cottage is a unique experience. We had a very relaxing weekend here and is a great getaway! The decor mix of antique/farmhouse with hints of modern technology is very charming and fun. Special touches like soft ironed sheets, bath salts, and homemade cookies are very thoughtful. Lisa is a great host!!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AMAZING! Lisa has thought of every detail from the heated toilet seat to the little coffee pot, snacks, and cozy couch. The atmosphere is filled with so much love you will leave feeling completely spoiled and filled up. A five star experience tucked away in the beautiful north Georgia mountains. The picturesque sunrise, fireplace, outdoor tub and shower with twinkling lights are a few of the details that make this cottage so special and unique! If you are looking for a romantic setting with all the fine details and an experience that will rival any getaway you have ever had, you have found the right place!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and my stay at the Chandelier Cottage in the early part of Nov 2019 has been the best Airbnb experience we’ve had. The pictures on the profile are beautiful but nothing compares to actually being there. The cottage looks and smells amazing! It’s as if you walked into an interior design magazine. It took my breath away!
First, Lisa is a great Airbnb host. She should teach classes on hosting and hospitality because her Airbnb set the bar high. It’s sparkling clean. She irons the bedsheets by hand. She responds quickly to all of our questions. She carefully selected all the furniture and decorations in the house. As a lover of all things vintage and antique, I was ecstatic to be at this cottage that has a working 1920s stove, clawfoot bathtub and oxidized silverware. There is even an outdoor shower and bathtub with a candelabra and chandelier! I really want to live there if I could.
Plus, Lisa has managed to infuse some high tech technology into this vintage-inspired cottage which is really delightful. Mostly everything is voice-controlled through Alexa. There is a good sound system throughout the cottage. Alexa will play all types of music for you and even check you in and out. There is a big flat screen TV, complete with Netflix, so you can still watch your favorite shows.
Like everything else, the bathroom is clean. There is a seat-warmer on the toilet which is a treat. It makes it so comfy to go. There are plenty of toiletries and towels. Lisa thought of everything! The kitchen is fully equipped. There are chocolates, oatmeal, coffee, tea and warm homemade cookies waiting for you when you check in (Yep! Freshly-made cookies!) There is a bbq with a stove outside too. When I say Lisa thought of everything, she really has. There is even Advil, phone chargers for Iphone and Android by the night stand and Vit C packets by the china cabinet. It really blows my mind! She is the definition of detail-oriented!
The location of the cottage is ideal too. It is in the city of Cornelia which is close to Helen, a great place for Octoberfest, but far enough so you can get away from the hustle and bustle of the town. It is in a small farm so you’ll see lots of trees and some cows. If you’re lucky, you might get to pet and feed Teapot, Lisa’s favorite cow under her supervision, of course. There are plenty of activities in the area such as hiking, ziplining and lots of wining and dining. You’ll find something to do for everyone.
With that all that in mind, the cottage is ideal for couples or for a friends’ (girls’ trip or boys’ getaway. Lisa put a lot of work into it. Read her house manual carefully. It is a great place to relax and unwind. I always looked forward to coming home when we were there. I cannot wait to come back!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the most magical place to stay at so to celebrate our wedding. We got married on Green Hills Farm (property) and then stayed here the entire weekend. It was truly magical and we will be back.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa's cottage is a little piece of heaven. The pictures cannot convey how absolutely adorable this place is! Lisa has thought of everything to make your stay as comfortable as possible. She's added all kinds of little touches. You will not be disappointed if you stay here. We had a wonderful time. It's the perfect spot to go out and see all that the GA mountains have to offer. You'll end up wishing you'd booked more time though to just kick back and enjoy the cottage. Seriously. It's that wonderful. 
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Cottage is simply perfect. It’s a great representation of what “Southern Hospitality” is all about. At no time did we say “we’re missing ____”, because it had already been thought of."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage in the country is a real gem!. Lisa has done an incredible job of making this little get-away a little piece of heaven. The cottage is exactly like the pictures but even better!. Lisa is an awesome host and does little extras. Some have written that she has cookies. We were lucky enough to have freshly made sausage and biscuits in our fridge which made our day the next morning. She has all of the amenities!. We may have totally confused Alexa, but she has everything synced with Alexis so you have playlists, lighting control and temperature control all at voice control. Linens are immaculate and beautiful. The cottage is really not set up or equipped for a lot of cooking but who wants to cook on vacation anyway. The basics are there."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was absolutely beautiful and Lisa put so much thought and care into every detail. The location and property was perfect. It was like taking a step back into time. The perfect combination of Bridges of Madison County meets Tuscan countryside. The cottage is private and romantic. We will definitely be back to celebrate our Anniversary again next year.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a stellar and spectacular cottage! Wow! Words don’t do it justice. Will always recommend this place! Not to mention the most thoughtful host! Will be back for sure!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing and Lisa a wonderful host. We stayed 2 nights as an anniversary weekend and will be returning as soon as we have time in our schedules. This was a welcome reprieve from our hectic life.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa is an outstanding host, she has thought of everything at the Chandelier cottage! It’s beautiful and glamorous, all while having the country charm you’d expect from being on a farm. The outdoor claw foot tub and shower with the twinkling lights and candles were perfection. The bed was so comfortable and beautifully made. I absolutely loved listening to the occasional acorn tapping on the tin roof and I consider myself lucky that a small rain shower came through my last morning. Rain on a tin roof is one of the best sounds ever ❤️ I felt like I was leaving home after only a few days. Thank you Lisa!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so dreamy, cozy, romantic, and inspiring. This little cottage now holds a special place in our hearts. Front the decor to the views, everything is sooo beautiful. Lisa thought of everything possible to make our stay special. From the cute welcoming scrabble board when we walked into the door to the smell of fresh baked peanut butter cookies. Everything was in pristine, clean, stylish, and so beautifully quirky. We were able to relax and reflect and enjoy some alone time together. We will definitely be back and I am already counting down the days until we can return. Thank you Lisa for making this place and trip so special. You are wonderful!!!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have loved this place since the first time I step foot in the cottage back in March. Lisa is an outstanding host! She thinks of the smallest details. This place is like my second home. It is so peaceful and beautiful. She has done so many new touches and they are amazing! Mrs. Lisa has become family to us. I can't recommend this place enough. LOVE LOVE LOVE!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are debating staying here, do it!!! It is one of the best AirBnBs I have stayed at. Lisa has really thought of everything. Even phone chargers in the dresser, which really saved us! We checked in and found Lisa had left wine & champagne cupcakes out for us. She really went above and beyond!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's place is beautiful (like staying in a Better Homes and Gardens picture) and in the middle of lots of beautiful nature. From her place we were able to go hiking and see waterfalls within 20 min. We were able to feed Teapot, the world's cutest cow. Her cottage is so perfectly decorated, you feel an immediate sense of calm and relaxation while you are there. Every dish, towel, book, chair, etc is absolutely perfect. This is a very high end Airbnb for an inexpensive price. We will be back.
Lisa herself is gracious, funny, down-to-earth, and lovely. You couldn't ask for a better host."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the perfect weekend getaway at the chandelier cottage! Pictures don’t do it justice—you have to see it and experience it firsthand. There were many special touches including homemade cookies, coffee ready to perk and personalized messages from Alexa. Lisa suggested some local spots and we enjoyed each one. My favorite things were soaking in the outdoor tub and watching the cows eat while sitting on the front porch. We will absolutely be back!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I needed a little time away to rest and relax, and this turned out to be the perfect place for that. The cottage was nice enough on its own to make us very happy, but even beyond that, all of the time and effort that Lisa put into so many special touches to personalize it just for us made our stay amazing. We felt so pampered.
The cottage is lovely; the rustic roots of the building have been beautifully preserved, yet it feels downright luxurious because of all the wonderful little details inside. The setting is fabulous; it is quiet and just secluded enough to feel like it is a peaceful step away from the rest of the world, and we enjoyed seeing the farm’s cattle and even some deer. The hospitality is above and beyond, and Lisa’s communication is superb.
We can hardly wait to go back."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t have asked for a better stay! The cottage was absolutely spotless and oh so cute. Lisa was an amazing host, we had everything we needed for a relaxing romantic getaway. The location was great as well. Our favorite air bnb yet. We can’t wait to go back!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Simply the best! From the time I booked our stay I knew it was going to be a great one. Lisa, the host, was there from day one to make sure our stay was perfect. When we first arrived to the cottage I was in awe, but when I opened the front door, I was speechless. Every part of this cottage was perfect. We were welcomed with fresh backed cookies, a hand written letter, local wine, and Alexa who told us everything we needed to know about the cottage. We loved being able to sit on the porch and watch a family of deer enjoy their dinner. We were also able to feed Teapot, the cow, and meet Lisa herself. She treated us like family and we felt like we’ve known her forever! You can tell Lisa loves what she does and it shows. One morning, Lisa brought us a farm fresh breakfast and it honestly was the best food I’ve ever had! I have never had a host as wonderful as Lisa. If you’re looking for the perfect, romantic stay look no further. I am counting down the days until we can return!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is absolutely gorgeous! Lisa has done an amazing job of creating such a unique and relaxing space with so many personal touches. From the fresh flowers in all the rooms, personalized note and music selection to the robe, slippers and artisan bath soaps I left feeling very pampered. I will definitely be back."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Much more than we expected. Lisa has poured her heart and soul into this cottage and it shows in every inch of the space. She really has thought of everything to make this place great for couples to relax and enjoy themselves together.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Red Barn Cottage was everything we hoped for and more! Beautiful and charming with so many thoughtful touches. We spent the weekend there to celebrate our four year anniversary and enjoyed every minute of it!
Lisa put out locally made breakfast pastries, organic jam and freshly picked blueberries in the cottage for us. She was super quick to respond when we had questions and wanted recommendations in the area. Our original plan was to go into Helen and look around on Saturday but we felt no need to leave the cottage. We had ourselves an amazing champagne picnic right outside the cottage and listened to vinyl records throughout the weekend. Not only did we love the outdoors shower but enjoyed watching the deer feeding right outside the cottage doors. We also saw cows roaming inside the fenced off farm area. Oh and Alexa (with smart home enabled) is an added bonus!
You can truly see all the love that has gone into putting the cottage together and the joy it brings the host to share it. Strongly recommend both the cottage and the host! Looking forward to revisiting in the future :)"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cottage was everything I was expecting and so much more! Lisa poured so much love into her space! It was absolutely gorgeous and the personal touches that she added truly made the weekend magical! I can not wait to stay here again.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! It was a dream come true! The cottage far exceeded our expectations and was an amazingly unique place for us to celebrate our anniversary. So so many special touches: our favorite music playing with sparking cider chilled on the porch upon our arrival. Fresh organic blueberries picked that morning, farm fresh eggs and sausage in the cottage for us to make for breakfast. Hand feeding TeaPot was so so cool! Lisa is an incredible host!! We can't wait to go back!!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic little cottage. Do not let the basic amenities fool you. This place is a true gem. The decor is fabulously unique. The bed is firm and extremely comfortable. Completely private location but still convenient to everything the North Georgia Mountains have to offer. The standouts are the minor, extra details that made this stay so special. Bathrobes and slippers, fresh blueberries from the farm, sparkling water and chocolates, coffee and breakfast items, thoughtful and stylish decor, lots of toiletries in case you left something at home, an Alexa to control everything and a great guide book are just a few of the perks to round out the accommodations. Lisa is a fantastic host and we will certainly return for future stays. Thank you so much!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place for a romantic getaway. We stayed 2 days and very easily could’ve stay 2 more. Cabin is very comfortable and a great place to relax. Very quiet and peaceful. Will be staying here again.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Fran’s place to visit family in nearby Jefferson, GA and it was the perfect retreat. We played ping pong and enjoyed having everything we needed in the kitchen to cook our dinners. The home was spotless and we appreciated all the craftsmanship put into the airbnb. As far as things to do nearby - we enjoyed Revival Taproom, Cloudland Winery, Hurricane Shoals county park, and Jaemor Farms for strawberry picking. Thanks again for letting us stay."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nicely furnished. Had bathrooms stocked with shampoo, conditioners etc. Nice white towels, hand cloths, Kitchen included Coffee!

They did a great job remodeling a chicken house into an apartment . Very impressed!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are trying to go to a UGA football game but dont want to pay Athens prices, this place is perfect!!
My brothers and i spent a wonderful weekend at the “coop” and loved it.
Close enough to Athens, GA to go to the university. And there are several options for food about 15-20 minutes away.
This place was prefect for our needs. And we LOVE the ping pong table!"

We were there just to sleep during a work trip to that area so the remoteness and the quiet was perfect plus the beds are super comfortable! The host is planning some additional renovations that will really make it a fun place to stay!
This is a creative space and I really enjoyed staying there. I would definitely go back if I am in the area again.

If you're looking for a remote, quiet haven to rest, pack your clothes & some food to eat and come to this quiet, well furnished home. The showers are HUGE & towels luxurious & abundant.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fun place to stay
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect place for our large family. We all had a great time together in the common areas, playing pool and enjoying the hot tub. There was plenty of room that we had our own space and could spread out too.
We enjoyed the outdoor areas where every patio has furniture to relax and listen to the birds.
The kitchen is well stocked, has everything you need to stay in and cook. I would stay again and recommend Heikki’s home for a large family/group."
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,Lots of room and we love Clarksville!!!!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Heikki’s place was perfect for our large party of family and friends! After a full day of trophy trout fishing this was a great place to come back to and enjoy our time together! We felt right at home and had a wonderful time!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location to Taccoa Falls College. Would definitely stay again.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is just perfect for a large group! We’ve never had such a fully stocked kitchen- every gadget/appliance was available.
The bedrooms are large, open and airy. The grounds are lovely e we it’s room to roam and there’s a reason Heikki is a super host- he communicates clearly and quickly. I can highly recommend this home and host."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,everything was amazing! 10 out 10 would recommend!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family of 12 and I normally stay home for Christmas, but this year we wanted to switch things up and I'm SO GLAD we did❤
Rider's Place was amazing. It was super private and had beautiful surroundings. There was plenty to do within 15-45 minutes from the house. Places like Taccoa Falls, Helen, and Dahlonega🌲
With a family of 13 total, we still had plenty of space to be spread out in this home. There's a main floor, an upstairs, and down stairs, so we never felt packed at all. It was great.
We also enjoyed cooking in the kitchen every day we were there. It had everything you could possibly need, then some. We even used the grill outside for Christmas Day Dinner🍗
The hot tub was the hit of our stay🔥 Everyone enjoyed it. And there was plenty of games and things for the kids downstairs, right off from where the hot tub was.
Overall, I can't say enough good things about this place and will definitely be booking more family trips here❤"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay at
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Great hospitable stay! Would repeat!
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,The best feature of the house is the dining area where our entire group was able to share meals and devotions and play lots of games. The kitchen was well equipped with dishes and utensils although we did bring our own crock pots. The oven is a small convection oven. The master bedroom and bath were very spacious and comfortable. The other bedrooms were sufficient for our needs although the downstairs bedroom would be better with a fan. We really appreciated the big laundry room. The pool table/ping pong table was a lot of fun. The yard was beautiful with lots of wildlife. The host was very accommodating when it came to trash pickup. The house is older and the pull out beds were quite thin. Ok for small children but not comfortable for teens or adults. Plenty of room for parking 4 vehicles including a trailer. Close to Dollar General and downtown shops and restaurants.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Great house! Very large and comfortable. Also very clean.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"We arrived on Friday and left Sunday morning, we were in town for a wedding. House presents well, is very spacious, and clean. My family enjoyed the gameroom (pool table, and ping pong table) and the jacuzzi. House is removed from street and private. Great time, at Great house!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent !
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Just celebrated our 3rd trip back to Rider’s base. There’s a reason (or reasonS) our girls’ group returns every year. Spacious with plenty of room to spread out and congregate, well-stocked, quiet location, consistently clean, the birds, proximity to hiking, and the price is right. This year we tried out Yonah Preserve and def recommend. See ya next year Rider’s base!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Heikki is a great host. This was our second visit to this location for a family event in town.
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house was spacious and we all had room to spread out. There were 3 pull out sofas which gave sleeping options. The location was very convenient to Helen and to Cleveland. There is a Dollar General 0.3 miles away for convenience. The owner was very responsive and came to fix an issue we had with the door right away. We booked it mostly because of the outdoor space for our kids to get outside and play but unfortunately it rained all weekend. We still had a good time. The long driveway was nice for the kids to ride their bikes.
The negatives about the house are related to age. The house is old and has smell like an old house. Once you've been there you get used to it but every time we left and came back you noticed it again. There was not enough hot water for all of us to shower at the same time so we had some cold showers.
Overall it was a nice place to stay and very clean."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Our group really enjoyed our stay here. House is in a great location and there is plenty of space!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Our group of 10 had so much fun here! Surprised with how much space this house had. Everything you need in the kitchen, brand new appliances, jacuzzi is AMAZING"

2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great older 60's style house for a large group of people with plenty of room both inside and out. Very clean with a eclectic retro feel. Great lawn/garden/porch area, only wish we had had more time to enjoy it. Close to Ingle's and fast food when needed. Also an easy drive to Toccoa Falls and Lake Toccoa for a wedding."
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"Close to downtown, wedding venue Copey creek, close to dahlonega"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! Very family friendly with plenty of space. Also decently close to planets of activities
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The kids loved the game room and hot tub. Very comfortable beds and lots of room to spread out. Four miles from Copey Creek wedding venue.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay. Spacious, had everything we needed, close to everything and plenty of amenities. We traveled with a newborn and toddler and this property made everything easy for us. Would definitely stay again in a heartbeat."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Heikki’s place is simply wonderful, and a great base to explore the north Georgia area. We spent days driving around, including Helen, Tallulah Gorge, Lake Rabun and across the mountains in the Chatahoochee Forest. The house itself is very spacious with plenty of room for our party of 6. The kitchen is well equipped and Netflix on both TVs on the main floor was a great bonus.
The location is set back from the main road, and although we were initially worried the units next door would cause noise, we never heard a thing throughout the stay - apart from the nearby coyotes and other wildlife at night!
Clarkesville is a very small town, so be aware things like food deliveries through Uber Eats or Grubhub may take a while (if they come at all) - so we’d suggest buying in nice meals from the substantial Walmart in Cleveland when you want a treat, or heading to one of the many restaurants in Cornelia. The kitchen is more than well equipped.
Heikki is absolutely wonderful and couldn’t have been more helpful, even driving out to take out our trash (which we of course would have gladly done). Thanks again for the wonderful stay!"
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place very clean would stay here again well worth the money
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,This spot is a hidden gem. It has everything you need for a wonderful experience and the views are phenomenal.
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Incredible house! Plenty of space and tons of fun. We really enjoyed the hot tub. Enough TVs to watch every game that’s one. Highly recommend. Had an issue re: check in email and Heikki picked up promptly to help me out.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Really nice and roomy also close to downtown clarkesville
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and spacious house, very much as listing described. Location is set off the main road, so it was fairly quiet but still easy to access the town of Clarkesville."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at Heikki’s! I really appreciated having everything we needed to cook for our family throughout our stay
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"A great place to stay, the home was nice and accommodating, with all amenities working, the only drawback to the location was the rough driveway, which is the only entrance to the location."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Heikki's house is absolutely beautiful from the inside out. The house is surrounded by beautiful flowers and landscape, and is very peaceful. We rented this house for my daughter's wedding and it was absolutely perfect in every way!! The house is huge and has the perfect accommodations for our wedding group. There are 4 large bedrooms and 3 pull out sofa couches which allows for plenty of room for a group. The kitchen is large and has everything you need to create a wonderful family meal. We enjoyed sitting at the large kitchen table all together while laughing and making memories. Everyone loved the separate floors where adults could have conversations in the living room and the younger group could go downstairs and have fun playing pool, watching TV, getting in the hot tub etc. The best part of our stay was everyone going out to the fire pit area where we had smores and just sat around enjoying conversations with everyone. This house is close to Cleveland, Dahlonega, and Helen. If you are wanting a great place to stay for your wedding, our if you are coming to enjoy the great outdoors such as going hiking, visiting Helen, or going to the many wineries, this is your place. We had an amazing time at Heikki's beautiful home, and we can not wait to go back one day when we are in the area."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The stay at Riders Base was wonderful! The unit was directly as described and photographed, and everything was wonderful. There was a very small issue with the HVAC system which the owner was immediately on and rectified quickly and correctly.

And Stephanie is a literal saint, my car needed a jump the following morning and her and her husband helped my girlfriend and I out without hesitation. Stephanie, you’re by far the best host I’ve ever stayed with using this app. Thank you thank you thank you.
Oh yeah, and the pictures do not do this place justice. The pictures are accurate but just don’t actually capture the true beauty of the place.
You’ll truly love it here."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My Wife and I needed a great weekend get away and we looked up Helen Ga from a suggestion of a friend. So I started my Air bnb search and found this place. Let me say when we arrived we knew it was going to be a great weekend even if we didn’t leave the house. The pictures and descriptions do not do any justice to this place. We stay at air bnb 2-3 times a year and this one is by far our favorite. It was super clean and inviting, very spacious and exactly everything we thought we paid for and more. The host was super sweet to communicate with which made the stay that much better. The drive to Helen was super easy. The neighborhood was super quiet. Thank you so much for making our visit to the mountains of Georgia an excellent one. We will definitely be back not only to the mountains but to this air bnb."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful spot
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing stay at the 'Loft at Brookside'. I wanted to get a way from the hustle and bustle of the city life - with a tranquil location (one that was safe for a female traveler). This did just that. The location was easy to find, the place was extremely clean and cozy and the views outside were amazing. Shade (my fur pal) enjoyed the outdoor space, and I enjoyed sitting down by the stream every morning."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is absolutely lovely. We arrived with our two dogs and check in instructions were clear and our hosts were extremely communicative. Everything you need is right there in the cabin and they went above and beyond in providing these amenities. We only used the cabin for eating and sleeping and the hot tub after a long day of hiking. Everything was absolutely perfect and we would stay there again. And the downtown Cornelia area is wonderful too!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay at the loft. It was clean and beautifully decorated. I loved how peaceful and quiet it was.

This is a great place to stay if you are looking to slow down and just enjoy nature.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Loft was absolutely perfect for our long weekend. We specifically looked for dog friendly accommodations so we could bring our dog and we had a blast. While the yard is not fenced in, it's very very large and the lovely touches like squeaky balls and dog poop bags made us feel like our pup was just as welcome as we were.
The space is very nicely renovated. The full kitchen and cooking supplies allowed us to cook all of our meals in the house. The bathroom is newer and squeaky clean.
10-20 minutes from vineyards and beautiful hikes."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was my second stay Deborah’s place and it will not be my last. Great communication with host and exactly as described. She did a beautiful job with the place. Also the rain at night on the metal roof, so peaceful!! Can’t wait to come back."

The Loft is so cozy, bright, clean, and inviting. We really felt right at home. Deborah & Bob even stopped by to say hello and make sure we were comfortable after we got settled in and we're very responsive, kind, and hospitable hosts. The place itself has everything you could possibly want in a little getaway and then some, it was an absolute dream to stay in. The interrior is done up in a lovely modern farmhouse style and it's absolutely charming. The cherry on top was soaking in the hot tub under the stars on their nearly two acre property. If you are deciding where to stay and looking at The Loft, book it and thank me later! We will defentely be back to stay in this absolute gem of an air bnb."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a beautiful place and we really enjoyed the place.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie and Bob’s loft - transformed from a renovated barn - was a great home away from home for a few days. Easy to find using GPS: the place is clearly marked and can be seen from the road. Simple and straightforward check-in. Superb WiFi that worked consistently (not always a given in the mountains). Good central location for those wanting to explore the greater northeast GA area, just a short drive from Helen to the west and Clayton/Tallulah Falls to the east.
Loved all the thoughtful personal touches including labels on kitchen drawers and extra towels for the hot tub. Speaking of, both the hot tub and fire pit provide great comfort after a long drive.
There’s also a small brook at the back end of the property with some seating so you can enjoy nature at a slower pace and reflect. A calming little space.
Debbie and Bob are warm, welcoming hosts who seem to appreciate the company of their guests. We felt our comfort was important to them and appreciated their hospitality."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable little place in such a peaceful surroundings. The loft was so cute and clean and the bed super comfy. Only thing I would add is some sort of window covering for the window above the bed as the bright outside street light shines in.. but other than that everything was perfect and well thought out. Bathroom and shower were so nice. Was not there much to take advantage of all the outside amenities but would definitely consider coming back on our next trip to the area!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The loft was beautiful and peaceful. We had a great time.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When we arrived at the loft, Deborah and Bob were waiting to greet us along with their little dog. They were very warm and welcoming, and made sure that we had everything we needed before leaving us to get settled. The first thing I noticed was that the location was even more beautiful than the pictures portrayed. It was exactly what we were looking for. The loft itself also exceeded our expectations. It was very tastefully decorated, with a very homey feel, and there was everything one might need for their stay. The hot tub was a great way to relax at the end of each day, and Bob made sure that we had enough wood to build a nice fire in the fire pit. We stayed for four nights, but I wish we could have stayed longer. We could not have been happier with the whole experience! Would love to visit again one day…"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deb was very kind and helpful. The place was beautiful and well maintained. We even got to meet her cute little dog.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place for a relaxing weekend get away. This place is truly a home away from home. Deborah and her husband were very kind and welcoming. The place was very clean and had everything we needed and more. I will definitely be coming back.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved staying here and next time it will have to be for longer. Great open area outside for our dogs to run around. The location is perfect (we have friends that live in Alto) and we were not worried that the barking from our two dogs would bother the neighbors. Wish we could stayed longer but it was the perfect home away from home for a few days. Place was really clean and Deborah and Bob had all the drawers and cabinets labeled to help find what you needed for your stay. Loved it!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deborah’s place was very clean and she had all drawers labeled so it was easy to find everything. It is in such a great quiet area. I love how she had a binder of recommendations and she even shared some of her own books.

We arrived late in the evening and had no problem getting in. Justin and I got engaged this weekend and this place will be in our memories from the weekend. Very peaceful spot, perfect for our lab to chase the ball and check out the creek. Highly recommend renting this spot for a Helen weekend trip, Cornelia its-self is a great town as well. We did wish that there was more privacy for the hot tub outside, but we did not feel uncomfortable. Loved loved loved this spot!! Hoping to come back to recreate a great weekend 🥰"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the house and the atmosphere! We made a fire pit, used the hot tube, cooked in the BBQ! We just love it. We spend a nice weekend, there is a river near the property near the property and we❤️ will be back! Thanks Deborah and Bob!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deborah’s Airbnb was very nice ! Very spacious. My boyfriend and I like it freezing so for both air conditioners on 60 was so cozy. Different blanket and pillow options were a great touch. There was a binder filled with maps and different eating spots around the way. Very clear instructions for checking in and checking out. I wasn’t able to speak to Deborah but my boyfriend did. I did speak to her husband when we first arrived. I would recommend this Airbnb. Just total relaxation for the weekend. Can’t wait to be back
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved loved loved staying here— wish I never had to leave!!! Deborah is so nice and although I missed chatting with her in person I knew I could reach out to her if I needed anything. Would book again in the future!! ✨
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super easy to find, quiet and secluded from the road/neighbors. The owners do live on site, but in a different home. They were very kind and greeted us when we got there. Absolutely precious. My 15 year old son and I take an annual trip to Helen every summer and this year we were able to experience some new things thanks to Deborah’s recommendations. The loft felt safe and comfortable and we were able to relax and have an amazing weekend. Would definitely stay again! There are plenty of stores and restaurants close by to enjoy and Helen (and other attraction areas) is only 20 minutes away. Definitely would stay again!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Loft was easy to find thanks to their signage. It was clean, easy to settle in, and even had drawers labeled so that you know where utensils, pans, etc. are! I enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub at night because the fireflies were out. They even have a binder with brochures of places to eat and things to do! The same binder has the check out procedures and Wi-Fi information clearly printed so there is no confusion. Though the owners live right next door, my privacy was well respected. A little birdie told me of their plans for a new rental they may build, and I can’t wait to come back when it’s done!"

Thank you Deborah and hubby!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The loft was absolutely beautiful. It was extremely clean and had everything that we needed for our stay.

It was the perfect place to kick our feet up and relax.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah's place is truly better than the photos! It is very clean and well maintained.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful Airbnb and great host! Hope to come back soon!
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, very clean and nice place to stay, and great communication with the host"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I booked this for her birthday and we’re beyond pleased! Upon entering the beautiful home we were greeted by Deborah and her cute dog! The inside was beautiful, the bathroom and kitchen were extremely clean. The hot tub was heated and ready to use. Overall this trip was amazing and so relaxing! We will definitely be back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a wonderful property for a private getaway to the mountains. We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are genuinely looking for a home away from home, please stop searching! Deborah and Bob's place is not only amazingly peace-filled, the pictures, though accurate, cannot capture the tranquility and cleanliness of this home. You have absolutely everything you need, from a washer and dryer to bakeware. You even have two TVs, one in each room, and separate HVAC units as well. You have stores and restaurants less than 10 minutes away and it is minutes to a major highway. So even if you are just passing through, PLEASE stop and take two days to refresh and regroup before moving on, you won't be disappointed. Bob and Deborah, thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deborah and Bob’s quaint place was perfect for an anniversary getaway. I do have to say our favorite part was the his and her robes. We felt so pampered as we ate breakfast in our robes and rocked in the chairs on the front porch. We will definitely be back!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah’s Airbnb was lovely, with a cozy yet beautiful interior! The property is somewhat small, but still has a wooded feel. The Airbnb is relatively close to the next house (Deborah’s house) but it still felt private and our host was careful to give us our space 😌 The hot tub is excellent! The tin roof also makes a soothing sound in the rain. The property is close to local attractions like Teccoa Falls and Tallulah Gorge. Our host was very accommodating to a few special requests, so extra points for that! Well worth the stay! Thanks!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie and Bob are some of the sweetest hosts you’ll find on this app, the place was nice, clean and private. Only negative i can think of was a bit of an uncomfortable bed, so maybe bring an air mattress if you’ve got a sensitive back. Great experience overall!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I enjoyed our weekend getaway. If you're looking for a peaceful and relaxing place, this is it!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for a quick weekend getaway to Helen. We arrived a few hours early and Deborah graciously let us come in a few hours early. When we arrived her husband happened to be in the yard and greeted us, we got settled in and walked the grounds. We enjoyed the stream in the backyard and talking with Deborah and her husband, they were incredibly nice and gave us some history on the area and recommendations on places to see and eat. Other than that we were free to use the fire pit and hot tub or walk the grounds as we liked. There was a welcome basket of snacks and some wine in the fridge, it really made us feel welcome. It was a very comfortable space and I absolutely love the colors that were used in decorating the space! Thank you for being so wonderful to us! We absolutely recommend this space to couples or smaller families (they have a pack and play in the closet!), it is quiet and I am sure would be even more beautiful in the spring/summer!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time. Loved the hot tub. It was so peaceful and relaxing.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing! Just what I needed for some self care. I can’t wait to bring my family for another stay.

From start to end Debbie was very responsive and welcoming. It was very cozy and conveniently located, every detail was well thought out.
Being able to meet Debbie and Bob gave it an extra touch, especially in a time where everything is now done electronically and through technology.
I’d definitely stay here again in the future :)"

The loft was also very warm and bright making it very comfortable. The bed slept amazing. You are also provided with a lot of household and toiletry items which was very nice. It was conveniently located near a lot of restaurants and shopping. It was only 20 minutes from an awesome Tanger Outlet Mall and 5 minutes to a great Mexican restaurant, El Sombrero! Helen, GA was also a 25 minute drive and was a beautiful town. I highly recommend the Loft if you’re looking for a place to relax! Deb and her husband are wonderful to work with and are very responsive!❤️"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The loft was truly amazing and even better than in pictures! It is easy to find and in a great location. We found a ton of things to do that were just a short drive away (hiking, shopping, wineries, etc).
The loft was very clean, the beds were comfortable, and it was well stocked with everything we needed. The hot tub was also super clean and we loved relaxing on the little porch. Even though it rained for most of our visit, the property was so beautiful and dreamy!
The hosts were very responsive and helpful (and just the sweetest!). Unlike most air b&bs today, we could certainly tell the hosts genuinely care about their loft and its visitors. They made us feel right at home there and I definitely recommend a visit!"

Bob and Debbie were amazing hosts and we were so thankful we got to chat with them a bit on our first day and meet their sweet dog as well! We would highly recommend them and hope to be back again soon :)"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic time at the Loft at Brookside and Bob and Debbie were just fantastic hosts. I would go to any AirBnB they have just because they are the hosts! They gave us great recommendations on what we should do and everything in the house was so clean and comfortable.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay close access to anything you need but still quiet and private. The hot tub was perfect after a day exploring Helen and Talluah Gorge and the bed was very comfortable. Our pup loved playing fetch in the big yard and listening to the creek was a bonus as well! We will definitely be back!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My best friend and I stayed at this sweet little loft to celebrate her bachelorette. Deborah and her husband came over and personally welcomed us and gave great suggestions for wineries to visit. We had a blast!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even more beautiful than the pictures! Such a beautiful property only about 20-25 minutes from downtown Helen, and Anna Ruby Falls! Deborah was a pleasure to work with and check in was a breeze. The secluded location, beautiful views, and hot tub make for the perfect nightcap after a long day exploring Helen, GA and Unicoi State park!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at this loft. It was the perfect size. We enjoyed cooking in the kitchen, walking the property, and the hot tub. It was perfect for a romantic getaway to celebrate my birthday. The hosts even left me a cupcake and balloon.
The place is decorated so beautifully. We had the best time hanging out and taking a day trip to hike at Tallulah Gorge.
We will recommend to our friends and will stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Deborah was a great host! The Airbnb was immaculate. The kitchen was fully equipped with everything you could possibly need & more. So relaxing and exactly what we needed for a birthday weekend getaway. During our stay we woke up and enjoyed the morning by the river watching the fish. We then spent the day in Helen a Bavarian city which was just a short drive from the Airbnb. We concluded our night by soaking in the hot tub which is exactly what we needed after a day of walking. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to everyone. Filled with many personal touches, clean and very comfortable."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deborah was the best hostess we have ever gad with Airbnb. We just love the apartment they have. We would highly recommend anyone to stay there.

Sincerely,
A & M"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an absolutely perfect stay at the loft. The host was incredibly responsive and went way above and beyond for us to make our stay special. Everything looked brand new inside and was sparkly clean. The property was gorgeous, they have a lovely garden and a small creek about 50 yards from loft. We felt so comfortable here. Even the features in the house we awesome, the antique tables and maple headboard. Literally inspiration for things we’d love to do at home. We would 1000% recommend this airbnb to anyone visiting the area. Thank you again for such a great stay!!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Birdsong was a dream and lived up to its name. My husband and I enjoyed a very peaceful and relaxing weekend. Every morning we enjoyed coffee on the screened in porch while listening to the birds sing and watched the squirrels play. The river was beautiful and easy to get too, with a wonderful gazebo and swing. The house was clean and felt just like home. Joan makes sure every detail is covered even putting hearts on the throw pillows for our anniversary and leaving fresh cut flowers from her beautiful garden. We can’t wait to come back, we were less than 5 minutes from downtown, bowling and a wonderful antique shop. Highly recommend visiting Clarksville and staying at Birdsong!"

Thank you for an amazing stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the Birdsong and will definitely be back. It looked like the pictures - lovely. It was clean, comfortable, well furnished & tastefully decorated. We felt right at home. It had every amenity anyone would need. It had a great screened sun room - although it was cold weather while we were there. Hope to be there again in warm weather. While it was located in a peaceful area with beautiful, natural landscape, the location was very convenient to Clarkesville.
We highly recommend the Birdsong. It was a pleasure to meet Joan."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I wanted to find a peaceful spot to relax for a few days. The Birdsong was a great choice. We totally love the peaceful ambiance. The house was clean & felt just l like home. I must say, the one feature that I loved the most about the house were the supplies in the kitchen. I've never been to any place that has everything available to us. That was a gold plus in my book. We had a great time staying at the Birdsong. There was nothing negative I can say about my experience & stay. It was amazing. Thank you Joan for opening your house to us. We'd love to stay there again if we come to Clarksville."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay! The home was very clean and comfortable. I definitely give this place five stars. I will say, however, that the futon bed is more suitable for kids with young backs than for older guests :) The other bed was very comfortable though."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Birdsong was beautiful! It felt like walking into your own home. Everything was fully stocked! There was everything you could possibly need. She has thought of everything... sheets, blankets, pillows, games, toys, pack n play, writing utensils, you name it, it's probably there! my 3 favorite things: the shower (WOW), the awesome clay coffee cups, and Jax (the sweet chocolate lab that greets you when you arrive). The location is great and allows you privacy, yet everything is within a close driving distance. I am definitely going to book another stay in the very near future!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Birdsong is amazing! We weren’t there much because of my son’s wedding. I would have liked to enjoy it more than we did. I can’t recommend it enough. I expect it to be to be harder to reserve because it’s so nice everyone will want to stay there. To say it was immaculate is an understatement! This was my first time using Air bnb. I hope the rest of them are this nice. It sets a very high bar! I was able to meet the host & she was very nice & the pup Jax.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is very conveniently located, just outside of downtown Clarksville. Perfect place to stay for anyone who is interested in enjoying the Soque River."

The Keurig machine worked great in the morning for my coffee. And this house really had great details: from the patio outside that you can sit and have a chat in to the little makeup vanity that I used to do my makeup. The washer and dryer worked great too. I even asked them for some detergent to wash some of our clothes and they brought it over right away. Overall amazing stay! Thank you for allowing us to stay at Birdsong ☺️"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at Birdsong. The house was immaculately clean and well-appointed, The internet service worked great. The neighborhood was quiet, and it was so nice to take the short walk down to the river, where I could sit by the water. The hosts were very nice. It was fun to watch the squirrels tirelessly (but unsuccessfully) try to raid the bird feeders around the back porch. I enjoyed interacting with the owners' dog and one of their cats. There are very helpful guides/information in the house to most of the waterfalls in the surrounding area. I would love to return for another vacation!"

Their dog Jax was super friendly and greeted us everyday to say HI! We have never stayed in an Air BNB because you never know what you will get but I’m glad we did. It was perfect!

They had a slim book on local attractions, particularly the waterfalls, that was very helpful to us."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Superclean, quiet, quaint, and convenient, Joan's Birdsong was perfect for my family getaway.
The home is nestled at the back of a quiet neighborhood, away from busy streets, so very safe for children. It is tucked away, but only a couple minutes drive to the bustling small town of Clarkesville.
I slept on the sofa bed with my daughter and we were very comfortable. I gave the primary bedroom to my mom. My young son slept on the futon in the small bedroom and enjoyed the toys and games.
Birdsong must have recently been renovated as the appliances, kitchen, and bathroom seem brand new. I loved the large walk-in shower and screened-in porch. Joan has stocked the house with plenty of blankets, linens, and kitchen utensils.
The trees and flowers surrounding Birdsong are beautiful. We were lucky to see the flowers blooming, especially the huge snowball bush in the front yard! Nature and small-town lovers will be happy here."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is just a great place to stay in Clarkesville & North Georgia. We love everything about it, especially the screened in back porch. Our son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter live just a mile away and this has become our home away from home when we visit them. Couldn't recommend the home more highly!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful stay! The house was very cute, and had everything we needed for cooking our meals and relaxing on the awesome screened in porch. We also loved the peaceful setting and being able to walk in the woods to see the Sogue River. Very centrally located to all of the towns we visited; Clarkesville, Cleveland, and Helen. We will definitely be back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Birdsong was absolutely wonderful. We were traveling with our toddler for a family wedding, and having a house to ourselves so close to the venue was perfect. The area is secluded and peaceful, surrounded by trees and within walking distance to the river. Sitting and reading on the screened-in porch was probably the highlight of our trip after a long day of travel. The house is very clean and homey, stocked with almost anything you could need or want. Joan and Rob are incredibly thoughtful hosts, and even added a pac-n-play to the house amenities just for our family's trip. Will certainly return if we ever need to be in Georgia again!"

I would like to recommend to everyone and thank you Joan!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a very clean home and was perfect for my wife and I and 15 month old son! She even provided a pack and play for us. The screened in porch was very relaxing and we would recommend this home and host to anyone looking for a quiet relaxing get away!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Sparkling Clean, Relaxing, Spacious, Well furnished  and decorated home with carport in a quiet neighborhood. We stayed here for 6 weeks and relished every moment. It came equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.
We felt at home from the moment we checked in. I was inspired by all the beautiful artwork that is displayed through out the home, and books in the bedroom. The kitchen was fully equipped, and cooking was an enjoyable experience. When there was a minor inconvenience for few hours with the main power outage in the area due to snow storm, Joan and Rob immediately provided us with a generator, heater and hot coffee.
This airbnb exceeded all of our expectations, and it is our top choice for any possible future visits to the north Georgia area. I strongly recommend this place.
Thanks so much, Joan and Rob!"

It is directly across from Piedmont University conservatory (our destination), a four minute walk if you walked slowly, and a three minute walk from a lovely coffee shop and restaurant. The hosts communicated often and gave us all the information we needed. Very sweet place! We hope to stay their again next year."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place within walking distance of Piedmont's campus. Michelle and Matt were very responsive and everything was just as described. I will reserve this property again next time I am in town.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Down in GA for a wedding in the family. Drove 11 hours to arrive at this gem. Great place in the country to stay with family and friends. Plenty of room inside and out for everyone to enjoy this home and beautiful surroundings. Douglas was very attentive to ensure our trip was a success in every way. He definitely went above and beyond and we really appreciated that. Pool table and air hickey both worked great, awesome firepit was a blast, and watching the wildlife from the deck with a cup of coffee was spectacular. We all loved this place so much and would highly recommend others to come stay and experience the same great vacation home that we all did. We have stayed at many vacation homes and this tops them. Thank you Douglas for sharing your families get away with us. We look forward to a return trip. God bless."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I felt right at home in this cozy gorgeous cabin! Far enough away from town for peace and quiet, close enough to shop and get the things I needed. Douglas was very nice and helpful when planning my trip, he recommended so many good hiking spots! Extremely clean and well maintained, and I loved seeing the cows everyday, excited to book another stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house and location. Doug went above and beyond to provide a very comfortable stay. He was very flexible and provided all the information we needed to enjoy our stay.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful big house to stay in while visiting a pretty part of the country. Great host and beautiful home with lots of activities (yard games, board games, pool table)."

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Fantastic, roomy cabin. Douglas was a responsive and extremely helpful host. We made some delicious burgers on the pellet smoker. Everyone was very impressed with the open space and the feel of the cabin. Such a beautiful property. 10/10 would recommend!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was perfect and the host was very responsive and great. We would definitely stay again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay! This is a great place to relax and unwind. It's hard to pick the most relaxing place - the king size bed, massage chair, hammock, outdoor seating areas, cozy couch, or whirlpool tub. There's room for a ton of people, but you don't have to be on top of each other the whole time. Lots of fun things to do, inside and out. I self-owned at air hockey, but there's also a pool table and board games if you want to stay in; cornhole and frisbee golf if you want to be outdoors. Or just walking and smelling the air/seeing the stars. (A neighbor had some baby cows that were so cute, but at enough of a distance.) There were lots of helpful touches - handy blankets everywhere in case you're like me and love blankets. The light switches had labels, and there a few friendly notes on local recommendations or how to operate things like the thermostat or jacuzzi. Easy to find anything needed. Doug is very helpful and friendly, but not intrusive. Totally recommend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy, beautiful, clean and relaxing place! The cabin was very well designed and well maintained! You'll find WHATEVER you need in the kitchen😅👌 Great place to stay. 10 mins from a shopping center, so getting to the store was not a problem. The views were just gorgeous!! We all enjoyed every aspect of our stay! highly recommend this place!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"I have been waiting all day to write this! First of all.OMG! The host, Douglas,such a gentleman, kind and compassionate. I told him it was a trip for my son who is graduating in May. He has the most beautiful tree put up for us. We didn't have to bring anything but meat..lol. Fully stocked kitchen, laundry room and toiletries. It felt like I was at my family's vacation hime and it was my turn to use it. So homey, comfortable and quiet. We couldn't have asked for more. We love it so much til the same night we was on there trying to book for another stay! Douglas outdone himself with this one and I cant wait to see his growth and stay at some other properties that I'm sure he will get. A superhost he has got to be! No complaints or disappointments. My grown daughter literally cried when she had to leave. Before we left, we cleaned up and washed all the sheets and pillowcases. We even left food in fridge to feel apart of the family too🤣Thanks for everything Douglas and we will be back."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy drive to a get-away full of fresh air, 6 acres to yourself, but views of horses and cattle without any smell of them, just serotonin from the cuteness. Best cabin I’ve ever stayed at because of the fun and relaxing time I got to have with my friend family ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ More reasons it was fun and relaxing: The property and cabin is FULL of outdoor games, board games, card games (which was our choice of games!), video games (we even played Nintendo), air hockey, pool table, duck hunt, HUGE TV’s for our music and movies. We brought the wine and food, but the cabin is loaded with all kitchen needs (even a popcorn maker), shower needs (even hairdryers). The furniture was so comfy and the massage chair is 👌🏼 I can’t wait to go back!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Doug's place was relaxing and peaceful. we enjoyed the fireplace, fire pit, back deck and pool table."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Doug was great at communicating and very easy to work with. House was perfect and had a very warm feel to it. We enjoyed the outdoor fire pit and swing! Would definitely like to rent again the next time we come up.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great stay here. Not only was the inside of this cabin beautiful the outside of this home was gorgeous. So many great thoughtful touches to make our stay comfortable and memorable. The fire pit and the use of the smoker were so fun to use. Inside the massage chair and beautiful large TV were enjoyed but my favorite was watching the cattle and donkey graze along the fence line. This beautiful place felt remote but was close to all the conveniences of an “in town” stay such as grocery and restaurant choices.
Only 20 minutes away we found the beautiful Tallulah Gorge State Park. The trails and visitor center there have so much to offer for all ages. We hiked from rim to rim of the gorge and it was so beautiful. Tallulah Gorge State Park
Grateful we found this amazing place! We are definitely coming back again."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,This home was perfect for our weekend stay! The lodge vibe was exactly what we were looking for as we went to relax after a great wedding in the area. We are already talking about renting this place for a family reunion! Awesome place and awesome communication!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,One of the nicest cabins we have ever rented ! Owners went above and beyond to stock the kitchen and bathrooms. Beds are comfortable and furnishings are perfect. Indoor and outdoor games are plentiful . The only reason we would not want to give this cabin a glowing review is to try to keep it a hidden gem so it's easier for us to rent in the future :)
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. I haven't stayed in a BnB this nice and large for such a low price. The cabin was clean, nicely decorated, and much bigger/roomier than we expected. It was a lot of fun to walk around the property. The location is peaceful and tucked away while being surprisingly close to local amenities. Overall this was a great stay and great value."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This place is a five star facility with everything you need to make it a memorable getaway. Spacious bedrooms, comfy beds, top notch appliances, it has everything.
We loved the decor and all the Table and Board games which have been provided. Everything was well stocked which is kind of hard to find nowadays on Airbnb.
Quick drive to Helen for party scene and come back for relaxation. We also appreciate the flexible checkin and checkout time provided to use.
Thank you Douglas for sharing your beautiful Cabin house with us, we definitely made lots of memories."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Doug’s cabin was perfect for my family! Very spacious yet cozy. The kitchen was well stocked with anything you might need for cooking. The massage chair was a great amenity, and we also enjoyed using the fire pit. I loved the fact that we were surrounded by cows along with a few other cute farm animals! Very peaceful escape for us. Doug was a great host and very accommodating. Will definitely be back in the future! Thanks again!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Loved staying here, it was very clean and peaceful. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin was perfect for our family! We had lots of room and loved how it was privately tucked away - the cows were a nice bonus. Douglas was super responsive and kind, he even proactively installed baby gates on the stairs for us since he knew we had small kiddos! Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We used the cabin for a stay for 2 days for a wedding at toccoa falls I wish I was there for a longer stay everything was great and well upgraded. Douglas was a great host and he was quick to respond to any questions there were multiple indoor and outdoor games at the cabin it was clean inside and out and the decorations inside the cabin were beautiful next time I have to stay longer to relax and enjoy.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best AirBNB we have stayed in so far!
With the open floor plan and number of bedrooms and bathrooms, Doug’s cabin had MORE than enough room for our family of 5 including 3 older teens.
The cabin had plenty of entertainment: very large screen TV, pool table, air hockey, wifi…Doug even recently added a standing arcade game (Big Game Hunter). There is a jacuzzi tub in the master bath and massage chair in the living room. We enjoyed steaks cooked in the smoker on the back deck for dinner.
The neighbors have cows and a donkey that were fun to watch along with the wild guinea fowl roaming the property.
Doug’s cabin is under 30 minutes from Tallulah Gorge and also very close to historic Camp Toccoa at Curahee. After a half day hiking, it was wonderful to go back to the cabin to clean up and just relax.
If you’re looking for a beautiful, relaxing place to stay on your vacation, this is it. Half of the vacation IS the cabin. It’s obvious a lot of love has gone into this one."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin was absolutely perfect and peaceful! Comfortably fit 2 couples and 5 kids with extra space to spread out. Plenty of outdoor options for the kids to play. Huge back deck with plenty of seating to hang out while grilling. Good driving distance to Helen. Douglas was very responsive and took care of everything needed to make our stay comfortable. We would definitely book again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was beautiful. The kids really enjoyed the house and all the fun activities. Would love to stay here during the winter months. Really enjoyed it.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Doug is a fantastic host! The cabin was beautiful and peaceful and looked just like the pictures. The cows sang us to sleep lol. We really enjoyed the pool table, air hockey, and the massage chair! Would easily recommend."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing experience! Such beauty in and around this homey and roomy cabin. Felt right at home. Slept so well and woke up to heavenly surroundings while having breakfast on amazing back patio. The owner Douglas, was most helpful with my stay. I will recommend this cabin to family and friends. And I will be back!"
