I would stay here again 100%."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I had a lovely stay at this house. Alexis and Jacky are attentive hosts, very communicative with prompt and professional responses. They assisted us with a few questions before booking, even following up the day before check-in to make sure everything had been addressed. They remained available for communication throughout the stay and made sure we had all our check-out info the night before. They were wonderful, and are very open to receiving feedback on how to make their visitor’s experience even better.
The house itself was great. It’s not easy to find a one-story house with 5 bedrooms! It was pretty clean inside, nothing to cause any alarm.
Fully functional kitchen with fridge/freezer, coffee machine, cooking equipment, plates and utensils, etc.
Dining area and living room were roomy enough to seat 6-8 people comfortably. There were some games stored in the living room (we played Cards Against Humanity for hours and hours), which was a nice touch! Also a Smart TV in the living room and in each bedroom.
Each bedroom was also furnished with comfortable bedding and some furniture, along with ceiling fans to supplement the central air conditioning. Two bedrooms had full en-suite bathrooms and there was a third full bathroom in the hall.
Washing machine and dryer worked great.
We didn’t get a chance to use the backyard (hottest weekend of the summer! No one wanted to go outside).
Driveway easily fit two cars and there was street parking available. The neighborhood was quiet and the house was only a couple minutes away from plenty of stores and restaurants.
Overall, it was a great stay in a great house for a great price with great hosts!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was second time we stayed here and we loved it! The room was clean as was the bathroom. Everything was very accessible to find in the room. The only thing I would just make a note of is that this house has two rooms advertised in our Airbnb. When I arrived my significant other and I went to the room that we were at before and the code we received did not work for that door. As it turns out we were actually supposed to be booked for the other room that was also located in the back, so there was some slight confusion with that. However, as I said earlier this is our favorite location for Airbnb’s stay at in Bakersfield. :)"

Definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling alone or with their partner."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"What you have is a room slightly smaller than a hotel room with a decent size bathroom. The bed is full size. The fan is quiet, but the lamp did not work (a common problem with Lowe's Harbor Breeze fans). As with hotel rooms, there is a full stock of coffee, waters, a microwave, mini fridge, a TV, and a small safe. The room itself was quiet. But there is also an under the window air conditioner (this is ""Bako"" after all). Unfortunately, the AC is, even on low fan, far too noisy for such a small room, so plan to rely on the overhead fan. Oh for a split! The only other variance from a hotel room was the round toilet seat on a short toilet."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really cute, clean and safe!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A fantastic place to stay 2nd stay and it is the best will definitely stay there when in Bakersfield 5*****

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"I only stayed a night, but it was clear from the start these are hosts that take great pride in providing a place to stay. Even booking last minute and late at night, the hosts responded promptly with check-in instructions. The only issues I experienced were the blinds did not shut all the way and there was quite a bit of light coming in from the backyard. I did not have a switch to control these lights. Also, the room did not have it's own dedicated A/C and was set warmer than I would like for sleeping. I used the fan, but at hight speeds, the motor made a loud noise."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The best Air B&B I’ve ever stayed in!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Once again, our trusted Hosts Cedric and Karen came through in all areas: Perfect surroundings, ambiance, communications, safety, cleanliness, accessibility and most of all, in their hospitality and positivity.
Yes, cheerfulness! And this is a great touch and one so needed in our times.
In most Airbnb rooms, guests don't see signs of positive words, messages; or even most hotel rooms for that matter. Why is a simple touch such as this so influential? It's because in uncertain times such as ours, even little seemingly insignificant 'positive strokes' can have an affect on another so as to cause a ripple effect on the whole world (excuse the pun). So for this small touch, they win kudos from us.
Keep up the great hosting Cedric and Karen! We'll see you down the road!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Karen and Cedric provide and warm and comfortable living space. It is a spacious side room on their property so they are available if anything goes wrong. They set up a beautiful Uganda themed decor and everything (especially the bathroom) is newly renovated. It is a highly recommended area to stay if you are visiting Bakersfield.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was great, very clean and cozy, we had a very relaxing stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place and we are seasoned Airbnb. This place was so comfortable and we loved the decor. A bathroom to just love. The extra touches were so appreciated - makeup towels even w-tips plus waters and peanut m and m’s. Comfortable bed and the outdoor space was so well lit and comfortable. Outlets for all devices and great fast internet. For us personally the location was just perfect like 3 minutes from our daughter but for anyone else food and amenities not far. Great job!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is perfect for a short stay for a couple or an individual. It is very stylish and well-equipped for any needs you might have for a short stay. Definitely worth it or the price. Highly recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super clean & quiet place to stay. Was perfect for my one-night stopover on my way back to NorCal. Spacious & plenty of extra thoughtful touches—coffee, snacks, etc. Within just a minute or two of Starbucks and shopping centers, too!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay it was quiet, the bed was comfy. It was very clean. We will be back ."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful 2 night stay with my husband and 9 month old baby! The host was very responsive and friendly. check in and check out were super simple and finding the place was very easy as well. It was quiet, comfortable, private and our baby loved the tub for bathtime! The only thing that was not ideal was that the room was bright at night, lit up by outdoor twinkle lights that stay on until 10pm (that is only because our baby is used to black out curtains but he ended up sleeping well regardless). All in all, we definitely recommend and will be staying there if we visit bakersfield again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The bathroom was beautiful and the entire space felt so cozy.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The neighborhood was quiet and safe. Easy to find and access the space. Pristine very clean and thoughtful touches that show they’re incredibly caring about their guests. Welcome snacks, coffee bar, easy wifi instructions, labels on light switches, extra power cord beside the bed, the different pattern they used to make the bed, the folded toilet paper points, a light on already for when I arrived. But my favorite part of all? A mini heater in the bathroom! As a Florida girl I get cold easily outside of my home state and the heater helped me enjoy the open shower during a bit of a cooler Cali week. I also loved the remote fire heater and extra blanket. Super comfortable bed! The no fuss check out made it so relaxing for me to leave because I had an early flight out and it was no hassle. I can’t wait to return and re book the next time I am in town for work."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely love this place! It was my second booking w Karen & Cedric. I wanted to book another week but unavailable and not surprised. If you’re considering booking just do it. You won’t be disappointed!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice and clean, honestly the only downsides was the floor was very cold because it was all tile and the shower pressure was rear bad. Everything else was amazing!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Love it, my second stay here!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's so nice to find a place that has all the special touches someone looks for when staying away from home. Karen & Cedric are the best at hosting and communicating. I loved my stay so much I've booked another week. It's amazing!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is beautiful, a very nice area, and super clean. I definitely recommend it."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Karen and Cedric place was peaceful, warm, and comfortable. It was much more than we expected. Treats were
left for us. We traveled for work, so having a comfortable bed and warm place to stay was what we needed."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The space was spacious and comfortable. I had a pleasant stay!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Definitely worth spend you day here. I was never expecting any Airbnb to beat my expectations, but Karen & Cedric definitely did."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is probably the cleanest place I’ve stayed. It was spotless and smelled so nice. Very cute, everything as pictured, and a great neighborhood."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a great stay! Was surprised with a little gift which helped celebrating my gf bday that much better! Would def come back
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, just wow. Everything was perfect and clean. The walkway to the airbnb was very easy and accommodating. I love the studio suite feeling. The private restroom was amazing. Would definitely book again. Worth the stay!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Every decorative detail enhanced the stay—Karen and Cedric definitely covered the bases. The suite was just as shown in the pictures—the bed was fantastic and the bathroom huge and pristine. The ambiance was a welcome respite from the road and nice alternative to a hotel. We had a very restful overnight stay. You will not be disappointed and I’m sure their other units are equally attractive and comfortable. Both Karen and Cedric were very helpful. We found the restaurant scene to be a bit of a challenge in Bakersfield, but if we’d had more time I’m sure it’s better than what it seemed on first blush—it was a weeknight and businesses are still recovering from COVID. I would guess barbecue and steak houses stand out throughout the city.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gorgeous home. Spacious & very clean. We really appreciated the fully equipped kitchen & the jetted tub in the master bathroom. The check-in instructions were clear so we were able to get in w/o any issues. The beds were very comfortable. We loved being able to have our dog with us. The large & well-maintained backyard has a gorgeous pool & play structure w/ swings. The host was very responsive (except for during our 1st morning which was apparently due to an internet outage on his end).
The only negative experience we had involved the use of the pool. We needed to ask the host to turn on the waterfall & waterslide but were unable to reach the host the entire 1st morning. We also couldn’t use the pool our last afternoon due to pool cleaners arriving & having to chemically treat the pool. The slide is too high-friction to actually be able to slide on it. Considering we chose this place mainly for the pool & water slide, it was pretty disappointing.
Overall a great place to stay!"

2023-12-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Overall the place is clean except for some stains / marks on the sheets. Check in is very straight forward and the location is quite accessible with easy parking. The walls are quite thin and we could hear people staying in the adjacent unit at night. We also picked this place specifically because it states it is pet friendly. However, we were told the morning of our check in that pets were not allowed on any furniture and to note any extra cleaning fees that we may be charged because of pets, despite the cleaning fee also already being included int he cost while booking. This came as somewhat of a surprise to us as other pet friendly places we have stayed at through AirBnb have not had issues with this or have been more clear in the listing. Generally a nice place, but we would probably skip it next time we're in the area because of the pet issue."
2023-12-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Clean with lots of space. Neighborhood is a bit rough, road closed so we had to take a detour. WiFi service wouldn’t allow connection."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were in town for medical reasons and ended up having to stay an extra night , I reached out to Tina to ask if we could stay the extra night she was right on it and told us what to do and made it happen . Mike also reached out to us to send well wishes for a speedy recovery . They both went out of their way to make our visit easy going . We couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay ."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Stay was great. Thanks.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Something about this place really did make it feel like a home away from home! It’s been remodeled nicely and the couch and bed were SO comfortable, it was nice to lounge and relax for the night and it’s true that it’s bigger than it looks! I really liked the layout of this place. It’s in an older neighborhood of Bakersfield that I may not walk around in at night but the little complex was safe and is tucked away off the street and the place itself felt very secure including the parking spot for your car. You can hear the neighbor (mostly their dog) through the wall quite a bit during normal stirring hours but I also like having that security when I’m traveling solo with my dog so in a way, I didn’t mind it. It was dead quiet late at night and in the morning which I love. Great stay, would book again!
Ps - don’t let the road closed sign scare you. Drive right past it, you can’t miss the blue building."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Highly recommend!! I was looking for a place to stay between the Bay Area and San Diego- this home was ideal! It is much larger than seen in pictures and extremely accommodating. I had a great restful stay with my fiance and our dogs, we were able to work remotely and had all the amenities we needed. I will definitely try to book again on my next trip!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was. Great place to stay. Best place I’ve stayed in so far
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Easy experience! Just needed a place to stay for the night. Much appreciated!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Mike and Rachel place is very nice inside completely redone would highly recommend
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was great. Mike and Rachel were great host and were always quick to respond. This house was better than we thought. The pictures don’t do justice. It felt like home and just had such a relaxing feel. We didn’t want to leave! Would definitely recommend this house and I would book this place again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonder full
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Good place, it has everything you need and centric."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is my regular stop on our coastal road trip. Really clean, secure, and comfortable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely amazing hosts and amazing place to stay. Mike and Rachel are very helpful and their place is centrally located near freeways and great local food. The home is beautiful inside and has all the essential things you’ll need for your stay. And the place look like the pics. If you have a pet it is very convenient. If you don’t no worries because you wouldn’t know a pet has been inside. That’s how clean they keep it up. The bed and pullout couch is very comfortable! I highly recommend this place and will be visiting in the future. 5 stars!!!!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Booked with Mike and Rachel last minute, couldn’t have been more comfortable and happier with our stay. Check in was super simple, the unit was nice and cozy. Perfect little space for two. Did not disappoint."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very interesting closet. Beautiful bathroom and kitchen.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the place was so nice and better than any hotel in bakersfield. hosts are very nice and all instructions were easy to find and follow
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Place is cute. Location in the evening with multiple roadblocks and detours made it slightly difficult to find at first.
Noise from the attached neighbor late at night was unexpected and didn’t allow for a full nights rest unfortunately. Walls seem to be quite thin. Advertised coffee bar had no coffee. They complained after we left that their house cleaner found “spots of urine in 2 separate areas on the rugs.” We didn’t notice anything via sight or smell before we checked out. Our dogs are 2 small well trained dogs that we took out to potty multiple times that evening and early the morning before we left as we just stayed one night. However we agreed to pay an “extra pet fee” because we respect their home despite it being highly unlikely and irregular behavior from our house trained adult dogs. We stayed at another AirBNB that following day for a week and our pets had no accidents. So it just seems odd. I never heard back after messaging them that we would agree to pay the fee."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,one of if not the best arbnbs I've ever stayed at. it felt more like my own apartment then a rental. so much I can't even explain how wonderful of an experience I had. if I'm ever in town I'd recommend this place. giving it 10 stars is not enough.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As others have said, the pictures really don’t do this place justice. Lovely spacious accommodation. Everything you’d need for a comfy, homely stay. Would definitely stay again if I was ever in Bakersfield again."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The host was very easy to contact and available. The space is bigger than it appears in pictures and it seems so clean in each room in the patio area too especially for what concerns the barbecue! The are 2 smart TVs one in the bedroom very appreciated. Very suggested.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was lovely and we were delighted by all of the amenities. It was comfortable, homey and in a good location for access to major roadways. We cooked frequently and found the kitchen was well equipped for all that we needed. We had some difficulty with the grill that I don’t believe the hosts were aware of so hopefully that will be rectified and the internet went out in the middle of a movie, but it was too late at night to contact the hosts about this. Just minor inconveniences, so this did not take much away from our rating as the internet issue was out of their control. All in all, we were very happy here and would stay here again. Thank you for a lovely stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great apartment, easy to access. Overall a very comfortable stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was adorable! They left me a cute note, dog treats, and a bottle of wine. The TV was connected to streaming services already, the AC was cold and all the appliances were updated & modern."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience.
They had left easy instructions and a list of places to see and experience while staying in Bakersfield.
And a bottle of wine 🙌🏼
The place was very clean and the remodeling was quite impressive, especially compared to a higher-priced Airbnb I had recently stayed at.
Would definitely love to stay again.
The surrounding area did not give off the greatest vibes at first, but it was very peaceful and calm the entire week I was there. I loved how quiet it was.
Everything you can possibly need is provided here. The place is fully stocked.
You share a wall in the duplex with a neighbor I believe that lives there but you can not even notice they are there. Very nice ppl as well.
Also, everything functioned just as it should here!
Especially loved that I was able to park my truck-which has work equipment and tools inside-right next to the unit.
Lastly, Mike and Rachel responded immediately to any questions I had.
Would love to stay again."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice spacious and clean place set back from the street. It was perfect for a place to lounge around and rest.

It was very sweet of Mike and Rachel to provide a welcome gift for myself and my dogs.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stay here. I was a little nervous by a detour I had to take, but once I oriented myself, I was so happy to be staying in this immaculate and recently remodeled duplex. It had a great private patio for my pup to sniff around, easy off street parking, and the bed was so cozy! I hope this home is available the next time I’m passing through."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a wonderful place for just my husband and I to call home base on our weekend away. It was spotless and minimally decorated but cozy and welcoming (no clutter!). They even left a tasty surprise for us for our anniversary!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can’t say enough good things about this property. It really is a hidden gem in Bakersfield. I come up there often to visit my girlfriend and I have used other Airbnb’s and so far this one is my favorite. Mike was always very responsive and was a wonderful host. Mike and Rachel even left us a bottle of wine and some great bread for when we checked in. The remodel Mike did on this place was absolutely fantastic. I also had the pleasure of meeting Mike for a brief moment and have to say he is a great guy. This is definitely my first choice of places to stay in Bakersfield.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"A true Bakersfield gem!! Mike and Rachel are wonderful hosts and the place is cozy. They go the extra mile with making you feel right at home. For Bakersfield guest, they have made a booklet with restaurant recommendations and things to do while in town and the complimentary wine and snacks are a plus! The bed was super comfortable! I definitely recommend this place, and am looking forward to staying here again!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This house was perfect for our stay and is just as described. It is very clean, modern, and in a great location. The neighborhood is quiet, there is plenty of street parking, and it is in walking distance to grocery stores and restaurants. Would recommend this house to anyone needing a place to stay in Bakersfield!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was really terrific. It’s very clean and modern. It made the perfect gathering place for family with its ample parking. You really can walk to Trader Joe’s and Albertsons and Starbucks—you walk on a sidewalk alongside a road and then cross the road at a traffic/walk sign to reach the shopping plaza that contains these and other stores. The neighborhood is safe and peaceful. It was nice to have laundry machines at the house. Wonderful and deep bathroom tub!!! Would stay there again 🙂
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hasnain’s place is located in a great location close to restaurants and parks. Great neighborhood, the house itself is clean and has all of the amenities. The WiFi is a bit slow on the TV if you plan on watching Netflix or YouTube, but other than that our stay was great! The shower is amazing!
No shoes inside either but not a big deal."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great bathroom and comfortable beds. Clean, but the house was a little stuffy and had a funky smell! It was fine for a short term stay."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome Stay!! This place was one of the best places that I have ever stayed. I would definitely stay again!! Thank you!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at this Airbnb for the Labor Day weekend and it was the perfect home to stay in for the two of us. The location is perfect as it is within a 20 minute driving radius to go to the main areas in Bakersfield. The bedroom is spacious, has a tv setup and dimming lights as well. The shower has a hand held nozzle and also a waterfall head, which was amazing after a long day in the heat."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed here for two months with 2 adults and 1 baby. The check-in was very smooth although we arrived late in the evening. Hasnain provided very clear instruction beforehand. The location of the house is very convenient even though we don’t drive. Stockdale shopping center is within walk-in distance for groceries, coffee and dining. The neighbourhood is quiet and safe. We went jogging quite often in the morning.
The house is consistent with the description and pictures. The digital control is convenient. TV screen is big so it’s good for people who want to watch TV/movie a lot. Kitchen setup is complete. We cook our own meals for most of the days. The only small issue is that one sofa and the beddings are a bit too soft for us.
Hasnain is a very kind host. He’s very responsive with our requests and queries. Because our stay was long, he was accommodative for mailbox and deliveries.
Overall a nice experience and thanks for Hasnain’s hosting!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed staying at Hasnain's house. I stayed here three times for my work trips and I would stay more often if it wasn't so booked. I highly recommend staying here, it is very clean, modern and quiet. Hasnain is an excellent host that is very easy to communicate with. The only negative I could think of is that his place is so nice, it is always booked. :)"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is in a perfect location; convenient to nice restaurants and shops., and all major highways. It is clean, quiet, safe and so easy to access! We highly recommend this as a wonderful place to stay!"

2021-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice clean place, no real complaints just had mediocre wifi and the kitchen didn’t have many useful items for cooking and such. But it was very clean and comfortable all the way around."
2021-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Hasain's place is an authentic home that reflects the owners, which is rather preferred over pretty and shallow staged homes. It is a bit on the small side for a family of 4 with lots of stuff like us, but for smaller groups should be fine. Bathrooms were well upgraded and comfortable, and a bonus to have a BBQ grill. We had to get our own coffee but I'm sure that's a one off thing."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! This was my 2nd time staying here, and was again blown away by the amenities, the comfort and the care to make my stay a great one!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and lovely home! Thanks for having us there!

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The townhouse is exactly as described and more. It has been refurbish with modern touches with an amazing rain shower, the kitchen is well stocked. check-in was also very busy. I recommend this place and I will use again for future visits."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"These accommodations are classy and elegant, yet cozy and very comfortable. I’m a fan of tech savvy living, but have never experienced it, and it was luxurious. No shoes allowed so bring slippers; a welcomed house rule. Hasnain is a wonderful host, very attentive if you have a concern or question. We have a toddler so the stairs took getting used to, and nicer amenities had to be protected more so than in a less upscale place but we made do! Highly recommended :)"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable Airbnb. Comfy beds, huge shower, and easily controlled heating and AC. Everything we needed was provided. I especially loved the dimmable lights in every room and the electric blinds. I highly recommend Hasnain’s place."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hasnain’s place was a thing of beauty. Communication was a breeze. Checking in and out was super easy. I would definitely choose his place the next time I’m in town! He is also very fast at responding! A+
2020-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed at Hasnain's Place for 2 months as we moved to Bakersfield. The arrival was exceptional, the house felt cozy from the very beginning. Communication with Hasnain was easy and as soon as we pointed out a couple of things we needed he was there right away with them. The location is great and within walking distance to Trader Joe's and Albertson's. Beds were super comfortable and plenty of linens available. Also really nice to have supplies and toiletries at hand without having to buy them. I would definitely recommend Hasnain's for short or longer time! Thanks so much for sharing it with us!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,overall it is a really nice place to stay in Arvin

2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was a perfect place to stay .
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spot was exactly what we were looking for, a respite from the road for 2 nights. It was comfortable. Good shower, comfy bed & spacious couch just like in the photos. We were not here to visit Bakersfield so the location near the outskirts of town was perfect for us, a quick & easy on/off from Hwy 5 when traveling south to Palm Springs/San Diego. Met Elizabeth after we checked ourselves in with the keypad & contacted her to ask for some extra silverware & a corkscrew. The family lives next door & are very nice. They are friendly but don’t impinge on your privacy at all. It has a small kitchenette unit, but I wouldn’t plan on cooking there, other than a little breakfast. This is ideal for a business trip, with easy streaming for entertainment & WiFi that works. It was perfect for what my husband & I needed, which was a homey beautifully decorated break from the car journey for 2 nights, with zero traffic in the neighborhood & a quiet spot to relax. Would return again!"
2023-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Air bnb is connected to house so it’s not the safest or most private way to stay. The owners can walk in at anytime.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Very cute, clean place.
Elizabeth and Francisco were very responsive.
Great stay.
This place is nearby an elementary and middle schools, so I would just be aware of school traffic in surrounding streets in the am before school and when school is out.
But other than that no problems or concerns."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,I travel for work and wanted something different than a hotel. This place is its own little space with a beautiful design and in a quiet neighborhood with plenty around to eat. The beds very comfortable and had LOTS of pillows. 10/10 I will stay here again for sure

It was super clean, modern decor, homey feel, safe neighborhood with a washer and dryer in unit (even though we didn'tstay long enough to use it). The only hiccup we had was the code we received to enter and unlock the door did not work, we messaged them and got a response with the correct code right away, I was very impressed at the responsiveness since it was about 1:30am. They were very nice, great communication, easy check in. The AC was a huge plus! A reserved parking spot in the driveway. A++. We enjoyed our stay, thank you!"

2023-11-01,4,Group trip,"Decent 4 bedroom home in Bakersfield with 2 bathrooms. Overall, was spacious and convenient to an event we attended. The place is a bit dated and could use some upgrades such as in the bathrooms and the paint. The garage opener did not work and the living room light/fan did not work either. There was an alternative lamp there that we were able to use. There is not a keyless entry, which would have been helpful given that we had multiple people staying with us. One of the bedrooms has glass doors that open into the kitchen so not much privacy. Overall, it was convenient and the beds were comfortable and it fulfilled our needs for the 2 nights we stayed there."

2023-10-01,4,Group trip,"We had to let Maribel know about some things in the home-broken closet doors, left over trash in one of the dressers. The guest bathroom toilet isn’t sealed to the tile. We didn’t see the waterfall for the pool come on nor the pool filter. We had to clean the pool in the mornings with the provided pool net.
Besides minor things that can be cleaned ourselves or worked around, we had a great time and a nice stay here. We would consider staying in this home again in the future."

2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Maribel was great with communication and her place had just about all the comforts of home. Pool was fun and having our own garage to park in was great. One negative was the neighbor’s dog(s) that were out back nonstop barking day and night. One time they let the dogs in at 4am, second time they were left out to bark all night and were still barking when we checked out in the morning. Light sleepers might have some trouble trying to sleep in the master bedroom closest to those dogs."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I am a continuous repeat guest. This is the CLEANEST house I've ever seen! Just absolutely pristine every time. I appreciate the bottles of water in my room & snacks. The main reason that I stay here over and over is that they allow me to park my small work vehicle INSIDE their garage. They even give you your own clicker!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It was again a very nice experience at the place. It is my best Airbnb experience among all the places I have stayed. A blessed place!

Felt right at home. Super clean and organized. I would recommend and I would come back if necessary. Thank you!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow! Mary Jane and Emmanuel's place blew me away! I was in the process of driving very long distance on a short time frame, and the road is long, tiring, and cold. Their place was the best break I can ask for on this trip. Since I usually opt for the cheapest option in a situation like this (just to stop late at night, sleep, and leave early), I never expect much, especially since most places nowadays have misleading photos making it look better than it is. But once I arrived, I felt like I arrived at a spa. Exceptionally clean, everything is quality (shoes off at the door, snacks in the room with water), you can tell Mary Jane and Emmanuel really care about their business and are very professional. For once, I naturally slept in the full 8 hours because I normally NEVER feel at home on the road.. Would absolutely return if the opportunity arises! Thank you for your hospitality!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,My friend & I loved our stay! It was top notch. I especially loved being able to park in the garage. The bed was comfortable and the room was spotless. Thank you!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was my first time using Airbnb, so I was very nervous about staying in someone else's home. Mary Jane and Emmanuel made the entire process easy and manageable with their proactive and quick communication. They were flexible with my late arrival and ensured that I was welcomed to a clean room with snacks and water. It was a really thoughtful touch for me, and I felt comfortable enough to quickly fall asleep. I woke up the next morning feeling refreshed and ready to finish my work trip. I would absolutely book again if needed!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed here for one night and it was a really nice place. The room was clean and the neighborhood was quiet The only problem I had was that you have to input the address manually and not from the shortcut in the Airbnb app. If you use the app shortcut it will send you to a different house This is not the hosts fault but a glitch with the app which will probably be fixed soon. Overall it was clean, close to many stores, and just a really nice house. I will stay again if I'm in the area."

Highly recommend"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am a repeat guest and this is one of the best air b and b's ever. The host is very accommodating for each guest.
Snacks are in the room and water. Everything is clean and spotless. The home is decorated beautifully. And the best thing is they allow you your own parking spot in the garage and they give you a clicker. This is especially amazing to me as I am usually here in my fully loaded work vehicle. I also very much appreciate the gorgeous Christmas decorations.
I can't wait to come back"

Other than that it was quiet and safe. We’re grateful 🙏💫"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a really nice quick stay at Mary Jane’s ! Instructions were really clear, the neighbourhood was really quiet and cute. We had no issue to find the place and it is quite close (by car) to some fast foods and a Walmart. We did not use the kitchen. The bathroom was super nice. We could use the garage to park our car which was super useful. We asked if it was possible to do some laundry because we came back from a week in Yosemite but since we stayed only for one night it was not allowed. However we found a laundromat not far from the house so it was all good. Mary Jane was super reactive :)"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a wonderful stay here on our way back from a wedding road trip. We only spent the tail-end of a night here, but it was a clean, comfortable, and beautiful place to wash off, rest, and reset for the next leg of our course! The house is very clean, large, and nicely decorated! I felt very comfortable and welcomed. We did not have much interaction with the hosts, as they allowed us to chill in our own space, but we did say hello in the morning as we took a look at the beautiful garden! There were also cute little frogs in the driveway which I enjoyed! They also provided us with freshly laundered towels, waters, and some snacks. Very thoughtful! Would stay again!"

The room is super clean, as well as bathroom, qualitative mattress, very cozy and not cold as in many places here!
Hosts are very friendly and respond super fast, they really do their best for guests to feel their stay comfortable!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay was very nice. Extremely quiet and extremely responsive host. The room was really clean and super comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay and will be staying here again when I make this trip again.
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Mjc's house and their guest room was beautiful and pristine. The host made great effort to put the small touches on our stay, including coffee and tea in the morning, space in the fridge for our food, and a number of amenities in the bedroom & bathroom, and a beautiful backyard area. Mjc is highly communicative and left clear instructions to easily get into the house with flexible check in hours.
There is a quiet time after 10pm, however sound carries very easily in the house and you can hear most noises, including the garage door which is right next to the bedrooms, doors opening, and other guests entering the bathroom. If you're a light sleeper, definitely bring earplugs or white noise compensation. The bedrooms have thick memory foam toppers, which can be comfy or uncomfy depending on your preference!
Overall, great place to recharge in Bakersfield, albeit a little noisy for us."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,I have been a regular in Mjc’s home. I have been in other homes in Bakersfield but nothing compares with Mjc’s. It’s always the best! Definitely my home away from home.🏡
