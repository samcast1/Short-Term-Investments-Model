2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel's place was, as always, very comfortable with all the necessary amenities. Rachel is a sweetheart, always engaging and delightful. Her little house is our ""home"" in Bennettsville!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks Rachel awesome stay & we appreciate you having extra amenities
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place !
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is our 2nd stay and I feel sure it won't be our last!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It is always a pleasure to stay here. Rachel is an amazing hostess and always makes sure we have what we want and need for our stay. Very responsive with messages and very courteous.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have become regulars staying at Rachel's place. The little house is always welcoming and comfortable. Rachel is the sweetest and most proactive host we've had in our entire AirBnB experience (and that's over 75 different hosts). She always looks for ways to make our stay more pleasant, relaxing and enjoyable."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Rachel was an amazing host, she was very helpful with getting to know the area and responsive to any need or questions we had.
The cottage is in a nice, secluded area with a nice privacy fence of mature bamboo, and the yard was nice and spacious for our 3 dogs. Lots of beautiful trees and flowers!
Everything you could need for small home living is there. We were able to cook in the kitchen and do laundry easily since we had an extended stay. TV and board games are there for you too in case of inclement weather.
Rachel also gave us a binder with suggestions for food spots and things to do in the area. It even had the history of the property!
Highly recommend staying here if you need a quiet place to get away or as a nice base of operations for exploring the area!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great overnight stay in Rachel's home! It was cozy and clean, and the perfect location for a quick break while driving up the East Coast. Rachel was proactive and helpful with her communications, which was much appreciated. The house had everything we needed, and the snacks and drinks Rachel left for us were such a nice touch. The fresh ground coffee was excellent!! We would recommend Rachel's home!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was an overnight visit. So we did not get to enjoy Rachels place. It was spacious, lots of yard space and a carport. Everything appeared to be working as it should. I have to say that Rachel went out of her way to make sure the sofa bed was made, which made our stay that much enjoyable. Thank you!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time at Rachel's place, and it's just as great as before. Such a lovely and responsive host! And I always feel confy and right at home. I will be always be staying here again if I get the chance when n town working"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rachel‚Äôs Little House is delightful. My wife and I have stayed with Rachel several times and it has always been wonderful. She is a sweet and very considerate host and the cottage is comfortable and perfectly spacious for two. When I get to Bennettsville Rachel‚Äôs place feels like ‚Äúcoming home‚Äù!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The cottage was idyllic. I had everything I needed. I felt relaxed, & secure. Initially I booked to stay one week, until repairs on my house were finished, but this turned into 4 weeks."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Rachael was a very communicative hostess, even coming over to welcome us upon arrival and happy to assist with any needed items or recommendations.
The space is tidy and exactly as described with all items you need to prepare meals and relax. Plenty of blankets, towels, sheets. Loved the heated bathroom!
The only issue is bed is rather noisy if you move, a smaller sized queen and mattress isn‚Äôt particularly new or comfy. The sofa is also a pop out bed though so hubby opted to sleep there on 2nd night and we both got a little bit better sleep.
We do definitely recommend Rachael‚Äôs place, great value."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay here. The house was clean and ready for our stay. The host was very kind ahead of time and left little goodies for our old pup. She was also kind enough to leave us some creamer, which tends to be the thing I forget to bring along.
The house felt private and the yard was great.
For my SCA friends looking for a place close to the Girl Scout camp on Ebenezer Rd, you can't get much more convenient at 11 miles away!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The flexible check-in was great as it allowed us to arrive later than we anticipated due to storms on our drive. Rachel was very responsive to our messages and questions. She offered us farm fresh eggs which were amazing and the coffee she provided was excellent (need to find out how to order some üòÅ). Rachel was very sweet and I could‚Äôve talked all day with her if we hadn‚Äôt had to leave ! This was an excellent choice for our stay and we will be back.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home was a very cozy and comfortable place to stay with our puppies. The dog treats and toy made their stay special. The coffee, tea and creamers left for us was very much appreciated. We will definitely stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Rachel was super responsive and friendly. Checked in on us, and made sure we had everything we need. Thanks!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This little cottage is so cozy and comfortable. Everything was spotless. We drive back and forth to Florida from PA with pets and this place is such a little gem. Rachel is awesome and does everything she can to make your stay enjoyable. It‚Äôs small but has a huge heart. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre in the area and looking for a nice, comfortable place to lay your head.. looking forward to booking in our way back up to PA in the spring. Such a precious little place‚ù§Ô∏è!!!"

The house was very well stocked with anything you might need, from bathroom products to spices and other accessories in the kitchen. Rachel and her husband were super nice and had great communication and very responsive. And their dogs were super cute and loving too! Will definitely stay here again if I get the chance."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Melissa was a great host. The place was very clean and overall perfect. I would definitely rent again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If have any reason to go Bennettsville, SC, Melissa's house is the perfect stay. Comfortable beds and nice linens, my number 1 requirement for an AirBnb. House is decorated nicely and clean too. We were there for work. This house is close to downtown. However, not much going on in 'ol Bennettsville, which is pretty standard for most towns in the Sandhills. So, keep that in mind. That said, I was surprised how nice the house was."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Melissa‚Äôs home was one, if not the best, Airbnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve stayed at so far. This is a perfect place for a couple or small family looking f outfits a wonderful stay in South Carolina.
Located in a quaint neighborhood with kind & friendly neighbors, the home itself was impeccably designed & decorated, as well as fully equipped and extremely comfortable and homey. Farm fresh eggs and a selection of snacks and drinks awaited us upon arrival. The house was just the right size and an offered a wonderful front porch with comfy seating to relax on and watch the day roll by. Luxurious linens and soft beds brought sweet dreams to all after a long day of traveling.
If you get a chance to stop in South Carolina, choose Melissa‚Äôs home and experience true Southern Hospitality & Charm. You will not be disappointed.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My employer said this house was very clean, comfortable and looked like it had been decorated by an artist.

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"My cousin stayed at Melissa's place before and recommended it. I was in town for my Aunt funeral and Melissa's place was comfortable felt just like home. Melissa was very accommodating to our needs in this time of grief and my family and I are very thankful for her. Melissa let us use her place for a little repass after the service and provide things for us for no extra charge. The place was clean and easy to find. I HIGHLY recommend using Melissa and her services. She was outstanding.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the coziness and personality of the home. The beds were so comfortable!!! We enjoyed playing backgammon and thought the fruit, eggs and beverages left for us were over and beyond hospitable. Would definitely love to stay here again."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,Melissa‚Äôs place was nice for our over night stay. We had a party of 8 so it was a bit crowded but worked for overnight.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Melissa‚Äôs place was great. Felt right at home with great amenities and lots of space.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The Puple Heart was the perfect place to stay with friends from out of town after a day of packing up my house getting ready to move. Cozy and inviting.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Melissa‚Äôs place was perfect for what we needed it for - a home base while in town for Thanksgiving visiting family. The welcome basket snacks and wine were much appreciated! The place is very nicely decorated, the neighborhood is safe and the house is within walking distance to downtown Bennettsville. Melissa even put up a Christmas tree and had the front porch decorated which made us feel even more at home. Five stars!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is exactly as pictured. The neighborhood was quiet and the front porch with lights was a great place to relax. The rooms were a good size and there was plenty of space for the 5 of us We had a general question and Melissa was very prompt in responding. Overall a great experience!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time. We felt at home. Place was so comfy and private. We loved it. Definitely we will be back. Melissa was really nice and responsive.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was such a unique experience! You are literally in a carriage house with horse stables across from the living area. So fun! The property is beautiful and loved seeing our dogs runs and sniff everything! Definitely would recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We've stayed in other AirB&Bs because our children are dogs...really...and motels don't welcome folks with four dogs. That being said, we were surprised and please that our kids had a lot of space, fenced in space, to exp!ore ( my guess maybe 2 acres). Provided for us was some beer, wine, and snack treats. For the morning was coffee to brew, English muffins, bagels, jelly, and cream cheese. There were juice drinks and some small cheese thingie and crackers to have with the wine. Okay, let me tell you about the bed...well, the mattress. I sleep and have lower back pain. When I get up it's there, but after a bit it disappears. As soon as I laid down I noticed a difference...no aches or pain. When I got up...nothing. So, a surprise benefit. So, for me and my wife, as well as Sigmund, Oliver, Cowboy Bob, and Milo Muffin...we rate is stay a 5 star."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved the carriage house! Extremely peaceful, quiet and serene. Superb getaway from the city. Melissa is an excellent host; responsive and personable. Would definitely stay with her again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing and quiet. A very Unique place to stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay, was a good way to break up a long drive. Perfect for dogs!!"
2024-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Melissa was very friendly and helpful. The place was perfect for our dog who loved it as she had a huge fenced property to explore and run in and access to the barn so she could come and go, unless closed into one of the rooms. This would be a great place for people with horses, too, as the horses would be in the same barn you are in, their large stalls right across the center aisle from your rooms (Melissa has no horses, so there were none there when we stayed). The layout was interesting as the three rooms (bedroom, bath and kitchen) looked to have once been stalls that were converted. They each had a separate door that opened onto the barns center aisle that you used to get from one to the other. The views were nice and the porch would have been nice to sit on, but the weather was drizzly and all the porch furniture was wet. The bathroom was serviceable, but rustic. Full sized fridge, toaster oven and microwave for the kitchen. Overall, the place had the feel of a nice summer camp!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great thank you
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was my third stay at Melissa‚Äôs and we enjoy it every time. She goes above and beyond for her guests and we love the uniqueness of the place. My dogs loved the space to run and enjoyed the extras, like toys, that she puts out for them. We will be back when we‚Äôre in the area again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful and charming carriage house on a beautiful property- can‚Äôt wait to visit again for a longer stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A Dog Lover's Paradise at Burch's Carriage House üêæ
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Our stay at Burch's Carriage House with Melissa in Society Hill, SC, was nothing short of magical. Traveling with dogs üêï‚Äçü¶∫ü¶Æcan be a challenge, but Melissa made it effortless.
THREE acres, provided our dogs a secure and fenced area to roam & explore to their hearts' content. Melissa's love for dogs was evident in every detail, from the welcoming atmosphere to her own sweet pups greeting us through the fence. üêï üê© üêæ
The deck was a highlight, offering a touch of civilized luxury as we grilled & dined al fresco. But it was the Breezeway that stole our hearts, providing a cool retreat for both humans & canines alike. üçîüê∂ üêæ
The cleanliness of the entire property, including the manicured three acres, was impressive. Even our dog with an old paw injury could run & play comfortably.
While there may be more to explore in the area, we were perfectly content to bask in the tranquility of Burch's Carriage House. üíïü¶¥üêæ"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you want to get away from Society, come to Society Hill and stay at this peaceful unique place, bring your pups and they can run on a 3 acre fenced in yard which was amazing. I will definitely be a repeat visitor."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a place for 2 people with pets and a desire for the unusual, and also enjoy pristine cleanliness, a comfortable bed, fresh air, and thoughtful amenities, this is the place for you! All the better if one of your animals is a horse, because 10 feet from your bedroom door is a roomy and immaculate stall( actually two.)
You can watch the sun set from your deck - or enjoy coffee in the am there! Melissa is a very responsive hostess and is willing to do anything to make your stay memorable! Don‚Äôt think twice-rent this adorable place-you will not be disappointed!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Happy repeat customer. Have been coming here for many years. Ideal place for me and my dogs to escape the cold New England winters.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time, melissa was very helpful and kind and made the stay very nice."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved the location and so did my fur baby!!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We travel with our 2 labs and this is the perfect place to stay. Not only does it have a small fenced in area but also a much larger one where our dogs can roam free. It is always quiet and peaceful there. Melissa always makes sure you know how to get in and where everything is. She is also always available if you need anything. Accommodations are great. It is always clean and in perfect condition. This was our second stay and next time we are in that area, we will be sure to stay there again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place was as pictured. The best feature was the space for my dog to play! Melissa provided welcome treats and many thoughtful features.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I was in town by myself with my dog and this place was perfect. Exactly what I needed for a weekend visit. Not much around in terms of restaurants etc. but I went to the IGA in Cheraw and had everything I needed.
I‚Äôll definetly be back."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My daughter is in an annual horse show about 30 minutes from Melissa's adorbable place. We needed to bring our dogs with us this time. We just loved it there and were able to get out of our car after a long drive and let the dogs run. The carriage house itself is so well done and comfortable. The dogs had safe ways in and out which took the stress out of them getting away. Unfortunately, it was cold and rainy but we felt warm and comfortable inside. There were even treats for my daughter and a glass of wine for the mom! Thank you for being so accomodating Melissa!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Quiet and private. Huge area for dogs to run and play.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had another great stay here on my way from Florida to Maryland. My dog loved running around the huge fenced yard. It was a great reprieve from I-95 and long driving days.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Was driving through and needed a place to stay with my dog, and Melissa‚Äôs was perfect! I loved that I could let my dog run around in the fenced-in area, and the accommodations themselves were cozy and unique."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The carriage house was exactly what we were looking for. Quiet, private, simple, comfortable and extremely dog friendly. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to stay while we were down for the holidays. Our puppies loved the field and I loved how secure I felt with them running freely. The property is well fenced in so I was more at ease letting them explore. We‚Äôll definitely stay here again next time we‚Äôre in SC!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We love unique and we love dog friendly, and this place is both! Host also called a local restaurant that her friend owns to let them know it was our wedding weekend! Super friendly and helpful, great experience!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place and perfect for me as I was running retriever (dog) trial at H Cooper Blavk about 15 mins away. Wonderful host‚Ä¶.!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was just what I was looking for as a place to rest for me and my dogs. The whole area was fenced in and they loved being able to explore and smell everything, while also being safe. The barn house was so clean and a beautiful and unique experience. Melissa was easy to reach and helpful with any questions. Thanks so much for everything Melissa! Ziggy, Titus and I hope to be back sometime!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My mother used to say to us. ""Close the door! Do you think you live in a barn?""
Well, I could have said yes this past weekend. What an eclectic place but perfect for our needs with our dogs.
It was quite cold at night but the heaters worked well and kept us comfortable. Speaking of comfortable, the beds were great.
We loved the deck off the bedroom where we could sit out and watch the dogs enjoy the yard.
We look forward to coming back."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was a great place to stay, very close to our dog competition, and nice place to come back to after a cold rainy day‚Ä¶fenced in yard was perfect for the dogs"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I don't think the airbnb listing does this place justice. If you have a dog 100% go here. Traveling with a pet can be difficult, especially a bigger dog that needs exercise. Melissa was so thoughtful in preparing this airbnb to think of anything we might need. Dog toys, dog treats, even dog shampoo! But the biggest thing was that the entire area was fenced in, so my dog could run anywhere and I could relax without worrying. She also had snacks and even some wine and beer which was really helpful as after the drive we wanted to stay in for dinner and had snacks for dinner. She has an apple TV in the room, a space heater for when it got cold, even a heater in the bathroom. I hope we get the chance to return!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here as a respite from the road traveling from FL to NJ with our dog. She was very happy to be able to roam freely and explore the grounds. The snacks, breakfast items and drinks were enjoyable and thoughtful. All of our needs were met and exceeded. Beds were comfy. Plenty of towels in the bathroom. We felt welcome, safe and relaxed.
Will stay here on the way back to FL."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay again and Champ (our dog) loved it as well. See y‚Äôall soon. Thanks
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet and beautiful property. Melissa was a great host. I called her personally due to traffic delays, and she was more than happy to talk and work with me for check in.I will definitely stay agin should I get the chance!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my favorite Air BNB. I love the barn (I grew up in horse barns so it feels like home). Mellissa always provides thoughtful extras like snacks and toiletries. She is a wonderful host.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Melissa was wonderful and just a true joy. Our dogs LOVED the property and the location is perfect off I-95. And TRUST Melissa when she gives you a restaurant recommendation-phenomenal meal and full bellies were achieved.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Best place to stay if you are traveling with dogs. Our dogs look forward to getting out of the car after a long day and running around the massive fenced yard! It is the best!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second short stay at Melissa's place, and I highly recommend this beautiful getaway!! I'm looking forward to our stay in the fall."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa is a fantastic host, can‚Äôt say enough about the property, absolutely gorgeous, we will be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this place. Great value, all though nothing was walkable it was very close to a ton of stuff to do and restaurants."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It's absolutely stunning!! 10/5 star. super accommodating and way nicer in person. I would highly recommend it if you're looking for a unique getaway. So peaceful and beautiful! I will definitely be back for an extended period of time.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Melissa is such a great host and the property was so charming! We felt right at home. It‚Äôs quiet and peaceful üòä
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place to stay the night w/pets while driving the 95 from FL to VA!
We have two energetic corgis and loved having a large space where they could run free without worrying about them getting hit by a car. Once we closed the gate, we were in a completely fenced in area and didn‚Äôt have to worry about keeping them leashed.
There was also a smaller pen that they could run around in when we wanted to keep them contained.
The beds were comfy and everything was clean. Melissa was also easy to reach for assistance.
If you‚Äôre someone who needs the room to be super cool at night, I wouldn‚Äôt stay here during the summer, but otherwise‚Äîwe can‚Äôt recommend this place enough and look forward to staying here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent place. Melissa was very hospitable and accommodating.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Best place for us and our furry baby. We felt right at home and look forward to another visit in the future.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay at Melissa‚Äôs carriage house. We came through from CT with 3 horses, our dog and our cat on our way to FL. Melissa was so accommodating from booking to check in and through our stay. We, including the animals, had a very restful night. We will definitely stay at the carriage house again on our way through."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Melissa was an amazing host and very good with communication. I think out of all the Airbnbs I have stayed this was the best. I would be happy to stay again. I highly recommend a stay here!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place along our route. Wish we could have stayed longer. Our dogs especially loved the huge fenced in yard to run while we unpacked the car.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot... peaceful, private, and comfortable. Melissa is awesome!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at the carriage house, the space is truly unique, and it was more than perfect for our two dogs. Not only is there a spacious fenced in space right off the deck but Melissa let us know the whole several acre lot was available and fenced in as well. Melissa as a host was very responsive and accommodating, as well as the space being stocked with goodies and all the essentials you may need. We were in town visiting family and were more than pleased with this relaxing space for us and our animals to come back to. We would happily return anytime we visit in the future, and only wished we had more time to spend there!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a great place so peaceful and beautiful surroundings, Melissa is a great host nothing like a beer in a frosted mug after 10 hours on the road.
We will definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic service, peaceful surroundings, and our dog‚Äôs new favorite place to be!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a fun Airbnb. The grounds were immaculate and the setting was very peaceful. Only the sounds of the birds. Tons of fenced in space for our dog to run around. Lots of special touches including snacks and drinks. Super comfortable beds. We hope to return in September.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed eating my dinner on the deck looking at the peaceful countryside. My dog enjoyed the fully fenced yard with lots of space to explore.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Could not have asked for a more peaceful place for my family to relax and for my child and dogs to safely run around. Perfect road trip stop for us but I would also gladly come back and spend a long weekend here. It‚Äôs a private and gorgeous property, Melissa was so kind and helpful. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you have animals, and you are traveling anywhere close to this place, you have seriously got to stay at least one night!
Its by far the most ANIMAL FRIENDLY place we have ever stayed. There are different size pens for your animals to run free. Not only that, this place is soo tranquil, you can definitely find a piece of mind here. We will definitely be returning."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful property, stayed overnight on my way north from Florida. Was farther from 95 than I expected, but that is my mistake, not that of the owner. My dog was able to run free after a long drive. Thank you for a nice stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It‚Äôs a beautiful place in a lovely historic town. Peaceful, quiet with so much safe dog room to roam. The carriage house is beautifully equipped and very comfortable! One side is stable for horses, scrupulously clean. The twin beds are in a cozy room with a comfy reading chair, books and tv. The roomy bathroom has a huge shower with great water pressure! The kitchen has everything you need to cook. Super nice touch: a variety of breakfast treats and accompaniments make breakfast quick and easy! They had my husband at frozen frosted beer mugs! After a long day driving, to sit on the beautiful deck, watch the sun go down and quaff a super cold beer was so welcome! To repeat that in the morning with a hot mug of coffee while listening to the dawn chorus was bliss! We‚Äôd love to stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful. Melissa had charcoal for us to use on a grill and we cooked steaks outside, then ate on the deck as we watched the sun go down. She communicated constantly via text to check on us and give us instructions. My son and I go to an annual event in the area and I hope this place is available next year."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"this is my most favorite Air bnb. Melissais a wonderful hostess, everything you need she provides I look forward to my twice a year stay at this wonderful place. very high recommended!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Happy repeat customer
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Unique pet-friendly location with a wonderful host ! So appreciated all the details and comforts -from a fridge filled with goodies and wine & cheese, to a lending library. We had a wonderful sleep on very comfy beds and even our cat felt right at home . I‚Äôm a history buff and our host Melissa was a font of utterly fascinating local history ! Would definitely stay again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely and peaceful overnight stay. Just what the dogs and I needed in the middle of an 18 hour car ride. Super-secure fenced-in area allowed me to relax while the pups sniffed around. Host Melissa is very kind and thoughtful.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved both Melissa and her property. She is a local historian and can provide historical details of the town including both revolutionary and civil war details. The town of society Hill, while small, has a lot of historically significance buildings. It is very interesting. Melissa did a great job of directing us to surrounding towns for restaurants, activities, etc. we loved the property and so did our dogs. We would love to go back."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a lovely stay, thanks to Melissa. Anything you could need, she had stocked. It‚Äôs such a neat place, and she‚Äôs thought of everything to make it warm and comfortable. The dogs loved running and exploring. The deck looks so nice for warm weather. Very comfortable, private and cozy! Thank you, Melissa!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great experience. Just what we were looking for. Host was pleasant and willing to accommodate needs.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved the historic area and the seclusion of the accommodations. Our very active Golden/Irish Setter loved the ability to run free and chase her ball. We stayed during a very cold snap but stayed cozy warm in the bedroom. Melissa was so kind to tell us some of the history of the area which was of interest to us. We loved staying in a place so steeped in history.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Well let me start with , dogs love the place !! Melissa was very helpful and even give me recommendations about places to go. Place looks great feels like home and pepper and Twix love the place . I wish I could stay longer but I will definitely give 5 stars. Beverages and snacks are good especially when you time is very limited to go buy something, sitting patio is also great even a place to make fire . I would definitely come back . Thanks Melissa ."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It is a great place to stay. Perfect for our needs with a great fenced in yard for our dog. Lots of room around the area and there was a lot of great touches from decorations to snacks and deonks left. We will be staying there again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was great, we don‚Äôt travel much with our dogs so we were anxious about what to expect. The large property entirely fenced in was great. We didn‚Äôt do much more than sleep and get back on the road so just having a spot for our dogs to safely stretch their legs and explore was very worth it!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Though a very short stay, the Carriage House was everything we expect it to be and more! Lovely and peaceful surroundings. We had a restful respite from our long drive, and our dogs loved the space. They were able to run free and chase squirrels. Melissa is a great hostess, extremely responsive, helpful and flexible. The place itself is full of character, with nice touches, clean and we felt right at home. Definitely will be back, and maybe next time spend more time there, to enjoy the peace and quiet."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were blessed to be able to stay here during Christmas 2022. What a beautiful piece of property. We were in town to drop off our dog (Barley) to her trainer (Lake Effect Gun Dogs). This location is perfect for those sending any time at H Cooper Black. This place had everything that we needed to stay a full week. If we are back in the area for any reason, Melissa's place would be my first choice. I do believe that our three dogs loved this place as much as we did."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I love this place. And now I‚Äôm spoiled because Melissa provides so many extras that other places don‚Äôt. Coffee, snacks, thoughtful extras to make your stay cozy."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second trip staying with Melissa. We love her space, she‚Äôs very responsive and helpful. It‚Äôs the perfect place if you‚Äôre traveling with your furry companion. I cannot recommend her place enough."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I always look forward to my stay at Melissa's while I'm in south Carolina. it's peaceful, and I love the space for my dogs. Melissa is a wonderful host. I will always stay here when I visit south Carolina, thank you for such a wonderful place to stay"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,peaceful and dog friendly- nice to be well off of rte 15
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Always a pleasure to stay here.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Well, this just might be my favorite Airbnb ever! It is definitely not fancy or glamorous but just exactly what I needed after being in the car with my dogs for eight hours! I was traveling alone and needed a place to stay that was halfway between northern Virginia and central Florida where I could rest, relax, feel safe, and keep my canine companions entertained and busy, and this little gem checked off all the boxes. As soon as we drove through the double gate, and opened the car doors, we (the dogs and me) were in fenced-in, beautifully manicured, straight out of cozy country living heaven! Everything was beautiful, loved, and so obviously cared for! It seemed as though every time I turned around there was a special touch or sweet surprise that was exactly what I needed at that very moment. I‚Äôm hungry, and there was a basket of snacks! Oh, I meant to grab a Diet Coke, and there was a stash of drinks in the fridge. Water for the dogs? A huge bowl and attached hose were right there! I need to answer emails, and voila I found myself sitting on the deck enjoying pure zen and comfort while my dogs were eagerly exploring acres of fenced in farm land! I need more light, turn and there was a light switch! Check in and out were seamless and I‚Äôm still wondering how in the world a barn could be so clean and comfy! I imagined what fun it would be to live there, but honestly there is absolutely NOTHING around which was just what I was looking for but probably not what everyone else might want in an overnight. But if you want a place to re-charge in the middle of a 95 road trip and find yourself in South Carolina, you should check this place out! I will definitely be staying again in this little slice of heaven. My dogs wouldn‚Äôt have if any other way!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Not sure who enjoyed the stay more, our dog or us; our dog loved running in the field, we enjoyed the peace and quiet. Thanks,"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great place to stay, especially if you have pets. My two dogs had the best time roaming the property. Melissa provides toys, treats, towels, blankets, and water dishes for the dogs. For humans, there is wine, cheese, chocolate, drinks, and items for a continental breakfast. We look forward to staying again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place to stay. Melissa is great with communication and accompanying any requests. Highly recommend when traveling with pets

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The carriage house was a very unique stay with great accommodations for our horses. The house was clean and beautifully decorated. We loved the back deck!!!
Host Melissa was very accommodating and communications with her were top notch! We will be back for sure!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Carriage House is a beautiful, well appointed place to stay. It‚Äôs very comfortable and clean. Melissa, the host, is warm and welcoming, and makes you feel at home. Very highly recommended."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is all about the dogs, and our puppy could run, do zoomies, and play. I never worried for her safety once on this property because of how its setup with secure fencing and plenty of room. Thank you again to Melissa for a wonderful stay. Wish we had the opportunity to stay longer."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a unique stay. You actually sleep in a remodeled horse stall. Being a horse owner I loved this place. So many lovely details. Wine, cheese and breakfast were pluses. Breakfast on the porch was wonderful. Melissa is obviously a master at giving you all the finishing touches. Such a wonderful once in a lifetime experience."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Burch cabin was everything and more. It was very clean, relaxing and peaceful. Melissa was very easy to work with. We will be staying here again.. Thank you!!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Melissa's Airbnb is a true treat! The property is gorgeous. She provided so many nice details that made our stay great!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I are always on the hunt for a new and unique experience with Airbnb and let me tell you guys‚Ä¶ THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! We loved every single detail and Melissa was so so so lovely to chat to! Bonus points from our pup who absolutely LOVED the huge yard! This was probably the most unique place we‚Äôve ever stayed at and we‚Äôre definitely planning on coming back soon!
Melissa even provided snacks and drinks for her guests which was a nice surprise to come ‚Äúhome‚Äù to!
We‚Äôll be back!‚ù§Ô∏è"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our second stay at Melissa‚Äôs place, and we love the space she provides for us and our dog to relax on our long road trip."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My gf and I have been here twice and won‚Äôt be the last! Great escape with Cheraw golf course just north of here! Wish I had horse as they‚Äôd enjoy this place too! Cozy cozy and more cozy
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was perfect. The place is clean and unique. We love all of the space for our dogs. The host is very responsive and she leaves drinks, snacks and everything needed for our stay. We will be back."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"What a cute place to stay! The host was very kind and left little treats and wine for guests, a sweet touch! my pup LOVED all the room and run and smell. As others described, it is pretty rustic and literally in stables so be prepared for that kind of experience."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, great communication and beautiful property. I have already booked again."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Such a beautiful piece of property and so wonderful to have 3 acres fenced for dogs to explore! I've never had an airbnb experience with so many goodies for both human and canine guests. Visitors do be aware that each room is separate and connected by an open, unair-conditioned breezeway with glass sliding doors in this small barn. In fall and spring would be just lovely. In South Carolina's July heat the in-room plugin portable a/c units just couldn't keep up, and it stayed warm most of the night. Hard to sleep. But the beds were comfy and Melissa graciously pushed the beds together for us. Still we would go back, just at a different time of year."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,All I can say is Wow! We stayed here one night traveling from Florida to home. It is exactly as described. Very peaceful. Our pups had a fenced in yard and were thrilled. Picturesque scenery. I didn‚Äôt want to leave. Melissa was a great host. We will be back again for sure.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Burchs Carriage House was a tranquil experience. The entire property is something worth experiencing. The highlight of my stay was having breakfast (which the host provides) on the patio outlooking the beautiful landscape while listening to the birds chirp.
Melissa was very kind, communicative and extended a warm welcome upon my arrival. I‚Äôd recommend this property to anyone wanting a pleasant experience!
Melissa, thanks again!!
All the best"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful, pet friendly stay! Will be returning!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The property and setup is amazing if you're traveling with dogs. The entire property is fenced and the dogs have so much room to stretch their legs. This was a perfect overnight stop for us. Also really appreciated the coffee, drinks, and snacks provided."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My Husband & I really enjoyed the mini-honeymoon we had at the Carriage House.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"So perfect for dogs and horses alike...if you‚Äôre like us and put pets first and don‚Äôt mind the layout then this Carriage House is precisely what you‚Äôll need! Melissa was easy to communicate with, fridge had snacks and wine/beer AND breakfast items! Only warning eat before you get to Society Hill because there‚Äôs only a Dollar General nearby so no choices for take out."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,What an awesome place to stay and our dog loved it more than we did. Hope to be back soon. Thanks
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Although it wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea‚Ä¶. It was exactly as advertised. Was very happy with the cleanliness and service.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Small town, but the two places to get food were super. It‚Äôs an very nicely set up one bedroom 1 bath and kitchen . All separate. Great large safe fenced in area for pets. 20 min from lots of nice restaurants"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect overnight stay for us on our way from Florida to PA. We didn't have equine companions but our two canine ones were happy as can be. After the long ride in the truck, they welcomed being able to run loose and all the new scents! The property is beautiful, the accommodations very comfortable and the hospitality genuine. If you're traveling in cold weather, remember you may want an extra blanket on your bed at night or for your fur babies. Thank you Melissa for the snacks - perfect after our late night arrival.

Just show up and enjoy!!! I would definitely stay here again! Highly recommend this as a place to consider if you‚Äôre ever in their area!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Fabulous place to stay; my pup enjoyed it so much that when we started packing up the car to leave she kept biting at our feet and barking as if to announce she was not happy we weren‚Äôt staying.

The weather was very humid during this stay and when we arrived she had the dog bowl already filled with water for my fur babies. She is truly attentive. Since it was our second time my dogs were familiar, they felt right at home."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of our most favorite stays ever. Truly unique experience, spotlessly clean & comfortable. Best moments were watching our Jack Russell roam in the pasture as the sun set across a cloudy sky! It doesn‚Äôt get more perfect. Melissa is an outstanding host. Its was so nice to arrive after a long drive to see some snacks and beverages waiting, along with some other upscale amenities that only a really good host thinks to include. I loved falling asleep in my comfy bed where i could see the night lights of the horse stalls. Next time I come I need to bring a horse."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, not close to major cities. I would advise including travel times in your plans. Homes in downtown Cheraw are beautiful."

The two horse stalls are a great size and everything was so clean. Thanks again, Melissa!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Main reason I like to stay at Airbnb‚Äôs are finding places like these! Most unique and so peaceful with best touches! We got excited to see if the local deer would set off the motion lights on the deck‚Ä¶ no luck but just an example of the surroundings! I gave my girlfriend a golf lesson on the nicely mowed lawn before heading to Cheraw State Park Golf Course which is quick drive north‚Ä¶ peaceful area I‚Äôve never been! I like having the lights in the horse stalls as a night light‚Ä¶very unique experience and want this for a house one day
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice place to stay peaceful and quiet. great for if you have animals as well.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place for couples, with Dogs, and/or Horses. There is an area, for additional people's
inside sleeping area, but you'll have to be ok, with the outside temperature. We had so much fun, it was so relaxing, and our dogs thought that they were in Heaven. We highly recommend, this AirBnB. Great hosts too.üëç‚ù§"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Melissa‚Äôs place is perfect for our overnight stay with our fur babies. She‚Äôs a sweetheart! Very responsive to our questions and needs. This is the second time we have stayed and will definitely be back again!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you have pets, this is the pet resort for them! Loved everything about Melissa‚Äôs place. Our pups especially loved the accommodations! Beds were very comfy for us humans. Perfect place for a night or a week. We will go back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are traveling with your pets just go ahead and book Melissa‚Äôs property. This is by farrrr the most pet friendly property I have ever stayed at, but it goes beyond ‚Äúpet friendly‚Äù and is more of a pet paradise. You cannot beat the price and Melissa went above and beyond to create a space that is perfect for you and your pets. She offered many small touches that made our stay super stress free and comfortable for us. Im just upset we couldnt stay longer. Wish I could give this property a million start. We will be back!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa‚Äôs place is always comfortable, neat and clean. It‚Äôs a wonderful stop for our dogs‚Äî so easy!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my second stay at Melissa's-- I very much appreciate this unique space and it is perfect for people and their pets! Comfy beds and a fantastic deck and area to hang out.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa a wonderful host. Her property is a great place and especially good for people who want to bring their pet with them. The location is rural South Carolina which I love. If you like that type of area, you will be impressed."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"TL;DR
Will definitely stay here again.
One of the most unique stays we‚Äôve had the pleasure of spending the night. The property and the converted stables are gorgeous. A super convenient place to spend a night or so if you have pets (especially larger pets that require a stable). So many little touches that normal Airbnb‚Äôs don‚Äôt do like wine and beer in the fridge, snacks on the counter, and breakfast for the morning(s). It was a little warm out but the bedroom had a portable AC unit that cooled the place sufficiently throughout the night. None of the rooms are connected so if you have to use the restroom or get water from the kitchen in the middle of night you‚Äôll need shoes and probably a flashlight, none of which bothered us. Thanks for a great stay, Melissa!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gem of a location and star host. It was very relaxing and easy to work remotely from. We loved how dog friendly it was. The horse was very flexible with our arrival, incredibly responsive, and full of many details that made the experience a pleasure. We had amazing weather but if you were coming in the winter, pack your sweaters. It never got too hot and we didn‚Äôt even need the AC. It‚Äôs incredibly quiet and calm, a great place for a getaway from the city. The town is small and cute and there are many towns around it that are fun to explore. Our dog loves the water, and we found plenty of lakes and hikes within a 15 minute drive. It‚Äôs a great place if you‚Äôre looking for a getaway, a layover on a long drive, some peace and quiet, or simply a place where your pets are welcome.When they say welcome, they really mean it. They don‚Äôt just tolerate when they say welcome, they really mean it. They don‚Äôt just tolerate them, everything is designed to welcome the pups and give owners peace of mind."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and the carriage house was a very cool place to stay. The stay was a great escape from the hustle and bustle of city living.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a fun, animal friendly place! Our little dog ran and hopped around the cottage and yard with total joy! The deck is a calm, beautiful place to sit and read, eat, watch the pup, and just relax! Best stop over ever on drive north from Florida! Kind of funky and unusual (really is part of an extremely clean stable with 2 stalls, which you enter to access the separate bedroom, bathroom kitchen). But clean and comfortable! We hope to return!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot, especially if one has dogs"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"if you have pets and want to have the most relaxing unique stay or even if you don't have a furry companion pick this place. melissa has everything set up perfectly from wine, snacks, to pet treats. She even has everything set up for horses to stay! there was a huge fenced in yard for our pups to run around and enjoy the outside while we enjoyed the deck with our coffee watching them."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay for dog training at Cooper Black!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very happy repeat customer. Great for folks with dogs and horses.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very charming and unique place to stay! This would definitely be ideal if you are traveling with dogs or horses, as there is so much beautiful land to enjoy. We ended up arriving much later than expected and Melissa was so helpful and accommodating with our late arrival which we really appreciated. It was a very cold night and unfortunately we were slightly uncomfortable and cold all night even with the space heater in the bedroom, and having to go into the cold to get to the bathroom. Other than that, it was a lovely stay and Melissa added numerous thoughtful touches to make our stay very special!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time and it was just as great as the first. It‚Äôs a very unique place and one of our favorite air bnbs. Make sure to take advantage of the space; we really enjoyed making a fire and cooking on it, having s‚Äômores and picking pecans! We really appreciate Melissa and the details she added to make a great stay."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place to bring our dog! It was great to have so much space for her to run and play.
2021-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the most unique stay on our journey from MA to FL w our basset puppy. We stayed an extra day to give us all a chance to stretch our legs and explore; we‚Äôre glad we did. Our dog was in heaven with fenced in pastures to run/play in. The barn/paddock would have been great if it hadn‚Äôt been so (unusually) cold the days we were there. There were space heaters in the 3 rooms off the paddock area - bedroom, bathroom, kitchen - so we were warm when were in those rooms but couldn‚Äôt leave the doors of those rooms open to the common open area of the barn, which made it hard with a big puppy - she couldn‚Äôt move around inside, as the rooms themselves are on the small side. Which again would have been fine if we had been able to make use of the large open area of the barn as the wide open ‚Äúhallway‚Äù that connects the rooms into a little guesthouse. Melissa, who is a lovely, interesting and gracious host, had provided us w a propane heater for the open area but it couldn‚Äôt heat that area w nighttime temps in the 20s. No one‚Äôs fault but Mother Nature‚Äôs! Had the temps been 15-20 degrees warmer, it would have been absolutely perfect, so I encourage travelers who are traveling in late winter/spring (we were there during some of the coldest weather of January) to visit this unique AirBnB!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my second time staying here, so I knew what to expect. I love this place and Melissa. I was having difficulty for some unknown reason booking the dates and Melissa took the time to contact Airbnb , which I so appreciated. She has a clean safe place to stay with your animals and so many special touches, dog treats, wine and beer plenty of room for animals to run and play. She really has created a haven for folks and animals traveling together. As long is she will be there and I have to travel back and forth I will be staying at Melissa's place, if allowed! :)"
2021-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Our barn stay was very comfortable. The host had thought of lots of extra touches, like beer/wine, snacks, cheese and crackers, bagels with cream cheese! The barn was very clean, our pup was made welcome and the ONLY 2 little things that would have made our stay 100% was the DVD player working (we couldn't get it to connect) and we picked a VERY cold night to stay, so it was obviously chilly even with all the space heaters. But overall we thought it was a great airbnb, we would recommend it to friends and would stay there again üòÅ"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"So great we stayed twice on the same road trip. Sweet space, amazing place if you have a dog (or horse!) with you!!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had stayed once before and Melissa airbnb was just perfect for what we needed!
We love the carriage house and will not hesitate to stay again next time we are driving down the coast!
Thank you for your hospitality and attention to details. It is such a special place!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,So cute and cozy! Great place to stay especially if traveling with dogs and Melissa is a wonderful host!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa was thoughtful since the minute we booked her Airbnb. We didn't need much during our stay since we were passing through but we fell in love with her carriage house! So much so that we booked it for way back!
She reached in a timely manner and made sure that we had everything we need for our overnight!
Can't recommended enough!
Also we had our dog with us and it was just perfect for her too!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a perfect place - safe fenced area for animals to run around, sweet indoor spaces and thoughtful host!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is adorable! I loved the amenities & the thoughtful touches & the host is always in touch should you need anything. Quick thing of note, I may have missed it in the listing (and/or not familiar with what an actual carriage house is) but you do have to walk through the stable breezeway to get to the bathroom & kitchen. Not a draw back for us, it was fun & authentic, but I wish I had brought slippers. Privacy is not an issue, we were warm enough, and the rain on the tin roof just lulled us to sleep. I would love to stay here again!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Melissa is awesome. Exactly what we expected based the description. It was perfect for our needs. Loved the little extra touches she provides. Will def stay there again if the need arises. Thanks for sharing a piece of your ranch with us and our fur babies!‚ô•Ô∏è
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a lovely and unique experience. We loved everything about this stay. If you are traveling with furry friends, this is like taking them to Disney. We loved sitting on the deck while the dogs played in the yard. Cozy and very comfortable bed. Wonderful snacks and everything you need in the kitchen. It was complete with a full coffee pot and coffee to make for our journey. We wish we had more time to spend!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa‚Äôs was the Airbnb Room of Requirement. It was exactly what I needed. Wish I wasn‚Äôt just passing through, I would ask to live there, but I appreciated that the listing accepted one night stays and that she welcomed my pet, as it is already hard enough traveling across country with them, her accommodation made it one less factor to stress over. There were very thoughtful and hospitable touches, from complimentary food and beverage, to shower goodies, and a book exchange library. She was communicative but respectful of privacy and space during the self check in amidst the Covid pandemic. Really can‚Äôt say enough about how much I enjoyed this spot. Am saving to my favorites!"
2020-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Thanks, great visit!"
2020-12-01,4,Stayed one night,We had a short one night stay on our way down to FL without a pup so didn‚Äôt get to experience the grounds but could see how our dog would love it. The room was clean and comfortable. If traveling in the winter be sure to bring layers as it gets cold in the barn!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cottage house was a fun stay. Great for the animals, they enjoyed the space and we enjoyed the friendliness!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very accommodating if traveling with critters. Quiet and private. Had everything you could need. Very central location to explore interesting nearby communities.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely magical! I cannot express enough how perfect this place was for myself and my pup to unwind in after a rough few months leading up to moving back across the country. It was so perfect that we ended up staying an extra night to relax and enjoy the property! My dog had an absolute blast running around. Not only does the Carriage House have its own fenced in space with a dog door going to the porch, but the entire property is also safely fenced off and Melissa was so kind to give him free reign of the many acres of beautiful space! He LOVED it! Melissa was so kind when we arrived and so patient with him being stranger wary. He has never taken a treat from a stranger so quickly. She gave us a tour and let me know how everything worked. She even had plenty of things for guests in the kitchen which was such a lovely surprise after a long drive! They had even preset the firepit ready to go for us! It was a perfect stay and we loved every second of it, especially walking the acres and playing fetch, followed by relaxing on the porch. Would love to have stayed longer and hope to stay again! Extremely refreshing after months of chaos ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything about our stay was great. We arrived after 13 hours in the car with a dog and a cat. The space was clean and perfect for our needs. It was so great for our pup to be able to run around in the fence in deck and field that night. Melissa was super responsive and helpful and her place is a gem if you are looking for a place to stay with pets.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"It is the most interesting Airbnb for me so far. It‚Äôs a half horse barn, half living space with a fenced in yard within an even larger fenced in yard. Melissa is such a kind host and has provided so many thoughtful amenities (juice, bagels, dog treats, coffee, beer/wine... etc). It‚Äôs absolutely wonderful and we hope to find our way back soon!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stop on our trip from north to south. Our dogs loved the gigantic fenced area they could run and play. The interior space is perfect for those traveling with pets. Melissa is a friendly and attentive host. We will definitely stay here again on future trips!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you‚Äôre looking for a special stay, Melissa‚Äôs place is perfect! Everything was more than expected from the listing. The converted Barn, on her beautiful, spacious property, provides a unique and cozy atmosphere with all the amenities. Your four-legged friend(s) will be just as excited to stay here, with their own large fenced in yard (with doggie door!) to romp in as you enjoy a serene coffee in the morning or beverage at night. There are even treats and some toys for them!
Melissa is the most thoughtful, gracious host. She was very accommodating and very quick to respond. The place was very clean and had all of the necessities and more, as she provided snacks, drinks, and items for a continental breakfast!
Melissa was understanding of our changing timeline, as we encountered bumps in our timeline on our road trip. She was able to provide us with a guided tour and all the information we needed via phone (perfect for social distancing). My only regret was arriving after dark so I could not take in the beautiful scenery and sunset, and wish we had had more time to enjoy the space. Her place is just perfect and I highly recommend for any future stays!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was so much better then expected. Melissa is by far hands down the best host I‚Äôve ever had. She greeted us right away when we arrived and showed us around. This place is perfect if you want to get away with your dog for a weekend. My favorite part was enjoying the complimentary wine and eating s‚Äômores by the fire at night. I will definitely be returning. Thank you Melissa.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My dog was smiling as we pulled into the large fenced area for her to explore. I was happy to be in a quiet, rural setting with comfortable beds and a normal sized frig-freezer to unload all my food into. The microwave and toaster oven were fine for heating my dinner."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place if you have dogs. Country setting, very unique setup. Have stayed 3 times now"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Melissa‚Äôs place is a quiet spot with a fantastic set up for pets!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This was my second stay and I loved it just as much as the first! Melissa is a wonderful host!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a very relaxing time with our dogs with such a gorgeous view of your grounds. So unique and tucked away from it all. We would definitely stay there again!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Me and my fiance are traveling down 95 and needed a place to stay that would not only take in dogs but embrace them. This place absolutely exceeds this expectation. Melissa's home provides vast amounts of space for your pup to explore. The entire property is fenced in with your own private yard inside the property. This home caters to everything you and your fur family will need. I can't wait to make a visit back.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you have dogs or horses, this is the place for you! The space is wonderful with plenty of room to run. Melissa was so nice, helpful, and quick to communicate. She had many thoughtful touches around the place from food and drinks in the kitchen to all supplied bathroom items to tennis balls, dog treats, and even dog shampoo! I was passing through on a trip but already booked it for my way back! I definitely recommend staying here if you have any four legged companion."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Melissa is a fantastic host and I wish every host were like her! Quick responses and wonderful hospitality. We wish we could have stayed for more than one night. Our dog and cat absolutely loved it as well!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a beautiful place in the country with wonderful hospitality. Our next stay will hopefully be longer.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved this place! It was perfect for me and my dog. It was very clean and well laid out. Melissa even had a doggy door to a fenced in yard for my dog to roam around. There were nice touches everywhere. I highly recommend Melissa‚Äôs pace to anyone, especially if you have a dog. I would definitely go back!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My experience at Melissa's place far exceeded any expections I arrived with. Spotless, adorable, well appointed, and filled with good energy from a woman who obviously loves sharing her space with people she is willing to immediatly treat as friends. I loved everything from the moment she met us at the gate to let us in to the last sip of coffee on the deck before I had to leave. I am anxious to find an excuse to return to Society Hill!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this for my mother, sister, and their dog. They enjoyed their stay and thought the place was great. It‚Äôs extremely dog friendly. Melissa is so nice and easy to communicate with."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a really wonderful and unique place to stay, especially if you have pets. I highly recommend it. Melissa accommodated our late arrival, and the place was super cozy. Our cats absolutely loved exploring the property."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Amy's place was amazing. It was super clean, comfortable and easy to find. Amy and her husband Phillip went above and beyond to accommodate and were very easy to communicate with. We felt very much at home here and the decor was charming. We will definitely stay here again if we are in the area.
We were booked for a week but actually extended our stay.
The Rustic Haven was our favorite so far out of all the places we have stayed."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"immaculate and cozy space, very accessible. Amy was very proactive at letting us know about access."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved our sty at Mrs Amy‚Äôs home.. hope to come back very soon

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice cozy place to stay. Very close to our event space.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife, baby boy, and I booked this place to stay as we were in the area for a racing event. This place is fantastic, surrounded by farm land, great trailer parking and turn around for small to mid size trailers. Large trailers could make it work. Cozy inside and this area expieriences some awesome nighly thunderstorms, the night rain hitting the roof made for the perfect sleep, the bed is fantastic, great size tv, The owner lives right next door both were really friendly and welcoming. We will definitely book this place again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a true gem! Beautiful space, excellent location, very quiet and close to the main highway. The place itself is immaculate. The host was very friendly and accommodating. The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. Definitely staying there again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed this house very much! It was exactly like the pictures and description. The aesthetic was amazing. Decorations were so cool. The flooring was beautiful, everything about the home is beautiful and I would definitely stay there again in the future."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this updated home , it was above and beyond my expectations. Host responded to any questions we had although didn't have many. Clean and well kept, loved the fenced in back yard for our pup also. Would try again to get this place. Thank you."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Daryale was a perfect host and the property was just amazing! We hope to book with you again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home situated on a huge lot. This space was clean and well kept. Daryale was a great host. I highly recommend this place. Thanks for having us
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Excellent host and the house was impressively clean!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I and our dog enjoyed a wonderful long weekend at Daryale's place. The house is absolutely charming in a very private and quiet location. We took advantage of the game room on rainy day, watching movies and playing arcade games. Our dog loved the fenced-in yard and exploring around the pond. Daryale is super responsive and helpful. The location is so convenient to the event we were participating in at the Dragway. We hope to make this an annual trip to Daryale's place!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home nestled in a peaceful setting! The pictures don‚Äôt do the home justice. Our teenagers loved fishing on the pond and the game room.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,House was comfortable and inviting. Great place to relax and unwind after a long day.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay. The only thing missing was a coffee maker. Nice home in a great community!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very accommodating we had a great time
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Looking forward to another stay in the near future.

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Daryale‚Äôs house felt like home. Everything was organized and well placed. Very nice views and quiet. Love this house would definitely stay again next visit.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay at Daryale's! Nice touches and amenities. Lots of space. The land and pond were beautiful. The game room area was great for hanging out with family. My father is disabled so this was perfect for him, as he could enter the lower level and stay in that area. Everything was great! We plan to stay again in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Great quiet location, close to the race track, worked perfect for us. A+++"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pictures do not show how beautiful this rental actually is. The kitchen is huge with updated appliances and a gas stove top. The home was decorated with a fall theme throughout the kitchen, dining, and living room. Huge fenced in backyard overlooks the dock where the kids fished and caught and released bass and bluegills. The game room with a pool table, Mrs Packman, and Galaga was a huge hit for the kids. Would 100% rent here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The entry to the property is breathtaking. The lake is the first thing you see when driving up to the home. We got in a little late and the house was lit up beautifully with outdoor lighting. The ambiance was its own vibe. We were in awe when we walked into the game room and it just kept getting better. The kitchen was amazing, stocked with all of the essential needs for cooking. Daryale provided snacks for us and cute little personal touches all over the house. The master bathroom was AMAZING. The shower in there is the best. We woke up our first morning and went out to the lake and just hung out on the swings and fished. The lake is stocked with decent bass. It‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous. The group of us drove down for a sporting event and have decided to make this an annual trip. There‚Äôs no need to book anywhere else."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,2nd time we have stayed here and it is great! She is an awesome host!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Very nice relaxing environment. Good place to stay in my opinion.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautiful home. The host makes it quite nice. It is nestled back in the pines, very quiet and peaceful. If we go back down that way, we would definitely stay there again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was great! Just like the pictures & description. We will be back.
2023-06-01,2,Group trip,"This could have been a better experience for our family had the owner taken the time and money to clean up the home, inside and outside. As we pulled up to the house, we noticed large cobwebs in all the windows, and broken outdoor furniture as we entered the home. The refrigerator had someone's open food in it , the appliances had not been cleaned well, and the floors didn't look as if it had been cleaned.The master bedroom matress and boxspring still wrapped in plastic with what looked to be a disposable mattress cover. We could not enjoy sitting on the porch because of cobwebs, dirty, and broken furniture. Not a comfortable experience."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay if looking for place to stay the is a little private. If you like the outdoors, you should definitely try this place out."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"House : This place was absolutely amazing & peaceful ! Plenty of things to do .. basketball goal, grill , pool table , PS4 w/ games , Darts , Pac-Man Machine and a nice size tv right next to the Bar (byob) . She did leave complimentary wine tho . The kitchen was absolutely beautiful. My dad is a chef and he LOVED the kitchen . Bedrooms and bathrooms are beautiful also.
Nice areas if you like sitting outside .
The pond was my favorite part: soooooo many fish you could look down and actually see them swimming around the private dock . All sizes too . We caught plenty . There is also a sitting area at the pond right next to a fire pit .This place was everything !!!
Host : The host was very responsive, flexible, & polite ! She even was willing to help accommodate some special requests that I had . Definitely on her way to being a SUPER HOST . What are you waiting for book it NOW !!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Daryale's property was everything we were looking for and so much more! So many little touches that added to the stay from treat baskets and bathroom amenities to fish food to take to the beautiful pond!! We highly recommend Daryale anytime you are in Rockingham!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,beautiful place nestled in a beautiful area of NC. peaceful and serene. lots of fun activities for the kids to enjoy. great host as well
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,The house is beautiful!!! Easy access for us we would love to come back again in the future
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was great, and they were incredibly kind and gracious as we had car troubles and could not leave by checkout time. Thank you!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed staying at Daryale‚Äôs place for the second time. It‚Äôs the perfect place to stay when coming in town to visit family!
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Nice house and location
2022-11-01,3,Stayed with kids,The house was in a very peaceful place. It‚Äôs great if your looking for a quiet place to relax. It was not as clean as it should have been but it‚Äôs kid friendly.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,The Hobbs was a good place to stay at we played pool and had a good time out there.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This house was considerably better than I expect in many ways. The beds were comfortable and fairly new, the house seems to be mostly newly remodeled, has the vast majority of the things you need. The house is tucked away from everything, which was very nice, and only a few minutes from food, the speedway, and downtown Rockingham.
The only concern is some potential with cleanliness. The master bath had bottles of shampoo, condition, and other items as to be expected. However, the two the bottles were half empty and clearly used already."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful home that was only made better by our host. From check in to check out, our host was extremely helpful and responsive."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had the best time! We enjoyed playing pool and hanging out by the pond.We have 10mo twins and I felt comfortable with them crawling around. Home was very nice and clean!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Very cute place out in the middle of nowhere, which was perfect for our getaway. The only thing that caught us off guard was the tiny house on the property. Made it feel not private like we hoped for. We are all adults and not partying, so nothing to hide, it just felt like we had a neighbor literally right there which was kind of the whole point of driving so far to get away from. House was great though!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,House was very fun! Enough games and activities to play the whole week and never get bored.

Looking forward to the near future to stay again"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,This is a great place if you have a small child. A crib and changing table are provided. There is a door at the top of each stair case which is also very helpful. The back yard is large and fenced in and there is a small swing set and slack line gym set.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was my family‚Äôs first Airbnb and we came up for the US kids golf world championship! The house is about 30 minutes from Pinehurst and offers everything you could want in a vacation rental! It is on a pond/lake and we paddle boated and fished and caught a bunch!

We had 3 adults and 2 children and there was plenty of space for everyone. The kids really enjoyed the game room and the adults really enjoyed the screened porch. We wish we would‚Äôve been able to use all the amenities but we were not there long enough. It is in a private subdivision which gave us a sense of peace. Daryale was quick to spring into action with anything that we needed and communication was constant. I appreciated that! Thank you again Daryale, this will always be our choice when we stay in Rockingham!"

We are looking forward to coming back in the future when staying in the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I had a wonderful time at Robert's guest/chauffeur's house. The property was truly exceptional and definitely worth escaping the I-95 holiday traffic for; I wholeheartedly endorse it.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wish we had more time! The description and charm were spot on‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve already referred the location and host to three additional friends- before we‚Äôd even left the area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Working in healthcare is stressful but traveling away from home and working in healthcare is even worse.

Tucked away in a tranquil neighborhood, the charming house boasts an enchanting garden that truly stole our hearts. From the moment we stepped through the gate, we were greeted by lush greenery, fragrant flowers, and the soothing melody of chirping birds.
The interior of the house was cozy and thoughtfully designed, providing everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The space was just right for two people, with a warm and inviting atmosphere that made us feel right at home.
One of the highlights of our stay was undoubtedly the garden. We spent countless hours lounging in the outdoor seating area, surrounded by the beauty of nature. Whether sipping morning coffee or enjoying a glass of wine under the stars, the garden provided the perfect backdrop for relaxation and rejuvenation.
In addition to the delightful accommodations, the hosts were incredibly hospitable and attentive to our needs. T"

The main home and gardens are stunning. The apartment was quaint and cozy. The only small downside would be the double bed. The mattress was comfortable but a bit tight (the bed size is clearly indicated in the listing) Other than that, everything else was perfect. Host was easy to communicate with. The aprtment was very clean and spacious. Would def stay again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So thankful to have found this charming apartment. The hosts are so friendly and have the place stocked with everything you need. The bed is comfy, the space is quiet and peaceful, and the water pressure is great! What else could you ask for?!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Was traveling on business and could not find a Hilton chain locally. Haven‚Äôt used Air bnb for years because of hidden fees but happened to find Robert‚Äôs listing and this was perfect. Pricing or value for money was great.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My safe harbor on these long drives through 5 states. This is where I like to be. It‚Äôs perfect. Everything is perfectly sized for me, it has everything I need, and the grounds are stunning. This time the camellias and tulip magnolia tree were in bloom. I only wish I had time to enjoy it more, but the drive doesn‚Äôt allow for that."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great option for two people. As a bonus, the property grounds are beautiful."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Robert‚Äôs place was great! Needed it to be close to a dirt bike track nearby. Location was perfect for that and space was comfortable and clean! Will definitely return for the next race.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Beautiful chauffeur‚Äôs apartment adjacent to a historic home with all the amenities one could want.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved staying here! It‚Äôs such a charming place and I loved reading all about the property. The apartment is lovely! The only thing is my fianc√© and I are quite tall and the bed was a little small for us personally (just something we deal with as above average sized humans). I would stay here again, though!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Comfortable and quiet place. Perfect for us!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, great location, great value and great owners! Always a pleasure to talk to them and stay in their beautiful apartment when I am in town. The owners have thought of everything to make your stay comfortable. It‚Äôs private, quiet, walkable to downtown, and the apartment has everything a guest could need."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay. It was just as expected. It was helpful that Robert allowed an infant. We brought our own pack n play. Our child slept in the kitchen which was nice because we could close the door. We hope that the place will be available the next time we are in the area to visit family. Thank you again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Chauffeur's Apartment is a diminutive delight! So warm, cozy, private, and quiet, over the garage, separate from the main house. Viewed from the courtyard below it looks so quaint and unpretentious. I imagined how it must have been for the chauffeur to live there back in the day, just a staircase away from the garage and the car he drove for the then owners of this magnificent historic estate. The apartment is comfortable, with a well-equipped kitchen, and a cute bathroom where a mural with two blackbirds flitting through bamboo trees is painted on the walls and ceiling. Robert and Phil are gracious hosts, very responsive, and the vintage apartment is impeccably clean. They allow guests to walk around the grounds that surround the stately brick mansion. Thanks for a wonderful, restful two-day stay and for sharing a bit of the history of your beautiful home and those who built it long ago."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This quaint location was just what I needed for a quick overnight stay. The chauffeur accents for the decor made this room an experience and not just a place to sleep. Robert was very responsive. There was a power outage during my stay. He was quick to communicate and report the issue, and it was resolved quickly. The little touches were nice - drinks, snacks, etc. Amenities were readily available. I look forward to staying here when I'm in town again on business in the future."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had another wonderful stay! Everything was perfect, as usual. Very clean, very comfortable, great communication, everything has been thought of! Thank you again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great space, very clean, and an amazing firm bed!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I decided to try something different while celebrating the Thanksgiving holiday with family in my hometown of Laurinburg. Normally, I travel from Charlotte to Laurinburg for one day, but now that we have an infant we wanted to break up the amount of time driving by spending the weekend. Since there aren‚Äôt many good hotel accommodations in town, I decided to look for an AirBnb. Surprisingly, I came across Robert‚Äôs listing located in downtown Laurinburg. The reviews were excellent so I booked. The apartment is located on the grounds of a historic home, and had all the looks and feel of being in historic city such as Savannah or Charleston. The apartment is cozy yet spacious enough for myself, partner and our baby. There was plenty of space for her bassinet with plenty of walking room. The kitchen and bathroom were also well equipped. The apartment was clean and comfortable. There‚Äôs plenty of parking available in the owner‚Äôs private parking lot. My family was able to walk to the downtown area to the few shops and view the town Christmas decor. I‚Äôve never thought of Laurinburg as a vacation destination; however, let‚Äôs just say I was able to experience my very small hometown in a different way which was lovely. Will definitely stay again when visiting overnight."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We had another great stay. Everything is wonderful. The carriage house is immaculate. The bed is so comfy. Everything has been thought of! Thank you both so much!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was everything we expected. We were in town for SAU baseball but were rained out for two days so this apartment was a quiet, cozy & comfortable stay while we waited out TS Nicole. They thought of every type of info in the notebook, every extra you might forget in the bathroom, extra sheets/blankets/pillows in the closet & even included cold drinks in the fridge. The value of this stay exceeded any hotel stay we‚Äôve had in Laurinburg and we‚Äôre can‚Äôt wait to book again in the spring for Home Games."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The ‚ÄúChauffeur‚Äôs Apartment‚Äù is nothing short of spectacular! The accommodations are immaculately clean, cozy and well appointed. The owners have thought of everything! They were extremely gracious and made our stay both unique and enjoyable!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I‚Äôve settled on this jewel as ‚Äúmy place‚Äù for my very long caregiving drives. It has everything I need and nothing I don‚Äôt love. The owners can start calling me Sabrina now, I‚Äôm happy to have the chauffeur‚Äôs apartment on the estate. Super clean, lovely, and the gardens and magnolia tree are splendid. If I wasn‚Äôt so keen to get home to my own paradise I would definitely stay longer at this one."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a great weekend here. It was what we needed and then some. Loved the decor, the history and the peace this place provides. One of the best AB&B experiences he and I have had. Would return. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This location was just 1/4 mile away from my childhood home. I had driven by it countless times, but never imagined I'd stay there. I'd never been inside the mansion, seen the backyard, or anything like that - so seeing it up close was fantastic. I highly recommend staying here, and my family really enjoyed it."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were in town for our son's wedding and spent only one night but loved the quaint Chauffeurs Cottage!

The grounds were lovely and while very small, the cottage had everything."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is perfect for a couple or a private stay. The guest book is worth a read and very informative about the history of the home. If you stay here you have to take a stroll around the gardens! They are beautiful and relaxing with plenty of places to sit and enjoy the view.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks so much for the hospitality! What a nice experience for myself and my corgi. Fascinating home and hosts!

Details like to put chocolates makes us feel we are important guest for them‚Ä¶ the experience was better than expected and we appreciate all the hospitality and respect of them‚Ä¶ wonderful experience! ü•∞"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Ernie's place in Laurinburg was a great experience. He was super welcoming and helpful. The decor was really great - maybe not the kinds of things that I'd have in my house, but i don't go to bed and breakfasts to stay in places that look like where I live. 100% would book again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing place! The home was beautiful and perfect for our family. I only wish we could have stayed longer and spent more time at the house. The host was great, friendly and gracious, but we only saw him when I reached out so I could learn more about the history of the home. It was very private, very safe, with great parking. The home decor was luxurious, and the kitchen had everything we needed. The grounds were beautiful. We are already trying to decide when we can return!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"We thank our hosts for ensuring a safe, clean and enjoyable stay in this historic home. This place was conveniently located for our work team to get to farm sites in neighboring towns and counties and provided a relaxing space to return to. The house is decorated with antiques and treasures from around the world which makes it fun to explore and it is great for photographers. Michael and Michelle made themselves available for any questions or concerns and were very friendly and helpful! There were many bonuses like the fire pits that Michael lit for our group one night and the beautiful gardens surrounding the home!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was absolutely beautiful, well kept and fully stocked for all my cooking needs."
2024-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house - true to the photos however it very much lacked in the details of a nice stay. The ad says ""private yard & BBQ"" - this is false. There is a man that lives in the little building behind the house w/the patio and grill. I feel it should be disclosed that you ""share"" the property with someone. There is no outdoor space to hangout. The refrigerator needs to be replaced - the shelves were broken/missing and no ice maker. There weren't things like paper towels, hand soaps, hand towels, washclothes, extra trash bags, etc. We had to buy a lot of supplies that are normally included in an airbnb. There are no drapes in the main living areas so it's not private at night. There is not a TV in the main living area - only in the bedrooms."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I were in town for my cousin's funeral and all the hotels in the area were completely booked. Although we were in town for a sad occasion, staying at this property made the weekend a little easier for my family and I to endure. My family and I were raised approximately 12 miles from the property. This was the ideal location for us. The owners were very friendly and did everything in their power to make our stay enjoyable. The property is beautiful and very spacious. My family and I were able spend quality time together under one roof and when privacy was warranted, there was enough space to go think or grieve as needed. We have decided that each time we come if the property is available, we will definitely book this property. We had a great time and would highly recommend booking this property to anyone looking for lodging in the area."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Great historical home with tons of character. 6 Bedrooms, 3 bathrooms in great location. My favorite thing was the 2nd (shortcut) staircase."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,We had the best experience staying in the Grand Tutor! Every room/bed comfortable and clean. Great communication and assistance with anything we needed. We will all be back soon!! Thank you so much for welcoming our family.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our family was very fortunate to get to stay in such a beautiful house for two weeks while our home was under construction. We felt like royalty staying there! The kitchen was absolutely amazing! The bathrooms/showers/tubs were also amazing! Everyone had their own spacious rooms with very comfortable beds. I think the only thing that we didn't like was having to leave! A BIG thank you to the owner for allowing us to make his house our home for the past couple of weeks. We truly enjoyed our stay!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Thank you so much the house is decorated perfectly for our New Year‚Äôs Eve wedding. We were in awe of the entire home. Def plan to book there in the future
2023-12-01,4,Group trip,It‚Äôs a nice house. If you have a reason to be in this area
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family gathered together for the funeral of my grandmother. It was a sad occasion, but staying together in a beautiful home gave us space to reconnect and care for each other."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Great location for a weekend with the family!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"I needed a place to stay while me and my roofing crew traveled down to do a job in Mccoll SC. This was a close drive, and seemed like a nicer place to stay. I wasn‚Äôt wrong. Nice area, and plenty of things to do. My team of guys had never been to a place like this to stay for a couple days, so this was a real treat for them. Would recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough good about this place. It was just a great peaceful home to stay in. It was less than the price of 2 rooms at a major hotel in a neighboring town. We just loved it. If you want an elegant home, with an atmosphere that promotes time together as friends or family, this the place."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mike (the owner) was an absolutely amazing host and an awesome spirit. He personally came to the house to trouble shoot a problem we were having with the internet which we greatly appreciated . The house is immaculate, it feels like you're stepping back into time old world charm with modern conveniences there is a TV with streaming apps in every room. The decor is so detailed in a word stunning. The pictures are very accurate. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by smooth jazz playing on the Google home speaker. A nice touch that made you feel like you were staying in a fancy hotel. We were a family of 9 with two children. Everyone was comfortable and slept well. Janet, the contact for our stay was extremely pleasant and helpful. I called and texted with multiple questions which she always answered in a timely manner. We very much appreciate your hospitality and we will definitely stay here again. 5 out of 5 I00% recommend this place and will be returning again!"

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place with friendly host/owner.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Place was good and comfortable and people of evolve was always available for any of the questions I had
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house ended up being a bit too fancy for our group needs but it was unique and full of character. Something to keep in mind is the house is very old so outlets are not as convenient as in a more modern home. Under our bed was very dusty when I had to kneel down to find an outlet. Our room had a large plastic covering over the window that was pretty disruptive each night due to wind, the reason for it being there was never disclosed. I think this would be a good fit for groups and provides a unique stay however for a group of guys looking to have a place to gather and crash at the end of the day, we didn‚Äôt feel this place could offer that. Driveway super accommodating. I believe the owner lives behind the house and many in our group felt he lingered around the yard and drove by a bit too much and some felt uncomfortable. Perhaps some clarification up front would be reassuring. All in all, with some detailed cleaning in out of sight areas, this place is great for a group of adults."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Such a great overall experience. It was a great location to get away from the big city in enjoy a small city with really great food and pure privacy. The host was amazing!!! He was able to be there whenever we had a question and everything. And was able to bring everything peacefully

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The host is awesome. He listens and is responsive. We had a phenomenal experience. I hope to rebook the house for this time next year. My mother lives in a neighboring retirement village and it was convenient for the family to spend time with her. The host helped us create a Christmas we can always remember. The house was decorated for Christmas and we entered a well lite home to the sound of Christmas music. Cannot thank him enough!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great experience! we absolutely loved the place! The host did not communicate with me at all during the stay.

The house was very clean and all of the amenities were in point. We‚Äôd stay here again in a heartbeat!

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice and peaceful. I enjoyed coffee in the morning outside while listening to the birds sing. There are cornfields around the property which added more privacy. The neighborhood has very friendly people as well.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Chloe‚Äôs place was awesome! I even asked if they would consider renting it out to me.

During our downtime away from the field it was very relaxing, so peaceful away from the road. The kids had a blast getting in the big yard and playing more ball! There was a carport that came in very handy during the summer showers. There were plenty of towels, the kitchen had all the amenities including spices to help cooking. You are only 10 minutes from Lumberton so if you don't feel like cooking that's cool too!! It's not far too drive!!!

We would be glad to stay again in the future."

This house was perfect for our needs - close to town, yet not in town and felt private, had good wifi so I could work remotely for my day job while at the house. It provided a home base for us.
It was clean, very cutely decorated and had lots of nice touches to make you feel at home. Things such as the nice hand soaps, fully stocked kitchen, little snacks and drinks (including coffee for the keurig, teas, microwaveable popcorn, water, popsicles, etc). We loved that they had some outdoor furniture that we could use as well.
Overall, we had a wonderful stay and appreciated all the extras that Chloe and Sherry provided!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at the farmhouse and just like our first, we were not disappointed. Beds are very comfortable and the pillows, linens, and towels are good quality. Snacks and drinks were provided each time and we greatly appreciated them. The air conditioner keeps the house comfortably cool and there are ceiling fans in the living room as well as each bedroom. Never had any issues with WiFi or any of the streaming channels. Self check in and check out is hassle free. We spent most of our time sitting outside in the shade enjoying the country breeze and spending quality time with family. This is a comfy cozy, country 'home', with soy bean fields all around it. But the house and host isn't the only thing that's great, the few neighbors that live near by are pretty awesome too. Thank you to the kind neighbor who drove by to offer his assistance when he saw my father with the hood of the car up checking the oil. It's nice to know there are still friendly folks willing to offer a helping hand."

So when I tell you her home is clean and amazing I mean that whole heartily . You will not be disappointed at all. You should really book her prices are also amazing! Overall a 5 star Airbnb"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have now made this house our home away from home. It's the only place we look forward to coming to when we return to visit family. Our kids have plenty of room to play and we feel safe and secure being surrounded by farm land. It's peaceful and cleanly. We would recommend anybody who is looking for an amazing valued home to check this one out. It's well worth it and like us you will find yourself not wanting to stay anywhere else from here on out. The hosts are kind accommodating people!

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,The house was very homey! I felt home away from home!! We entered the house and they had a welcome Keila sign might seem like a small detail but it made a great impact felt very welcomed to their home!! I would definitely recommend a stay here for anyone who wants to get away from the big city. Great Host Ms. Chloe
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little quiet peace of heaven blessed me and my mom in so many ways. If you want somewhere peaceful just to getaway and relax, esp if you‚Äôre city folk like us then this is it! We most certainly will be back! Thank you Chloe, Cory, and Sherry for making us feel warm welcome and at home!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is a true North Carolina HOME. Located in the country, off of a well maintained dirt road, and surrounded by soy bean fields. We spent our mornings outside enjoying the scenery while drinking coffee on the porch. This was a last minute booking and Chloe/Sherri were fantastic getting back to me in a timely manner. The home was clean, the WIFI reception worked fine, and checking in and out was a breeze. They had all the provisions we needed so we never had to ask for anything. Sufficient towels, blankets, and pillows. The air conditioning is more than adequate for the 95+ degree North Carolina heat and kept the temperature inside very comfortable. We will definitely be back."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is an old but updated farm house with space from neighbors. Great landscape with multiple seating area's outside. Highly recommend the sunset view. Area seems quiet for the month that we stayed. Their is a DG nearby with a good selection. Plenty of parking. House seems very insulated. For the price, it's cheaper than a hotel, you have whole house to yourself and large front and backyard. Host's communication was prompt and effective. They will pick up trash multiple times per week and assist in any way possible. They were very helpful. Their is a stackable Washer/Dryer in utility room, older but functions perfectly. There are two couches, 1 folds to a bed, 2 bedrooms , each with a queen bed. The house seems decorated nicely, with 3 Roku TV's and extra seating. Hardwood floors with many area rugs.

2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved the house, the location and the stay. In a country setting, yes in a cornfield! It was nice and peaceful with a great front porch view. Even though there were neighbors around nothing was out of sorts. There is a dirt path to the house, and the house is old, but it‚Äôs well kept and decently comfortable. I would recommend an update to the mattress compared to other stays. Her hospitality was great! Plenty of linens and towels, snacks and water were in the fridge. Cute set up and plenty of room to park. I would stay here again. Great rustic get away to unplug and rewind, abs the value is there."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, well-stocked, quiet home, that was perfect for a little rest and recharge. The family that owns the property was very nice and our farm stay felt very private and relaxing. Our girls were delighted to find the snacks and drinks provided upon our arrival.

The house was cozy and cute. It definitely had a very homey vibe, which I appreciated.
CONS: Poor internet quality, no dishwasher, uncomfortable beds, and lacking some essential kitchen items like a chopping knife, lids for pots & pans, and a few other things.
Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay for us and would rate Chloe's home as a 8.5/10!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This Airbnb went above and beyond all of our expectations!!! The location is awesome and very private and suited all of our needs. We have a rambunctious little 2-year-old and he enjoyed playing in the huge backyard. We could not have felt more at home and comfortable. It was very clean, everything we needed was available, the communication between us and the host was phenomenal and they responded within a timely manner every time we had a question or concern. We have absolutely zero complaints and would recommend this Airbnb to anybody who is looking to stay in the area. We already can't wait to come back again!

The very little questions we had, the host was quick to respond over text message (even though I later noticed the info was already posted in the kitchen!)."

2024-01-01,4,Stayed about a week,"This is the second time we've stayed with Steven and Jessica. The house is beautiful and roomy, but you can definitely tell it's an older house that's settled. We loved it the first time we stayed, all though we only stayed for a few days during our first trip. This time, we stayed a week, and it felt a little less glorious. There was construction started every morning on the attached apartment at 830am, so there was no sleeping in. They were nice enough to stop when we laid our twins down for naps. It was inconvenient to listen to the hammering and impact drilling throughout the day, especially when we had company over. Had that been disclosed prior to making the reservation, we probably would most likely have looked elsewhere. One other issue we had was that they only allot you two rolls of toilet paper and two trash bags for a weeks stay for a house that sleeps 6. Otherwise, our stay was great. It's a beautiful place and they are continually working on renovations"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The beds were comfortable and the space was very open and inviting. Lots of games and toys for the kiddos!

Very highly recommended."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Needed a nice place to stay for a few days with lots of space and this was perfect! The host was very tentative when questions were asked and extremely kind! The set up of the home was great, quiet area , fit us all perfectly !"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our time there even though we mostly only spent the evenings there. The quality of the amenities inside the property is very good and there is a very cozy vibe.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My sisters and I stayed at Steven and Jessica‚Äôs 2 bedroom apartment in Hamlet since our nephew was getting married at the Southern Dream wedding venue 15 minutes away. The hosts were accommodating to our request ahead of time for a slightly earlier check-in so that we could get ready for the wedding. They were extremely responsive prior to and during our stay to any questions we had.
Easy keyless entry, street parking right in front of the home, quiet neighborhood, listing photos were accurate, everything was very clean and aesthetically pleasing, and the two beds (a queen and a double) were comfortable. The little basket of snacks/kcups was a fun surprise. There is a second entry/apartment to one side of the home, but we didn‚Äôt notice any extra noise or disturbances during our stay. We wish we could have stayed an extra night to take advantage of being able to walk to downtown Hamlet and enjoy a coffee or shopping, but that will have to wait for another trip!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Steven and Jessica have done such a phenomenal job creating this home away from home in Hamlet. We return to this AirBnB time after time because we always feel so welcome in this quaint little town. The unit has such unique character, and the hosts have gone above and beyond to provide everything their guests might need. I can‚Äôt recommend this place enough."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,absolutely great stay! I had a couple questions and messaged the host late in the evening for a response the next day and got an immediate answer! very quiet neighborhood and spacious house! spent most of my stay right on the front porch swing!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay, easy in and out. Centrally located and worked great for my daughter and I."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was fantastic! There was a tropical storm (Ian) during our stay and we didn‚Äôt lose power or anything. I had friends in hotels that lost power 3x during the storm so this airbnb was definitely a blessing! The host was quick to answer questions. Everything we needed and some. Plus the convenience of the location was awesome. Cute little town with its own train museum and the seaboard restaurant the host recommended was great too. Also I had planned to come with my husband but he‚Äôs a marine and the marine corp is really good at messing up my plans so we (me and our two teenage daughters) came without him and we felt completely safe. Highly recommend!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute, clean spot with plenty of space. A short walk to quaint downtown Hamlet, where everyone should stop in the Train Room. No problems with communication or otherwise."

Would definitely recommend. One drawback was the amount of light coming in through the windows at night from neighboring properties as well as digital displays on appliances. If you need a dark environment for a good night‚Äôs sleep, I would suggest a sleep mask."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Steven and Jessica were absolutely wonderful hosts! Beautiful place down to the detail and they were super communicative and quick to respond. I‚Äôd definitely stay again! Wish I could rent from them monthly. Any lack of stars anywhere is fully because of fees and things tacked on to the price the actual hosts get. Totally not their fault!

It's in an older neighborhood and is definitely an older house, but the window AC unit worked great! It has been nicely updated and was very clean inside. Just be very careful of the driveway if you have a lower car because the tree roots are huge. We would have bottomed out if we were in my husband's car. But there seems to be space for street parking if that is allowed."

2023-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Sophia‚Äôs place was super clean. It was spacious and had nice amenities like a washer and dryer and full kitchen. There were a few things that could have made our stay better though. There was an overwhelming amount of instructions sent just before check in. In them, it said we could adjust the thermostat which was nice, however it kept kicking back up to the default temperature so my baby and I woke up sweating and I had to go monkey with it in the middle of the night. Also, most airbnbs I have been in have basic toiletries, but not here. Overall it was a good stay and met our needs but I don‚Äôt know that we‚Äôll be back."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only needed a place to shower and sleep, so this house was all that and more. It is an easy drive close to the highway but in a rural area surrounded by farm fields. At the same time, it is close to many restaurants and stores. We didn't use the kitchen, but the coffee maker was appreciated. The place is spotlessly clean. No complaints."

Everything Sophia provided in the descriptions was right on point, and her communication was excellent. You can tell much thought has been put into this home to make it a wonderful place for guests.

Sophia's communication was excellent and she was very responsive. You could not have had it any better than hers.
She even thought of windowshield cleaner. I got to remove the bugs before heading back out on my 12 hr journey.

She loved having her own room and I loved the spacious bathroom attached to my bedroom. I made use of Sophia‚Äôs complimentary car cleaning products she left out. What an awesome idea!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sophia's place was so comfy and cozy. As someone with mobility struggles, I was really happy to see a ramp up to the back porch and pull bars in the bathroom. The Christmas decorations made the space even more homey. There is some noise from the traffic, but that didn't bother us. There was room to ""camp out"" on the deck and make smores. This home is in the country but minutes to everything you could need. Excellent bnb!!!"
