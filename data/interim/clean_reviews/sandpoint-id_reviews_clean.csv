2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Emma were excellent hosts. They were quick to communicate and checked in frequently to ensure we had the best stay. They even let us check in early and gave us the option to check out late (we didn’t need to). The home is cozy and the perfect size for two people. If you aren’t as mobile or have a difficult time getting up stairs, you may want to consider a different home. It’s a steep climb up to the bed. We didn’t have any issues, but want others to be aware just in case. The tiny home was perfect for a three night trip to visit some friends in town. We’d gladly stay again! Thanks, Mike & Emma!"

Can’t wait to stay here again next summer✨"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My week-long stay at Mike's Tinyhome in Sandpoint was an absolute delight! Despite its small size, the tiny home offered a cozy and warm atmosphere, even during cooler weather. The shower was nice and spacious, and the well-equipped kitchen made mornings a pleasure. Lounging with coffee and movies was a fantastic way to start the day.
While we didn't get a chance to use the barbecue and bicycles, their accessibility was appreciated. The outdoor lights created a lovely ambiance, and the loft area with its window overlooking the trees and sky was a unique and enjoyable experience.
Mike's guide to nearby activities and restaurants was a valuable resource, and the coffee provided was delicious, introducing us to a great coffee shop. The location of the tiny home was perfect, allowing us to walk around town, explore the beach, and enjoy nearby trails.
In summary, Mike's Tinyhome is a hidden gem in Sandpoint. I highly recommend it for a cozy and convenient stay. Thanks, Mike, for mak"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had the BEST stay in this adorable tiny house! My husband and I stayed there 2 nights with our 3yr-old son and 4yr-old daughter. The kids LOVED the upstairs bedroom loft (1 parent slept with them upstairs and the other on the super comfy futon). The hot water was seemingly endless and the shower pressure was perfect! The place was super clean and easy to find/enter. The dedicated parking spot was well shaded and located right in front of the tiny house (plenty of room for our sprinter van). The location was THE BEST (we walked downtown to restaurants/stores often). The host was very friendly and responsive. I highly recommend staying here- it was an experience our family will never forget (the kids were so bummed we had to leave “their” tiny house). We will definitely stay again the next time we visit Sandpoint!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay in Sandpoint! The location could not have been better for us since we wanted an easily walkable area with lots to do. The house was exactly as described and allowed us a great space to relax and unwind!

Mike our host had everything set up and so perfect... he even provided bicycles and locks for our enjoyment that were not part of his listing. The upstairs loft had a great extending window that made it feel like you were sleeping outside under the stars. And he provided a French press and the local Evans Brothers coffee, IMHO the best."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really like the Tiny House experience and try to seek them out when I travel. I enjoyed the location of this one the most. The Sandpoint Farmer's market is not to be missed and the near by organic grocery store has everything you can imagine and great baked goods.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our 3rd time staying at the Tiny House on 3rd street, it’s become a tradition for our little family. We absolutely love staying here. Everything is so thoughtful from the fully stocked kitchen to the linens and extra blanket and even the bathroom is well stocked. The queen size bed is very comfortable and wonderful to look at the sky through the skylight at night. For a Tiny House I would not expect such details. It truly is steps to downtown area with lots of sweet little restaurants, coffee shops and shopping. Easy walk to the city beach as well. When we travel our goal is to drive as little as possible and this is the perfect place to stay if you want to walk everywhere with ease. We’ll be back again next year!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn’t have asked for a better stay in Sandpoint. Location was ideal: walking distance from everything (including the lake), and still, secluded enough to make evenings on the porch peaceful and private. And the property itself was a true delight: cozier than even the photos suggest, high quality fixtures throughout, and every little detail thought through to make it feel like home. Highly, highly recommended!"

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with easy walk to downtown, restaurants, the lake, and elsewhere. Place is cozy and would only really recommend for 2ppl though 4 could fit. Be sure not to turn off the water piping heater as we learned the hard way and had to wait for the pipes to unfreeze. Mike was helpful though and we had access to water and a bathroom next door."

I live in my minivan so it was nice to stretch my legs in this tiny house - though most people might find it smaller than their usual living set ups hah.

Mike is super cool too - all in all great experience. I will be back!"

We went to the farmers market, walked back to unload. Went to the winery, walked back to unload. Walked to the brewery and had drinks at dinner… walked back.

Already planning the next trip and stay here!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic. Blocks from the bi-weekly farmers market, the city beach, and Sandpoint’s staples: The Hydra steakhouse and Joel’s Mexican restaurant. It’s a comfortable tiny home; in the middle of a heat wave the AC unit had to be turned off and on intermittently because it worked so well.
My wife and I are planning a return trip for the winter season and have this bookmarked.
Loved it."

And I’m highly sensitive to sleeping anywhere but my own bed. The weather during our stay was quite cold but we kept warm with just the little space heater provided. The kitchen was very nicely stocked, we didn’t do any cooking but had we wanted to I think it would have been easy. Very close walking distance to anything downtown. Easy parking and we loved that it’s fully gated for our kids. We can’t wait to stay here again in the warmer months to take advantage of the cute deck, fire pit and more of what Sandpoint has to offer! Highly recommend this gem in Sandpoint!"

The kitchen is stocked with everything we needed-we ate in except one meal- and we really appreciated the organic products(spices, oil) The porch/grill combo is delicious in any weather and the neighborhood tabby kitty may become your new best friend(we named him Turmeric).
Mike is genuinely kind, close by and happy to answer any question or request. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip and chats with Mike."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what an amazing experience. It was adorable and the best location for a weekend getaway."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mike’s tiny home was a perfect cozy getaway! I was especially impressed with 4 different options to make a quality cup of coffee :)
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mikes Tiny House is perfectly located, adjacent to the adorable downtown of Sandpoint with the benefit of the quietness of a neighborhood. The tiny house was a fun and unique place to stay, with a bonus private front patio and seating area. It’s very clean and efficient and well organized. We chose to use both the loft bed and the futon bed as two adults used to having a little more space at night and slept well. Mike is a very friendly and accommodating host. He checked in with us regularly and responded quickly to a couple of questions we had. Sandpoint is a destination worth putting in your travel list. The town is charming and walkable and progressive while staying quaint and naturally beautiful. Our friends came for vacation from Florida and purchased a condo to return to immediately upon their return home! Thank you, Mike, for a wonderful stay. I highly recommend this affordable and comfortable and memorable home and experience!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location! Everything is in walking distance. We loved the outdoor space and the tiny house was perfect!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay if you’d like to experience tiny home living and be walkable to everything downtown Sandpoint has to offer!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mike was wonderful and super personable! His suggestions for where to eat/what to do in town were so helpful!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a charming wee house — and it IS wee, but the layout is such that it doesn’t feel at all cramped or crowded; my husband and I stayed with our teenage son, and we were all very comfortable.
The house was immaculately clean; furnishings, fixtures, and and appliances are high-end and in excellent repair; the deck and yard are great spaces; the location is great; and the owner provides great options for coffee-lovers!
Thanks for a great stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,👌🏼
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Tiny House is a perfect place for a stay in Sandpoint. Walking distance to everything the downtown has to offer. The house has everything you need to make your stay enjoyable. When in the area we would definitely stay again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Great location!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute gem! Super walkable to Sandpoint, clean and had everything we needed! We traveled with our two tween’s and we were perfectly comfortable. The stairs to the main bed are steep- which was not a problem for us, but probably wouldn’t recommend for someone with bad knees or balance issues. Mike was a great host. We would highly recommend this tiny house!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don’t do this adorable place justice! So tastefully done and packed with just the right amenities. The location to shopping, city beach, and restaurants was perfect and communication with Mike could not have been better. Absolutely would recommend this place for a couple’s trip or friend’s weekend away!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, easy check-in, perfectly described.
If you're there on one of these ridiculously hot days we've been having, I suggest turning the AC down to cool the upstairs bedroom, it works great.
Thanks Mike!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful tiny house with thoughtful touches. Great location. Would definitely stay here again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location and great host. Clean and comfy.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location and a great tiny home experience.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place!!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a delightful stay, in a delightful property, in a delightful town. I arrived on the Amtrak at 2:30AM, but Mike was super helpful with directions and the door access code. The house is cute but very functional with everything you might need. I especially liked the outdoor grilling area and the additional coffee beans with grinder and multiple brewing methods. The loft is cosy, the AC is cold and the WiFi (after a brief tweak from Mike) is fast. The location is great for the wonderful food and drink options in Sandpoint, and only 10 mins walk from the beach- so refreshing to jump in the lake on a warm day.
This is a new property with a couple of small outstanding snag items, but Mike is hugely receptive to getting everything in perfect condition ASAP. I hope that I can come back some day soon."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Tiny House was great, location was perfect for exploring Sandpoint and Mike was on top of everything and communicated really well with us throughout the visit!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike’s place was fabulous! He thought of all the little details. The place was clean, quiet, right next to downtown, and had plenty of space for 3 people. We cooked there and had no problems. The fire pit was also nice and fun to have!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for 4th of July weekend with my husband and 2 kids. Walked to the parade, shops, restaurants, lake, and fireworks show. Mike had the house fully stocked with essentials and was beautifully decorated. As a parent to young kids I really appreciated the black out shades!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike was a great host, he was on site when we arrived and checked in frequently to make sure everything was okay. We loved the house and wish that we hadn't arrived in the middle of record breaking heat wave so that we could spend more time on the deck or at the fire pit.
The house didn't have A/C, and Mike and I talked about what to do about the heat, once we got all the windows & the skylight open, it cooled down quick in the evening."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful clean and modern house in an amazing location. Walked to town and the beach. We appreciated how aesthetic everything was- matching plates and utensils, decorative plants. The porch was lovely to sit out under the shady trees. Great communication with the host."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a really cute place to stay, and Mike was very good at communicating. There was an issue with the water heater, but Mike warned us ahead of time and worked to fix things."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mike was a great host who answered our questions quickly. The tiny house was very clean with many extras that made it great. Enjoyed the covered deck and the fire pit area also. Will recommend it to others and plan to come back.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location within walking distance of several restaurants, bars, and other places. The tiny home is a perfect place for small groups. The speakers in the ceiling are awesome!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Good stay - very clean, organized, and walking distance from other interesting spots in town."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mike was a great host! The house was clean and very nicely put together with the porch and added bbq and gas fireplace outside! The location of it is also great! The place was within walking distance to everything downtown and was a very nice experience in Sandpoint! We will definitely be booking again!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best Airbnb experience I’ve had to date!👏🏼
Absolutely amazing Tiny home that doesn’t feel Tiny at all, especially with the big yard that includes a fire pit, gas bbq, table, and chairs,and the best part....the hanging night lights on the patio! & That’s just outside!! Inside was even cooler. I took my 6 year old daughter here when I came to visit sandpoint and she absolutely loved it! The loft bed was fun and the sky window above The bed I think may have been my favorite part of the whole home! It opens up and also Has an optional bug screen u can pull down that was perfect for us at night to be able to sleep with the window open! Amazing details in the kitchen- included salt, pepper, spices, coffee, (all organic), & every pot, pan,cast iron skillet, and kitchen item you’d possibly need. And my other favorite part was the built in ceiling speakers that connect to Bluetooth and allowed us to play music whenever we wanted throughout the house! This will be my first choice in sandpoint anytime I return no questions asked!🙏🏻✌🏼👏🏼"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, fully equipped tiny house. Location is terrific for walking to city beach and restaurants. Host is great and very helpful."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and explore Sandpoint. Nice neighborhood. Mike was very responsive to our requests and had lots of great suggestions. The Tiny House isn’t exactly as described, in our opinion it was even better. We loved sitting by the fire table talking, the deck was great! Inside they have nice dishes and pans and bedding, all much better than I even have at home and actually had to ask where he got some of the kitchen ware it was so nice. The only bad thing I have to say is the weather wasn’t great when we were there, but as far as this place to stay...if you like Tiny Houses, this one is a gem! If you have any mobility issues the stairs to the loft are steep so be aware of that, but they have great hand rails and they aren’t bad. My husband and I are aging so we noticed in a few years we may not be able to climb them. We hope to return and explore more in better weather and when we do we will definitely be staying here if it’s available!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I were looking for a quick mini-vacation and this hit the spot! The tiny house was adorable and in a really nice location, right downtown and close to restaurants, parks and the beach. We could walk to about 90% of the restaurants we wanted to check out. I was little worried about my suitcase and storage, but there were lots of little spaces to store my toiletries & clothes. The space was so clean and furnished really nicely. It really didn't feel all that small, especially with the nice deck and outdoor space. Another bonus is that while the weather got pretty warm, there was enough shade that we were always comfortable inside. I highly recommend this spot!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect tiny home in a perfect location. It was very comfortable. I can highly recommend a stay at this home.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our tiny house stay was wonderful. The place is so cozy, clean and fun. The fire out back was a great addition for the chilly spring evenings. Mike was super informative and helpful, as well as being quick to answer any and all questions. 10/10 stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a lovely little spot! My friend and I stopped in Sandpoint to break up the drive to Banff. Jodi was super friendly, a great communicator, and the place itself was wonderful! Sparkling clean with lots of cute touches. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This location was perfect! Close enough to walk downtown or to the waterfront. Cute little place with the most comfy bed and best pillows!! Jodi was great and helpful for recommendations and information.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you! We enjoyed the little gem and it was perfect for what we needed.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute, small, but well-appointed studio, right downtown! Bed and pillows were comfortable. Everything downtown has to offer is walkable from the studio, and Jodi left her driveway open for my car, which I thought was very kind. I only had a couple brief interactions with Jodi but she was very kind and welcoming. Will definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, close to downtown!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our short stay was very comfortable and cozy. Loved the peaceful atmosphere and decor. Fire pit and grill with the private patio area put the stay well above any hotel. Host was amazing and offered to turn out the sofa bed for us after a long day. Location is a short drive or bike ride to restaurants and the beach. Would definitely stay here again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a perfect place for the two of us to rest our heads in Sandpoint. It is conveniently located and with walking distance to restaurants and the lakefront.

The place is immaculate, well appointed, and very cute. the bed is super comfy and the shower has good hot water! Jodi and Michael are very kind, friendly, and respectful. we really enjoyed our stay and will stay again if it's available in the future. The outdoor area with a firepit looks fabulous - we didn't have time to make use of it, but it would be great to sit and relax by a fire in the evening. Thanks Jodi and Michael!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What an absolutely wonderful little AirBnB. The views are spectacular and the place had everything we needed and then some. This places had great vibes and probably the best view out of all the BnB’s we have stayed in. We would love to stay here again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first visit to the area and we booked at the last minute. The hosts were awesome. Very proactive, friendly and knowledgeable. The space is beautiful and the view is amazing. We hope to come back and visit again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed the weekend, the cabin is so comfortable and well designed and has amazing views!! Modern, clean and right on the mountain where you can hop on the trail just steps away! 5 stars from our doggie pal too 😊"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"lovely place to rest for a couple days. had everything we needed, bed was comfortable, bathroom was very nice and clean. beautiful views and close to the McKinnis trail. Would love to stay again in nicer weather but even the rain was nice to listen to at night and in the morning."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Loved our stay here
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,My fiance and I loved our stay here. The views are so beautiful and we loved that we were able to take our dog with us. It is such a relaxing place up in the woods yet is close to hiking trails and right near sandpoint where we were able to adventure.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We celebrated our 20th anniversary here. This cabin was clean, cozy, and had million dollar views! If you are looking for a comfortable, peaceful getaway that's still close to amenities - this is your place!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We only stayed one night, but would love to return. The space is really comfortable and stylish, and the panoramic views are jaw dropping. It’s a little slice of heaven just minutes from all of Sandpoint’s amenities."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is AMAZING. Photos don’t do the views or the place justice. 5+ stars for everything - location, cleanliness, views, comfort, all of it.

Alex was so warm and welcoming and took care of any and everything we needed and even things we didn’t know we needed (thank you for the electrolytes!!) He even went so far as to start a fire so it was ready for us while we were out getting dinner. Amazing. Truly spectacular little home in the hills with an unbelievable view of city, lake, and mountains. The wonderful hospitality has assured us that this is a place we want to visit again and again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super great host. Very friendly and approachable. Will definitely be back.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, what a spectacular view! I decided to spend the night here (versus a chain hotel) before an early morning flight from GEG (Spokane Airport). And I'm so glad I did. As soon as I stepped out of the vehicle, my jaw just dropped. The town and the lake were nestled below us, and it was such an idyllic setting. While I selected the cabin for the view, the interior was equally impressive. The decorations and furnishings all felt like Idaho, and it was evident that the owners wanted to showcase their state and town (e.g., an Idaho license plate and Mickinnick Trailhead sign). It's so wonderful to see the pride of place! The cabin exemplifies the best of Airbnb. A minor side note about Sandpoint is that trains run through the town during all hours. However, this setting in the hills is much better for noise-sensitive individuals than one in the valley. Overall, it was a superb experience and well-run accommodation."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely beautiful view, easy check-in, and great/kind hosts. Would highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This Airbnb is I think the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at! Very friendly and responsive. Gorgeous view and a nice homey feel. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our second stay at the Scenic Mountain Retreat. It was just as wonderful as the first time. Erika and Alex are wonderful hosts. Alex was even plowing the road as we were leaving for skiing one day. They are responsive hosts and provided all the comforts of home plus some. We LOVED the view and how peaceful the cabin is. You will definitely feel like this is a serene getaway yet, still able to reach the amenities of town fairly quick if need be. We highly recommend you stay here, you wont be disappointed."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Charming Airbnb with a fantastic view!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Erika’s place is great. Very comfortable, clean and cozy! Easy and flexible check in, which we appreciated. We loved the gas fireplace and the bed was comfy! However I am surprised the listing didn’t mention this- and maybe we were just there on an off night- but there is a nearby train that loudly blew its horn nearly every 45 minutes, all night, making it difficult to get any sleep as we were awoken throughout the night. If this wouldn’t bother you this place is a fantastic stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, beautiful house. Better than I expected. 5 minutes from town, 20 minutes from the mountain. Awesome view of the city. Quiet and peaceful but a short drive and you're right there in the city. Thank you Erika and Alex. Definitely recommend for a nice getaway to the mountain or just a relaxing weekend. Will definitely be coming back."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful little hideaway in the mountain. We enjoyed our stay. Super clean and cozy. We enjoyed our time watching the snow fall and checking out Sandpoint.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin has an amazing view of the lake at any time of day. The fall colors were just spectacular during my stay. This is the perfect place to unplug and relax.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice clean studio. We only stayed one short night, but it was comfortable. Great views, nice, clean, modern, and private studio, even though the owners are right next door. They had made a nice bonfire by the time we arrived in the evening. Everything was clean, comfortable and in good working order. Apart from the dogs, we had no interaction with the hosts. There seem to be a lot of friendly but big and rumbunctious off-leash dogs around, so if those scare you, make sure to communicate with Erika beforehand (not sure they were all theirs or not)! What we assume to be their dog, a beautiful Irish setter or setter mix, was very very keen to give an enthusiastic welcome. There were train horns that sounded quite loudly from the foot of the hill in the early evening, but I did not hear any between 11 pm and 6 am, when everything was extremely quiet. Lots of deer around!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Erika and Alex have a fantastic Airbnb home! The view is just incredible, we loved sitting outside and just basking in it.
The tiny home was sweet and comfortable. The hosts were super friendly and gave us tips for restaurants too.
Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Would stay again
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was a dream to stay in with wonderful views and everything that you could need. Erika was quick to respond and super accommodating!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erika’s place is beautiful and cozy, with breathtaking views. Woke up to an amazing sunrise!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A sweet perch on the mountainside with unmatched views. This private and beautiful home provided an ideal space for my fiancé and pup to explore local bike trails and rest and relax peacefully in between adventures. Alex went above and beyond to ensure our first AirBnb experience exceeded our expectations. Would have loved to stay longer but grateful for our time there.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Erika and Alex's place was exactly what we were looking for in our time at Sandpoint, close in - yet felt far away. Communication was clear and easy, enabling us to find the location and get situated with zero hassle. The place itself is beautiful, clean and simple. The big views and generous windows make this studio feel like more space than you would ever need, yet is smartly compact with modern convivences. Though on the same property as the owner/operator, we felt we had great privacy to enjoy our time on the mountain. The accommodation is well depicted in the description."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,So peaceful and very kind host! Loved the stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a sweet little getaway with a great family that built it! The hosts were so sweet and welcoming, even showing their other projects they were working on."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing. So peaceful , exactly what I was looking for. Great responsive hosts-answered any questions I had. Beautiful home & would definitely stay again! Highly recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was lovely. Would stay again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was such a great stay with amazing views. The morning sunrise over the lake is worth waking up extra early to witness. The cabin is extremely cozy and modern. The wifi was fast enough for me to get some work done as well. The hosts are very friendly and easy going! We would definitely stay here again. Not to mention it’s such a good deal. Very reasonable price for such a scenic and clean place.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thanks for the wonderful stay! Beautiful location and we'll be back soon!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The views are incredible and the space is extremely comfortable. We had a cozy stay, our vehicle was safe and late check out allowed us to enjoy our morning before getting back on the road. 5 star experience."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great hosts and amazing Views!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view is breathtaking!! Excited the house was available during our stay in Sandpoint. Would recommend 100%!🥰
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the stay was great and hope to come back every summer!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! The space and the view was beautiful. It was close to town, but felt remote. Erika and Alex were very gracious and responsive hosts. Would definitely stay again when in Sandpoint."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This guesthouse is stunning! The view out the back door is jaw dropping overlooking Sandpoint and the lake. Furthermore the gas fireplace and ac unit enable users to get the home to the perfect temperature! We will be back again! Highly recommended
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved staying one night at Heavenly Heights! Charming, peaceful, and very clean studio. The bidet was an exciting plus. Thank you for sharing your space!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Would highly recommend! The place was clean and in a great location. Would definitely come back next time we’re in Sandpoint!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Can't recommend this place enough! Located up on a mountain away from the town/crowds. So peaceful! Alex was such a lovely host (I did not meet Erika)- he showed me how to access a nearby trail and brought me fresh nectarines in the morning! Would definitely stay again. I will note that you can occasionally hear the train from town, but I imagine you probably hear it everywhere in Sandpoint! It didn't bother me with earplugs in!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful weekend getaway! Beautiful view and welcoming hosts!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,this little home is well worth it! highly recommend coming here for a quiet getaway and to see the amazing view of sandpoint! Alex and Erika were very kind and welcoming!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a gem. I feel so fortunate that I found it as I literally stayed on mountain top with a view worth 10x what I paid. Amazing hosts and extremely responsive. This was the easiest check in/out process yet. If I am in the area I will 100 percent be back. Great job on creating a truly stunning place for people to enjoy. Seriously amazing.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed staying for a couple of nights in Sandpoint after a trip to Glacier National Park. The guesthouse was easy to find and offered an amazing view of the lake. Everything in the house was exactly as listed and the hosts were very friendly.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This beautiful little cabin in the woods is the perfect place to get away. It has a clear view of the Lake and trees that you can actually see from the bed! Erica and Alex were so helpful. They showed us a short-cut to get to the McKinnick trail which is a must-do. They helped me wash my Stand-up Paddleboard and cleaned the grill for us. The place is not big but has space for everything you bring (we had bikes, SUP, pickleball rackets, cowboy boots, hiking shoes....you name it.). Plenty of space outside to leave your toys. It is very close to town (driving though not walking) and to the lake. Totally comfy and cozy and they make it feel like you are visiting friends. Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Two big thumbs up for this cottage and Erika and Alex!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful place! Great very super quite. We loved sitting outside and just enjoying the view but you can choose to do that from the bed inside also.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Erika and Alex's place is nothing short of perfection. The view speaks for itself, but the space was so thoughtfully designed and laid out. So many thoughtful touches - from the cordless phone charger to the boot drier for those staying during ski season - there is truly not an inch of the space where comfort and convenience of guests wasn't considered. Hosts were extremely responsive while providing space and privacy. The trains that others have mentioned were heard, but not an issue for us. We so enjoyed Sandpoint and look forward to another visit soon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a blast staying at Alex and Erika’s place. The home and view are beautiful, and the hosts are incredibly thoughtful and friendly."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our two night stay at Erika’s place. It was welcoming and peaceful, with thoughtful accents and accommodations. It had a wonderful view of Lake Pend Oreille. Our dog had fun meeting their dog. Erika is an amazing host! A true a gem on Airbnb!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay. The view was beautiful and it was such a quiet and peaceful location. The cabin was modern, beautifully decorated, and spotlessly clean. It was also very thoughtful that the fridge was stocked with beer and water. Definitely recommend and can’t wait to go back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a fantastic property! Friendly hosts, beautiful surroundings, and an amazing view!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is the perfect place to stay in the Sandpoint area. Erika is the perfect host. Helpful and available to assist with the many questions you have. This property is perfect great location- private but very easy access to all the area has to offer. There is no reason to stay at anywhere else in Sandpoint. The view is outstanding. If you go to Sandpoint this is where you should stay!!!! The added benefit of having this family as your host. We will be back.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Alex and Erika were perfect hosts. The place has beautiful arial views of the lake and Airport (for av geeks) and they stock it with plenty of conveniences in case you forget something. Property is perfect for dogs and has well finished concrete floors. Lots of privacy. Good luck on your next build Alex!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay on Heavenly Heights Road was just what we needed for our getaway to Sandpoint!! It was incredibly beautiful, peaceful, had everything we needed for a cozy cabin stay. The cabin itself is amazing, fire pit outside made for a magical evening under the stars, and waking up to the view over Lake Pend Oreille was absolutely gorgeous. Erika and her husband were so friendly, and their dog Timber even came to say hello! We would stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful stay! Stunning views and well decorated. Perfect for a romantic getaway!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Erika & Alex’s place felt like luxury after a long day of driving. It’s one of the cleanest air bnbs I’ve ever stayed in. We only stayed one night along our road trip, but we wished that we could have stayed more so we could explore the area. Sandpoint is beautiful and for a place that felt remote to us, there were plenty of great food options. We’ll definitely be making plans to go back and enjoy everything the area has to offer!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little place with beautiful views! Would definitely stay here again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a lovely place! Hosts were fantastic! The place was very clean and well put together!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"great location and great views, quiet and serene. will definitely be back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Erika and Alex’s! The house was very private and the views were beautiful! The hosts were extremely accommodating and we appreciated the book of local recommendations and board games! We had a great time in Sandpoint and a relaxing stay at this Airbnb!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Erika was a fantastic host! Check in was super easy. Was everything we needed and more for our stay in Sandpoint! Would definitely recommend staying at this beautiful home!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Beautiful views of the valley and lake.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was the perfect place to relax and enjoy the area!
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The house has a great view, super clean and modern and great size. Alex and Erika’s are very nice and friendly. Just being honest though, the only complaint we have (and I’m surprised that other reviews have not mentioned this) is the trains. The expectation of the pictures of the property is it’s quiet and rural since it’s high up on the mountain side. On Friday night the train ran every 45 min and it blows the whistle several times at each crossing. On Saturday night it ran a couple times and no idea what weekdays are like. If you’re a light sleeper this is not the place for you."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Immaculate and superbly designed cabin with luxury comforts and stunning lake view! Wonderful hosts! I would definitely stay again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Above and beyond with the little touches and amenities.
Highly recommend staying here while visiting Sand Point. Great view. Friendly hosts. Felt like a good value for a long weekend.
Love that it’s dog friendly and had private outdoor area with a fire pit"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Erika was extremely responsive and checked in with me beforehand to make sure we had everything we needed.
They have a beautiful place that exceeded my expectations.
I would happily stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Erika and Alex are the kindest hosts. Their place is clean and stocked with whatever you need. One of our top Airbnb experiences! Thank you!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing stay! They even had the fire going for when we arrived and it was amazing along side a breathtaking view! Definitely worth the experience(:
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying here! Erika and Alex alway make me feel like family and are gracious, kind hosts!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place, great views!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a peaceful and beautiful retreat. This is a perfect getaway location. I loved the single room design! The high ceiling, expansive windows, and thoughtful furniture and amenities make it feel large. The concrete floor is a nice touch. The view onto Lake Pend Oreille, Sandpoint, and Ponderay was incredible. I was fortunate to watch the storms roll in from the south on my first night, getting to appreciate lightening. Erich and Erika are excellent hosts. I highly recommend this retreat!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this little cabin and the quiet, peaceful area. One of my favorite things is how the morning sun absolutely floods the bed…. So so lovely. Hosts are friendly and I felt so cared for in a difficult time of my life. Will be back as soon as I can🖤"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was short, but amazing! The perfect spot to unplug and recharge. The cabin was cute and cozy. It had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. The view is spectacular!! We headed out for dinner and were pleasantly surprised to find a fire had been started for us in the fire pit when we returned. Already planning another stay up here soon! Friendly and communicative hosts."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay! Beautiful views, cozy and warm cabin, and they even had an outdoor fire going for us when we pulled up. The family is very friendly and kind. Love that it was dog friendly, and their dog Timber is very sweet, playful, and friendly. Will definitely be back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Stunning view and just adorable as ever. Thank you for letting me and 🐶 Frankie. Stay we will definitely be back.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alex & Erika were friendly and easy going hosts. The location and guesthouse have great ambiance. Super slick access to some great hiking. Highly recommend the stay and wouldn't hesitate to book again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely beautiful cabin. Next door to owners home. The front door has windows and no covering, felt like that should have had a covering to help with light in the morning. Beautiful views and thoughtful amenities! Dog friendly but not a lot of room to take the dog potty. We had rain and snowy weather even though it’s April so we did a lot of driving and exploring vs hiking as planned, but still had a great time for our anniversary. Would stay here again if it’s just us and not our kids too."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I had a great time at Erika’s place. It has a spectacular view of the lake and mountains! The cabin was very clean and well appointed. We live about 4 hours away and made a quick trip to Sandpoint for my wife’s birthday. This was the perfect place for us to stay, we both love this kind of location. The real treat was the heated toilet seat in the bathroom. You and Alex truly are 5 star hosts.
Thanks for the memories!
Bill & Sally and Otis"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay, Alex and Erika are wonderful hosts and made me feel right at home."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Couldn’t have asked for a nicer spot to spent the night. Very clean, quiet, and beautiful setting. Highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay for a ski weekend at Schweitzer. The cabin itself is so cute and clean and has amazing views of sand point and the lake. Only a quick 20 minute drive to the mountain. Dog friendly was a major plus!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Make a fire! It’s worth it. It’s so peaceful on the mountainside. Have a nice long breakfast and take it in. Must do the Mickinick hike down the hill from the house. Check out Eichardt’s for a good meal/bar exp. Great place and great hosts.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect get-away oasis of warmth and coziness!! I can’t wait to stay here again!! 😊
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place with an amazing view. Looking forward to staying up there again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our peaceful and relaxing stay at this cabin! It had everything we needed. Loved the nearby trails.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was great with a beautiful view of the lake and mountains. The hosts were great and responsive. They even contacted me before check in to make everything go smooth. Schweitzer was definitely worth seeing and this stay was just at the bottom of the mountain.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Erika and Alex's place was a top-notch stay! It is exactly how it is pictured in the photos: clean, spacious, stellar views, and all the comforts of home plus a little extra. The place was spotless on our arrival and Alex left us a message when the place was ready for check in. The hosts are very responsive-they live next door and may see them from time to time. We loved staring out the windows at Lake Pend O'Rielle every morning with our coffee that was provided in the home. We truly appreciate dog friendly stays and our hosts were very gracious letting us walk our dog around the property. It is just enough out of town to get that mountain living feel and only a 10-15 minute drive to restaurants and shops. It was about a 25 minute drive to Schweitzer mountain. We would love to stay again and really appreciated having a ""home away from home."" You will not be disappointed in this stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, beautiful sunrise view over the lake and mountains. Cozy and comfortable bed - found it difficult to get up in the mornings! Would recommend."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was short but sweet! A couple of friends and I stayed one night while we skied at Schweitzer Mountain. The home was comfortable and clean! As an added bonus Alex allowed us to plug our crock pot in before are planned check-in, very flexible and easy people to work with. I recommend this stay to anyone!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfectly quiet and private space with great views. We enjoyed being out in the woods away from everything. Easy access between Sandpoint and Schweitzer to ski.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Totally great host Highly recommended!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was absolutely amazing! My fiancé and I stayed with our dog and it was perfect for a relaxing long weekend. Both Alex & Erika were so accommodating and friendly. We especially appreciated the local recommendations. The house is thoughtfully laid out and has the most incredible view. We hope to come visit again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent accommodations for a weekend at Schweitzer! Peaceful and quiet with super easy check in. We’d happily stay here again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was the perfect spot for a weekend of skiing at Schweitzer mountain. The views here were amazing! We will defiantly be back!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Erika is a terrific host and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The view and peaceful atmosphere were just what we needed to rest and recharge. And the location was quite convenient for both skiing at Schweitzer and doing things in town.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place is only a few minutes away from Schweitzer Red Barn Park and Ride stop. The view is spectacular. You can see Alex and Erika put lots of thoughtful details into the place when you built and decorated the place.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful spot, close to Schweitzer mountain. Beautiful little cabin with the right amount of amenities. Host came out and greeted us, despite our very short stay. Very kind to do so. We would certainly recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a blast. thank you for a great stay!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely place with beautiful views! Felt very homey and peaceful. Exactly the atmosphere I hoped for.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great time visiting this “home away from home” ! Great views over the city and lake, particularly sunrise."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice place and bigger than what we thought from the pictures. Great view of the area and the lake. Getting to the place was a little tricky because of the steep road and the snow but they did a great job maintaining the road and communicating to us. Would stay there again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing location with beautiful winter views!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Erika and Alex are wonderful hosts! We came there during a winter snowstorm and the private road was plowed before we arrived. The cabin itself is very warm and inviting. Alex and Erika have created a peaceful oasis!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The view here is stunning and, situated above, Sandpoint, there is a real sense of peace and solitude. The place had everything we needed to really relax, make our own meals, and take a deep breath. It is a short drive to Ponderay and Sandpoint and very close to Schweitzer. Erika and her family are delightful, especially their friendly dogs. Surrounded by boulders and woods, this is an ideal place to get away and get some perspective for a few days."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had an absolutely amazing stay. So many thoughtful touches and the home was clean and comfortable-it truly felt like home! We would definitely stay again and would recommend to everyone!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great hospitality. Absolutely beautiful view from inside the cabin.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed at Erika and Alex’s place for a short little get away to celebrate his birthday and it was a great experience! Check in was was easy and Erika and Alex were sweet enough to have a fire going in the fire pit outside for us when we arrived- we only had one question for them while there and they were very quick to respond. The cabin was clean, had an amazing view, and was just overall cozy/homey. We would definitely recommend this beautiful little place to our friends and hope to be able to stay there again in the warmer months."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was easily the best AirbNb experience we’ve ever had. We had car troubles right before we were supposed to head there but Alex was extremely helpful and patient with us as we worked through it. Erika and Alex were so easy to communicate with and a couple times Alex dropped what he was doing to come show us trails or just to make sure everything was going well. He even asked if we needed anything from the grocery store for Thanksgiving because he knew our rental car would be iffy on the ice. The cabin is exactly as advertised and it’s just incredibly beautiful and cozy. This was a 10/10 experience and we hope to be back soon!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect
As presented
Host super supportive
Gratitude"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful cabin retreat with an amazing view. Perfect little getaway for my wife and I.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tidy cabin perched in the hills with a view of town, the water, and mountains. It’s close to Sandpoint when you want to be out-and-about, yet remote when you want to cozy up “at home” by the fireplace. Our family had a wonderful stay during the changing of seasons!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views , very peaceful"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Erika and Alex were wonderful hosts! We felt at home immediately and continued to feel that way for the duration of our 5 day, 4 night stay. The cabin is thoughtfully planned out and has everything one needs for a comfortable stay. The view out the enormous front windows is nothing short of spectacular looking out to the town of Sandpoint, the lake, and Selkirk mountains beyond. We won't hesitate to book again should we be up north in the future. Thank you so much!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute spot, wish I could have stayed more days! Hosts were great!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfection. Absolutely beautiful location and the accommodations are incredible. Highly recommend!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a fabulous stay! The hosts provided for everything we could have needed, the place was immaculate and adorable, and the view was so amazing! We had coffee outside with the sunrise. We were there for our 44th wedding anniversary, and the time we spent at this little cabin was restorative and relaxing - it is secluded and quiet, but very close to the town and many activities :) I would highly recommend it!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place with grate views! We loved staying here!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy place with a super nice view of the lake from up high. Cozy and clean little place, pet friendly place!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just gorgeous place with stellar views. It was a bit smoky from wildfires this time of year but the cabin was outfitted with an air purifier and many other thoughtful comforts that made our stay restful. A must see is Schweitzer mountain resort then in 20 minutes you can be at the beach in Sandpoint! Sandpoint is a sweet upscale town with lots of shops and trendy restaurants.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location!!! Such a cozy little spot! Will defiantly be back!!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay in Sandpoint was wonderful. Erika and Alex were very welcoming. The view from the cottage is amazing.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very peaceful, quiet and private enough place. We loved the big windows, outdoor shower, lack of a television and the birds and deer sharing the hillside with us."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We will be back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great little place to stay for a weekend away and to unplug. Loved having kitchen space to be able to cook some of our own meals or we ventured across the bridge to Sandpoint to find some local places to eat. Loved the radiant flooring so warm on the feet :) Great view of the lake (we misjudged how close to the water we actually were - thought we could walk to it but it's not that close and is private waterfronts on that side vs some public access across the bridge)
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It was exactly what me and my partner were looking for. Wasn't hard to find and good room for parking. Great view of the water surrounded by trees and sounds of nature. The room/cabin was just as enjoyable as the view. Very cute set up with everything you need. The heated floor in the bathroom was especially nice. That was such a good surprise. To finish it all off the king bed facing the glass sliding doors looking at the trees and water was just perfect. Such an amazing getaway as both my partner and I enjoyed every second there in peace.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"“Cabin” is not the right term. This new modern simple studio sits in a perfect location with a great view of the lake and surrounding mountains. Beautifully decorated, great linens a fabulous porch to sit on. Pretty perfect place for us to chill, rest and get some work done.
Some great hikes near by.
This is one of those special properties that is well thought out and carefully and kindly managed. Will be back.
Best if all! The outdoor shower. Yes!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very clean, cozy, and peaceful stay with a remarkable view! We loved being only a short drive to downtown Sandpoint but far enough out of the city for the peace and quiet. We enjoyed listening to the trains and watching them far in the distance as they came and went to town. We couldn’t have asked for a better sunset view!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is, without a doubt, my favorite place I’ve ever stayed. The cabin itself was perfect. It’s amazing with great views and in an incredible location. It has all the perks of a secluded cabin but with the added bonus of having a cute, little town just a 10-15 minute drive away. I still can’t get over the mountains & the lake. I wish I had more time there!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here earlier this month. It was peaceful and beautiful and exactly what we needed for our trip away!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This couple's getaway was the highlight of our weekend together. The house was absolutely beautiful and had a wonderful view of the lake.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was adorable, such a beautiful location and perfect size for two people. It was close enough to a city to grab a bite at a restaurant but also in a very private and peaceful location. The hosts were super responsive and extremely proactive with giving instructions. They even gave a guide of local recommendations for food and activities, which was much appreciated!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute place to stay and the best views to wake up to! Chelsey was so sweet and very good at communicating! Definitely would come back here!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This spot is an absolute gem. The location is great, beautiful setting and close to town. It was also not too far from Schweitzer which was awesome! Very responsive and helpful hosts, you can tell they put a lot of thought and love into this cabin. We enjoyed a night in playing scrabble and waking up to a gorgeous view overlooking the lake. We hope to be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Couldn’t have asked for a better Valentine’s Day retreat for myself and my girlfriend.

2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice, cozy little cabin. It was clean and bright inside. The hosts were great, they paid appropriate attention to detail and the amenaties were comfortable. The cabin space is smaller than it looks in the pictures, but it was very pleasant and comfortable. The setting was beautiful, and we really enjoyed staying here. Would definitely recommend as a private couples getaway."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kara and Tarzan’s place was a wonderful place to stay while visiting the Sandpoint area. Kitchen is very clean and well equipped. The bed is super comfortable. The deck was my favorite place to relax. It looks out on the pool and has a lake view.
The weather didn’t cooperate during our visit, but the kayaks and bicycles would have been great to use!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most amazing weekend at the condo! Loved the place, the location, amenities, all of it. We rode the provided bikes across the long bridge, walked around downtown and ate delicious food, swam in the pool and the lake! The perfect getaway location, we will definitely be back and for a longer duration next time. I didnt want to leave. Thanks so much for sharing your beautiful place!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay very much.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! We enjoyed our stay, especially having access to the pool right outside and the kayaks."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nicely furnished, comfortable and clean condo in a great location. Easy to bike or walk into town and around the area. We appreciated the items supplied for the kitchen and laundry, and the AC unit worked great! We really enjoyed sitting on the small deck with a nice view of the pool and lake. We loved using the bikes and kayaks! The bed was very comfortable. The only problem we had was in using the TV. A representative of the hosts and then the host were very responsive in offering suggestions to resolve the Wi-Fi connectivity problem, which was finally done by connecting the TV via Ethernet cable instead of Wi-Fi. However, then the problem was that although it was advertised to have both cable and Netflix, neither were available. Error messages were “TV not part of your Netflix Household,” and “No signal” for TV cable."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was exactly as described, very clean and an easy walk to downtown."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely charming condo, beautifully and functionally decorated. Incredibly clean. Gorgeous kitchen. Beautiful deck with view of the pool and lake. Lovely outdoor furniture. Comfy beds and cupboards all labeled- love that! The pool has a 9 foot deep end, so fun for jumping in with my kiddo. Pool was never crowded and has comfortable chaises for lounging. Other residents were very friendly. Excellent instructions. It would be a wonderful place for a long stay- washer and dryer and walkable to downtown. Loved it."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Found a beautiful trail within waking distance. We walked everyday to a different restaurant in downtown Sandpoint. Very close to the pool. We had everything we needed.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great base for exploring Sandpoint! Comfortable place, well-stocked kitchen, and great property."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Really fun place to stay and great location! Only complaint was no AC (host said they put them out over memorial day for the summer). It was over 90 degrees in the condo which made us not enjoy it much during the day but the hosts had no control over the weather and it truly was my only complaint. Very cute condo.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you for a wonderful adventure! We LOVED the rocking chairs and the location near nature. We actually watched an osprey hunting at the docks on the property. The neighbors were all friendly and there were lots of great places in town. City Beach park is a must visit and of course there are lots of beautiful nature destinations in the vicinity.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay!!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one beautiful place to rent. I would recommend it if you’re coming into Sandpoint Idaho. It’s easy to get around and easy to get to and close to the freeway entrance. If you’re out of gas, they have a gas station right at the entrance of the driveway. So you are never worried about running out of gas.!! Lol we felt right at home and everything was perfect. Thank you Kara and Taran for letting us write your house. We look forward to coming back."

2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This was a nice spot for a little get away! A little hard for me to find personally in the complex and loud upstairs neighbors but that’s not a fault to the owner. Just worth mentioning if you are hoping for a quiet spot. Lovely location near the city and beach.

It was a bonus to have access to kayaks and bikes. Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location on the water front. Loved having the bicycles available to use. Wish the kayaks could have been used, but understand it is seasonal. Very clean, and cute place that was comfortable. One of the nicest and well stocked Airbnb's that I have ever stayed in. Walking distance to the little downtown area, or just hop on the bikes and cruise around, or ride across the bridge on the Serenity Lee Trail."

We appreciated access to kayaks, bicycles and helmets, games, pool towels, washer/dryer, portable AC, fans and more. We definitely recommend this condo and look forward to staying again. Thank you!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great place near the heart of downtown Sandpoint. Being a lower floor unit it was great to have a walkout patio to enjoy the pool area. We were there for the 4th and were able to enjoy the fireworks from the lawn area by the water (at night in the summer wear bug spray for the mosquitoes!). We are a small family of 4, two almost teens and us two adults, and for the summer sleeping was fine. If we all 4 were to be here throughout the day (colder weather) it would be a small space but it worked for us since we were outside most of the day. Thank you for the portable AC unit as it kept the space nice and cool in the triple digits outside. Parking was a plenty even on the holiday weekend. Bedroom bed was quite comfortable. Hideaway was decent. Thank you for the blackout curtains off the patio for the hideaway sleeper use. There were some minor footsteps from neighbors above but not much of an issue. There are docks and a few stairways into the lake but no beach area if that’s what you are after. You can still swim out here at the lake or drop a kayak or floaty. Due to the heat during our stay we didn’t walk to town, we just hopped in the car and parking in town was pretty easy. You could walk but you walk through the back of a gas station and a gap lot to where the sidewalk begins. I’ve been a bit random on this review but just wanted to add info that may be of interest to others. Enjoyed our stay on Pend Oreille!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was equipped with everything needed, it was full of great amenities and was very comfortable."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptional. The location is outstanding. Communication is superb. I felt like I had a personal travel agent, not just an airbnb host. Kitchen fully stocked, comfy couch, steps away from the pool, view of the lake, 10 min bike ride to town and nearby bike baths. We took advantage of all the amenities - pool, kayaks, bikes, proximity to the town. We had wonderful dinners/lunches at Beets and Basil and UTARA and enjoyed cooking in the remodeled kitchen. Bathroom fully stocked with shampoo, conditioner, soap, towels. Kitchen fully stocked with olive oil, pans, even a blender to make smoothies! The bedroom gets bright, so we recommend bringing an eye patch to sleep in during the summer. Super friendly neighbors, we were fortunate to meet Pat :-)"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first trip to Sandpoint and we could not have asked for a better place to stay. The condo is beautifully decorated with top of line appliances. Access to the pool, kayaks and bikes were an added treat. and perfect for our first getaway in 2 years. Added bonus was being able to fish on my birthday from the kayaks and from the dock. Communication was superb and we look forward to coming back again next year!"
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in this clean, comfortable condo. The bed was really comfy! The place was cute, well appointed and a great location."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Loved it. Great location. Private and serene. Clean and ideal.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Clean and stylish and comfortable. Loved the pool and the kayaks. A bit smaller than I expected but very nice.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,It's a lovely little condo. I've seen some of the older units at condo del sol and they did a great job with the remodel of this space. So bright and open! The location can't be beat and the host provides many great local recommendations. We made a game out of it and did our best to try them all. We would definitely come back to Kara and Taran's place!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A very nice space. Clean, stylish, and perfect for a short getaway. Would stay again."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great location and very comfortable outdoor patio. Easy walk to everything.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful condo in the perfect location! We came here on our first family vacation with our 1 year old, and had the best experience. Loved being water front, but still only having a 5 minute walk to the heart of downtown. Super clean, homey, beautiful finishes and lots of amenities. We loved having the pool be basically right out the back door, and spent a lot of time on the patio in the evenings. Great family friendly condo. We definitely want to come back next year!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, clean get away."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The condo was nice and access to the lake great!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice modern condo, perfect getaway for two people. The place is pretty close to downtown. They offer kayaks and bikes with your stay. My wife and I rode the bikes every morning to go get coffee. It was great."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location. We enjoyed the pool and bikes. It was very convenient to walk or bike to restaurants and to the beach. Recently remodeled with a stylish decor. Very clean and well stocked. The washer and dryer were great to have so we could pack light. It's a small space, but that was perfect for our family of three. There is good separation between the living area and the bedroom. The king bed was super comfortable, but bring earplugs and a sleeping mask if you are sensitive. There was a lot of noise from the upstairs units and light through the blinds that made it hard to sleep once the sun came up."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This condo is great, perfect location to downtown/lake/pool, provides all of the extras you could possibly want-bikes/kayaks/basketball/tennis gear/life jackets/bike helmets/bocce ball, shampoos and conditioner, k-cup coffee and creamer, beach towels, bath robes....you guys thought of everything!!! Thank you!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is beautiful, exceptionally high quality remodel and finish. View from the porch of pool and river is lovely! It’s well located with a short walk to city center, and parking is extremely easy. You do hear some highway traffic if you’re outside, otherwise it was quiet. We enjoyed our stay!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Sandpoint. Has everything. Great location...and a super comfortable bed!

2020-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful view right on Lake Pend Oreille. Super convenient to downtown, beach, shops & park. Cruiser bikes were fun to ride around town on."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great location and great hosts. Very nice remodel. Super clean condo, with a lovely porch, complete with rocking chairs so you can have a wonderful spot to capture the morning sun while enjoying your cup of coffee, and contemplating your day’s adventures.
Kara and Taran are great about communicating. It’s been a pleasure to stay in their condo and we appreciate all the work they put in to making this a great experience."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Precious little condo! Clean, well decorated!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very clean well supplied place with all of the modern conveniences of home. The porch is a great place for visiting and views. Lake access on property and close to bike trails.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kara and Taran's place was great. Listing on AirBNB accurately depicts the condo. Beautiful and clean. They've thought of everything. We hope to come back in the summer so we can enjoy more of the amentities offered, like the bikes and kayaks."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and excellent accommodations!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We thought this was a great find in Sandpoint. Condo is compact but very comfortable and spotlessly clean. We’d love to come stay here again.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great condo in a great location. Awesome pad!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I cannot write enough about what an amazing place this is. I actually would like to keep it a secret so I can always come and no one else will know!😉. Best location. Best hosts. Best place.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay! Stylish, cozy and so close to downtown! We want to come back during the warmer months so we can utilize the bikes and cruise around downtown. We also want to use the kayaks next time, as well. The bed was comfy, the tv was huge, the fireplace was relaxing.
Bonus points due to their TV being already signed in to a Netflix and Hulu account, for the evenings when things were winding down."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place, nice and clean, a short easy walk to downtown."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This by far the BEST place! It is stylish, modern, plus the perfect location. I will stay here again and again!"
2020-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It is a lovely little condo with wonderful Amenities. We did arrive to no heat and tried for a couple hours to warm the condo with a space heater and a couple wall heaters. We only got it up to 55 degrees. But a call to Kara quickly remedied the problem, since something needed to be reset in the heater. I wish we had called sooner because the condo then heated up very nicely. The modern look and extras are what made this condo a lovely place to stay. The pictures don’t quite show how small the place really is. And there are a couple steps in the condo as you first come in. You have to go up those stairs to access the living room and kitchen. The entrance is a bit crowded by the washing machine and dryer which doesn’t give the best first impression. But the bedroom, bath, living room and kitchen are lovely spaces and well decorated. The condo is well stocked and very clean. One surprise though was having to strip our own linens and towels and start a load of wash. Normally this would not phase me, but we paid a hefty cleaning fee and still had to do this."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place to stay. Clean. Easy to get in. The building was difficult to find but when we located the right one everything was fantastic. Clean. Warm. Perfect location near park, bridge and shops. We will stay here again :)"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very clean and comfortable condo with great walking distance location from town and some of the area trails. Condo is set up with everything we needed and more for our weeks stay. Kara and Taran even accommodated a last minute adjustment in the days of our stay! Would rent from them again.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very responsible and responsive host. Had a nice time. Thank you so much.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Conveniently located, well equipped and cozy. Would certainly stay again!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The condo was clean and cozy. My wife and I enjoyed visiting the restaurants recommended by the hosts. Ending the evening in front of the fireplace was romantic and relaxing.

2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay, the condo is perfect! Great location and super cute. Would definitely stay again!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This vacation property has been completely renovated and is very clean and beautiful. The location is fantastic, situated right on the waters, and we were within easy walking distance to the shops and restaurants. Great place to stay!"

2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just an amazing spot! Location is perfect (relative to Sandpoint overall, the lake, and within the complex itself. Pool is just steps from the back porch. The remodel was wonderfully done, and everything is perfect inside. Would highly recommend staying a Kara and Taran's place!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding condo in beautiful Sandpoint !! Everything perfectly clean and loved the decor which added to our relaxation weekend at the Festival !! Would definitely stay here again and again . PERFECTION 😊
2019-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This is an amazing cozy condo with all the special touches. Bikes! Kayaks! A pool right outside the unit. I love the Bluetooth speaker in the bathroom! I rocked out in the shower. So fun.
Having access to Netflix on the tv was another awesome perk. We were tired by days end and it was just the right thing to end the day as a family.
Thank you very much Kara and Taran! We will be back!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect location. We walked to local bars, restaurants and city Beach. It was fun to use the kayaks and the pool was refreshing! The condo was very clean and comfortable!! The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to cook!"
2019-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Close to town and loved exploring on the bikes!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"As the previous reviews before coming, the condo was everything we expected. As the key is easy to lose, don’t take it with you every time you leave. Just leave it in the lock box."
2019-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The awesome - This condo is great for a couple. Not so much if you have a baby. So if it was just us I would give 5 stars. Super clean, stocked with all you need and the access to the lake and pool are amazing. Quick responses from penny., the host which was helpful. This place is a great great getaway for the romantic couple. The “okay”, which is why I have it 4 stars....The condo does have stairs in the unit so for a crawling baby - no bueno. If the unit was bigger, a flight of stairs would be no problem, but with little space for crawling and hang out, it makes it tough to block it off. I would suggest this host recommended that the unit isn’t really suited for infants / babies. And the upstairs unit is LOUD. Really really loud. You can hear people walking, flushing toilets and showering.... and conversations. To be expected with an older condo building, I totally get it. So again, if it were just us then we can deal. But for sleeping baby. Eh...... all in all, a great space for us, just not is with baby."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was lovely! We had such a nice stay! The condo was super clean and well equipped. We are a family of 4 and although it was a little tight in the house- we made it work. We really wanted to be in a lower unit because of the walk out to the grass as we have young kids and it was perfect. It was a lovely space to be in - nice and bright, new renovation, comfortable furniture, great outdoor space and amazing king size bed! We were so comfortable at night! This place is worth the price just for the bed alone! The hosts responded very quickly to any queries and were super accommodating . The washer and dryer worked fabulous! The kitchen was well equipped and such a nice space to be in especially in the morning with the sun! The outdoor deck was amazing- we were out there enjoying it every night for dinner and drinks. The bikes were fabulous! I wish we could of stayed longer. We will definitely miss the convenience of being in that awesome town! Thanks so much for a great stay!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful condo to stay in! Super clean and cozy. Fantastic location. Easy walk to town. Had a wonderful pool and view of lake.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Spot
The beach cruisers are key to be able to ride a couple blocks into town to eat and or drink and ride back.
Magic!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"So beautiful and clean! We really enjoyed our stay, especially the pool and riding the beach cruiser bikes!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you want to stay in one of the most beautiful condos, with a fantastic location, look no further. Beautifully appointed and clean enough to walk on any floor barefoot, this is one of my new favorites. Communication is excellent, so easy to get in and out. My sister said that she would like to live here forever with the first 3 minutes we were inside. Don't hesitate to book. It was a perfect weekend. Walking in town, kayaking right outside the condo, and a movie night in the most comfy places you'll ever stay!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, clean, modern condo centrally located. Very well thought out and equipped !
I will return!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a really great experience! They were really great at communicating, and they went above and beyond to be great hosts. I purchased a weekend away for my parents for Mother’s Day, and I can’t say enough wonderful things about the hosts, but here is their review below:
It was the perfect quick little getaway. Everything we needed and more was there. So clean, comfortable and very cozy. A great place to relax and unwind. Location to downtown Sandpoint was perfect. Would like to go back for our 25th Anniversary this summer."

2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing Air Bnb. I’d totally stay here again! Thanks Kara and Taran!
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The moment we walked in the door it felt like we were on vacation! Kara and Taran created a little Oasis right in downtown Sandpoint, ( just walking distance to shops and restaurants and a leap away from the water.) The decor is filled with a soft and breezy cottage charm mixed with a modern touch. (I was even awed by the linens... so soft and cozy.) The condo is spotless and everything had its place. It was a peaceful place to wake up to with a view of the mountains and just steps away from the water. With a full kitchen and most importantly a Keurig and coffee provided, I had all I needed. We will be back!
A.G."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot!
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful place in a great location! It was everything we were hoping for!

2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful location, right by the lake, easy walk to downtown and great dining / shopping and for our trip super access to Schweitzer where you are on your boards in 20 minutes from the condo. Beautifully decorated, great amenities. Really a wonderful location and look forward to returning for more great skiing!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a treasure! Beautifully renovated space with a perfect cooking kitchen and entertaining space ideal for big dinners and cozy movies snuggled up in front of the cute little faux fireplace. Beyond thrilled by the location by the lake and downtown, the perfect space, the wildly comfortable king bed, the gorgeous linens, and the local, stylish decor. Will be booking again!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Taran and Kara’s place was absolutely perfect! There were four of us and it worked out great. The condo is so cozy and it was spotless!

Would definitely recommend this Airbnb to friends and family. Thanks for being such great hosts Taran and Kara.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect spot to relax and chill. The place is modern and comfortable. And Sandpoint is awesome.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying at your condo. Everything was perfect, bed, shower, kitchen, washing machine, TV. We did some kayaking in early morning which was awesome. A real gem in our roadtrip."
2018-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, newly remodeled and stylish furnishings.
The upstairs condo was doing construction work (replacing carpet) which made for a noisy stay."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2018-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Clean and nice Condo, close to downtown."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,wonderful condo in a great location. we loved using the bikes to cruise around the downtown area. quiet condo with beautiful decor. perfect for our family with one child.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Had everything I needed to cook dinners. Very easy to find and close walk to restaurants and downtown. Very clean and well thought out. Will stay again if in the area.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a great place for a small family. The location is excellent as we could walk to the beach and the restaurants on 1st Avenue in 10 - 15 minutes (or drive in under 5 minutes). The pool was just off the back deck which made it very easy to go for a quick swim whenever we wanted. We didn't get a chance to use the kayaks or bikes but did enjoy having a tennis court right there. Silverwood Amusement Park/Water Park is only a 30 minute drive. My son and I will definitely stay here again if/when we return to Sandpoint.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joyful Kindness greeted us at their peaceful condo! We had a wonderful time!
M,M,J,J &bJ :)"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Taran and Kara's condo was perfect for our stay. It was nice having use of the kayaks.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent space. Beautifully renovated recently. We enjoyed the amenities such as the pool, bikes, tennis courts and the lake. Location was very close to the public beach and local restaurants and pubs. The owners were extremely kind and accommodating and surprised us with fruit, salmon and a portable air conditioner. There was 4 of us and we fit in the unit just fine."
2018-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Recently remodeled, stylish, and well appointed condominium. Kitchen nice and fully stocked. Nice pool, and complex is on the lake with dock for boats. Kayaks and a bike available from owner. Close to downtown. We really enjoyed our stay. Things to consider: It’s a small single bedroom unit. Not a lot of room to spread out so best for a couple. We had our teen daughter and pullout sleeper sofa worked well but takes up most of living area. Being summer we could expand the living space to lovely deck with dining and seating options overlooking pool and view of lake. If it were winter I’d feel a bit confined. Also no air conditioning and while we loved the heat and sun during our stay, the condo gets quite warm. Ceiling fan in bedroom helped greatly but if you’re used to AC be prepared. Sandpoint is great and this was excellent home base to explore. Go to Evans Brothers Coffee on Church Street for your daily caffeine needs. Five minute bike ride away. I think Sweitzer was about a 30 minute (summer) drive. Silverwood water park about 50 minutes."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic location! Great space in a quiet condo complex right by the lake. The bikes were awesome and made it super easy to get around town. The place was clean and had everything you could need. It is slightly small, we were four people and this place is better for 2 or 3. The only thing that was missing was some storage space in the living room. We had two people sleeping on the pull out couch and they had nowhere to put their stuff other than the bedroom which is kind of awkward. The patio was great, had lovely dinners out there. We did have a few minor issues (spotty internet and a flat bike tire) but Mike was quick to respond and did what he could to help. I would definitely stay again. The renovations they have done to the place are lovely as well."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nicely renovated, great location. Relaxing stay."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Definitely cozy for a family of 4, but if you're okay with that, it's really perfect. Great location (walking/biking to town), nice remodel and both pool and lakeside. No AC but stayed relatively cool with bedroom fan and cool evenings."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The condo is in a great location on the lake and walking distance to town. The condo was nicely remodeled and we appreciated use of the kayaks. The complex was very quiet and the people we did run into were very friendly. This was our first trip to Sandpoint and would visit again.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything as described and more! Great location at Condo del Sol but with upgraded features, all new everything! We had a family of 4 stay here easy and the very large TV with netflix and more made winding down for the kids a breeze. Communcation was great and the condo had eveything needed. Pool is right off the comfortable back patio and even lake views. As many of the condo's in the area and as described in the ad there is no A/C in unit, so if you have a summer stay you may want to bring a fan as the main living are is warmed quickly with morning sun! Great stay, will be on the radar for all of our future sandpoint trips."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is just lovely! The view of the water and hills is gorgeous, and the pool is a rare, amazing amenity for the area. If you like to run, walk or bike, this place is perfectly located just steps from the lakefront path to the bridge, and a 5 mins walk to the city beach and park. Not only was the condo sparkling clean, it was also modern and functional. We would absolutely stay again and again. 10 stars!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really great and stylish condo lakeside in Sandpoint. Awesome location on the water, comfortable bedroom, gorgeous fireplace and huge TV with Netflix and sports/all the channels, in case of rain :) Great pool right off the patio. We had a great time!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay. Easy walk to downtown, yet very quiet and peaceful at night."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely apartment, easily walkable to everything we wanted to do, see, eat, and drink in Sandpoint. There is a very bright streetlight outside the bedroom window that the blackout curtains don't quite contain so if you are sensitive to light while sleeping I recommend a sleep mask. Apartment was very, very clean, well organized, comfortable, and relaxing."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay! Perfect for what we were looking for and would absolutely stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was amazing. Very cozy and accommodating spot. The hot tub was a nice touch and we were a walk away from the center of town. Thank you so much for having us! Would stay again.

The decor is fabulous!! Thank you!! Perfect stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a real gem. From the outside you would think of a rustic setting but that vanishes when you look at the inside. It’s modern and is as quaint and welcoming as can be and the hot tub is fantastic. I used it as a base for skiing Schweitzer and it was ideal for that. Restaurants and grocery were in walking distance. I would stay here again in a minute!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay in Sandpoint. Walk to everything. 20 min to the ski mountain.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cannot speak highly enough of Joey and his Garage Getaway. From the start Joey was very responsive and accommodating. The space itself is so cute and homey. We want to model our ADU after it! If you’re staying in Sandpoint, look no further. Everywhere you want to be is within a 5 min drive/10 minute walk."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was great! Clean, had the amenities we needed and was walkable to downtown!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place :)
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joeys place is really lovely. Nice quality furnishings and linens. Extremely clean. Very close to downtown Sandpoint. We will definitely be staying there again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our weekend getaway at Joey's place. He was very communicative, provided detailed instructions in advance, and the space was beautifully decorated and welcoming. Parking on the street next to the getaway was easy and felt safe, considering we could see the car from the bedroom window. Unfortunately it was a bit too rainy for us to walk the neighborhood or make use of the hot tub, but we had a lovely time reading next to the fireplace and playing a few of the provided games in the living room. Our stay was comfortable, easy, and quiet - exactly what we needed for a few days away from home."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED it. Joey's place was the perfect spot for me and my now husband. My parents and family live in Sandpoint, so we rented Joey's place for a few days to visit with family before we headed to Coeur d'Alene for our wedding weekend. It was the perfect apartment for us.
Joey was proactive with communication and extremely responsive. There was a little welcome note and snack basket waiting for us and the home was big enough for us to have my parents and sister over for dinner but also felt cozy and homey for the two of us. I really appreciated the countertop space and bathroom size too. A lot of the homes in Sandpoint are a little older so the bathrooms always have limited countertop space, the showers can be tiny and the bathrooms are just smaller overall. But that wasn't the case with Joey's, it was the perfect amount! We 100% want to stay here again when we come back to visit our family in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great airbnb experience! We arrived to a lovely welcome card and chocolates. The unit was really beautiful and well-appointed. Such cute decorations and super clean!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We felt right at home at Joey's place. The design and decor were great and all the amenities were very comfortable. My kids loved playing all the games and we read all the books. The sheets were luxurious and the mattresses were great. We walked to many places, which we loved, including great coffee shops, a park, the library and the beach. Joey was very responsive, friendly and helpful! We'll definitely try to stay again here. Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely fabulous place to stay! The decor was gorgeous! It was spotless, modern and had every amenity we could have possibly needed. This was the perfect place to stay for our time at Silverwood. The hot tub was such a nice perk as we were super sore from all the rides. Joey was very responsive. We even ate all the great variety of goodies they had out for us! Wonderful experience all around!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and cozy place with everything we needed and more
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything went great with our stay at Joeys place and also with our communication and check in. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location for visiting Sandpoint. Nice clean place and nice responsive host. Would recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for the Long Bridge swim. This was the perfect location for our family of 4 - close enough to town to walk in, set in a walkable neighborhood with old trees. Very close to a shopping center but surprisingly this didn’t add any noise to the serene environment. As others have said, this Airbnb exceeds all expectations. The attention to detail is superb. Our kids slept on the pull out couch and I noticed its mattress was exceptionally comfortable. We enjoyed the hot tub as well. It’s a small space but very thoughtfully laid out. Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joey and co-hosts were absolutely amazing ! The bed was comfy ! The was clean ! Hot tub was fantastic!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! Perfect for our little family and easy to get to. It was also close to local amenities and stores. They had tons of extras like beach towels and beach chairs that really added to our stay, and I loved the local coffee selection as well as the complimentary snacks/drinks offered! Host was great and responsive as well!! If we end up needing a place to stay in sandpoint again we will be here again if at all possible!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a fantastic airBnB with plenty of thoughtful little amenities. Love how walkable the location is and having access to the bikes. The space stayed cool even in the sweltering heat. Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Garage getaway was a great spot for a little mini honeymoon for us! Joey was responsive and accommodating! He even offered us early check in for our stay. The accommodations were exactly as pictured and the location was fantastic for us. We loved having the kitchen available for making our own meals and it was stocked with everything we needed. The details included were also such a nice touch, including local coffee, and a nice welcome note and treats! Thanks again for having us Joey! We will definitely recommend your spot to anyone we know looking to visit Sandpoint! And will definitely book again if we are to be back ourselves :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a one-bedroom apartment, beautifully decorated, in the perfect location. For me, the mark of the perfect accommodations is in the details and this place has them! The host provides local coffee beans, along with a grinder, a pour over, and an electric kettle. I’m such a coffee snob that I travel with my own coffee, pour over and kettle, but I didn’t need it here! The coffee was delicious. There are hooks on the wall and what accommodations don’t need more hooks on the wall. Excellent detail!
The place is walking distance to downtown.
Sometimes, AirBnBs have cute pictures and decor but are NOT comfortable. This was both! If you’re coming to Sandpoint, stay here!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing and was very well thought out. It was walking distance to everything! There is so much to do in the Sandpoint area. I highly recommend it.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really cute and quiet - easy walk to downtown venues and restaurants! Nice touches everywhere - high quality everything. Great linens and towels. Kitchen had everything and nice little snacks and welcome. Bed was too firm for us - a topper would have been nice.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our new favorite Airbnb, the place was SPOTLESS, couldn’t find a spec of dust if you tried. The door was easy access and location was perfect, right between everything you need. Our favorite part was the beach cruisers we used all weekend, everywhere we went. We also appreciated the snacks and waters in the fridge which is something we haven’t ever had in an Airbnb before. The bed was extremely comfortable and the place truly felt like home, we can’t wait to go back. Our favorite spot to eat in the area was hydrasteak house, does not disappoint!!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We definitely rate the Garage Getaway as 5 star. The outside may seem a little nonchalant, but the inside is top notch. Very clean, beautiful décor, and comfy everywhere. Close enough to downtown where we walked there several times. The neighborhood with its elegant picturesque homes was perfect for my husband’s daily walks. He swore he saw a 39 lb. cat and 17 lb. squirrels. It was a beautiful weekend weather wise and the Garage Getaway was the perfect place to stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Joey's place was the perfect stop for our trip to Schweitzer. It was beautifully laid out and comfortable.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED our time here!! Very cozy, lean, and comfortable. It’s the little things that really make a difference… amazing coffee, treats and chocolates, welcome card. As well as the important things - clean, comfortable bed, nice towels. The hot tub was a real treat after skiing. We will absolutely come back and stay here next time we visit Sandpoint! Highly recommend - also great location - easily walk around town"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location; shops, restaurants, grocery all within walking distance and a short drive to skiing. Also great amenities; fluffy towels, a heated fan in the bathroom (!), and even a crockpot. Easiest check-in we've experienced. Thanks for sharing this amazing space."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Top notch host. This is one of the best Airbnb’s we’ve stayed at and one of the few I’d come back to. The place was perfect right down to the small personal touches. And so comfortable! Plush towels, great pillows and the carpet in the bedroom is so nice to walk on. We had a great stay and Joey is an excellent host. 10/10"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is perfectly located within walking distance to all the shops/restaurants in downtown Sandpoint. It was extremely clean and well stocked with all the necessities and more! A short 20-25 minute drive to Schweitzer as well. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our extended weekend in the Garage Getaway. Joey was a wonderful host and was very communicative from start to finish. **An added bonus was the mom and baby Moose roaming outside one morning. Wouldn’t hesitate booking this place again! Thanks for the great stay!

Very clean, great furnishings, nicely appointed, and a well-stocked kitchen with everything necessary for cooking meals at home. This was our second stay and it was just what we expected - excellent. We will be back. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was very clean, cozy and well-appointed. Perfect for a winter getaway to Schweitzer, but I think it would be just as nice in the summer since it's really walkable - restaurants, grocery store, coffee shops etc. Welcome snacks were very welcomed by our 10-year-old. The coffee set-up (local beans) was much nicer than most AirBnBs. Hot tub was enjoyable and worth the trek in the cold."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for skiing at Schweitzer and exploring Sandpoint! The hot tub was a huge plus after a long day on the mountain. Hope to stay here again sometime!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joey’s Garage Getaway is a clean, comfortable and conveniently located property in the middle of Sandpoint. It has a well designed floor plan.
It is the perfect size for two adults as a one bedroom. You are within walking distance of all of Sandpoint attractions, restaurants and shops.
Joey, our host, was friendly, quick to respond and went above and beyond for all of our needs and questions.
We asked if he had a humidifier for the property. We told him it was not a big deal if he did not. He promptly responded that he did and would place it outside of our door within 15 minutes. Joey delivered a brand new, top of the line, personal humidifier at our doorstep.
We parked our car on the street during a snow storm. The plow came by and plowed us in. As we were shoveling our car out, Joey came by, grabbed a shovel and helped us free our car.
This property and Joey are great for visitors to the Sandpoint community. He was our favorite host. We will be back."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, responsive hosts, cleanliness could be improved."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Garage Getaway is a perfect little place in the heart of Sandpoint. We loved all the wonderful details and would go back in a heartbeat.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfy, quiet, and sooo close to downtown! Joey was super communicative and checking in was a breeze. Will definitely stay again, hopefully during ski season!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Joey's apartment is perfect. Neat, clean, thoughtfully designed, little touches of hospitality throughout. My husband and I were visiting Idaho from Virginia to receive medical treatment from a Doctor in CDA, and chose to stay in Sandpoint to be away from the hustle and bustle of the larger city. CDA was an effortless (and pretty) 40 minute commute to our appointments throughout the week and coming back to Joey's apartment each day was a retreat. The apartment is located on a very quiet street, yet walking distance to everything downtown Sandpoint has to offer - especially two grocery stores! The very private hot tub was such a relaxing treat; what better way to start the cool mornings relaxing in the hot tub with a cup of Evans Bros. Coffee Joey so graciously provides? Perfection! The balcony off the bedroom was wonderful for an afternoon cocktail or two. Everything about the apartment was so comfortable and welcoming! For those mornings we didn't feel like making breakfast, we loved Connie's Cafe - every meal delicious! We would not hesitate to stay at Joey's Garage Apartment again - highly recommended! Thank you, Joey; job well done. 👏"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joey made the weekend so special for my parents’ anniversary! They were so pleased with the apartment and its location!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If this place is available - stay here! It’s pretty spectacular with such attention to detail. Beautifully furnished with everything you can think of! We had an incredible time in Sandpoint and staying here just made it even better.
We will definitely be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was by far the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. It was so comfortable and clean. There were so many thoughtful touches that made it feel like home. The location was great. Close to downtown & the lake. I appreciated the coffee bar and extras to make my morning coffee. My husband really enjoyed the hot tub. We would definitely recommend staying here & hope to be back soon!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was the best! Everything you'd need on a stay away from home! Way better than staying in a hotel. We'll definitely be coming back!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great stay! The location was central to everything, a quick 2 block walk to Safeway to grab groceries to cook in the kitchen, and even a lovely walk to Memorial Field where we got to experience the Festival at Sandpoint! There is also a brewery, wine tasting room, and hatchet throwing within blocks. The apartment is beautifully decorated, and Joey's communication was beyond stellar! Will definitely stay again! Thank you!"

Loved it, hope to stay for our Schweitzer trip."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Joey’s was great for a long weekend. The unit was clean, cozy, and in a really great location to access all the fun restaurants and activities in downtown Sandpoint. Joey was very easy to communicate with.
Our family looks forward to staying there again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joey’s place was awesome! Great communicator, brand new everything, modern decor-very upscale feel. We are picky super hosts and Joey’s place is a 10 out of 10! Highly recommend to other guests!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joey’s apartment was amazing for our two night stay in Sandpoint! It had everything we needed and is in a fantastic location close to a grocery store and walkable to the beach park.

He has pretty much everything you need for your stay in this fun little town! Thanks Joey!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of our very favorite airbnbs ever! Joey is a really wonderful host who communicates very well. The apartment is located close enough to downtown that we could easily walk everywhere we wanted to go. Very comfortable and clean. We loved it!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The garage get away did not disappoint! Very well appointed and centrally located. We walked to dinner every night.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect getaway for me, my husband and our 4 year old. Elegant
& modern decor that was comfortable with nice touches. Clean and surprisingly spacious for a 1 bedroom. The little extras that included snacks, local coffee beans and a welcome note were lovely. We didn't get to try out the hot tub but it was nice knowing it was available.
Communication was great and our week overall a great experience."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joey really gives a lot of attention to the details and made this place feel like home. The apartment was beautiful and so inviting! I loved the pour over coffee and fresh whole coffee beans from the local coffee shop. The bath products were great and free of all the nasty harsh chemicals and smells.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So many others have said it, this is THE BEST Airbnb we've ever stayed at. Comfortable beds, super clean home, well stocked with goodies and coffee, immaculate set up, and very thoughtfully designed. As a person who doesn't love super strong fake fragrances I also appreciated the scent free laundry detergent and the fact that there is not an overwhelming aroma to the place- you know how some Airbnb's try and be so 'fresh and clean' smelling and it's just fake fragrances- not Joey's! His place smells clean because it is SO clean. Very walkable to everything downtown, the bike path is close by, and the lake shore is just short walk from the spot. Super private and quiet as well. We loved Sandpoint!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect location to explore the beautiful town of Sandpoint from! A home-away-from-home that you won’t regret booking.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place with an accommodating host! Lots to do at the AirBNB and close around town!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just a delightful space. Thoughtful touches, everything was clean and updated. And the kitchen was one the most well-stocked with utensils and appliances I’ve ever seen. Great private hot tub, a short walk to plenty of activities: this place is perfect!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I booked this space for a low key weekend out of town. The space was perfect for the two of us and had everything we needed. We were able to cook a full meal one night and the location is very walkable.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this place is perfect!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay in Sandpoint!
This Garage Getaway was an ideal setting with every detail thoughtfully considered. New construction, furnishings, art and hot tub make this one an easy recommendation. The bed was comfy, snacks were delicious and coffee/tea bar a true treat. We'll be back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joey's place is beautifully styled, very comfortable, conveniently located... so perfect for a Sandpoint stay. His generous and thoughtful touches - chocolates on the bed - made it feel 7 star hotel quality. My sore body enjoyed the hot tub and cozy beds. The kitchen was great to cook in and the TV & fireplace to relax by. I strongly recommend and would easily visit again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks so much, Joey! Your place was awesome!
Our only complaint was someone going in and out of the garage most of the afternoon on Saturday, clanging around, and extra noise. We didn't use the hottub as we didn't realize you had to go out and around through the front along the street. So, maybe if that's better disclosed? We only had brought boots and didn't have shoes to wear or a swim coverup. So, rather disappointed.
But, everything else was great!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joey’s place is in a convenient location within walking distance to town and a short drive to Schweitzer mountain. We enjoyed the hot tub and amenities provided by Joey and we would love to come back!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would definitely stay again. It was lovely inside.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our favorite AirBnB ever; and we stay at quite a few AirBnBs! The location was very convenient to grocery stores, downtown, hiking, skiing, etc. The bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and living/dining area were very spacious. The furnishings were all high end, and the artwork was very tasteful. I love to cook, and found that the kitchen had everything I needed. The knives were sharp, and the refrigerator was clean and free from leftover food from other renters. (I hate dull knives and other people's food.) I appreciated that the door-entry code was customized for our stay, so we knew nobody else would have access. Joey responded immediately to the few questions I had before our stay. He provided coffee beans, tea bags, seltzer, and welcome snacks, which was a nice ""extra."" And the hot tub was perfect for after skiing! We sill definitely plan to stay here whenever we visit Sandpoint."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot near downtown Sandpoint and Schweitzer! Super clean and well stocked. Hot tub area nice and private.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joey’s garage getaway was heaven for our couple of days away!! It’s such a beautiful newly renovated apartment over the garage, 2 blocks from downtown Sandpoint and across the street from a grocery store. Joey has made a beautiful space with every amenity you could ever need. He went above and beyond to give us local recommendations for a wonderful thanksgiving dinner and his favorite local spots to eat. The jacuzzi was so nice to have as an added amenity and the kitchen was fully stocked with anything you might need to cook. He thought of everything from extra pillows to coffee to laundry to extra blankets, to games and activities to do around town. His space is super cozy, beautifully decorated and made us feel like we were right at home. The little details make the value absolutely worth it and his communication and directions for our stay were timely and clear! We will be back!! I cannot give enough praise to this little slice of heaven in Sandpoint, ID."

Anything we needed was quickly taken care of. I would highly recommend staying at Joey’s!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and comfortable place. Every detail was done with a thought. Close to everything. Joey went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. We could not have asked for more. Staying at Joey's made our entire stay in Sandpoint so much more enjoyable!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay!! Very comfortable and well stocked, clean unit. Check in was easy and communication with Joey was great. If you happen to have feather allergies, perhaps let Joey know ahead of time as there were a good amount in the bedroom, however we were happy to see extra pillows and blankets we could use and had no issues. We will definitely stay again if we are back in Sandpoint! 😀"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great little apartment! We stayed 2 nights and it was really evident that Joey has put a lot of thought into making his guests’ stay comfortable and has gone above and beyond with a variety of small details to make their stay special. The bedding and furniture were all clean and comfortable, there was a great variety of cooking essentials if desired and a wonderful “coffee bar” with locally roasted beans. We did not do any cooking since everything is within easy walking distance. If I ever travel through the area again I will definitely check if the apartment is available. Thanks for a wonderful start to our week of vacation."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Joey’s apartment is really great! Super clean and well appointed. Super comfortable and quiet. Just a few minutes walk to the best of sandpoint : restaurants/ brewpubs/ the lake and beach/ markets/ bars/ parks. Joey is a great host and if you’re coming to sandpoint, you’ll be really comfortable here . He’s super responsive and wants you to be comfy."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"well designed, located, and comfortable 1 bedroom in a great location! we couldn't explore much with the wildfire smoke at the time of our visit, but enjoyed a cozy day in with a/c and movies. very comfortable for our family of 4!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So glad to have found this spot! It was a perfect little place to set up home base for a few days.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I had a very relaxing and comfortable stay at the ""Garage Getaway"" in Sandpoint. I would like to say the name is a bit misleading; I was expecting a shabby, low ceiling, dingy garage apartment. However, this place is really spectacular. Very high ceilings, bright, nicely appointed, very updated from every facet (floors, bedroom, bathroom, electronics, kitchen). The hosts were very responsive and accommodating. This is a really nice place, and hopefully, I can stay here again in the future. I would come back for certain."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the nicest rentals we have stayed at. The kitchen was well stocked, the bed is comfy and there were lots of extras in bathroom to make our stay very comfortable. The location is perfect and you can walk just about anywhere you want to be. Sandpoint t is beautiful, with so much to do outdoors. You won’t be disappointed in your stay at Joeys. We hope to be back again soon!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The most adorable, well stocked, comfortable, perfectly located home! Joey allowed us to check in early and continued to stay in touch for whatever we needed. He gave great recommendations too. I can’t say enough good things!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed at Garage Getaway for a month in July. It felt like we were in a hotel suite with our own concierge! Joey was awesome with communication and getting a few things we requested to enhance our stay. The place is well equipped: beach chairs, towels, bikes etc as well as any kitchen item you could ever need. I miss his super sharp knives and brand new gas range! Would absolutely stay again and recommend you do the same."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect a lovely stay. The apartment is very thoughtfully decorated and easy to walk to downtown to have dinner or for an evening stroll by the water. Joey is a great host and you can tell he enjoys it.
Book this one!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When entering this apartment above the garage we were stunned at how beautiful, well furnished and relaxing it felt. Joey raised the bar with this AirBnB. It has very up-to-date furnishings with a kitchen supplied with all that you need for cooking. The layout and design of the apartment has many windows (very new shades on all the windows) in the open-concept living area giving the space light and a welcoming feeling. There is more to add, but let your own experience here delight you. This is a great home away from home. We loved the place, one of the best ones we've stayed at, nationally and internationally. Thanks so much."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joey’s place is fantastic! I could tell the minute we opened the door and started to walk up the stairs that it was going to be clean. There was a delightful scent right away. And sure enough. It was immaculate. My husband and I have stayed at quite a few vacation rentals and this one is top on our list. Joey’s communication was fantastic. He took care of us very well. I loved the personal touch of a hand written note and chocolate! Everything is within walking distance. It’s all around a wonderful place. We highly recommend!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joey's Garage Getaway is absolutely wonderful! Every possible detail is taken care of with supreme comfort in mind. Best equipped kitchen ever! I can't wait to come back!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apartment is well situated downtown with in walking distance to many of the Sandpoint restaurants and bars.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I LOVED this place! Great location - walkable to all of the fun and beautiful things Sandpoint has to offer. Great space - everything was so well-designed, comfortable, and clean. Great amenities - I think the kitchen is stoked better than my own at home (ha!), and all of the snacks and thoughtful “extras” were so wonderful. I hope to book this place again someday soon."

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joey’s place was perfect, absolutely perfect. From the high end finishes to the quick responses to the extra attention to detail to the amenities, this place was a dream. We cannot speak highly enough about this wonderful place. The location was quiet and easy to get everywhere. We are looking forward to our next visit."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Joeys Garage Getaway was an amazing space for my family and I. It was so clean, cozy and spacious. It was a short walk to downtown and the grocery store and we didn’t need to drive anywhere. We will be back to stay again!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joe is above and beyond the perfect host. The space is so perfect and quality is incredible. He is so thoughtful with the same local touches and really cares about the quality of your stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the treehouse, it was such a unique and
Beautiful place. We felt very welcomed and really enjoyed our peaceful visit. Witnessing the moose and eagles in the same day was surreal."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,What a special get away. Thank you Jon and Becky for being so accommodating and welcoming us to the property. We got a surprise rainstorm and it was such a treat. Treehouse held up perfectly and the pitter patter of the rain was the perfect soundtrack to our elevated view of the surrounding nature.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had another lovely stay at the Treehouse! It was beautiful as ever, and Jon & Becky were, once again, wonderful hosts. We enjoyed our weekend and had everything we needed and more. We hope to be back again sometime!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thank Jon and Becky for a great experience, and beautiful property."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jon and Becky: A Caring Host and Hostess.
Some of the details were reminiscent of what you might encounter from family. Small bouquets of flowers from the garden, a dreamy bed, fresh local coffee, Becky's home made bread with butter and jam. With out a doubt the tree house is a structure that was built with feeling and artistry. The whole experience was inspiring.
In Gratitude,
Lee and Martin Withington"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a nice change of pace!! Very well maintained space for 2 with all the necessities. Obviously you have stairs to climb so be prepared for that with luggage etc, but was well worth it!! The views are incredible! We also had access to the dock for swimming, sunning, or taking out the kayaks & stand up paddle boards. Jon and his family were very welcoming and hospitable. Would return again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place, exactly as advertised. Quaint little tree house on a beautiful lake…but the treehouse is anything but quaint. It will blow you away! Windows brought over from a bar in Ireland, three floors, king sized bed, homemade pastries for breakfast and more. Loved waking up in the morning and having a cup of coffee looking out a bay window in the living room overlooking the lake. Use of canoes and kayaks, cute downtown a couple miles away and plenty of hiking, swimming and boating. Perfect place for someone who wants something other than your standard hotel room! Would stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay here! The treehouse was so was fun, unique, and cozy, and the area is just beautiful. The hosts were also so friendly and welcoming. We’d absolutely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jon and Becky's treehouse is a very special place! They were welcoming, the views are incredible, the whole property is beautifully kept, and the yummy homemade jam and bread were a lovely, and tasty, touch."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This treehouse is exactly as you see! Beautiful inside and out. The hosts are kind, welcoming and give it a great personal touch. It's just a quick drive into town (also a bike/running path that we used!) to her any groceries or go out to eat and shop. We spent most the time on the dock or out in the water. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unique Treehouse with an amazing view. Great location for a relaxing weekend by the lake.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This treehouse is seriously one of the coolest places you’ll ever stay! We had a truly magical weekend here. The bed was so comfortable, the views were breathtaking, we had our own private dock that they had lounge chairs set up on for us and we brought some floaties that we tied up to the dock and had the best day on the water. A perfect place for a romantic getaway. I’m already wanting to plan a trip to return for even longer next time. Do not miss out on this awesome spot!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the treehouse SO much! We brought our bikes and rode into downtown Sandpoint. Enjoyed coffee on the deck, and took in the incredible views! Such.a relaxing stay, memorable stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The pictures don’t reflect how special this setting is. You are right on the lake with eagles soaring above and a cool breeze to help you sleep like a baby. Jon and Becky shared their swim dock and kayaks so we could get out in the lake. The property is gorgeous. Becky provided fresh cherries from their tree along with lots of other personal touches. A truly magical place.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful and fun place to stay! We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Treehouse and appreciated all of the thoughtful details and personal touches. It was clean and lovely and had everything (& more) that we needed. We loved being right on the lake and being close to Sandpoint- got to canoe, swim, hike, explore, rest & relax. Would love to stay here again soon and highly recommend it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So happy with our stay! Even better than the photos! We already want to go back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Delightful little vacation spot! Loved it!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, fun treehouse right at the water."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This treehouse stay was nothing short of magical! The treehouse itself is magnificent and the beautiful details throughout were stunning. The view of the lake was incredible and so relaxing. The bed was extremely comfortable and waking up to those views was breathtaking. Having access to a dock with kayaks was a lot of fun and there was also a basketball/pickle ball court to play on. The hosts left homemade goodies in the treehouse like honey, jam, lemon tart, bread and more. This was a wonderful touch and everything was delicious! Thank you for an incredible stay and for being such wonderful hosts!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for a WONDERFUL getaway
Much needed and realize I don’t do it enough
Tree house was a beautiful place to stay and an absolute beautiful property to spend a few days
Wonderful touches in the kitchen to make you know what the local flair is
Would definitely recommend this place and will be back
Most unique property I have ever stayed in"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tree house is the stuff that Airbnb dreams are made of. A magical weekend, impeccable place, and delightful hosts who think of everything - down to fresh lilacs when in bloom. As others have said, if you’re thinking about it, do it. I listened to that. You should too."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a fantastic place for a get away. We loved the tree house along with the amazing views! So peaceful and quiet. We will definitely be back. Very clean also and inside is as enjoyable as the outside. Hosts were very friendly and welcoming.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Relaxing
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were probably two of the nicest people I have ever met, and the property (not just the treehouse, which is extraordinary) is beautiful, with lakefront access and views. The treehouse itself is absolutely amazing, cozy (but now small, very comfortable!), well furnished, the decorations are beautiful, I could go on for hours..."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the best time. Couldn’t have had a better time in a more unique and beautiful place
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jon and Becky were excellent hosts.
The treehouse was fantastic, it was “my husband’s adult dream house.” The outdoor activities kept us busy and the fortress of being in a treehouse maintained our privacy. We would recommend this place to anyone lucky enough to obtain a reservation, it was truly amazing!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing escape! The pictures almost don’t do the treehouse justice. And Becky and Jon’s attention to detail is incredible.
One word of warning, while surprising your wife/partner with a trip to the treehouse is a great idea, you might want to monitor their suitcase choice... A huge suitcase and the treehouse stairs/ladder can be a… let’s call it a comedic event!
In all seriousness we could not recommend the treehouse enough. Beautiful location and unique experience!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unique, peaceful, amazing views! We loved our stay at the tree house. The hosts are wonderful, the treehouse is cozy and the attention to detail was appreciated.
Will definitely be back again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great and relaxing stay at the treehouse! Check in was easy and there were so many thoughtful touches, like fresh flowers in every room. We loved spending time on the lake, but also never grew tired of being indoors and looking out the windows! Highly recommend for others looking for a peaceful lake retreat."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cozy treehouse is breathtaking with an incredible view! We enjoyed our stay and would love to come back for a second time, but this time with our bikes, and summer weather. Jon and Becky are sweet people. They seem like a lot of fun and they give you fun things to do around their property like fishing, kayaking, and they even have a pickleball court. So cool! By far our favorite little getaway to relax and find peace again.
Celeste and Nick (North Bend, WA)"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of a kind experience! So very grateful to Jon and Becky for allowing the opportunity to fulfill a childhood dream. The views are incredible both inside and outside. Very unique with repurposed windows with history. Light and airy. Loved the sounds which included the lapping of the lake and train whistles, otherwise quiet and serene. Your only regret would be if you don’t visit the Treehouse. Marsha"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a unique experience! The views are awesome and we had a fantastic time. Our hosts were friendly and engaging which we appreciated very much. They even surprised us with a homemade dessert. If you get the opportunity don’t pass it up!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse was exquisite and like a dream. The attention to detail, cleanliness, and location were awesome. I'd recommend a sleep mask as the treehouse has a ton of windows to see out of many angles but no curtains. This was no issue to me because I'd figured as much and brought some. There is also a train that goes by, not a big deal but good to know if you're a light sleeper. Lastly I would recommend that you take the stairs inside the treehouse without shoes or socks, my husband actually fell down the inside stairs as they are very smooth and slippery. All in all we had a lovely time and a fantastic and unique experience with a great host. I look forward to returning some day."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This treehouse is simply the best! Such a unique experience with all the comforts and coziness of home. My stay was absolutely picturesque. Perfect spot to relax and enjoy the beautiful lake views from up in the trees. The little touches everywhere were a wonderful surprise - beautiful flowers, fresh bread from the local bakery, raspberry jam and homemade applesauce in the roomy fridge, blankets in the porch chairs for the crisp mornings drinking coffee outside. Wonderfully warm and welcoming hosts. I can’t wait to come back again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, this was truly an experience like no other! The setting was extraordinary and the treehouse has so much detail you have to see for yourself. We were able to fish off the dock while enjoying the views of beautiful Lake Pend Oreille. We found the place so relaxing and peaceful creating a memory that will last forever."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. Jon and Becky are so great and attend to every little detail to make the unique treehouse experience feel extra special. The weather wasn’t great while I was there, but just sitting inside and watching the water, geese (Harvey and Greta), bald eagles and scenery. Truly a wonderful experience. I enthusiastically recommend this place. 🙏"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This treehouse is truly something special! There is so much character in every corner. Combine that with views overlooking the lake and we were enchanted right away! Jon and Becky were gracious hosts, providing a warm welcome and fun history of the treehouse itself. We were cozy and content throughout our stay. Would encourage all to visit this unique place for a getaway!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The answer is ""yes""! If you are looking at this listing and wondering, ""should I give this a try?"", the answer is absolutely ""YES!"". It is now one of the most favorite places my wife and I have stayed. The pictures actually don't do the treehouse justice. It looks nice in them, and it's even better in person. The location is AMAZING. You wake up to tons of natural light and a resort-like view out on to the lake. All of that and a cup of coffee are an amazing way to start the day. Jon and Becky are exceptional hosts and go out of there way to add lots of little touches to make your stay even better. They are just great people too - which is a huge plus. Again, if you are thinking ""maybe"", the answer is ""yes!"" Just do it - you'll be glad you did..."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ll keep it short: Spectacular
If the treehouse is available, don’t think, book it now."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This tree house experience was amazing! My friend and I were doing some traveling and exploring and this was the best place yet!! 10/10 👌🏼
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A truly incredible place to stay! The property and views from the treehouse are amazing. Jon and Becky are so welcoming and hospitable, they made our stay very comfortable. I would definitely recommend...10/10"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is unreal. Pictures don’t even do it justice. Amazing hospitality as well. You must stay here!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one special place. So unique . What the hosts have created is very special and so relaxing. We were so happy just staying at the treehouse and enjoying the beautiful view and relaxing. I have a more difficult time just chilling and boy did this place help me to do so. It was just perfect. Thank you for what you have created on such a beautiful property.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you.
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a really fun place to stay! It was beautiful and relaxing. It was super cute and the host even left little treats to eat.
We happened to be here on the night of a thunderstorm. Being in a treehouse during a thunderstorm is loud. I would recommend bringing earplugs.
Because of the weather, we didn't have the opportunity to use all of the outside amenities. Even still both my husband and I would happily recommend the treehouse to others."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Becky and Jon are the best hosts that I have ever encountered. I'm convinced that they do it for fun. Becky left fresh flowers and very nice shampoos and soaps. She is also an organic chef so she leaves delicious treats once in awhile. I can't even make this stuff up. If I were to ever be a host, I would try to be like them. The treehouse was amazing. I felt like we had the best of both worlds. We were very close to all things we needed but I also felt like we were a world away up there. The eagles in the tree were amazing. The train that periodically came by reminded me of my childhood home. We had a storm come in the first night. The treehouse was pretty noisy during that. It didn't bother me at all. I thought it was pretty cool. My husband ended up needing some earplugs to sleep well so maybe pack some of those. You won't regret coming here."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the coolest places I've stayed!
Amazing property and hosts! You feel the care and love they have put into this one of a kind hideaway in the trees. The little extras put it over the top. I highly recommend it and can't wait to come back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This treehouse is the truest example of “even better in-person.” While the photos and description of Jon and Becky’s place look incredible, I assure you that the real thing is even better.
From the moment we set foot on the beautifully maintained premise, Jon and Becky approached with an aura of joy and positivity that stayed with us throughout the remainder of our stay. They had wonderful local suggestions and truly provided an exceptional experience for us.
The treehouse comes exactly as it is described- small but quaint and grants every “escape” one could ask for when looking to take some time away from the hustle and bustle of any city.
If you are lucky enough to find an opening in the reservation schedule, jump on it and do what you need to free up whatever else is on your schedule- it’s worth it.
As with many before us who wrote about their experiences in the guest book, we look forward to our return trip in the (hopeful) near future. Thank you again for providing us with such an memorable getaway, Jon and Becky!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could live here I would! The treehouse itself has a neat, eclectic style and I saw something new whenever I looked around. The view was beautiful! The hosts were very sweet to leave a couple of slices of homemade bread, butter, and eggs in the fridge. Jon was always available if we had questions and was super kind. We enjoyed the kayaks and canoe too! The treehouse is located near town with tons of cool restaurants to check out. I can’t wait to go back!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful place and a one of a kind accommodation!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This treehouse experience was unlike any other! It was beautiful inside and out! It was a great respite and very peaceful. I felt like I was living in a fantasy amongst the living trees! Beautiful grounds and we loved playing pickelball!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was beyond what we expected! Great hospitality along with the feel of a 5 star hotel all to ourselves. The property and treehouse are world class!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is magical...... the hospitality and fun little touches made it so very special for a honeymoon retreat!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This amazing treehouse rental takes your love for the great outdoors to new heights! The lush setting on the water’s edge was so comforting. A spectacular viewpoint to be had for watercolor painting! Climb up to the top floor and you will experience what it’s like to live in the treetops, surrounded by fresh air, Lake Pend Oreille, birds and awesome views. Never left the treehouse! A few horn whistles added to the adventure in the tree! Thank you for checking off my bucket list with a treehouse stay!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jon and Becky are by far the best Airbnb hosts I’ve ever had. They met us upon arrival, their hospitality was beyond expected and their treehouse was magical. The view from the treehouse was unbelievable. We felt so at home and comfortable."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I begin? It's so amazing its magical. The view of the lake and mountains from any level is breathtaking! The amenities are plenty, their personal touches awesome. The history of it all captivating and you catch yourself reflecting on it. Kayaking the lake in the morning when the water is like a sheet of glass is a must. Your head will never be so clear. Deer eat and play in the yard. And I woke up my last day to a Moose and baby in the yard, just feet away from the treehouse. A MOOSE! The horseback riding in the mountains was fabulous. The local food and fare superb. Farmers Market had the best goodies. Thank you both for sharing God's beautiful gift with me!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tree house is beautiful, and the hosts were delightful. One of the most memorable places we've ever stayed."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was exceptional and way more than we expected! There were so many thoughtful extra touches (eggs,jam and honey in fridge, scones delivered and local coffee). We were able to go on long walks, kayak, canoe and swim right from there. The best was sitting out on the deck in the morning with coffee and in the evening watching the moon come up over the water with eagles flying right next to us. The owners were amazing and great to suggest hikes and restaurants. Would highly recommend to everyone and we will be back."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exceeded expectations!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing space and right on the lake. If you are looking for something different than the norm this is the place. Jon and Becky were super nice and made sure we had everything we needed, even going so far as to share some freshly picked huckleberries. We wouldn't hesitate to go back and do it again."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!!!! We were BLOWN AWAY - it was like a dream!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are on the fence about this place, just DO It!!! The place was clean, quaint, and air conditioned. The view was insane, and we loved getting to have our morning coffee on the deck. The hosts provided us with fruit, eggs, cheese, crackers, bagels, and much more.
The pickleball court was a pleasant surprise and we loved having our own private dock! I cannot day enough good things about this place. It went above and beyond our expectations! We can’t wait to go back."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Truly a unique experience.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This amazing treehouse, right on the bank of Lake Pend Oreille, is the best airbnb I've experienced in my 10 years of traveling. Becky gave me a tour when I arrived. I was in incredulous delight because there were so many artsy, unique, and thoughtful touches. The photos are great, but experiencing the space as a whole was an entirely different level of charm and whimsy. The decorating and restoration of antique furnishings and appliances is brilliant . I especially loved the bronze -fronted fridge (which held organic o.j., homemade raspberry jam, cheese, eggs, and English muffins. I slept like a baby in the cozy, comfy loft bed. There are lots of high quality toiletries, guest bathrobes, and great reading material such as a book of treehouses of the world. There are binoculars to focus on the bald eagles and osprey near the lake. I ended up spending most of my time in the living room or on the porch of the treehouse, just soaking in the panoramic view. I didn't want to leave to go visit anywhere else. And I didn't want to leave when my check-out time rolled around. I'll be back, but next time for a longer stay!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a wonderful, restful time. Great view of the water. The treehouse was definitely one of a kind with lots of craftsmanship details. We are definitely considering coming back again sometime!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place. Couldn’t have had a better stay. Truly a special place!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do this place justice.
The location has a quaint, rustic, and wonderfully cozy feel. The views of the lake are breathtaking and awe-inspiring, and it's such a wonderful and welcoming place. We mainly interacted with Becky, who was the picture perfect hostess, even going so far as to give us banana bread as a parting gift! We even stayed an extra day, and Jon was super chill and helpful when it came to pushing our stay forward.
The main thing this place has going for it is its uniqeness. Nobody you ever known has ever stayed in a place quite like this, and I even took a video on my phone to show folks back home. ""Wow"" and ""where is that??"" were the universal reactions to the video. The kitchen is fully stocked, down to even a blender, and fresh greens, orange juice, and local coffee beans, in the fridge, and more besides. It's hard to put into words how lovely our stay was there, and we'd undoubtedly do it again.
The one thing I would say is that the location was not quite as private as we were expecting. It is located on the family's property, and they often have children and grandchildren visiting, so even though the main house is a good 75 yards from the treehouse, the dock is right in front of the treehouse, so if you're there on a romantic weekend, don't plan on just strutting around naked like you own the place, as there are many large windows and absolutely no curtains. This isn't a knock against the place, though - merely something we didn't quite get from the listing. I'd still recommend it in a heartbeat. We're extremely pleased. :)"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and unique stay for our wedding night. Can't wait to return and stay again- very close to town, amazing views, and thoughtfully designed. Would absolutely recommend to anyone, it's worth the value and is something cool to talk about when you describe to others that you stayed in a tree house."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This really is a special place.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was seriously the coolest place we’ve ever stayed. The treehouse is so cozy and the property is gorgeous! If you are on the fence just do it, words don’t do this place justice. It was absolutely wonderful."
2019-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing...so cozy and perfect. Unfortunately, a freak windstorm moved in and our 2 night stay turned into a very short one night stay. 50 mile an hr winds...while the treehouse didn't move and sway, the winds created loud, loud noises. Kind of scary. We hope to return to experience the full benefits of this special treehouse."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We felt like we were staying in a little fairy house! This tree house is filled with charm and special little touches! And the grounds around are beautifully landscaped with terrific access to the lake right outside the door! It was even better than we had imagined and we hope we are fortunate enough to stay here again some day!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an incredible experience. We had so much fun being up in the tree :-) it was well equipped comfortable and such a unique experience we will be telling our friends about it!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to have a nice quiet weekend away from the stresses in your life! There is nothing like waking up to a warm cup of coffee and sitting out on the most perfect deck with most perfect view!!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Expect to be thrilled!! It is a beautiful treehouse right on the lake. Well maintained landscaping. Be prepared to walk aways through wet grass from your car to the treehouse. As you probably have read, the stairs are part spiral and part straight-up both outside and in. I got the hang of it pretty quickly, but don't bring a ton of luggage or bags (especially if you are solo) or it will be a struggle. They have everything you need kitchen-wise--no toaster oven or regular oven, but there is a stovetop and a microwave. The bed and a closet are all that is on the second floor (wonderful bed!) so, if you get up often in the night you will have to carefully go down the steep stairs to the very cool galley bathroom! There is a floor above the bedroom as well, where you can look out through the trees at all the beauty, or it makes a great meditation area--very steep ladder to get up there.
All in all, I had a wonderful solo trip--it isn't far from town at all for dining out and shopping in Sandpoint--I love their food coop right on the edge of town, there is a spa on the way to town (Highland) if you would like a massage or facial, etc., and so much more!
I would love to go back to the treehouse next year--it is so unique!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at the treehouse. Was not totally sure what to expect but I was completely blown away by the location (right on the water with gorgeous views that you can see from the deck or living room) and hospitality (lots of nice touches like eggs, english muffins, OJ and coffee waiting for us so we could hang out in the treehouse for breakfast). The other nice surprise was how comfortable the bed was. My husband and I had been on a 10 day road trip and it was definitely the comfiest bed we slept in. Would not hesitate to stay here again, I didn't want to leave!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is really magical! Hard to leave. The hosts even had breakfast makings in the fridge, as well as coffee, cream and OJ. Highly recommend it, it’s a great experience!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are having any reservation on whether to book this or not, DO IT!! It’s worth it!!!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfort & relaxation with a wonderful view!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! The treehouse looked great in the pictures but is even better when you get there. The grounds are meticulously cared for, lush, green and beautiful. The treehouse itself is just amazing. So many little touches and so functional for such a unique space. We loved the top lookout floor for reading with the breeze coming in through the windows. The bed was very comfy. The lake is right at your feet and we loved the use of the private dock with kayaks and paddle boards each day. There are also natural stone stairs leading into the lake if you don't want to jump off the dock for a swim. This place is so peaceful and private. The hosts were great and on our second night during a wind and thunderstorm Hailey even texted us offering to have us hang out with them at their place if we felt unsafe, which was very thoughtful. We chose to stay in the treehouse during the storm which was a pretty cool experience in itself! We stayed for three nights and were so sad to leave. Every minute we spent here was relaxing and joyous, such a wonderful place!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a wonderful place. My daughter, 21, and I went to celebrate my 50th birthday.
This place was so relaxing for us. We had coffee on the deck, then went down to the boat dock, then to the 3rd floor where we read and I took a nap. There are so many cozy places to hang out.
There were a pair of Bald Eagles in one of the ""tree house"" trees.
We also picked raspberries as there were more than enough for everyone. This was an absolutely wonderful weekend."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unique treehouse on beautiful grounds with fabulous views!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Expect an amazing experience. Be sure to ask host for recommendations because they will send you the best ideas. Can not say enough.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of a kind experience! Loved it!
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The treehouse is magical and creates an experience to remember.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved being right on the lake in this unique space. It was great having use of a canoe and kayaks to explore the lake. The treehouse itself is so fun and artsy. Hailey provided some nice extras. We enjoyed just hanging out in the cozy space enjoying all the thoughtful touches.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed two nights in the treehouse for his birthday and it was absolutely amazing. The location, cleanliness and general atmosphere of the place is all unbeatable. Truly a magical experience, even bald eagles flying around the treehouse most of the day! There was even fresh eggs and homemade apple butter in the fridge for us! Both of us so were beyond sad to leave, and we will definitely be back as we’ve completely fallen in love with the treehouse! Best Airbnb experience yet. Book more than two nights. You'll be glad you did."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"On the lake and only a couple minutes from town, this treehouse makes for an amazing weekend. The space is very unique, stocked with every amenity we needed and bonus; the bed is very comfortable. I highly recommended this home for anyone in need of a relaxing lake getaway."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The 2 night reservation in the treehouse was a gift from my husband for my 64th birthday. It will go down as one of the most memorable. Hailey greeted us upon arrival to guide us to the treehouse Hailey is so welcoming and very laid back..her personal touch (fresh fruit bowl & fresh flowers) add a special welcome as you walk thru the door. The beautiful stained glass door (glass compliments of Ireland) immediately tells you..this is a treehouse like no other! For me, it was jaw dropping beautiful..hand carved wooden couch with overstuffed pillows and windows that offer a panoramic view of the beauty that surrounds you. Seated right on the lake you can sit on the porch to enjoy sunrise/sunset; or, walk down to your own private beach and dock.
California king bed guarantees a good night's sleep..you don't need to bring your own pillow from home, the ones provided are perfect. Inside and out the treehouse is a once in a lifetime adventure."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unbelievable! You have to check this place out. It’s one of a kind!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best experience ever!

If you don't stay here a couple nights, you're crazy! the host were wonderful! just a text away from anything you need! kayaks and paddle boards free to use! nesting Bald Eagles that would fly by and perch nearby! such a wonderful unique experience, I will be staying here again!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome, awesome experience ! The pictures are pretty accurate, but there is so much more to this treehouse than shown. Its the little details that make this place special. Wonderful hosts and family, beautiful views, cozy to the nth degree! An experience to remember !"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jon and Becky were the most gracious hosts that anyone could ever ask for. Everything about their hospitality and the amazing tree-house exceeded our expectations. Staying there was such a unique experience that we will never forget. We really felt like it was our own private place, in our own little world. We will always be thankful for the memories and definitely want to come back again someday! Thanks Jon and Becky!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the good fortune of staying at the Treehouse on Lake Pend O’reille for 3 nights in early August. The photos don’t disappoint. The treehouse is unique and the views are amazing. Jon and Becky are thoughtful hosts and their property is a small slice of paradise. We would definitely return and we highly recommend Jon’s place if you’re seeking a unique and beautiful lodging on the lake, with full use of your own dock, kayaks and paddle boards, very handy access to both paved and mountain bike trails, and in close proximity to Dover and Sandpoint. So relaxing. Thank you, Jon & Becky!"

The experience was unlike any other! We loved the entire stay and are looking forward to visiting again!
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We knew as soon as we saw the listing this place would be special, and we were not disappointed. We were looking for a quiet getaway from our busy lives and the treehouse provided just that. The view couldn't be beat and with a couple eagles that liked to occupy one of the trees above us, we were treated to wonderful sounds each morning. This treehouse is a gem from the perfect decor down to the small design details. Absolutely beautifully made.
Jon and Becky were gracious hosts, meeting with us to give us a little history of the peppery (also beautiful) and making sure we felt at home.
If our travels ever bring us back to this area, we will return to this peaceful getaway."
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jon was awesome to us.
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jon and Becky have a a truly extraordinary place! As soon as I saw the listing I knew I wanted to stay there. And it was even more wonderful than I could have predicted. First off the treehouse is full of character - the detail and design from the unique design features to the furniture gives it such a homey feel, and the views are spectacular - not to mention being among the trees. Being right on the lake was perfect for a relaxing weekend - you can enjoy a cup of coffee and watch the sunrise from the porch or living room, sit on the dock, or kayak on the lake. Jon gave an informational tour when I arrived of the history of the treehouse and a run down of some things to do in the area - he was a gracious host and helpful as I began to plan out my weekend. I would highly recommend staying at the treehouse - it is a once in a lifetime opportunity and Jon and Becky couldn't have been more kind and welcoming!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The tree house was amazing! We had a private dock with beautiful views all weekend. And not mention outstanding hospitality! We will definitely be back again
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely perfect in every way. I need to come back.

2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are wanting a lovely, scenic, amazing experience you must come to the treehouse. Jon and Becky are amazing and super nice. You'll learn about how the treehouse was built. It is a wonderful stay, and you can enjoy the beauty of Lake Pend Oreille. We were able to use their canoe to out on the lake which was so fun. Our stay was so wonderful and we can't wait to go back."
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing from the moment you step out of your car. The setting on the lake and the amazing tree house.

Truly, nothing could have been better...except we had to leave!!"
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful experience sleeping between trees! The view was incredible, the place was beautifully decorated with nice amenities.

The artistry and craftsmanship of this little gem is very impressive, every detail is fascinating. Although the weather was rainy during our trip, the sitting area was inviting and we enjoyed sipping tea, staring out of the huge picture window at the breathtaking views of Lake Pend O'reille. I wish this was my house!! We could not have asked for a more peaceful and relaxing weekend. Thank you so much for sharing your lovely home with us...can't wait to come back!"
2016-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Can not speak highly enough about this place. There were homemade cookies waiting for us and Becky gave us a quick tour of the house. The tree house has an amazing view of the lake and we were able to fish and use their kayaks and paddle boards. Jon was easy to get in touch with when needed and his wife was very warm and friendly. I. showed pictures of this to my wife's parents and they want to drive up from Idaho falls to stay here, that's how much we enjoyed it."
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This treehouse is a special place. The view is epic. Jon and Becky are kind and welcoming. I've rarely met nicer people. If you're up for an experience and open to the particulars of treehouse living, you should stay here."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was amazing! Within walking distance to downtown, right next to the water, and activities both at the location site as well as in town! Our stay was so relaxing!! What's better thank waking up and drinking a cup of coffee on the deck and watching the water!?! Explore downtown and enjoy some local cuisine or hangout at one of the 2 pools, or even just walk around the property.
Sarah was quick to respond to any question, check in and check out were a breeze, absolutely would stay here again!! A must stay location in Sandpoint!! Thank you for a wonderful weekend!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"great place, right on the water in a walking town. minutes to walk to everything. quick drive to all grocery stores.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can't say enough positive comments to reflect the outstanding quality of Sarah's Place condo and its beautiful location. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our time in Sandpoint and our stay in the very clean and up-to-date condo was the ""frosting on the cake."" Our only regret is that our stay was way too short as the condo provided us the quiet and relaxing environment that we were seeking for a short get away from home. Sarah's Place condo will be our place of choice as we plan future vacations. Thank you for opening your beautiful condo to us as it was exactly what we were hoping to find."

The neighborhood is lovely, surprisingly quiet for being so close to the downtown district.
We appreciated that it was private, super clean, thoughtfully appointed yet simple/uncluttered, and...a no pets policy (we love dogs, but they are really hard to clean up after).
Lisa communicated promptly to our questions.
All in all, a great base camp to use on ski trips up to the mountain. Can't wait to return next yr."

Washer and dryer got the job done. Board game loft was a fun space to chill out and play some games. Fireplace was warm and cozy."

While it is not the largest place, they thought of everything you could possibly need during your stay there. Highly recommend any couple traveling through the area to spend a few nights here."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was so perfect. It’s set a bit farther back behind a house, which I loved for the privacy. There’s TONS of natural night and the main window is right in front of some pretty hedges which makes the view feel secluded but also nature-y. The natural wood throughout felt like I was in the middle of no where enjoying a cabin vacation. I really enjoyed the no TV aspect. It forced us to just enjoy time napping, exploring, and doing a puzzle! It was a great weekend in plugging.
The cabin is just a 5 minute walk to a natural grocery store, so many restaurants and shops, and the YUMMIEST coffees we’ve had, at Evans Brothers roasters.
Lisa was a great host with super fast communication and willing to help out in any way she can!
This cabin is seriously perfect and I recommend it 💛"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Sandpoint Dream Cabin! It is so cute! It is also modern, well designed, and has just about everything you could ever want. The only exception is that it does not have a television. However, it does have Wifi, so if you really want to watch something, you could use your laptop/smartphone. The owner, Lisa, responded to questions quickly via Airbnb messaging. It's location in South Sandpoint is perfect--within walking distance (or short drive) to restaurants and shops. Took only 25 minutes to drive to, park at top of Schweitzer Mountain. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cottage for a long weekend ski trip with my wife. Hot shower, warm fireplace, all the amenities you'd need, totally private, 30 min drive to Schweitzer. 3 mins to dozens of restaurants, breweries, coffee shops, shopping. More to do than we had time for. Cabin was a perfect spot to relax and recharge. Hosts were super helpful with recommendations too. All in all a great stay!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"perfect cozy little home to get away for a few days, all supplies you need (granted I brought a wine opener and there was one already there) No tv which would be nice but it's also nice to just enjoy the company of your significant other and entertain eachother with your own comedy 🖤"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is so cute and cozy. It was clean and organized. It is the perfect size for a couple wanting to get away for the weekend. We asked Lisa for recommendations and she gave us the best coffee and restaurants in town. It is located in quiet neighborhood but yet quick drive to anywhere in town.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow this place was exactly what we needed. Beautiful space and centrally located. It was close to everything my wife and I were interested in visiting. We walked to Matchwood brewery for dinner one night and drove less than 5 minutes to Mickduffs another afternoon. We had breakfast at Joels one morning which I would highly recommended and that was within walking distance as well. We drove about 20 minutes to a beautiful hike (Viewski Loop near Schweitzer) but there are hikes all over the area. If this space is available you should definitely book it.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Cabin in town is a lovely spot. Everything is in brand new condition and Lisa is quick to respond to any requests. It does get light in the summer super early there and there are are a few high windows without shades that let light in so a bit hard to sleep in if you need darkness.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, conveniently located walking distance to much of what Sandpoint has to offer! Thank you! Will book again in the future"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! So close to downtown Sandpoint.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bret’s place is in a nice quiet neighborhood but just a quick walk to restaurants, live music, and the farmer’s market. The apartment is very basic but clean and comfortable. There’s a microwave, Keurig, and small fridge. It was nice to park in the garage for easy loading and unloading. Bret was available by text throughout our stay in case we needed anything. We would definitely stay here again for visiting Sandpoint or skiing Schweitzer."
2024-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great place. BUT the bathroom was disgusting, there were no cleaning supplies and the owner living on site wasn't available during my entire 4 night stay. I had to buy my own cleaning supplies.
There is no curtain over the sink in the kitchen making it able for you to look in the owners bathroom....
But they can also look right back at you and if you're (semi) undressed walking around they will see you. The lack of privacy made me very uncomfortable.
Hot water heater is too small, I was warned upon check-in but that doesn't make it better. Install a normal water heater for heavens sake. The shower head puts out a huge amount of water and if you shower on full blast you will not last with that water heater. A water saving shower head would be a better match with this tiny water heater."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time here! ~10 minute walk to downtown, clean space, garage was super convenient to have"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a great location, perfect to bike around town and get to the beach!!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, awesome location, great communication. Recommended highly!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bret's place made our stay in Sandpoint enjoyable. It was quiet and serene, and was a beautiful thoughtful space. It fit our needs for a ski weekend perfectly and had everything we need. He was easy to communicate with and responsive to our questions. Negotiating the unplowed alley driveway in snow season was a little tricky for our low slung 4 wheel drive, but we made it work! We would definitely stay there again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, best spot in downtown really. 5-10 min walk from everything. Apartment is brand new, shower is amazing, be efficient if you’ve got 2 people."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bret was great!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,"This is a reasonably comfortable Air B& B located in a quiet neighborhood very close to downtown. It’s fairly bare inside, has low quality linens and towels with very few kitchen amenities, but is fine if you just want something basic. For a large vehicle the parking is tricky, but the back deck is a nice spot to hang out. Bret is responsive, close by and helpful. I was alone so the small water heater wasn’t an issue but for two people it would be for longer showers."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay a couple nights in Sandpoint. Location was quiet and an easy walk to downtown. Also nice to have a garage to park the car in. Bret was very responsive and provided good instructions for check in. Would definitely stay again!

Easy to communicate with host."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Totally as advertised! Having 2 bikes to explore the area and ride to the beach was a fantastic bonus. The memory foam bed was comfortable! If you and your spouse are used to a king the queen works just fine because the bed does not move when your spouse moves. You will enjoy your stay here. Book now!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for me to stay. It is walkable to everything. It is very private and feels extremely safe. It is cozy and well-appointed, so exactly what I was looking for. I will definitely be back in the future."

Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location in south SandPoint. Easy walks every day to first street attractions.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Bed was comfortable. Brett provided extra towels when we called.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Bret’s place has all of the amenities you need and is unique. There’s a nice balcony to relax on the deck. We visit Bret’s place every year.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Super-cute little place. It was perfect for our needs. Bret was very responsive to any questions I had and graciously extended our stay by a night! We’ll gladly stay here again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our entire stay! It was clean, Bret was very responsive, I loved waking up to sun shining through the chapel windows. There is no counter in the bathroom which makes it spacious and there are small shelves to use. There were bikes to use and pets are allowed. My Subaru Forester was a snug fit to park the garage but it all was great. We would definitely stay again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay! It was a perfect get away weekend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bret was communicative and the place was the perfect place after trekking around Northern Idaho. It’s within walking distance of the main area in Sandpoint and it’s a short drive off the highway
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay and enjoyed the location being close to downtown.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and value. The place has been nicely built out and Bret is very helpful and responsive.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice little spot near town. Brett made our stay easy!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As good as advertised! Fantastic location that’s easy to walk to all the cool stuff. The inside was minimalist, but very clean and perfect for a solo person or a couple.
Brad was responsive, accommodating, and a great communicator. I ended up losing a key and he took care of it right away.
The entrance is a bit goofy because it’s through the alley and it gets pretty muddy, but no big deal. The trick with the rain shower is to not have it on full blast as you will run out of hot water quickly.
Overall, one of the best values in town and highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Bret’s place was a great getaway for a long weekend of skiing, and we were also able to bring our dog! The location was perfect — a short jaunt into town for restaurants, groceries, and cute shops.
Finding the stay was straightforward enough, and check-in was a breeze. Having the garage for our car and ski stuff was a huge plus as well. We had no problem parking an SUV in there.
The place itself was simple and had everything we needed to be comfortable including shampoo/conditioner/soap, kitchen essentials for eating, and extra towels and linens. It was super clean upon our arrival, and the shower was a wonderful treat after a long ski day, although the hot water tank is on the smaller side. The bed was comfortable, temperature control was easy, and the TV was a nice way to decompress.
Bret’s communication leading up to the trip and during our stay was fantastic. He was easily reachable, and his replies were always timely and informative.
Overall, I’d definitely recommend it!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Bret was an incredible host! The place was nicer and more private than we expected. He had incredible recommendations for the area and offered fresh linens and anything we needed (we had a month long stay).
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Bret's place was very conveniently located for my visit to Sandpoint, within walking distance to the Panida Theater, where one of the shows that brought me to town happened. The room was well-furnished and cozy warm, the fridge had its own freezer and the microwave did its job well. Bret's instructions were very helpful, as the popular Maps app starting with G was confused by the fact that the airbnb is behind the main house on the street. I kept thinking of questions for Bret, but always seemed to find the answers before I could ask. I'd happily stay there again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little spot—clean, quiet, close to town and the lake! Responsive and experienced host. Will return again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A lovely spot near downtown Sandpoint.
One of the best airbnbs I've been to. I hope to return again to this spot when I visit next."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pretty great spot. It's a quiet and spacious abode that captures the relaxation aspect of Sandpoint.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We really loved it. It was smaller, but we knew that going in. Bed was great, the place was clean, and the bathroom fantastic. We really appreciated how close it was to downtown. We walked most everywhere. Bret got back to us almost immediately after we arrived to ask if we needed anything and how we liked our stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place. Great location for Walking anywhere downtown.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Location! This is a quaint spot with great access to both the water and downtown areas. Has everything you need and Bret is an easy-going host who has provided the essentials and few touches to ensure an easy and smooth stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Right near downtown- we walked to dinner! We also had the use of great bikes and rode all over downtown and to the lake. Very clean and just what we were looking for. Bret was very helpful and available. Would recommend!!!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and bikes available! Super fun to ride around town. Thanks Brett!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Bret's place was perfect for us. Big enough for the two of us and our dog, walkable to restaurants, parks, and the lake, clean and comfortable. Communication was easy and responsive, location was quiet and private."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Absolutely wonderful!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable and private spot, in a quiet neighbourhood! Close to the beach and restaurants, easy walking distance!
There is a single car garage to park in if you have a small car or SUV, definitely couldn’t park my truck in it, but that was no issue because there was ample street parking.
The 2 bikes that were supplied were in good condition, they were a really awesome touch & made getting around & enjoying a few days in Sandpoint super fun!
I definitely recommend staying at Bret’s place, if you are a solo, or a couple!! Plus the bed was SUPER comfy!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little spot. Perfect for a quick overnight stay. Very clean, great location."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for a place to stop for a couple of days between Mt Rainer and and Glacier National Park to relax and maybe listen to some live music and enjoy some good food. Bret’s place is a 12 min walk to the Festival at Sandpoint. The parking is limited at the venue and Brett‘s place is nice short walk through some beautiful homes. Having all of a gear in our car it was nice to have the garage. Our Subaru Outback with a rooftop tent had no problem fitting in there nicely.
It’s a cute cozy one room studio over a garage with one of the best showers on the planet."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The best thing about this Airbnb was its location. Breweries like Matchwood and Utara were within walking distance. The shower was spacious and the bed was comfortable. I’m glad there was a garage but my Toyota RAV4 barely fit. Just be aware that if you have a car larger than a compact SUV you’ll have to park it on the street (there was plenty of parking). Oh and bring an eyeshade for when you sleep if you plan on sleeping past sunrise. The church style windows are cute but let in lots of morning light. Overall this was a solid place to stay and I’d recommend it if you’re looking to explore Sandpoint.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place which was walkable to the lake and restaurants! Comfortable bed and nice amenities! Parking our car in the garage was a bonus!

I do think the cost is excessive for the size of the studio though."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time visiting Chapel by the Pier. This cottage is in a great location very close to the downtown core. It is also within walking distance to the 3rd street Pier. The cottage is private, the bed is very comfortable, and the shower is powerful. We recommend this place!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The location is amazing. I went almost the whole week without needing to get in my car. Bret is a great host. Available and responsive, but very respectful of guest's privacy. The space is small, but the balcony is a great feature, especially if you have a pet. My cat loved it. I did cook a few meals in the unit, despite the limited cooking amenities (microwave and small fridge). There are many restaurant and a natural market close by. All in all, a nice spot."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay at Bret’s place! Quiet peaceful studio walking distance to restaurants and shops! Bret’s place was clean and bed was super comfortable! Thanks Bret for the stay and the great tips on where to eat and hang in town!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chapel by the Pier is located in a very convenient and quiet location near to downtown Sandpoint. It is easy to find and it is also near to the water, both the lake and the river. This is a modern rental with beautiful glass church glass windows. It's private and has all the modern conveniences one would need. It is adequately separate from the host's residence. The bed was very comfortable, the shower was lovely. We were advised to be judicious using the hot water. We had no problem having enough hot water for two showers a day in 5 days of staying there. The lighting was great in the rental. The sliding glass door gave us some fresh air. Bret responded to any needs we had and he communicated very well checking to see if we had all that we needed. We liked the place so much that we're going back in June!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location - love being in walking distance to restaurants. The set up is nice above the garage so you are not on top of people. Bret was a good communicator which is always helpful. Cute place, comfy bed, and remodeled bath. The garage was an added bonus we were not expecting."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bret is a great host! We didn’t get to meet him in person, but his communication was great. Super cute space with a fantastic bathroom, comfy bed and a great kitchenette with big sink, refrigerator, microwave and a Keurig coffee maker! The TV was easy to use and had great sound. It was also nice to bring our dog with us and to have the use of the garage. I highly recommend Bret!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, very close to town, Very nice modern remodel, has all the basic necessities. Dogs allowed was a big plus. Highly recommend."
