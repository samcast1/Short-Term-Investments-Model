2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, modern, yet warm and welcoming decor, perfect space for a weekend getaway. Pet friendly was a key feature. Clean and comfortable accommodations, easy in and out, and close to all Midland has to offer."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Lori could not have been any more helpful and the apartment itself was very nice with everything you could imagine that you would need. The problem was the tenant upstairs was very noisy, including obscene loud arguments at 2 o‚Äôclock in the morning."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The host was very responsive and helpful throughout the process. The home is very cute, clean, and comfortable. It is close enough to downtown Midland to walk. There is parking in the driveway. The thermostat is adjustable so you can control it to meet your personal preferences. Dogs allowed and I have a large, well-behaved dog, so that worked well for us. There is an apartment above so if someone is there, you will hear them. Didn't bother me at all but if you are super sensitive to exterior noise, you should know that. I would recommend and would certainly stay again in the future."

2023-09-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Lori‚Äôs place is small and simple. It‚Äôs a walking distance from downtown Midland, Dow Gardens, and more. The place is very very clean, the kitchen is well equipped, Lori leaves everything extra, in oppose to most airbnbs. We had an extra set of sheets, plenty of towels, soap, toilet paper rolls , and paper towels. The only one little issue we had was the soft mattress in the queen bed. We ended up sleeping in the sofa bed in the living room which has an air mattress that we could inflate until it was hard enough. The laundry room was convenient and the little back yard can be nice if you visit during the summer. Lori is friendly and quick to respond."

Just driving in this area is beautiful, much less to talk a walk. This is our first stay at this duplex and it will not be the last.
I have traveled to Midland since 2009 and have stayed at different hotels in this area. This duplex is a lot better than getting a hotel (more room and saving money since hotel rates have gone up in this area). And, this is also our first time using Airbnb, and we were not let down."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Kevin's place in the last week in November. The place is as described. Very accessible to a number of places in Midland. Walkable to the library, Center for the Arts and Dow Gardens. You would need a car to drive to the mall area or downtown Midland. Kevin communicated very well and answered the questions we had. The house was clean. The bathroom is a bit dated and can use a makeover. The kitchen and sunroom were fantastic.
Overall, we had a very pleasant stay, and we recommend this place if your travels bring you to this part of the state."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place to stay. Did have a little of a mildewy smell. Bed was comfortable. Only complaint is size of the Tv and channel selection as well as it is old so you can't connect your phone to it. And no TV in bedroom so if that's something you prefer this isn't place for you. Had nice full kitchen and plenty of towels. Definitely needed a good dusting
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We only stayed for one night. Had a great time.

The neighborhood was very nice and felt so safe. The value for the money spent was amazing. I just can‚Äôt say enough good things about this space."

I loved that one could settle in very easily, everything was placed so it was intuitive to find. Beds and linens were clean and plentiful. I didn‚Äôt cook, but noticed there were lots of utensils. Except the bathroom, there was sufficient space in all rooms; the shared sun room at the back was particularly lovely! Although bathroom was teeny, the good shower made up for it. I‚Äôd recommend to anyone, and would stay here again! Thank you Kevin!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a terrific time at Kevin's place! It is such a cozy little duplex with everything you need. If you're architecture geeks like us, I highly recommend walking around the area of Kevin's place. There are SEVERAL Dow homes right on the same street. Also, the location cannot be beat as the library is literally right down the street. We had a super easy time with check in and check out and while we had a neighbor in the other side of the duplex, we never heard them all weekend. We will definitely stay at Kevin's the next time we're in Midland."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Our only regret about staying at Kevin's place was that we couldn't stay longer. Every aspect of this stay went smoothly. Kevin reached out to us right after we booked and was always one step ahead in terms of communicating details related to our stay. Check in was seamless.

2022-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"It‚Äôs a nice area. The furniture is a little outdated as well as the kitchen appliances but we didn‚Äôt need to use them as we only stayed one night. The tv, most of the channels do no work or come in at bad receptions so if recommend bringing something to connect to the tv to have better tv options. It was full of kitchen dishes and pans if needed. There was no trash can I could find which was weird and inconvenient. The bed is comfortable. The location is great. Quiet neighborhood. I‚Äôd return here again overall and would recommend it"

The high speed Internet allows an instant connection to the world from this cozy house in a very quiet, well maintained single family house neighborhood. Kitchen is small but has the perfect ambiance for a nice meal for two. The sunroom is right next to the kitchen, offers plenty of leg room for us to relax. The backyard is pretty secluded, surrounded by nice trees with birds chirping in them. No coffee grinder but Kevin provided fresh ground coffee and they are very good! Kevin is on the top of the communication and has answers to all questions within a few minutes!

We have truly enjoyed our stay and definitely consider to come back!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice place near Dow Gardens, excellent value for the money. It's a half duplex. Driveway, sunroom, and basement (which we didn't enter) are all shared. The kitchen window looks into the sunroom so it is a tiny bit disconcerting even if you don't see the other unit's tenant. Good WiFi. Lots of closet and drawer space. Bathroom is very small but has all you need. A/C in bedroom only, might be an issue in very hot weather. Desk area in living room AND bedroom which is really nice. We barely used the kitchen but it seemed very well equipped. Outdoor space is lovely and you cannot beat the location. It was perfect for a quick trip to visit friends and Dow Gardens. Great value for the money spent."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"As always, this place is super charming, well located - convenient, quiet and peaceful. I will be back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice neighborhood. Cute little apartment style house with shared washer/dryer downstairs and a common sitting room in back. We were a little surprised opening the curtain off the kitchen to see the other apartments tenant sitting outside our window in this area but only because we didn‚Äôt know that area was there until we looked, I do find it necessary to explain that for future bookings. With that being said we really enjoyed our stay here. My boyfriend went to a concert at Soaring Eagle, it was a straight and easy drive getting there. We would stay again."

The duplex itself is super clean, inviting, and nicely furnished. We instantly felt at home. Plenty of dishes, utensils and towels. The awesome water pressure in the shower and comfortable bed were greatly appreciated after trekking Dow Garden/Whiting Forest in the rain! The sunroom and rear yard are shared with the other side, but it wasn‚Äôt an issue for us. They were an added bonus to an already excellent spot. Very relaxing - we really enjoyed our stay!"

In fact, I am glad I didn‚Äôt have to sit in a hotel room trying to connect to their WiFi in a small space. I was able to work remotely in the wonderful sunroom. Kevin‚Äôs response to our late request to stay 3 nights the night before our arrival was immediate. He was so kind, I locked myself out early in the am and he was over immediately to let me in. I left my purse after checking out and he was very accommodating to let us back in to get it. The yard is landscaped so you almost do not see your neighbors. Check in was easy. There is no TV but we don‚Äôt usually watch a lot of tv anyway.
If you need 3 pronged plugs they are in kitchen and sunroom but the bedroom has a power strip with adapter if you need/ want to work in the living room. The neighborhood was quiet and felt very safe.

Sue has decorated the house beautifully. It's in a lovely neighborhood, with a private, charming backyardyard. We enjoyed sitting on the back porch every night. The house is located in a quiet, private neighborhood but still close to many nice restaurants and stores like Walmart and Meijer.
Sue was such a doll of a host. Her communication from the beginning was friendly and very helpful. We come to Midland every summer for a weekend, and we hope to stay at Sue's place next year.

Also, the rooms had enough space so that we could setup a pack n play in each room. The location was great. There was a dog somewhere next door, but it wasn't loud enough to be a bother.

The house; wow. Newly renovated house. The kitchen is ideally set up, bathrooms and bedrooms are everything you‚Äôd expect if staying in a hotel room.
The owner adds some nice touches with waters, a few snacks, and also a few toiletries if you lost your luggage. I‚Äôve been in many Airbnb and this is one of the best. I think the owner travels a lot, and know exactly what any guest would want.
100% recommend this rental from easy check in, nicely renovated house, fantastic communication, and plenty of parking."

Everything you could possibly need during your stay is already here, as I‚Äôm used to needing to bring my own trash bags and other things yet didn‚Äôt need any of it here. Located extremely close to anything and everything you could need from groceries to laundry services. The hosts went above and beyond to always be available to answer questions and offer assistance in many ways, like offering to clean all dirty linens each week.

Heads up for others, the A/C is a fan unit located in one of the windows, which is loud when on, but we didn't mind. It was a bit of a challenge to keep the temperature controlled during the night mid-summer, but it worked. We loved the general decor and feel of the place. It was very well-supplied in the kitchen and bathroom. The Castile soap in the shower was new to us, but as people who like to use non-sulfate shampoo, it was an unexpected treat. One final note, as a heads up to others, there is a painting of a nude lady hanging in the bathroom."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cynthia and her husband were wonderful and extremely accommodating! I flew in for an audition and they offered to drive me to it! Extremely sweet and fun to chat with! They even helped me get a ride to the airport so I wouldn‚Äôt miss my flight! 10/10

2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Quiet house, comfortable sheets. Easy to find with lit-up reindeer, Xmas tree in the yard.
For my mid-February visit, the room temperature was quite warm. I shut the heat vent and opened the window.
Some of the photos show all the ""girly stuff."" Be careful walking in with your bag! Figurines, toys, stuffed animals, a doll bunk bed, a hobby horse ... and an embroidered sampler with a single date, implying that this room is a tribute to a lost child. :'(
The bathroom is a tribute to MSU football.
Downstairs was Xmas in February. A lit-up tree with no apparent power switch, wall decorations, jars and dishes of Xmas candy, Halloween candy, tins of nuts, snacks that may be purchased. Keurig coffees: more sweet, donut shop flavors
Be careful in the tub: large bottles of product are precariously placed.
Wifi password: on a sign on the floor by the other BR.
The room is upstairs, a long flight, and the handrail is placed very tight to the wall."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cynthia offers a comfortable room in a clean house in a quiet suburban neighborhood. I stayed one night and got on with the rest of my journey. When my plans changed a few days later and I found myself back in Midland, I looked to see whether the bedroom on Plumtree Lane was available, and then stayed two more nights. That's about as strong a recommendation as I can make: Offered the chance to stay under her roof again, I happily did so."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place! Very helpful host.
Will definitely come back"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay if you value your privacy. Bed was comfy, USB charger ports and outlets were available next to the bed. She had snacks to purchase for a small fee too.
The neighborhood appears to be an how community so its clean and safe.
The room was clean, and has character. The hosts personality is vibrant through out the house.
Also, I appreciate the uplifting quotes."

side note: Cynthia really puts special touches on making stay enjoyable. she offers recommendations on where to eat & visit. she also has a bin selling $1 (more or less) on things you have forgotten- over counter meds, shaver, gum, mints, etc. So thoughtful.."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Air bnb is located within 10 min of Dow Gardens, its super close to resturants & shopping. You will need a car, but the drive is short. I saw a couple deer near her house. Her family was there & nice. It is a firm but comfortable single bed, with nice pillows. Big window overlooking the neighborhood. Shared bathroom nearby. Room is located on the 2nd floor. Cynthia privided a folder with local recommendations to dine, work out etc. I was just in town to visit Dow Garden & meetup with a friend, who ended up not being able to meet, but Midland is a friendly mini city so everyone I came across was friendly and it was nice being by myself actually for a night!!! Thanks for the stay."

2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed my stay here. It is clean and comfy and the host was friendly though I never got to meet her. It's a bit out of the way location wise but was fine for just 1 night.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cynthia and her husband were amazing hosts and have a beautiful home! They went above and beyond what any other host has ever done. They are sweet people and it‚Äôs obvious they love sharing their home with others. Will definitely be staying here again in the future and recommending to others!
2020-10-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures are true and place is clean, which is about the only good thing about this place. I was supposed to stay here for an extended stay, but was told I might need to find another place within 10 minutes of checking in. Cynthia‚Äôs kids wanted to visit but won‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt want guests due to Covid. So the conversation of staying or not staying kept happening over the course of a couple of days, implying that I need to leave. There‚Äôs really not that many places in Midland in general anyways, so finding an extended stay at the last minute is very inconvenient and you lose out on extended stay discounts. If you want to find someone who loves to talk about politics and someone who could talk your head off, this is the place for you. Otherwise I would avoid this place."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay very much. Lovely home and Cindy is a pleasant host.

2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cynthia‚Äôs place is so much more than a little cottage! She has a gorgeous house with a nice private upstairs section for her guests. We kept to ourselves mostly and enjoyed the cozy room when we were not busy in town. We really enjoyed the complimentary snacks and other options available as well. The space was clean and warm for the winter and the shared living space had a gorgeous view of the woods. We‚Äôll definitely be staying again in the future!

2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay at Cynthia's was fantastic all the way around. As hosts, Cynthia and her husband are immensely kind and helpful, and extraordinarily welcoming. The room I stayed in was exceptionally clean and comfortable, and the bathroom and other shared spaces are taken care of just as well. The thoughtfulness invested in providing everything from local tips to mints to a lovely bar of lavender soap, and even offering to share the dessert they were having when I arrived, helped make the visit a treat in absolutely every respect. I'm so glad I had the opportunity to be there, and I'm hopeful that I'll get to return. Would definitely recommend it for others, too! :)"
