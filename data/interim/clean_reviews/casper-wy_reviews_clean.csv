We felt 100% safe in the home day & night as well as walking about the peaceful quiet neighborhood. We quickly realized we would need more paper products & reported this to the hosts who had the items delivered within just a couple hours. We wish the heat/ac would have functioned more evenly throughout the 3 levels to make us more comfortable & ensure a good rest nightly. We loved being able to be together first thing for coffee in the morning & throughout the entire day to talk nonstop & share meals. Having the use of the garage to park 1 car & the garage opener was an added plus.

We had a group of 5 adults and one 4 year old. We were up here for an antelope hunt. Everyone had room and felt very comfortable. So many full baths. I could go on and on. Don't miss out on this place. You won't regret it!!"

2022-06-01,3,Group trip,"The house was the last house on the street, that had a view of the lands on one side of the house and backyard view was open and pretty. Saw 2 pronged deer right outside the backyard. Clean house with a manual and suggestions. Would of given 5 stars for everything, but they unfortunately they had some sort of water leak from a storm a couple of night before we got there and water got into their basement. I got a notification that they found a leak and they were getting it cleaned out and it smelled a little musty, a couple hours before we were suppose to check in. They're communication was great. But the basement was still wet when we got there and we really couldn't use the basement living area. The bedroom that was located in the basement was one of the wettest spot, so only was there to sleep, couldn't relax down in the basement living area, cause the fans and windows had to be kept opened to help with the drying. Once we turn off the fan and closed the window to go the bed, the smell was pretty bad. The hosts were great in communicating what was going on and we felt bad that they had a leak, but would of been nice if they had offered a discount or something on the night because of the inconvenience."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Highly recommend!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Spacious and quiet home! Great place to stay on the edge on town.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was wonderful! Exceptionally clean and well appointed. Beautiful views from the TWO deck areas. Would have been perfect for morning coffee or evening happy hour, but, it is springtime in the Rockies and the weather doesn't always play nice! Plenty of room for everyone! Really great kitchen. Beds comfy. Plenty of parking. Really nice, quiet neighborhood. We celebrated Mothers Day and our daughters birthday last weekend and we were on the go constantly. And that is my only regret...we weren't there enough to truly enjoy all this home has to offer!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great hosts, the house was perfect"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed for 2 weeks at Scott and Jess' very comfortable 4 bed/4 bath home conveniently located in central Casper. The home is quite large and very comfortable. It is by far the best appointed AirBNB we have ever stayed in with more than ample supplies, sheets, pillows, blankets, etc. For those that like to cook, it has a very large and well supplied kitchen/fridge. There is a large garage which we were happy to have on snow days. As a nice bonus, the home overlooks a huge natural prairie with a large herd of Pronghorn Antelope and some horses which we observed each day. Bring your binoculars!
Scott and Jess are very attentive hosts. But, the house was so well set up we never needed to bother them.
We will 100% stay here again next time we are in Casper."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home is beautiful and spacious. We are a family of four and went to Wyoming to visit our daughter, son-in-law, and 1st grand-baby. The house was perfect for all of us to have meals together and visit.
The house is fully equipped with extras. It was nice not having to pack shampoo, conditioner, soap, coffee :)
The air hockey in the basement provided hours of fun and being able to park in the garage was a bonus.
We would definitely stay there again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Scott and Jess were very responsive and answered a bunch of questions for me before even booking. I was moving cross country (with a moving truck) and needed a place to stay for a night with ample parking. This place is super clean, in a great spot for sunrises (if you’re and early riser), and quiet."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is EXACTLY what we needed for a large group. The views of the mountains are spectacular!

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was perfect for a family get together. The views of the mountains were amazing and beds were very comfortable. Will definitely stay again next time we come to Casper.

2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"Very nice, large modern home in great neighborhood. Easy access to all of Casper. Home is clean, well stocked with towels & linens, and kitchen has everything you could possibly need. There are carpeted stairs to access rooms upstairs & downstairs. Plenty of room to spread out, games to play, a yard to run in, and while kids are playing, mom can enjoy the soaking tub next to the ginormous walk-in shower in the master bath. There is also a garage to in. Bring slippers as the hardwood floor gets a little cold. I've stayed in numerous air bnbs and this one has been the best. Definitely recommend."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,It Was nice Perfect I had no worries
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting Casper for the first time to see family there and in Jackson Hole. We wanted to be able to feel ""at home"" while we were there since we had a week's time in the state.
Scott and Jess' home provided us just that! Very clean and meticulously detailed inside, with an amazing view of Casper Mountain. Easy access to groceries, restaurants, and more. We even took our morning walk in the neighborhood. More room than we needed but if we would travel with our kids and my Mother next trip, this home would be ideal.
Communication was quick and kind when needed.
When we go back we will reach out to them again for their home space.
Lovely home!
SUPER STAR AirBnB home and hosts!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home is fantastic! There is plenty of room for everyone! The gathering areas are perfect for creating lasting memories.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jess and Scott’s house is very comfortable, clean and just a wonderful home away from home.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott’s and Jess’s was the perfect place for my husband and me for our 3 night/4day stay in Casper!

Communication with the hosts was quick and easy, and check in and out were seamless. If we are ever back in the area we would definitely like to stay there again, and bring more of our family with us! Thank you again, Scott and Jess, for a wonderful stay!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed the stay. It was peaceful and met all my needs! I would recommend this to anyone with or without a dog. I had my dog and the fenced in backyard was perfect.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was very quaint and clean. The bed we slept in was comfortable and the pillows were soft. They had a firm bed too but we used that room for our 1 year old who slept in her pack and play. The backyard was nice especially for our dogs.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely recommend! Super clean and well stocked….they have thought of everything. The comfy beds, quality linens, and back patio were perfect. The best part…they made our pups feel welcome with dog beds, treats and toys. The neighborhood was quiet with no traffic…just a gang of wild turkeys roaming the streets. This is by far one of my top stays."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, cozy home in a great location! The hosts are also friendly and responsive. We very much enjoyed our stay. ✌🏻"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was perfect for our needs during our five night stay! Quiet, nice walkable neighborhood in Casper's big tree area. Private back yard, comfortable beds, spotless home! Great kitchen and coffee bar!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A charming house in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood. Grass lawn backyard with tall, sturdy fences is perfect for letting your dog stay outside while you are out and about. A short drive from downtown and Hogadon Lodge (our two destinations during this trip). The house is older, but this adds to its character, and everything is in good condition. If you enjoy running or walking, there is easy access to a pathway that starts a few blocks away by Casper College and offers a beautiful view of Casper Mountain. There is also a YMCA a short walk away. Zechariah's place was great and we'd gladly stay here again the next time we are in town!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent space, Excellent host!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Zechariah’s house was a perfect spot for my trip to Casper. I did not have any dogs with me and it was very clean. Well suited for non dog travelers and dog travelers alike! He was easy to communicate with through the process and I didn’t have any issues.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great older house
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location near the college, places to eat, and grocery stores. Tucked into a beautiful area with big trees for nice walks with our dogs. Very pet friendly which is very hard to find with a big back yard that is fenced in. Would stay here again."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zechariah and Scarlett's place is tucked into a super quiet and cozy neighborhood that makes it easy to get just about anywhere you need to be quickly. It was comfy, clean, and a great price compared to loud and busy hotel options in town."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely period home. Well preserved without being over the top.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a perfect spot for a small family and dogs! Our dog Ziggy very much appreciated the dog beds, toys, and yard to run around. The home is very clean and nicely done. The bed was very comfortable and cozy. We both grew up in Casper and love this neighborhood. Could maybe do without the neighborhood turkeys but that has nothing to do with the home. I absolutely plan to stay here again when visiting family in Casper."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a great little cozy house in a quiet neighborhood. Had everything we needed for a lovely four night stay. The back yard was well secured for our pup to run and have fun.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,was a decent stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The neighborhood is centrally located to shopping, restaurants, etc. It is extremely quiet. There is a gaggle of wild turkeys that were fun to watch. The house was very clean and comfortable. The backyard is big and dog friendly, except if you have extremely small dogs, less than 5lbs. Its an awesome oasis for a date weekend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little house. Very cute and cozy. Loved the various unique decor. Quiet area of town. Happy we were able to bring our dog with us!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"All was nice. Comfy pillows and beds, many extras including clean extra blankets, effective heat/air, excellent washer and dryer, interesting tv options, established neighborhood, quiet central Casper location, very clean. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! Such a great home!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Zechariah's spot was amazing! We were on a road trip from Texas with our pup and this place was perfect! Super pet friendly and conveniently located to some amazing spots. Cannot recommend this Casper abode enough!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We visited Casper for a wedding. There were 4 adults in our party and Zechariah's abode was perfect. We had easy access to great brew pubs, hiking and the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center, just to name a few of the attractions. The home was very well kept, clean and stocked with the basic essentials. The beds were quite comfortable for us. Zechariah was ""Johnny on the Spot"" when we accidentally locked ourselves out (totally our fault). I would return if we ever have the opportunity to stay in Casper again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little house in a cute neighborhood! Hosts were responsive and I’d stay there again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"All the amenities I needed! No crazy cleaning fees. Great, close location to Casper College. Cozy place for a great price."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Zechariah has a cute place. Very functional, it met all our needs. We brought our dogs and they were quite comfortable. I even left my water bottles on the kitchen counter and he responded right away, so I could turn around & get them. Quiet neighborhood & quick to everybody we needed to see. LOVED THE YARD!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would recommend for a Casper stay! Will definitely go back next time in town!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect — so clean and dialed. Comfortable heaven after a long drive. Bed feels like a five star hotel and home had everything we and our pup could ask for. Really appreciated hosts’ communication and flexibility.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Zechariah is such a gracious host for our stay! My only regret is that it was only one night. Clean, dog friendly and homey. Loved every minute!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,I cannot think of one complaint about my stay here! Communication w Zechariah was outstanding and the house was extremely clean. I will definitely rent this again on future trips to Casper.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked with idea of bringing our pet but ended up coming alone, great area for a pet for sure! Excellent neighborhood--only concern was steps to door are not level and top is so much taller it was a bit of a hazard if you are not aware of the long step down--otherwise area and home was very nice. There is a gaggle of wild turkeys that frequent the area and that was fun! Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The most dog friendly Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in with bowls, toys, and dog bags. With that said, it was also extremely clean and tidy. We had a great experience and would stay again if we passed through town. Kitchen had what you needed to cook without being overcrowded and air conditioning was nice for the summer. Also, Zechariah was so friendly and easy to communicate with."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely, lovely home! We were so comfortable and happy there! Very relaxed, and decorated so nicely. You did a great job of painting and adding nice touches to make it a wonderful experience. I especially liked that there were luggage racks!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay. Place was exactly as described and it had everything we needed.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The house was overall very good. Clean, nicely furnished and decorated, backyard was great for our dog. Neighborhood is quiet and nice to walk around. Only recommendation would be to have another AC unit in the second bedroom as it got a bit warm in there during the summer."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Charming place in a quiet part of town. Great patio with a nice big and well maintained, fenced backyard. Nicely appointed kitchen. Highly recommended and would rent again!
Excellent communication from Zecharia!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The entire experience was great and the little touches they did to provide for the dogs were fantastic. Casper is a regular destination and it was by far the best stay I've had in a while. Can't wait to stay again!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place and I look forward to staying there again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Zechariah was fantastic to work with. He was beyond flexible when we had to postpone due to weather. He was incredibly responsive to every message we sent. He even purchased the very product we enjoy in our coffee and left it in the fridge!
Great little house, cute and friendly neighborhood. When we return to Casper we will be looking up this charming little place to stay again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I stayed for one week while working in town and it was perfect. Great back yard for my dog to stretch her legs.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Zechariah’s place was perfect for us. After booking with another Casper host who canceled on us because she couldnt clear the snow, we looked for another non-dog friendly listing. There were none available. By the listing details, we thought Zechariah’s listing would be our next best option. We chose correctly. Setting aside the canine amenities, Zechariah’s place was equally nicer and cleaner to any non-dog friendly listing. Which often isnt always the case.
Zechariah’s place has been well cared for and appears to be loved by its owner. You can tell this by the amount of detail. Especially in the basement, where the remodeling was done with detail.
Thank you for hosting us towards the end of the April blizzard. It couldn't have gone smoother.
So if you are not a dog lover, or the type of person who always asks ""Why do people always think you want to pet their dogs by letting them sniff you on the hiking trail?, Zechariah’s place will still fit the bill for your stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Honestly, 10/10. Would definitely stay again"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home in an appealing neighborhood. Clean, nicely furnished, with thoughtful amenities. One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve been to."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a fantastic stay! Everything was clean and inviting. Everything was stocked so well, including bathroom and kitchen essentials. The washer and dryer were such a great added bonus as well!! there were helpful little hints posted about, like which light switch went to which room. I was originally planning on bringing my dog, but last minute decided to leave him at home because of the snow. I know he would have loved this place though. There were comfy dog beds, treats, and bowls all set up and the backyard was a great size! The neighborhood was super pleasant. My first day, I spotted a group of wild turkeys that I am told are familiar local residents in the area! would 100% stay here again. Oh, and price was extremely reasonable! Zechariah even offered to have our favorite coffee or tea waiting for us when we arrived."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay- everything was as listed and the place was top notch. Would definitely stay again if we are in the neighborhood!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,thoughtful touches from an assortment of teas to coffee and even makeup cloths and Netflix too! Great stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a very charming home in a very safe neighborhood with an exceptional host who, right down to having your favorite coffee, really wants your stay to be perfect. Communicating with Zechariah was easy - his responses were quick, helpful, and always thoughtful. The living space is nicely furnished - comfortable enough to sit for a movie and space enough at the table for four. As non-pet people, we were concerned there might be pet hair or odor in this pet-friendly home, but everything was spotless. If not for the dog dishes, we wouldn't have known dogs had been here. Bathrooms and kitchen have everything you need (I was happy to find a pitcher) and the pillows are ridiculously comfortable along with very cozy bedding."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic stay and wonderful hosts!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super clean place! Very cute setup, it had everything we needed. A nice perk was all the equipment for our dog and the fenced in backyard, we loved it! We were there the night a blizzard was beginning and they even came and shoveled for me!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This BNB is so stinking cute and cozy. I stayed solo, but it has ample space for a group (comfortable dining and living areas). I appreciated all the details in the styling of this home. It has a relaxing and artsy vibe which fits the home and its location. The neighborhood felt very safe and is near some nice places like the YMCA and a cute coffee shop a short drive away. Everything was as describe, and the host was responsive to any questions I had. I also appreciated little things, like how they had dog bowls already set up and personal packages of condiments in the fridge. Ultimately, it was a really pleasant stay and I'll absolutely be going back."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved it. Thanks
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Close to everything!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our visit to Casper in this little home. We were very comfortable as a family of 4. The neighborhood was quiet and it was easy to get to downtown in a few minutes. We tried some really good restaurants and even cooked at home one evening. We took a couple drives to the Ski area and Alcova reservoir and both were beautiful. Alex and Tori made us feel welcome. The beds are comfortable and everything is clean and functional. We would definitely stay here again!!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tori and Alex could not be nicer. It snowed the day of my arrival, and they came over and shoveled the driveway and sidewalk before I got there, then offered to come back the next morning and do it again because accumulation was expected overnight. Tori even offered to come over and change the bed linens, even though I am an ""evening shower"" guy, and had only used them for four nights. The note on the AriBnB chat says their response time is within one hour, but I don't think I waited more than 20 minutes to get a response from them, and I had several exchanges with them due to the extreme cold during my stay. The bed is nice and firm, the house is clean, and everything works. I would not hesitate to stay here again."

What we needed more than anything was a “home away from home” where we could take a break, do some laundry, and relax on the couch with some Netflix. Alicia’s home, which is as beautifully decorated as they come, was absolutely perfect. If you still need an additional reason to book this Airbnb, the mattress here was the most comfortable mattress I’ve ever slept on."

The house is in a great spot just outside of the downtown area (like maybe a 5-minute drive), but near larger grocery stores that are located outside of town (we cooked most of our meals at the house). The neighborhood is *super* quiet and the surrounding properties are also well-kept. Our main goal was to paddleboard on Alcova Reservoir, and this location was perfect because it was a simple 30-minute drive to the water. Don't let the lack of central cooling scare you away! The house has several window cooling units that kept the house absolutely perfect. We'll definitely return to Casper and will try to book this house again if it's available!"

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"One of the best Airbnb experiences I ever had staying at Brian. We stayed with 6 adults and the house was clean, very nicely laid out but what put it over the top was how it was furnished (everything quality including reclining chairs) and all the little touches Brian applied to make you say Wow. Coffee, sodas, tea, candy bars. The bathroom is awesome and all the bedding is new and clean (true also when you take the sheets off :). If there is a better place to stay in Casper I would have to be convinced."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second overnight in just over two weeks. I hope this place is around for a long long time. Such a pleasant environment, great views, and a fun experience staying in a camper that feels more like an apartment.
And SUCH a comfortable bed. Woke up to a gorgeous sunrise right out the master bedroom window.
Thanks again Paul!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Paul and Penny have my vote for Superhosts. The trailer is an extremely comfortable home away from home. Small personal touches exceeded our expectations:)

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an exceptional airbnb. The mountain view was spectacular. Paul gave us excellent directions and met us on arrival and gave us a tour of the fifth wheel, explaining all we needed to know. He was cordial and welcoming and explained that he and his wife had lived in this fifth wheel for 2 years while traveling. There were helpful notes throughout the fifth wheel with pertinent reminders.
Owners kindly accommodated our needs for no air fresheners, unscented laundry detergent, and unscented fabric softener (we had requested this before booking.)
Casper’s famous winds rocked us to sleep in the comfortable king sized bed. In the morning, we saw an antelope while eating our breakfast, which was a big thrill! We would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was absolutely beautiful! My sister and I loved it. We wish we could've stayed longer. The hosts were very helpful to my sister when she first arrived.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I wish we had more time to stay. It was very short but for our first time trying Airbnb I could not ask for anything better. I know where I will be staying next time I visit my sister. Great hosts and a beautiful place.. Oh and the baked goods were delicious!!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved staying! Would definitely do it again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing stay! Paul and his wife are wonderful friendly people and is was a pleasure to get to know them. Their RV house is just great, we had all the comfort and loved the place. But the best thing is the location! So close to the Casper yet so far away in the hills.
Great experience and we'd definitely come back again. 👍🏻"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a retreat amidst our cross country camping vacation. Couldn’t ask for better hospitality and amenities! Oh, and the baked treats were over the top ;)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome stay and would 100% return next time we are in the area. Paul greeted us and, as all the other reviews mention, the cookies were an appreciated yummy and personal touch. Parking situation was very accommodating for our 2 vehicles and trailers in tow. Paul went above and beyond allowing us to fill low tires on site so we didn’t have to mess around with it at a gas station. We cooked a simple meal and relaxed before getting shut eye before hitting road again. Bed was super comfortable."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Paul’s place was exactly what I wanted. It was relaxing and peaceful. The nights were quiet with beautiful views of the Milky way. I’d stay there again in a heart beat.

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It's a wonderful/comfortable Rv. Greats hosts. Wonderful views. Super clean.
Wyoming can be windy. I experienced such. Totally secure, but it has the potential to sway a tad when those winds blow.
The views are worth it. Close to town.
Personally, I'd will look them up FIRST if in Casper."

It was great meeting you, thank you again for a great night in Casper ."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Paul’s was too short! We sure enjoyed our very brief visit while traveling through. Paul was an excellent communicator from the very beginning until the moment he opened the door for us and gave us a personal tour of their beautiful RV. We loved the location and the gorgeous views as well as the interior accommodations. Everything was not only as stated, and described, but truly exceptional. It is obvious that Paul and Penny have a gift for hospitality. They genuinely care about their guests and their comfort. We were also welcomed with a goodie basket that we enjoyed that evening. We were traveling with our dogs, and they were also included in the goodie basket! A superb place to stay whether you are traveling through or wanting to stay a week! We would have loved to spent more time there, and enjoy conversations with both Paul and Penny. They are delightful people!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Paul was an amazing host who responded almost immediately and was especially attentive.

The RV is actually quite large, I am sure that two people would be happy staying there for an extended period of time. It is stocked with everything you need and more, Penny even made us lemon bars! There is also a helpful and informative house manual that was clearly made with care. I would highly recommend to anyone passing through or staying for a while."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Penny and Paul provide such a charming and comfortable space to relax and recharge. conveniently close to Casper and surrounded by beautiful views.

When we got there, he and his wife came to meet us and explain everything we'd need to know about the camper. Which really wasn't a lot, but, it was still nice to have no mystery about it. Plus, they live right there so if you do have any questions that come up, they will be right there to help. They had a nice welcome snack gift for us, waiting in the camper. The camper was perfectly clean. The kitchen was very well set up with anything we needed for utensils and items. Bathroom was clean and stocked. The shower is very spacious, just in case you're wondering about that in regard to a ""camper"" shower. It was my son and I for a hunting trip. My son took the king bed, and I crashed on the couch. That worked pretty well. We certainly had a wonderful time."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,You can find nothing wrong here. Great hosts meet and talk on arrival. Mansion of a trailer.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is the definition of Wyoming living. Loved it
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"best place ever! you’re able to sit in & take in the wide open Wyoming view from this location. The hosts were also wonderful! great communication, friendly, & everything was so clean. They were also helpful with my dog while I ran into town. I would recommend this place to anyone!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful! Very quiet, peaceful and everything I wanted. Has everything you need plus extras. Wonderful views. Location is perfect, close enough to stores, but far out enough to enjoy the stars, wildlife, and have a peaceful quiet night in the country. Penny & Paul were great, even though they are here if you need anything, or have questions, I really didn't need one thing, so I didnt have much interaction. Paul was nice enough to stay up and greet me as I got in later than I'd expected. Thank you Paul! Penny left me a fresh cinnamon roll which I enjoyed with the huckleberry jam! As well as the nice little touches, for your furry freind as well. Thank you Penny! Extremely comfortable bed, I didnt want to get out of it! Great place, very clean, and just what I needed. 🙂"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was only one night, however the home is well equipped for longer stays. I've stayed in many short term rentals and Natalie's is better than majority. Mattresses were upgrade and not the standard low end for a rental. I always carry a box with things not provided/or lack of and never had to use it on this stay. Book this unit, you will not be disappointed."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely home. Exemplary communication from host!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We did a fishing trip and this was the perfect place to crash after a long day with comfortable beds. Easy to get in and out of, plenty of parking. It is along a busier street but nothing that keeps you awake, or causes any problems."

It was an amazing stay! Very warm and welcoming, Natalie was very friendly and responsive. The beds were comfortable, and we had everything we needed. I would HIGHLY recommend staying here."
2023-12-01,3,Stayed with kids,"In one of the bedrooms, the window wouldn't close - it was super drafty and howling loud with the Casper wind. The central air heating was very loud and located in the the hallway connecting the bedrooms and the living room - it kept kicking in during the night (see drafty window) and waking us up. Other than that, the place was nice, clean, and exactly as described."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay at
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, spotless home was supplied with everything we needed and extras! Perfect for our family gathering.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Natalie was great to work with! We came to Casper for my daughters birthday and were welcomed with a Happy Birthday balloon and candy for her. Great personal touch.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I have to say this was my favorite Airbnb stay yet. I wish it wasn’t for such a short trip. The place was immaculate and comfortable.

It was so nice to cook a meal and do some laundry, and just stretch out after motel accommodations.
Bed and pillows were very comfortable, kitchen, bathroom & laundry had everything you need & more."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were going through casper as a road trip from up north and decided to stay at Natalie’s place and it was a good choice!
Place was easy to find.
Very clean, had every thing we needed! Had no problem with the place. No issues.
It was one of the best stay with airbnb😊"

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Natalie's place is an older house that was very cozy. The main bedroom was too noisy to sleep, and the blinds in the spare bedroom were broken, so it was quieter but very bright. The bed was very comfortable, that helped a lot."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice little house near downtown
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super cute, clean, and cozy house in a quiet neighborhood. We felt right at home. Everything was perfect from check-in to check-out."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Natalie was awesome as usual. We keep going back to her because her AirBnB is always clean, quiet, and central to what we need. She is always responsive (even while she is on vacation lol) and super helpful."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a lovely home with all the amenities we needed. Very comfortable and very clean. Nicely decorated! We would recommend to our friends to stay here.

- easy check in / out
- nice location to get around
- we slept SO well on this bed + with the AC
We‘ll definitely recommend this AirBnB."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I only stayed one night on a cross country road trip, but it was a perfect fit for that purpose. Natalie was friendly and responsive, and her place was cozy."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Natalie was very welcoming and accommodating. We arrived with extra people and extra dogs and she was understanding and helpful. Very nice little house. We really enjoyed this cozy home!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved my stay here!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I wish we could have packed up Natalie’s house to take with us! My husband and I took our two oldest grandsons on a trip and Casper was our first stopover. We absolutely loved our stay at the Cozy Retreat on Elk Street and nothing going forward measured up to this house. Natalie provided everything necessary for a comfortable stay and many extras in addition. Her place was immaculate and had a nice back deck for grilling and a front porch for morning coffee and off street parking. We hadn’t yet the need but there was a washer and dryer available which is an added benefit. The beds were extremely comfortable and the entire place neat and tidy. We highly recommend this home for anyone needing a place to land in Casper Wyoming!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host that is very responsive to questions. Nice clean place with everything needed. Very comfy and nice stay. Great beds, easy to use AC and good location."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay while in Casper. Very positive communication from Natalie and the house feels like home.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful redone home in an older neighborhood that is being revitalized. The house had everything anyone needed and was pristine clean! Natalie was great to deal with and our 2 night stay was great.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is so welcoming and so adorable. We felt like we were home away from home. It’s very clean, super comfortable and cozy. Natalie was wonderful to work with, quick to respond and very helpful. We were so thankful to find such a nice place that was dog friendly. I highly recommend this space if visiting Casper and we will absolutely stay here again! Thank you!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was such a cozy spot to stay for my friends and I. We loved our stay! Natalie is a great communicator and is very helpful if needed!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As you can see from our 5 star review, this lovely little home was perfect. The home was clean, comfortable and well appointed. It was nice after a day of fishing to come back to a nice shower and a comfortable bed!
Thank you Natalie! We will be back!
KC"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The last question on the review survey is ""Worth what you paid for it."" I laughed. I don't remember what I paid, but this charming little house was easily worth it! My parents and I felt right at home and really appreciated its proximity to the hospital (a two minute drive - less than a ten minute walk). It was a very peaceful place to hang out during a rather stressful situation. Natalie's suggestion of an early check-in was timely and provided us much relief. Both beds are really, really comfortable and everything was spotless. The yard is beautiful and the area quite peaceful. I almost hate saying how wonderful it was because I really hope it's available when we need to go back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Natalie was fabulous. The place was very clean and we will be coming back in August
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Natalie is an incredible host, we were traveling in from Myrtle Beach, SC and had traveled for over 24hours and were just killing time until we can check in. When I had told her that, she went above and beyond and offered us an early check-in. She gave us awesome recommendations for food and easy hikes… she also left some really good local coffee for us to try. She was so sweet and responsive, if I am ever back in the area I will be looking to stay at her spot first."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the cutest little house! It's well decorated and very cozy! We loved the squeaky floors, and the fact that they left it as an older home style. All the encouraging decor was a nice touch as well. We really enjoyed our stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the CLEANEST Airbnb we have ever stayed at, like squeaky clean! It was a cute place that was perfect for our stay. We would recommend staying at this home to anyone! Natalie was the best host!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was just what we needed for one night prior to moving into our new home. Easy to find, clean, and comfortable with off street parking. Hosts were very responsive and the checkout process was so easy we actually asked if there was more to do. We accidentally left an item at the house and it was simple to arrange to return to retrieve it. We would not hesitate to stay with Natalie in the future."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the cleanest Airbnb I’ve stayed in. It’s obvious the owners take pride in this home. It was the perfect size for our group, and we had everything we needed. I would not hesitate to stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Thanks for everything! Great place to stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emily’s place was clean, in excellent repair and I felt right at home. I enjoyed the decor and the layout, super cool!
The tub m/showet in the bathroom was amazing. I enjoyed sitting on the front porch in the evening. And…a great, very clean small family grocery store is nearby, great to visit and get some snacks!
Thanks Emily!
I would totally stay there again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place!
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,This is such a cute home! We loved our stay and hope to return. Emily was readily accessible for our question- highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Went fly fishing had an awesome stay. The grocery store next door was convenient. Will come again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Emily's place is amazing. She and her husband are incredibly friendly, the place had tons of room. It is right next to the cutest market, try their baked goods, they are amazing. If it hadn't been so cold we would have sat on the porch more and enjoyed it! You will not go wrong booking this location! We were so grateful to them for giving us a home away from home for a weekend!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay for our group’s fishing trip! Very comfortable.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a little gem hidden in a lovely, quiet neighborhood within walking distance to downtown. It was the perfect place to relax and enjoy a glass of wine with friends. Thank you so much for a lovely time. We hope to be back soon."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay in this super cute and comfy home! The location was convenient to downtown, the great local grocer next door, and our events that were taking place at the college. The hosts were responsive to our requests and questions!"
2024-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed 3 nights in this home. Hosts were friendly and responsive. Location is good, beds are comfortable and heating is adequate.
However, we felt the home itself is in need of some attention. Broken blinds (living room and kitchen), the side pocket of the bedside table was loose and had exposed nails (not great with a toddler around). Outside definitely needs some attention too, fairly unkept. 3 separate BBQ’s outside, none with gas (or clean). Home itself feels pretty cluttered, lots of random things laying around like boots and tools in the rear mudroom. If we found ourselves in Casper again we’d pick somewhere else."
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The upstairs looks nice and was kept fine, the kitchen was cute but the couch and chairs in the living were extremely uncomfortable, we had to spend a lot of time at the house and trying to get comfortable and watch TV was really hard, you couldn’t relax. All the pillows on every bed were so flat. The downstairs is a little scary, it seems like it needs some repairs. The downstairs bed also folded in half if 2 people tried to sleep in it so only 1 person could sleep there, there were some flying ants or termites in one of the bedrooms downstairs that came the day we were leaving and there was very thin blanket/quilt things on the bed and it was freezing so I’m not sure how those blankets would keep anyone warm. The house was next to a really cute store that made homemade pastries so that was cool and the location was good. But it just wasn’t comfortable sleeping, we were very tired after this trip because we didn’t get good sleep 🥴"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Good, easy stay. Had a bit of an issue with the electronic lock but the hosts were able to open it remotely and sent me an app invitation to open/lock hands free.
House is cute, comfortable and clean.
Wasn’t aware that two of the bedrooms were in the basement but worked out fine for our family of five. Only suggestion would be to put thicker comforters on all the beds – we stayed during winter and the thin blankets didn’t suffice. There were extra in the laundry room and I need to use 2 extra to stay warm at night.
I’d be happy to return the next time we’re through Casper."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location. Quiet street. Peaceful retreat from hectic travel and work work work.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Emily and Ray were very helpful with the multiple issues my toddler caused. willing to come over and fix anything even late in the evening.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Host got back to me quick and was very friendly.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Charming house and very responsive hosts. We really enjoyed our stay and will stay again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was great for my family of five. Maybe my favorite feature was the incredible grocer right next door!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a welcome sign and enjoyed our stay! I was cool there was a neighborhood Grocery store next door!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Emily was a great host and the house was amazing with prime location next door to a small local grocery store, 10/10 would recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. The location next to the market is fantastic, and all the home’s amenities made the time full of ease. Host was really quick to respond if we needed to ask a question. Overall a beautiful visit and we really appreciate getting to have a home away from home while there."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place! Only has one tv but that wasn’t a problem. Had a great stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice place with all the extras! Would definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Our family of four enjoyed a week stay while visiting family for Thanksgiving break. The hosts, Emily & Ray, were easy to communicate with. They were very responsive to questions leading up to & during our stay. If you love Craftsman style homes, then this is the one for you. It has a lot of charm and that “at home” feeling. The home, including the kitchen, is fully stocked which made our stay and cooking for the holidays easier. The location is convenient to many different things in Casper; restaurants, things to do with kids, downtown, & much more. Also, it is a safe neighborhood considering that my husband left his wallet on the front seat overnight, forgot to lock the car, and it was still there the next morning. The market next door is a great place to grab a quick lunch. Overall, we’d consider booking again when visiting Casper and needing a place to stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful Craftsman gem in a peaceful neighborhood! It was cozy and comfortable, and the kids loved the warm drink options. The tub is delightful - perfect for getting out the kinks after a long drive. We wish we'd been able to stay longer. It was wonderful to walk next door to the gourmet market and get some delicious entrees for dinner and snacks for the next day. Their pastry chef is German - highly recommend the quiche and the peanut butter cookies."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay! The location was great & a charming neighborhood. We loved the market right next door. Ray & Emily were very helpful & responsive as well. 🙂
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect and peaceful location, while still accessible to town. Nice neighborhood store next door with very friendly service for food and snacks!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This charming house was the perfect place for me to stay overnight on a brief return to Casper where I lived for 20 years. I loved the vintage photographs of the city, including a famous scene of horses inside the Wonder Bar. A gem of a destination!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks so much!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a well maintained, beautiful craftsman home in a quiet neighborhood. We truly enjoyed our stay - very relaxing and homey."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great value, lovely house, very nice neighborhood, and the grocery store next door is an extra bonus!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot, highly recommend"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was great… quiet and safe neighborhood… located next to a little store…
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"There were three of us at Emily's and therefore only stayed on the ground floor. It was really pretty and thoughtfully prepared here, but also a bit outdated and in some places a professional repair or exchange would be nice.
Overall, however, a really adorable house and very obliging hosts."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house with space for all our six grandkids
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay very much. Everyone had their own room and a very comfortable stay. Would stay again if I’m am ever back in the area. Loved having coffee on the porch!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, easy check in, place was as described and very clean."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay for my two daughters and I for a few nights. Loved the Grant St market next door. The neighborhood is lovely. Close to downtown and restaurants. The beds were comfortable and the linens and towels were nice. There’s a nice claw foot tub in the upstairs bathroom. We enjoyed the front porch in the evenings. It was hot when we got there (end of July 98 degrees) but they had left the evaporative cooler on for us and the house was very comfortable.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Emily and her home were great!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Just stayed for 1 night on the way to Glacier National Park. It worked for what we needed. Location was clean and centrally located and easy access to Casper downtown.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot to stay while we visited family in Casper. Very quiet and even stayed cool with the hot temps. Lovely house and we enjoyed it.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emily’s place on Grant Street is great! Charming warm home with lots of room next to an eclectic neighborhood grocer with fresh food. Casper mountain and falls is minutes away as well as a walking friendly downtown mix of shopping and eateries. Blast from the past and modern with an awesome souvenir store. Good restaurants 5-10 minutes away, ask the grocer for great local dining. The home has something for everyone. Comfortable beds, nice bathrooms and kitchen with good space. I’d love to stay here again on our next trip from Houston. The hosts were prompt with their responses to our inquiries. The home was very comfortable during the record snowstorm we were lucky to experience."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the house. Looked like the pictures (although somewhat larger in person than it looked in the pictures). Very comfortable. Hosts were friendly - apparently they live across the street but we never saw them so not a privacy issue (but could come in handy if there had of been a problem - which there was not). Private and quiet. Good location vis-a-vis Casper mountain (where we were skiing). We cooked every night, kitchen is well equipped. If I even went back to Casper to visit I would definately try to stay here."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! The hosts were super responsive and answered all my questions promptly. The house is charming and spacious. Kitchen is very well stocked and everyting was neat and tidy. The clearance in the basement is a little low, so we had our shorter guests bunk down there. We had everything we needed and would definitely stay again!"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful visit. Very quint and cozy historic home. Very peaceful. We arrived to a home that was sidewalk clear of snow. Would visit again. Thanks for your hospitality. The Livingston’s
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place in a very cool location! It snowed a lot during our stay and the neighbors were kind enough to clear our driveway and sidewalk every morning. Nice little coffee shop/grocery store next door. Home is very well built and renovated to be built in 1917! I would love to stay here again!
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Great hosts for a great home! We hope it’s available again when we return.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house was charming & bedrooms upstairs nice as described. Emily was proactive & informed us of the updated door lock system 6 weeks in advance of our stay which we appreciated. During our stay we discovered some of the outlets didn't work in the upstairs bedroom without a closet. That & not having a mirror in the bedroom made getting dressed more challening as the only mirror available was in the bathroom. The location is ideal; nice neighborhood, beautiful older homes. It was fun to see the neighbors' Christmas lights as our stay ocurred over Thanksgiving. Having Grant's Market next door is also a plus."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,A cozy and comfortable house with responsive hosts. Thanks!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was a lovely historic house. I was surprised to find 3 bedrooms in the basement.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home, very easy to get around Casper quickly from this location"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Emily's house is in the best part of Casper. It's a cozy, comfortable, lovely old house that feels like a home away from home. This was my 2nd stay here, and it won't be my last."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great house in a nice Casper neighborhood near downtown. The hosts were awesome and easy to communicate again. Loved the house and I was impressed with Casper. Hope to return soon with my wife to spend more time in Casper.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Make your stay in Casper magical by staying at this house! You walk in and immediately feel at home. The host even left a chalkboard with a custom message welcoming me! Communication is efficient and the hosts are right across the street if you need anything. Don't miss the cafe/store next door as this was one of the best brunches I've ever had on the road. I will definitely stay here again next time we come through Casper!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place feels like home! Lovely and convenient location with unique Craftsman details, everything we could possibly need, spacious and comfortable rooms, and the front porch swing was the icing on the cake. Ray and Emily are fantastic hosts!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great, clean the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom had a double shower head that was great and towels were extra large. We met the owner who was very nice and helpful. The Airbnb lock that they make them use was not the greatest but he fixed it right away. We would rent the house again."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Very sweet house, good for a big family or group. If traveling in the summer, the interior upstairs can get very hot, but the basement was much cooler. We loved being able to do our laundry as we were halfway through our road trip to Mt Rushmore, and having a full kitchen instead of a hotel was a treat! The market next door has wine and specialty items, not groceries as we had hoped, but we were pleased with the fresh pastries and quiche for breakfast! I could sit on the front porch swing for an entire day and not get tired of that peaceful place. So lovely, and I wished for more time to explore Casper from this spot."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful house! We stayed for one night on a cross country road trip. I wish we could have stayed longer. The house is right next to the cutest cafe and is close by everything you need. Highly recommend!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location! Quiet, clean, comfortable and plenty of room. Nicely decorated and well stocked with kitchen utensils and appliances. Wyoming and western books and movies. Right next door to Grant St Market, too!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a charming house in Casper! We met Ray (host) briefly and he was helpful with a question we had! He gave us an awesome recommendation for a beer at Mountain Hops Brewhouse! If you have time and love beer go to this place! Friendly service! Try the Alpine Glow beer it was so good! We got to eat some awesome bbq from Mac’s Smokehouse grill, try the BBQ you won’t be disappointed! They have a beautiful shaded outside area for the kids to run and play! Next door to the house is Grant St Grocery, a unique variety of products and lots of items that are non-gmo, vegan etc! They had delicious coffee we got the morning we checked out! We will definitely recommend if anyone we know is heading West!"

2022-08-01,3,Stayed with kids,"This house was super cute and cozy. Overall, we had a nice, quick stay and we loved the porch swing! There were a few glitches which I think the owners are working on (?) - the blinds aren't really adjustable and it was pretty dark in the house / the dishwasher started leaking all over the floor when we started it / the AC was only in the kitchen and super loud and windy. Apart from those minor things, I'd recommend this spot to stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! Was a perfect stop on our road trip.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a race and this house was perfect! Close to everything we needed, including ice-cream! 😋 we had a great trip."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is perfection, every unique detail! The kids loved playing “house” downstairs in their own rooms. It was fully stocked and in a safe, quiet neighborhood. Loved the porch swing!"

We would return any time. There are lots of homey touches."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Emily's place in Casper. It almost feels like our home away from home!
Not only is the house spacious and well-stocked (all the necessary kitchen gadgets and entertainment items and more!), but the neighborhood is gorgeous and perfect for families. We made sure to get Saturday morning donuts at the grocery store next door and took lots of walks admiring the architecture of the houses around the block.
My family was in town for a memorial service, and we were grateful to have a comforting place to relax between events. The house was also the perfect location for all of our weekend gatherings (it's a quick drive to the community center, Downtown Casper, and a hike in the beautiful Casper mountains).
Emily was easy to communicate with when we had questions. We've grown to love Casper and look forward to exploring all the great local Downtown spots and nature hikes for future family get-togethers."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,We stayed here overnight and had a comfortable nights sleep. The little store right next door was amazing for breakfast. Be sure & check it out! Thanks Emily for hosting your home!

2022-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"The upstairs of the home is very cute and encompasses the charm of its age. The downstairs needs work, but if you only need two rooms this would work for your family."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful house in good location.
2022-06-01,4,Group trip,"We enjoyed the yard space and especially relaxing on the porch swing.
It is an older home and has some damage throughout due to the age of the home. The driveway is hard to get into if you only have a car you might want to park on the street.
Overall we had a wonderful visit."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was so cute, clean and just an overall happy vibe💕 We had an amazingly comfortable weekend while in town for a wedding!! Will definitely book again!!!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a nice little home in a quiet area. While it is an older home it is well kept and in great shape. We loved the older look and exploring the workmanship and design of the past. At the same time the beds were very comfortable and the home has all the modern amenities we desired.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great home for the price. Right next door to Grant St Grocery and easy access to all of Casper. Hosts are super responsive and friendly.

Would highly recommend this for a Casper stay!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, quaint place. Host's were responsive to any queries and resolved the automated August Smart Lock functionality quickly."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Casper is truly a hidden gem, and Emily's place is even more of a treasure. The house is spacious, full of original details, and in a terrific location.
We loved having the market right door (delicious coffee and pastries!) and the neighborhood is in an excellent location. It was great being so close to downtown for exploration in our spare time (so many fantastic restaurants, independent bookstores, boutiques, and antique shopping) and near the main thoroughfare in Casper when we had to head to take care of family business and run errands.
The guide provided by the hosts helped us with everything we needed, from the basics to helping us pick out which local place to order pizza from. We had more than enough space, and will be returning this Summer for another family gathering. It's great knowing we already have a cozy place with all the amenities we'll need in a neighborhood we already love."
2022-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,beautiful house!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Well outfitted cute place. Great location.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and well decorated older house. Comfortable beds!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a charming home! The Wyoming touches throughout were great fun for we Wyoming natives. The house is as described. Beds are comfortable. Water is hot. The kitchen is probably better stocked than described - you'll want for nothing. I'm not sure if the description mentions that the stairs are steep (as expected in an older house) so probably not for the elderly, but the basement space is roomy and comfortable. Our initial check-in was fast and easy. Punched in the numbers, heard the lock open, and voila! But unfortunately, when we returned from that great market next door it seemed to be stuck so we were locked out for awhile. Ray and Emily were quick to respond and help with any issues and mentioned this was a new problem so they have undoubtedly fixed it. They are terrific hosts of a beautiful home in a fantastic location."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed this place so much! Used the kitchen to cook my boyfriend some rolls and baked some cookies!

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, gracious hosts."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,A darling house for our family to enjoy a weekend of ski races at Hogadon Basin. The market next door is a gem. Everything was easy!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for an authentic Casper experience, this is the place. The home sits next to a little market, on a quiet residential street, but is only a few minutes from everything in Casper. There is a nice sized yard, a grill, and a front porch with a swing. The main floor has plenty of space, with two bedrooms, a large living/dining room, a bathroom, and a nice kitchen. The basement is finished, with two more (huge) bedrooms complete with sitting areas, a full bathroom, and washer/dryer.
It’s a lovely place and we were perfectly satisfied. It’s an older home, so be prepared that the floor will creak, but any home with this type of character will have some quirks like this.
The host was helpful and responsive. Overall this was a great stay."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First impression, old, charming, stylish and clean. Everything is within 15 minutes shopping wise and about 20 from the airport. Charming little store literally next door for quick and easy snacks and etc.
streaming services were available, no hassle to turn on the TV and find something to enjoy on a slow night.
All the basics for cooking, and even condiments were readily available, same for showers and more."

I love having my own, very comfortable, living space in the basement while giving my parents their space upstairs. The beds and linens are really comfortable, the kitchen has everything you need and the basement shower is fantastic! The best part, though, is Danica. ""Super host"" doesn't quite describe her. Her thoughtfulness and compassion continue to ease the stress of our trips to the cardiologist. Looking forward to next time!"

We were in Casper for a child care conference and it was perfectly located for us to zip out from the conference and be away from work. The beds were very comfortable, and the fact that the basement contained a second living room meant I could get up at 5 am to exercise and not bother the rest of my staff members who came with me. The back yard garden provided a few sweet tomatoes that we enjoyed. I will definitely return in the future as long as there is room for us!"

We've been in a LOT of AirB&B's in the past several years and Danica's place was the best-equipped kitchen we've ever experienced. I enjoyed spending time in the backyard with the birds and the burgeoning veggie garden, reading and playing my uke on the patio. Comfy beds and bathrooms, very quiet at night. Offstreet parking (driveway was fine for our Honda SUV). Walkable neighborhood with sidewalks and lots of trees. The house would comfortably host a family of four or five, what with the 3 bedrooms, 2 baths and finished basement. Danica also provides a guest guide with great tips for what to see, where to eat, etc. Will definitely try to book again next time we're in Casper."

We enjoyed our space, the ability to relax and hang out. We found the house well equipped and very clean. The air conditioning worked perfectly for hot July days. We are so glad we chose this option versus a hotel. Danica was very responsive and helpful. I'd definitely stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to land after a long road trip. Danica and husband are wonderful and right on it if you need anything (they live next door). The place was very well stocked with everything you need and the back yard was a nice, private and quiet place to hang outside with family. If i’m ever back in Casper, i would definitely see if her place is available."

Our children loved morning walks and seeing the local neighborhood Turkey gang! We arrived late, and Danica made sure to turn on the porch light for us, without us asking. We really appreciated the little act of kindness and hospitality after driving 12 hours! Check-in was easy, the space was clean, kitchen had all the things to eat at home, and the beds were comfortable! We will definitely be looking to stay here first the next time we visit Casper!"

2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"What a comfortable home! The other reviews are spot-on so no need to repeat, but did they mention the great windows? All the light makes for a very bright and cheery stay. And the living room lights have very cool dimmer switches that were handy for movie nights. The kitchen has any gadget you might need. Everyone commented on the comfort of the beds. That radon ""hum"" in the basement is actually a fairly peaceful white noise - not distracting in the least so don't let that dissuade you. Great pillows and plush towels are also a huge bonus. We are recommending Danica's home to our friends. Very, very comfortable."
