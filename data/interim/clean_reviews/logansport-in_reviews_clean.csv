2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Eel River House for 3 nights. From the moment we contacted Malan, we were greeted by his warmth and hospitality. The house was immaculately clean and orderly. Much detail was given such as candies by the bed, local coffee, and all of the necessary essentials in the kitchen. The garden is well cared for and beautiful. We enjoyed good company while sitting on the porch and watching the sunset. Definitely looking forward to our next stay at the Eel River House! Thank you, Malan, for making our eclipse trip extra special."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a wonderful home with a gracious host. The home is spotless, well-stocked and maintained. Malan met us at check-in and was a responsive and clear communicator. The location along the Eel River was all the better with the number of birds we saw during an early migration in March. Wi-fi was 'good to go' with no issues. Highly recommend this home and host to anyone needing an abode in this area!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything is going nice and Malan is very very very nice host
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at the Eel River was. We love this quiet getaway that is close to family that we are visiting.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a comfy cosy home away from home, this is the place. From the moment Malan met us at the door and welcomed us with a friendly grin, we knew we made a good choice. Exceptionally clean with anything you could need. Such a homey atmosphere really took me back to a simpler time. The grounds are beautifully decorated with all manner of gorgeous flowers. Very nice garden and we partook of some of the produce at the invitation of our gracious host. We will most definitely be back and hopefully for a longer stay. Thank you so much Malan, Charles and Jack"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Eel River House very much! Everything is so very clean, comfortable, and peaceful. I especially enjoyed sitting on the front porch in the mornings watching the birds and especially the hummingbirds up close. The cinnamon rolls for breakfast were delicious. It is a charming house and wonderful place to stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay and appreciated your hospitality as well as all the relics around the house. Reminded us of our childhoods. Enjoyed setting on the porch in the evening listening to the birds, owls, and frogs. Also watching the hummingbirds and even had a goose in the yard one morning. Very comfortable place to stay and we would not hesitate to away there again when in the area. Thank you once again for opening up the place ro the public."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable home with a large front and back yard in a quiet residential neighborhood. It was lovely and peaceful.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home was impeccable - clean, beds were comfy and all the collectables made it really interesting. Beautiful quiet spot. The home is on well water which if you aren’t accustomed to may require some adjustment but plenty of drinking water was provided!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect peaceful retreat while visiting family in the area. It was an easy to find rural setting across from a beautiful river. Malan’s home was neat as a pin and well equipped with every amenity we needed. He was super flexible with check-in and went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable
& had access to him if needed. Really enjoyed the eclectic features & antiques! We could have NEVER rested this well in a hotel.. def coming back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Malan is very personable. He was there when we checked in to give us a tour and to answer any questions. The house is very clean and the beds are very comfortable. The home is very well equipped and comfy. We had a great stay and would stay there again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a wonderful place to get away from the daily hustle and bustle of life. It was peaceful, idyllic and quaint. Thank you for your hospitality."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cool place. It was very comforting and quiet. The cinnamon buns left were delicious and it was just a great stay
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Very clean and comfortable. Loved how close it was to the bike trail since that is why we came. If weather hadn't cooperated would have been very comfortable spending the day inside the home as well. Loved the front porch for our morning coffee.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our techs were in town to work so basically just slept there but everything was comfortable and clean.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Malan's place was very cozy and peaceful. We had everything we needed and was able to relax and just enjoy time away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were there visiting my daughter, so it was mostly a place to sleep. Everything was clean and comfortable."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a comfortable, welcoming home, with so many wonderfully eccentric touches! As a cyclist, the proximity to the Nickel Plate Trail was a big plus for me. It's the perfect location for riding either direction on the trail. I had two great days of riding and a nice, comfy place to rest afterwards. And Malan's hospitality and graciousness was off the charts."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A queit peaceful place to stay not too far off the beaten path. We enjoyed staying at Eel River House while visiting nearby family for fall break. Everything one would need for weekend or week away is all here.
In addition to seeing family we managed time to go to McClure's orchard for apples, pumpkins, the corn maze and petting zoo, to go for a long walk on the Nickle Plate trail, and to take our nephew to Miami's fort children's park in Peru.
The kitchen appeared set up for cooking but we choose to eat out at all our favorite places. We had coffee and doughnuts from Aromas, pizza from Harvey Hinklemeyers, and drove over to Akron one night to Dilly's.
I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a beautiful country setting not far from town."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Malan really is a super host! He was very welcoming, and everything was in tip top shape. The house was very clean and cozy."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice comfortable, clean and quiet place to relax. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is a very nice place to stay. It was very clean and comfortable with so much charm, inside and outside, that we thought we could stay a lot longer and not want to rush off. The owner was very kind and helpful, which is always nice. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Malan!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was immaculate and Malan was very accommodating. Would stay again if in the area.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice location, interesting history in the house. Very hospitable and responsive host.
Only negative was water quality. Strong smell of sulfur, not very pleasant at all."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Malan's house. It was very comfortable and relaxing. The furnishings and decorations were nostalgic. They brought back memories of my grandparents' house.
The location of the house is ideal. It is minutes away from downtown Peru, but it is on a quiet street in a quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch listening to the birds.
Malan is a great host. He met us at check-in and toured us through the house. One day, he was working in his vegetable garden and we visited with him for a bit. We shared some stories and he shared some of the vegetables with us. Malan was very available to us, but was not intrusive.
When we travel to the area again, we will try to stay here."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We enjoyed our time at this place a lot! Loved the 💐🌺flowers, garden 🍅 , the hummingbirds , there was hummingbird water ready in the fridge.! The treats, fresh linens, and housekeeping during our stay, it gave an extra nice touch! Our awesome host Malan was sooooooo nice, always responsive, and very helpful. Next time we are around the area we hope your place will be available again. We loved everything! Thank you 😊"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet neighborhood, nice front porch, well appointed kitchen. The whole set up was very thoughtful and we appreciated that."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are considering this treasure, book it now! This home will be above and beyond your expectations. We were in town for 3 nights visiting a large, extended family. This was our oasis at the end of each day. It is spotless, but with so many treasurers inside - Malan must dust every day! The bed is super comfy, the towels are so soft I want to know where to buy them. Malan met us and gave us a tour, and now we have a new friend. We Airbnb alot, and this place was a highlight for us. There are too may lovely things to list. If you like peace and quiet, but close to town, this is your spot ."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet home. It had everything I needed. Malan is a gracious host. I would stay here again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is in a really nice area, very peaceful and quiet. It sits just outside of the town of Mexico, Indiana, with the Eel river across the street, so it's really not too far out in the country. It is very convenient to get to several different places in the area from Malan's house. The house is very clean and there's plenty of room to spread out if needed. I loved the big circular driveway, since I had a larger truck for doing some hauling work while I was there. I would definitely stay again if it is available when I come back to town."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is wonderful, and just as described. As it turned out I really needed a place to rest and relax between long drives and visits with family and friends, and this was the perfect place to rest and relax. Everything I needed was here and easy to use and find."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Malian is a wonderful host! The home has the warmth of staying at “Grandma’s house”! Milan provides all the needs of home.
I look forward to saying there again!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfortable!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay. The place was very clean and comfortable. It had everything we needed and some fun extras we weren’t expecting. We spent our evenings playing Christmas music or the record player. Our visit was in the late fall so it was cold, but I can imagine how fun it would be in the summer with the river right there. The host was friendly and was there for anything we needed. I would highly recommend this place while visiting family or for a quiet get away!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"nice, eclectic home, with lots of history. nice quiet location. If you're there in the summer, it's close to the river, for fun activities there. The owner was nice, and had the home all warmed up for us when we got there. It's always nice to have a washer and dryer available to use. It's a nice place, but definitely not kid friendly. Next time we visit family there, we'll probably check to see if it's available. 🙂"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Close to Peru, but in the country. Great stay!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charming home and such hospitatily. The house was very clean and accommodating. Malan met us there and made himself available should we need anything.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Malan's place was lovely! It was unbelievably clean and very well taken care of. He was easy to get in touch with and happily accommodated our requests. We would definitely stay here again!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away and relax.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We appreciate this cozy cottage and the owner's attention to detail. My mother and I got away for a long weekend and I really felt like I had walked into grandma's house with her. She very much enjoyed the setting, the hummingbirds and the lovely reading material. I was able to get out on the river while she enjoyed the porch!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, clean and cozy home. Host is very welcoming."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and quiet! Enjoyed our stay
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the cutest little house in a lovely setting, including a pretty yard, flowers and lots of beautiful birds. There is a hummingbird group that provided daily entertainment and we really enjoyed the front porch both morning and evening! We were very comfortable and our hosts went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. The description was extremely accurate, the house was VERY clean and it was equipped with all that we needed. We would highly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice! Malan was very kind and very responsive. Would highly recommend this home.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is wonderful. Love the homie feeling of the house. Reminded me so much of my childhood ;). The place is super clean and has everything you would need ;)
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay in Logansport! It is such a beautiful place! Thank you for allowing us to stay with an extra guest. The extra blankets really helped!
We only have a couple of minor suggestions. The first is about the showerhead. I know that my children and I are taller than the average person so maybe it isn't a big deal to most guests ¯\_(シ)_/¯ so we had to do acrobatics to get under the showerhead. (ᴗ•ᴥ•) I know it isn't feasible to redo the plumbing for just the showerhead but maybe just replace it with one that you can also detach and use as a handheld? (That is what we did in our showers at home)
The other little suggestion is maybe some extra hangers in the closet? We like to hang up most of our clothes so we went to Wal-Mart and bought some for our stay. (I intended to leave them for the next guest but Mike didn't know and packed them up)
Thank you again for everything!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a quiet country getaway place. Very clean and cozy little house. We felt welcome here.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean home. We were very comfortable here. Malan greeted us and gave us a tour of the home. Would definitely stay here again.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Riverhouse was fantastic! The location is quiet and picturesque. We enjoyed sitting on the porch in the mornings to enjoy the view and the birds. The house was immaculately clean with a well equipped kitchen. The wifi was good. Malan, our host, was friendly and helpful and gave us privacy. After we left, we realized that our daughter had left her phone somewhere in the house. Malan searched until he found it in the couch cushions, and he set up a time to meet my mother-in-law to pick it up. I'd call that going above and beyond!!! Next time we are in the area we plan to stay at the Riverhouse."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely property and a very welcoming host. We were met upon check in and shown around the spotless home. Towels were ample and extras were available if needed. The host left us a pan of fresh cinnamonrolls that were delicious for breakfast the next morning. If you are a birder the property does not disappoint with hummingbirds, bluebirds and house finches really close and active off the comfy front porch. The area was quiet and calm with sufficient parking for both my and my friend's cars. Worth the stay and I would stay again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"In spite of a busy day for him, Malan met us pleasantly and at the time agreed. Instructions and information shared were clear and helpful. His place is beautifully clean and has charming decor. The property is convenient to main roads, but has a quiet ""country"" feel. While sitting on the front porch we enjoyed the view of the river, and watching the hummingbirds at the feeder. Really lovely!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Something for everyone. NHL playoffs were accesible on the TV.
Porch included views of hummingbirds. Kitchen was easy to prep meals. Cottage was fun and comfortable. Golf was enjoyed in Peru. Bring allergy meds just in case."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,this fabulous little cottage is indeed very eclectic and totally retro! Even the appliances reminded me of a step back in time to Mom/Grandmas place. Now sometimesfolks use the word retro but it really means tired. This was not the case! even though everything in the house from the furniture to the appliances to the wall hangings was a step back in time everything was in pristine condition. we enjoyed the porch overlooking the wonderful yard across from the river very much. We plan to book again when we are in the area:-)
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was very clean! They were super responsive and flexible with our late arrival time. They gave us plenty of privacy, we didn’t see them once. Would book again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Misty and Mark were so kind and accommodating! Excellent hosts
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay that provided easy access to the Nickle Plate and Pan Handle bike trails. Misty and Mark were most accommodating and the studio guest quarters were extremely comfortable. They have upgraded the seating from the gray couch to Lazy-Boy love seat recliners! Likely the cleanest Air B&B we have experienced. No steps and the curb less shower is much appreciated for us seniors. It was a little challenging finding the correct drive but there address number is on the mailbox and when you look for the white finish it is very obvious.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful place with wonderful surroundings! Quick responses from the owner and great fishing spot.
Only issue was it seemed like the shower wasn’t able to drain properly and left a lot of water on the floor, making it slick."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, pristine, simple, charming, and everything we needed for our getaway from it all stay! Misty replied to any questions almost immediately! Mattress was softer than we were used to, so we were surprised at how comfortable it actually was - and the bedding was so cozy! The pond and woods trails provided an entertaining variety of nature for curious nature buffs like me. A beautiful, serene place. I plan to bring my daughter and her girls here soon! Tip: the bathroom is done in an industrial theme. It has a concrete floor that gets slippery when wet. There are a couple of bath mats on the floor and nice-sized non-skid mats in the shower. Those with falling or balance issues might want to bring flip-flops or shower shoes for extra precaution. We usually camp in our camper when we travel but love this place so much, we'll likely make this an annual (at least) to come visit."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was easy to find and peaceful spot. Host was responsive and very nice. Location was perfect and apartment had everything we needed for a pleasant stay. Highly recommended!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We were in the area for work and Misty’s place worked out perfect for us until we were able to move into our house. We were able to grill outside, fish in the pond and enjoy some of the good restaurants in Peru. The dogs are super friendly!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed our stay here! It was clean, neat, quiet and misty and her husband were great hosts! I absolutely loved the back yard and enjoyed the pond in the back. I wish we had more time to relax there!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time here. Although our stay was short, since we mainly came just to see the eclipse, we still enjoyed our stay, and we would definitely come back. Everything was exactly as pictured, and the dogs were very friendly. It was easy to find and our host communicated everything very clearly."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Misty's place for a week of work. Misty is a great host. She's welcoming and responsive. She wanted to make sure I had everything I needed and did it. The efficiency apartment is an addition to the garage and is very nicely designed. It is on a beautiful property and was new, clean, and comfortable. I highly recommend Misty's place for anyone stying in the Peru area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Misty's place was cute and cozy. The hosts were very responsive to messages and had a great recommendation for local food. I would definitely stay there again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,absolutely perfect it was only a 7 minute drive from where my oldest was staying at grandma's the dogs were friendly and so were they
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We took our grandson. He loved the dogs, had a great time fishing at the pond, and exploring the grounds. The sunset over the fields was beautiful. Town was very close and plenty of restaurants to choose from. The creative design of the accommodations is what drew us to this Air BNB. Thoughtful, private, peaceful, friendly. Great place to make memories."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our second stay at Misty's was as relaxing as the first. It is so beautiful and comfortable. Misty is very accommodating. We really enjoyed our stay and will return. Darla Ferguson

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Needed a small, quiet place to rest my mind for a few days. These guys had the perfect place to do this. Had some work to do in the area but, overall, it was outstanding. Wabash is a cool little town, too. very personable couple. Sweet pups and a little baby too.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the second time staying here and it was just as great as the first time. My dog loved the trails, the relaxing pond, and their friendly pups! My fav part was fishing at the pond and the open layout of the shower! They allowed me to use their charcoal grill and the little kitchen had everything we needed to prep and make the food we packed for 3 nights. We will most likely try to come back after winter!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice place!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little space for our weekend away. Very modern, clean, and comfy accommodations. Will definitely stay again when in that area."

Hosts were quick to answer all questions we had, right down to whether we would have access to the OSU-ND game :) If you are looking for a little peace and relaxation, then you won't be disappointed!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was exactly what we needed for our stay. The only suggestion is.
It would have been easier to see from the road the entrance especially at night because its completely dark maybe some reflectors on address or driveway."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! We fished--and caught lots of fish including about a 6 pound bass.....we do catch and release so he is still there...it is lovely and quiet there. Misty was quick to answer all questions and she was very helpful.

Only thing we didn’t expect was how many homes were around the property, but we are from the city so it didn’t detour us! Still incredibly peaceful and had a great time! We would definitely come back! Our puppy LOVED running free on the trails and around the water ❤️"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This stay was amazing! The room was clean, organized,and not cluttered. All the essentials you would need were provided as well.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Just came back from spending 3 nights there with my pup. It was one of my fav airbnbs so far. The place was super easy to find and I was impressed by how clean and simple everything was. I’m super picky about how clean a place feels when you first walk in and I had absolutely no issues, not a cob web in sight, and I didn’t feel like I had to keep all my bags off the floor lol. The mini kitchen was just enough for me to prepare the food I packed and the shower in the bathroom is amazing. I specifically was looking for a place that was lowkey, quiet, AND had access to a pond for fishing and this was perfect. I even caught my first 5 pound bass! The hosts were super welcoming and accommodating especially when it came to having my dog with me. I already told them I plan to come back."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay and highly recommend Misty’s place! There were detailed instructions on entry, house rules, WiFi, local things to do, etc. It was the coolest place and complete with everything you’d need. The pictures don’t do it justice. Quiet and peaceful describe this Airbnb, complete with a nature setting and pond on the property. We hope to get back to the area and stay again. 🙂"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The most comfortable bed I may have ever slept on. Plenty of space, nice furnishings. I never saw the lake nor could figure out how to see it. Parking is right in front and private behind their home. It offers basic amenities (coffee but no cream or sugar sorta deal) and is safe and quiet in the country. They have large dogs on the property which didn't bother me at all, but if you don't like big dogs be forewarned. I recommend this space in rural Indiana."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Misty’s place was beautiful! All the amenities were perfect!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were driving from Kentucky to Michigan, hit a severe storm, and wanted to get off the road. Misty was extremely responsive, let us check in with 30 minutes notice, and it was a great choice for us. Far better than any hotel option within 50 miles. We were able to comfortably work from the place the next day and the kitchenette made dinner and breakfast easy. The weather prevented us from getting out and exploring the land, but it was peaceful and perfect for our overnight stay."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay. Nice park like setting in the back. Great space.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Well designed and nice layout. Beautiful property and pond. The kitchenette was well thought out. They even added an air fryer and a blender. These were great amenities to have. Having access to the grill made meal plans a breeze. Loved the shower in the bathroom. We'd happily stay here again. Enjoy our stay there very much! Anyone wanting a few days away to a quiet area should check this airbnb out!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, will definitely have to go to the pond next visit!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was exactly what I was looking for.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don’t do it justice .
Much cuter in person !
And the pond … icing on the cake . Had not been there ten minutes and caught my first fish . We went back out the next morning and I caught 4 more . So much fun and such a change of pace .
Would definitely recommend Mark & Misty’s !"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great. One of the best places I have stayed from air bnb. Misty and her husband was very nice and accommodating. Everything was in perfect condition. Only problem is I never had lime to get to the pond. This is a great place with even better hosts. Will definitely be staying here again when I’m back in the area.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,All of her places are nice and tidy. Each one has its own unique feel and very clean

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location with a great restaurant right underneath it Our hot water pipes froze and the owner responded immediately and did what she could to fix them, in the extremely cold weather that we had at the time. She was incredibly prompt with the repair. She was also beyond fair with the outcome. I would definitely stay here again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice apartment to stay in. Very quiet.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and tidy. When I needed to contact her about something she was very responsive and friendly.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,i would go back ah it's an excellent place
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and I stayed here on the weekend for a family reunion on Sunday. Saturday night we were just about to sleep when a very noisy party started in the restaurant/bar below us. The music was so loud it shook the floor and walls. It went until 3am. I was told there isn’t a noise ordinance in the downtown area. So note that when planning your trip (I think ‘the possibility of a party’ has been added to the description now). Seems the bar is open until 3am on Saturday into Sunday.
The space was the right size for us. I missed having a nightstand in the smaller bedroom to put my glasses and phone on. The street/car noise wasn’t bad. The ceiling fan wasn’t working in the living room, but Princessa had a box fan delivered to help there. There wasn’t a toaster (I missed that one wasn’t listed on the amenities), but when I asked about one she ended up leaving one for us. I won’t stay at this location on the weekend again, but I would during the week."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, comfortable"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy location and parking is plentiful. The space is clean and very functional. Will be back if in area again.

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a small apartment above a restaurant but it’s quite roomy. There is some street noise, but it is downtown. I didn’t notice any noise from the restaurant."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place in a great location. Came into town for a business trip and it was so convenient having a bar/restaurant literally right downstairs
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Other than a lot of traffic noise, it was a great place to stay. Host was super!! I plan to stay again when in area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an adorable tiny home that was next to a pretty pond with lots of flowers in the woods. The caboose theme was so cute! It was perfect for our short weekend stay for a local wedding.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dry nice place. Check in was very easy. Definitely recommend
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved this tiny caboose! Roseann was a great host and communicated everything perfectly: from locating the place to all the needs inside. The place was so clean and cozy inside, and having all the amenities we needed in such a tiny space was perfect for us. If you're in the area and love the tiny house movement you've got to stay here!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adorable tiny house. We loved the idea of sleeping in a train caboose too. The house was very clean well stocked. The owner is there on the property and helped with lo ating the caboose. Check in and out was effortless.
One negitive is the size of the water heater. There's only enough hot water for a 5 min shower for the enrollees e. mmmmmmmmmmjnmmmmjmmmmmnnnmmmmmmmnmgggkiilkkikl"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very unique opportunity in beautiful private peaceful surroundings!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful accommodations
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The caboose was delightful! Very cozy and comfortable. The grounds are lovely and we enjoyed sitting outside and relaxing. There is a nice pond in the yard that our chocolate lab loved!! Roseann is a great host, was very responsive to communication. The caboose had everything that we needed. Very clean, well cared for. We would definitely recommend, and hope that we will be able stay here again in the future."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed one night in the caboose and it was really charming! Everything was clean and so well organized into the tiny space that it barely felt like a tiny house. Roseann greeted us upon checkout and was very friendly.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The train car was amazing, and my kids loved it! Roseann gave great communication throughout our whole experience. the location was perfect, it was nice serene to sit next to the pond, while still being right in town. We can't wait to go back 🙂"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really neat place, packed full of history. We enjoyed our stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,My crew and I were working while we were here but the place was so cozy to come home to after a hard day's work. The living space was a great place for us to unwind and connect. The history of the couple was nice to learn about and the love in the home surrounds the walls. I may look at life through fairy tale like glasses but when you give yourself a chance to stop and look around you see amazing things and meet amazing people. 10/10 Would stay again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good. Ideal for the number of people listed.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved stepping back in time. It was like going home and you can’t get any better than that.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LOVED this house. You walk in and feel right at home. It was like walking into the house I grew up in, which is a few blocks away. Jeanettes parents were a big part of the Peru community. Her father was even mayor. There's so much great Peru memorabilia in this house. It's like a tastefully curated museum. The house was spotless, really nice modern bathroom. So clever how the kitchen is modern, but all of the classic things like the ironing board closet are still there, very cool, you just don't see that anymore. VERY quiet at night. Short walk to downtown. Jeanette was just the best host.
Can't say enough. I definitely will stay there again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have 3 major ""wants"" in renting an airbnb.
1) Cleanliness... Everything was very, very clean.
2) Location... We were staying in Peru to do the Nickle Plate bike trail. Approx.
5 blocks from South Trail. 2 miles (easily done by bike) to the North Trail
3) Comfortable beds... We only used one bedroom, but our bed was fine.
We had great interaction with Jeanette and her manager Mona. Both were very cordial, and helped whenever needed.
We loved staying at this very quaint, very historical home. Loved all the paintings, and little persanal touches. We will definetly stay again if we go to Peru."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Peaceful and home feel. Felt like I was back at my grandma's house. Great host. Enjoyed our stay. Will definitely use this place again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was perfect for my friends and me. Jeanette went beyond what was expected for us. We walked everywhere and loved being there. I’ve stayed in some other places in Peru, and those don’t compare at all with Jeanette’s wonderful home."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeanette’s place feels like you’re staying at the your favorite aunts home from childhood. The memorabilia and personal items add so much character to the home. It comes with everything you need for a comfortable stay. I wish we had more time to enjoy the place. I’d highly recommend it to anyone that needs a conveniently located home in Peru. Thanks for sharing the story of your parent’s, it made it even more special. Hope to return again some day. Will book a longer stay next time for sure. Thanks for sharing your home."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We really enjoyed our stay.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was exactly as stated. very cozy and charming. Our family enjoyed how we could all have our own private room or areas but still be very close together. Clean and stocked well of dishes and linens and loved being able to wash and dry clothes. Only dislike was parking, no dedicated driveway, and not always room directly out in front of the road. Great place, and we will be interested in coming back."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jeanette was very responsive. I personally loved the home and memories my family and I made. The type writer was so neat and had fun putting puzzles together.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful place and host. This will be our go-to whenever we're back visiting. The home was so comfy, clean, and had lots of fun memorabilia from the owners and town. She also had lots of art, books, puzzles, and games to play with as well as a nice entertainment offering with large flat screen and stereo. Kitchen was so cute and offered all we needed. appreciated the Starbucks coffee and refrigerated bottled water to welcome us. Everything was within 5 minutes. Highly recommend staying at Jeanette's place. You will love going back in time in this adorable home that more than comfortably sleeps and seats everyone. See this adorable place again soon!! Thank you from all three of us!! My kids even loved it and can't wait to come back."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Awesome place to stay. Worth the money and 10 minutes from every thing yet a million miles away.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet had a very lovely cabin and me and my girlfriend enjoyed our time very much. It did take a couple of minutes for us to get some help with which cabin were staying in as there is 2 others on the property. The cabin was as clean and Janet provided some nice amenities.

He kept saying, “Lita, we need to come back!”🥰🥰 Thank you, Janet!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet is the nicest and sweetest person I’ve ever met and she has the best air bnb I’ve ever stayed in. It’s perfect. Close enough to the city but far enough that you feel peaceful. The forest is beautiful and the surroundings make you feel at peace.

Super cute, and only 7 minutes from the site. My cabin was clean, comfy, and relaxing—and a much better vibe than the hotel rooms I would have had to drive to Kokomo for. I will absolutely be booking again next time I'm attending an event in the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Janet was an amazing host. She greets you when you arrive and makes you feel welcomed. She goes out of her way and provides extras like sodas, candy, coffee, and popcorn, etc. available for your use. Janet is the hostess with the mostest! She is very kind and compassionate She gives you privacy as well. The cabin was great!!! It was very comfortable. It is a great getaway. It is close to wonderful local restaurants. It is next to the Grissom Air Force Museum which was fantastic. My son and I enjoyed great father and son time. The cabin comfortably sleeps two people. But there are three other rentals onsite if you are traveling with other couples. It is a beautiful place at a reasonable price. We also enjoyed the donkey and horses onsite. She has available kayaks, corn hole, hot tub and sauna. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch swing and rocking chairs. I would highly recommend Janet's. place if you need a peaceful retreat from the busy hustle of every day life. We plan to return."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay. It makes you feel far away from everything. However in reality everything is just a quick drive away.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I have traveled extensively and Janet was the friendliest and most accommodating host we have encountered. On her own time she went out of her way to get my son and I a couple of kayaks for my son and I to use at no additional cost even though we offered. She has lived there her whole life and went out of her way to make us feel at home. The fridge was stocked with a variety of name brand soda pop and the bathroom was even full of toiletries. There were plenty of towels and wash rags available as well. I highly recommend this listing.

We loved sitting on the front porch of her house and talking with her. We got to meet her dog Bentley, her horses, and donkey. We had a campfire at the cabin on our first night there with the wood she provided. I can not say enough good things about Janet and her lovely cabins and property. Would definitely stay here again!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was lovely! Peaceful area, just what we needed! It was nice to have the grassy area across the road and the river. We needed a peaceful time away. As we were leaving, my husband said we should make another reservation!"

We chose the cabin because we were taking our granddaughter on a road trip and spending the 4th of July with family close by. We thought she would really enjoy the beautiful countryside and the animals, which she most certainly did! We all especially loved hanging out on the front porch swing with our pup, watching the fireflies!"

Please don’t hesitate to stay here you won’t regret it."

We loved sitting on the swings on the front porch and just enjoying nature. Janet and her family are so friendly and welcoming! They have horses and a donkey on the property which you can pet and interact with. There are really great restaurants in the area and lots to do. It’s a very beautiful town with lots of trails to hike and nature sights to see. We will definitely be booking here again this summer!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Janet’s cabin was more than we expected! It was peaceful, extremely clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed for our stay. We were shocked and appreciated the refreshments and she even invited us in for Easter dinner. We got one of the best night’s rest we’ve ever had away from home and the fact that we could bring our pup with us, was a huge bonus. We’re definitely discussing how to incorporate this into our every so often recharge routine. Such a great stay and we’re looking forward returning!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cabin is adorable. Clean and comfortable. Met Janet at check in. She was so pleasant. She walked us inside and pointed out heat sources and other amenities. It was a cold night so that was valuable information. The property is dog friendly and on my walk outside to take my dog to potty I saw an otter in the creek next to the property. That made the trip even more special!

She is so personable and conscientious….checking in and available for any questions. We would HIGHLY recommend staying with her! She is a delight!"

Janet left some drinks and candy for us, brought us an extra blanket, and was so thoughtful in all her preparation. The cabin was even sweetly decorated for Christmas.
The shared hot tub space was easily accessible, and had a do not disturb sign so we could enjoy it without interruption.
Highly recommend. We would be glad to stay again!"

She is so sweet and nice you can’t help but to feel like part of the family. Her daughter is just as amazing and friendly. She decorated the cabin so beautiful and made it feel so warm and welcoming. Justin also needs a mention in this too. He is a great guy that helps Janet on the horse farm. I got to chat with him and he helped add to the enjoyment of my stay. I will ALWAYS be blessed with meeting all 3 of them 😊
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was so cute and cozy! We had everything we needed and the space was very clean. Plenty of land to walk the dogs on.

Her few added touches to make it feel special just for ‘you’ makes her unique to any other host. The cabin has all the essentials & great working A/C. Only thing I think I didn’t see was the hot tub, but that didn’t take away from it being a great stay. I definitely recommend showing some love to her BEAUTIFUL horses & donkey while you’re there.

There is a fenced in area where your dog can run off leash. Lovely horses on property to admire."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was gorgeous with easy lake access for fishing, or swimming during warm months. Probably the cleanest airbnb we've stayed in.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed staying at Rebecca’s place. It was large enough for the adults and children. The beds were very comfortable and the blankets were so soft, I went right to sleep each night. The place was very clean. The trains that ran at night stopped around midnight and started again after 5:00am. They didn’t bother any of us though."

The house is very comfortable."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This home is wonderful and the setting right on the Wabash River was peaceful and beautiful. We enjoyed the fireplace and it kept the home cozy and comfortable. The beds were comfortable and the linens clean. The comforters were warm and fluffy. There was so much storage space and the master bathroom and closet were huge! The soaking tub in the bathroom was a bonus. Our dog Molly enjoyed the fended in backyard. The kitchen was spacious and had everything we needed. We couldn't have asked for a better week ad truly felt like we were at a home away from home. Rebecca the host was an excellent communicator and made us feel welcome. We will absolutely stay here again next year when my husband comes back to Indiana to hunt. Fantastic stay. You won't be disappointed!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean, welcoming place to stay with a friendly, responsive host. There is a train nearby which may bother light sleepers. For me, the comfort of the space meant I slept like a baby anyway!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We cannot wait to make plans for another stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely fantastic host. very responsive and the house was comfortable. Would recommend a stay. One item of warning is the king-size bed is firm. I'm usually a tough sleeper but it was very hard. I know that's some people's preference just so you know ahead. There are trains but, really no big deal. A couple trains go through a night. Nice place with lots of things all around."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca’s place was absolutely wonderful! We agreed it was one of the cleanest Airbnb’s we had ever stayed at, and the view of the river was amazing. Rebecca was also great at communicating."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great space, comfortable, homey but also clean. Good kitchen to bake in, and huge fridge and freezer. Herons right out the back door, nice view of the river. My family loved it, but if you’re noise sensitive about trains, be aware the tracks are close to the house. The host offered to provide earplugs, which was kind and we didn’t need them. Just wanted to make sure I mentioned it for those who are more particular. My family will definitely return anytime we visit Logansport."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved Rebecca’s home was very beautiful and Rebecca went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice view of the river we enjoyed the screened in porch.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Rebecca was very attentive and quick to respond. The porch lights were apparently dim and needing repair. She messaged us before our arrival to inform us of the light situation and her plan to remedy. Place was very clean. She had a pack-n-play available for our baby. There was a sulfur smell due to well water I believe; recommend bringing bottled water if you prefer. We were visiting family, so we didn’t use all the amenities offered. The porch, grill area, and fenced in yard looked awesome. Easy and seamless check-out instructions. Overall, we enjoyed our stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Rebecca was quick to respond and was helpful with questions. She let us pick veggies from the garden, so fun! The most clean and disinfected airbnb I’ve ever stayed at! Beautiful view of the water behind the house. This Airbnb has well water so there was a sulfur smell but we still showered and washed dishes and felt fine. Maybe pack filtered water to drink if you’d like!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t describe enough how at home I felt in this home! I knew that Rebecca was right there with any need or question that may come up. She was very kind and compassionate. Responsive, and knew all the answers I may have thrown her way! lol. The home is very clean, and the best equipped kitchen I have ever had in an Airbnb! The River, the peaceful sound of nature, the screened in porch, the beautiful River view, and the yard space…it all feels like a getaway! Bonus…it’s only a few minutes from Walmart or any other store but feels like you are in the country ❤️ Thank you again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Rebecca was very nice. Her property was beautiful and very well maintained I highly recommend this property for a fishing trip or just a little getaway. It was very peaceful for all day relaxing on the screened in porch or on the river bank. 10 out of 10 best experience I've ever had and I cant wait to enjoy this property again on my next fishing trip or getaway.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed staying here. Looking out at the Wabash River just feet away from the house from the screened in porch. It even has a fan. Lots fish swimming around in the river.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Becky went above and beyond for our stay, she was friendly, accommodating, and went above and beyond to make it a fantastic stay. She is an absolutely fantastic host!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and parents stayed here while visiting our son at Culver. Rebecca was so welcoming and her home is clean and spacious with beautiful surroundings. Highly recommend !
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was coming ‘home’ for a family reunion. Staying at Rebecca’s was perfect. The River quietly rolled past. The road was only lightly travelled and yet a fourth of a mile away was route 24 that hosted shopping and restaurants. It was perfect for seniors with only 4 shallow steps to the front door. Beautiful plantings and a fenced yard made it perfect. We’ll be back. Mike and Betty
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Place was very nice. Love the view. I would stay there again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very comfortable, extremely clean, and I got to relax! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to relax and enjoy peace and quiet. I'm familiar with the area as far as restaurants and things to do so I didn't need help there but Rebecca was very helpful and great to work with! Very clean and just nice setting on the river. I look forward to renting this again in the future if available when I go back there."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Gorgeous home! Pictures do not do it justice. Everything you could possibly need for your getaway. Great view and fenced in yard for the pup. Rebecca was very friendly and helpful. Would not hesitate to stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house is adorable and so peaceful. I stayed there while my home was being renovated and her home definitely helped ease the stress of renovations! Rebecca was great and always helpful! She is so sweet and always available. Would definitely recommend!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca was friendly, professional, accommodating, kind, and generous. We would definitely stay at any property she hosts!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Beautiful surroundings, well maintained home, close to town, friendly host. I stayed here with my wife and 2 small children for 3 weeks. It was a relaxing and convenient time. House has plenty of space, great porches, nice yard, and the kitchen has everything you need. We will definitely stay here again if we can. The host Rebecca was friendly and easy to talk to."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place with many perks. Pictures do no justice to just how beautiful and well-maintained it is.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at the cottage for a long weekend. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Very peaceful! We’ll be back if we’re ever in the area again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Miss Rebecca and her husband went out of their way to be helpful. The place was so beautiful and quiet. I can’t say enough of how much I enjoyed staying at this home. When I need to come back to this area, I hope to be able to get reservations."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice place on the river!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our Host, Rebecca, was so friendly, accommodating and gracious! We traveled with our 10 month old baby and when I asked if she had a pack and play to rent she went and bought one and had it waiting for us when we arrived. The first night we noticed the primary bedroom door was very squeaky. When we notified Rebecca she dropped off a can of wd40 per our request that same day. Voila, no more squeaking! Rebecca was always quick to respond to any questions we had a well as being understanding of us having family over as we were visiting my home town to introduce our little one to my family. The house was clean, spacious and well decorated. The mattresses were very comfy. The grounds were beautiful! My husband enjoyed fishing in the Wabash River right off the back yard! It was a perfect location and setting for our visit."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is adorable, comfortable and well stocked. We spent Easter weekend here to celebrate with our son who attends Purdue. It had everything we needed and then some to enjoy Easter dinner, cozy places to watch movies, and also spend some quiet time overlooking the river.
The back porch and large windows were perfect for appreciating the river view. The house appeared to be recently renovated and everything was beautiful. Our host was very accommodating and friendly. The only negative I have is the proximity to the railroad tracks. I should have realized that being located close to where the tracks cross the road, the train whistles would be blowing. That was a bit loud, especially at night. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to consider some earplugs, but I wouldn't let it stop me from enjoying this gem on the river."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great host. Great house! Would definitely stay again. We enjoyed the trains near by but my mother wasn't a fan. If you don't use a fan at night or are a light sleeper, you may not like it. Thanks again!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. The house is so charming and the hosts were responsive and friendly. We could not find the iron in the house and they actually went to buy one and drop it off. I saw new plants and flowers peaking out of the ground, I'm hoping to stay here again in the Summer. I bet it is even cuter then!
Thank you so much,
Michelle L."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely beautiful home! Host made us feel like family and right at home
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time staying and Rebecca was an excellent host. My wife’s father passed away and we were in town to be with family. The house was peaceful and serene, and we felt right at home. Clean, homey and plenty of room for us and our son. It looks even better in person than the photos. We would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend to any one that is staying in the area! Wish I could book with this location and host every visit to the Kokomo area! New to airbnb and this host and location exceeded my expectations!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place great location and great host. My family had an amazing time and will definitely stay again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was amazing and it was very peaceful and it was fun and exciting to see trains go through, fishing was fun.

Everything about this place was beautiful peaceful and fun."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very hospitable, kind and goes the extra mile. I am grateful for Ms Deborah and all her efforts."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"five stars all around. We all were made to feel comfortable and most of that was due to our host Deborah. We came out here from Philly for work down In kokomo and weren't sure really what to expect out here. None of us have ever been out to the mid west. We couldn't have been happier with the way we were treated. Deb definitely was the star of the show for us as well as the people we've met in Logansport as well at the different places we stopped into. All in all a very pleasant stay when we found ourselves not having to work. Thanks for making us feel at home Deb even when we were far from it.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Highly Recommended!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Deb is an excellent host and her place is great. Book with confidence!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Was quaint and pretty comfy. Other than the train track across the street (again, not a deal breaker) it was very peaceful. The host was so friendly and quick to respond."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The cabin is cute and comfy. The property is set in a private location but the outside light was out and the property was extremely dark and the window coverings were very sheer. I would have been happy with blinds under the sheers.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for our stay. Very quiet and spacious enough to relax in while we had a couple of hours of downtime daily. So much quieter and peaceful than a hotel.
Thank you, Deborah!!!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place and very well stocked
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Deborah's cute cottage. We enjoyed the beautiful surroundings and sat outside every chance we got. Her place was very comfortable and had a homey atmosphere. We would definitely stay again!!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was headed to the area for a funeral and Deborah knew I would be checking in potentially after dark. She left some lights on so it would be easy for me to find my way.
A delightful private cottage that does have all the listed amenities."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah was a fabulous host. She is incredibly kind and very responsive. She was amazing at getting me in immediately even with a last minute request after my previous plans fell through. She made check-in and check-out so easy. The location is perfect. The cottage is in a peaceful, rural setting with the river across the large back yard, but you're in to shopping and dining within a couple of minutes, and there are plenty of delivery options available (if, like me, you're too exhausted from travel to cook). The best part was the warblers who would visit at the windows in the afternoon to check out what was going on. The only negative was some inconsistent water pressure, but there were also Twix (and other little treats) available, and I always believe chocolate can make up for just about anything."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was great and felt like a home. Deborah was very responsive and super friendly. Have absolutely 0 complaints what so ever.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable and quiet cottage located fairly close to France Park. We would like to come back, stay longer and explore the area more. Deborah was friendly, very accommodating and responds quickly. We enjoyed our stay. Thank you!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very private and peaceful! Nice little country home that is being fixed up. Deborah is very friendly and responsive. Water pressure is a little inconsistent, just be aware of that."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed staying at the home. I especially liked the layout with a bedroom right by the main entrance. Very helpful since my adult sons were arriving in the middle of the night. It was just a nice country setting and surprisingly no barking dogs around the neighborhood.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I will definitely stay here again. Felt safe and loved the privacy
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Deborah’s place was perfect for our “friends trip”. Their was a nice outdoor sitting area and a space for us to have a nice bonfire.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Deborah is absolutely the most amazing hostess! She went above and beyond to ensure we were able to check in as soon as we could. We chose her place for the bridal to get ready for my wedding. She was so wonderful at communicating with me about checking in. I couldn’t express how grateful I was for her. The place is so beautiful and peaceful. And we even had a cute little kitten come visit us. I highly recommend choosing this place for your visit.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was absolutely wonderful. Lots of extra touches like candy for us to enjoy. The host Deborah was excellent to work with and made the process very easy. We would highly recommend this cottage and host. Thank you for being so accommodating.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deb has a well-stocked home to make you feel at home and welcomed! Her house is clean, and there is great AC (as I was there in August). The mattresses felt firm and new, and I slept well having chose the bedroom closest to the back door. One must be able to climb a few stairs as there are a few steps into the kitchen and bathroom level of the home. If you get a chance to meet Deb, she is one of the sweetest and nicest ladies! Take a walk across the lawn to see the Wabash river! It's peaceful in this home."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We rented this little cottage for family who came from out of state. The cottage was clean and tidy. It was also pretty spacious. It had everything they needed for a short stay. Communication, checking in and out were a breeze."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah was a gracious host who communicated wonderfully and quickly. She made the check-in process very easy. She also left thoughtful little goodies. The house was just as described, and was supplied with everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The little touches Deborah added were appreciated. We enjoyed watching the wildlife on the river and in the yard and field. The location is great - the feel of a real get-a-way, yet very close to town and all the conveniences. I definitely recommend this accomodation."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed this house. I was allowed to check in a little early, because I work remotely and had to get connected to the internet in order to take some work meetings. So that was very helpful.
The location is perfect, you can get to anything you may need in town very quickly, but you are not in a crowded neighborhood. It is a nice peaceful and quiet area. It is also a spacious house with room to spread out, and had everything I needed to enjoy my stay. I definitely recommend this house if you are making a trip to the area."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I rented this beautiful cottage for her and I to make memories of her getting ready for her Senior prom and make it a whole weekend getaway. From the moment I rented it I knew it was going to be special because the Host Deborah was so warm, charming, and simply a blessing. She went out of her way to make sure our WYFI and television was up and running for my daughters special weekend. From the moment we walked in the door we both feel in love with the cottage. It has every accommodation anyone could want and is so beautiful. We had an amazing time! I’ve already discussed with Deborah renting it again soon! Not only did I find an amazing weekend getaway but I found an amazing new friend in Deborah…."

The apartment is immaculate. The furnishings, the linens, the kitchenware - everything is exquisite. It was sparkling clean upon my arrival. I felt like i was staying in a home featured in a magazine!
It wasn't at all an issue for me - but do note that there are many steps to get up to the apartment.
Communication with Stacy & the co-hosts was wonderful. Super fast & responsive. Check in & check out was super easy. Had an issue with the internet and got an instant response and it was fixed pretty much immediately.
Location is great if you are visiting Delphi. Just a couple blocks to the shops/restaurants downtown. Even though the house is in town - its super quiet.
Highly recommend this apartment if you are visiting Delphi. I will 100 percent stay again"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous apartment that perfectly matched the pictures! Plenty of ammenities for every need and very clean. Stacy was a wonderful host and provided plenty of information before the trip. 10/10 would stay at again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place we loved it!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb itself was clean, spotless and great amenities. Stacy gave very clear instructions and we were able to check in and check out without confusion. Although there seemed to be a bit of miscommunication between the other cohosts about the parking situation. WiFi was a bit slow to do anything besides streaming Netflix but that's all we used it for so it was fine. The town itself is very small and there isn't much to do there, although there is a small little park over the river which was a nice walk. Overall experience was good but Stacy wasn't very responsive. Also, something to note. There are neighbors that live next door. When they walk by they can see you through the window if you are sitting in the living room couch as well as if you're in the kitchen."

Will definitely stay again the next time I am in Delphi or Lafayette."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I feel like I won the lottery finding Stacy‘s place. I was coming in for a last-minute weekend trip and luckily this newly renovated apartment was vacant. The space is beautiful, spotless, and has everything you might need for your stay. A great option for anyone coming into the area for a Purdue game or a visit to Wolf Park, among many other fun things to see or do within a short drive. I can’t wait to come back again soon!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The cabin and the property exceeded all my expectations. The setting was magical: foxes, deer, beavers, fish, all kinds of birds, baby geese, and rabbits were everywhere. The cabin has both a luxurious vibe and a rustic charm. Beds were extra comfortable, plenty of fluffy towels, and more than everything you could possibly need for a relaxing vacation. Really appreciated Lisa's attention to details, like the French Press coffee maker, excellent pots and pans, and fully stocked bathrooms. Also appreciated Lisa's recommendation of Kun's bakery in Logansport, the cinnamon rolls were over the top."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Lisa has a great spot. Beautiful property and nice cabin. Unfortunately we were there at the worst time of year for such a great place as temperatures were in the teens. Everything was great though and Lisa was a great host. The only thing I had a problem with (and this was completely My FAULT for not reading the listing thoroughly) is it’s only two bedrooms the bunk beds are open in a loft area and we were 4 coworkers who enjoy our privacy. Great for families with kids though. Once again my fault for not reading the obvious description. I hope to bring my family here during the summer!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Secluded, beautiful, quiet, peaceful and an amazing experience!
I recommend it!!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Enjoyed our stay. Comfy beds. Loved the little kittens that visited us. Worked perfect for our needs. Fire pit was great for relaxing. Too cold to take advantage of water activities but found some fish food and liked watching the fish come close to shore to eat it. Beautiful this time of year with the trees changing colors.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful cabin and property. The cabin was clean and had everything we needed and more. Lisa was helpful and very responsive. If you're on the fence about staying here, just do it. You won't regret it!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Truly a magical getaway. From the gorgeous lake to the private hiking trails everything about this property is one of a kind. We had a blast swimming and paddle boarding in the lake! The fishing was wonderful too. The cabin is small but can sleep a group very comfortably. We can’t recommend Lisa’s property enough! What a gem.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful place! We booked it for an extended family getaway, with 7 adults and 2 young kids, and it worked out well. The place was clean and well stocked with amenities, including lots of kitchen supplies and stuff for water activities. We especially enjoyed the deck overlooking the private lake. Lisa was a great host— easy to communicate with and very responsive. Overall, would highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"UH-MAZE-ING!

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"My friends and I had a great stay at Lisa's cabin. The cabin was very nice and comfortable, but the lake was the star. It was beautiful. We enjoyed fishing, swimming, and paddle boarding. It was very private, but only ~15 minutes from the grocery store."

The place was very clean and had all the amenities we needed and then some. The property is beautiful and we loved having a private lake all to ourselves. It had everything we could want in a quiet retreat and we will definitely be coming back again
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host and nice place. However, Eel River Ave and East Market Street are high traffic areas. During my stay there was nightly street racing down East Maket Street. So if you are a light sleepers this nice place may not be right for you."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay. We felt at home. Great river out back.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay, we had plenty of room. This rental is on the first floor and looks just like the pictures. Parking in driveway was available. Nice view of Eel River from back of the house. Bathroom shower was spacious with a nice shower head. This is an old historic home built in 1899. In some places floors are not level due to settling. Me and my son had no problem. But an elderly person with balance issues (like my 88 year old mother) might have a problem."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the space. It’s been updated with new accommodations since we stayed last year.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We love this place when we come to Logansport! Great downtown location and close to the State Theater.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My absolute priority wherever I stay is cleanliness. This property exceeded my high expectations.
I also appreciate a well-equipped home when I am traveling. Small things like a few cold bottles of water, a bowl with snacks, paper and pen, ziploc bags, and extra paper products make for a more convenient and easy stay. This property had all of those amenities plus much more.
I have already booked this property for a future stay in the area. It was one of the best properties I’ve booked through Airbnb to date. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a beautiful, clean, and comfy place!! The lot is surrounded by gorgeous trees with tons of birds and wild life to watch. The space is incredible for a ""tiny home"" and the hosts remembered all the creature comforts one might forget to pack. The decor is so awesome and looks like something from a magazine!! This was a total score of a find!!!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home is quaint and beautiful. Everything was well decorated and clean. The owers were extremely friendly and helpful. You can tell a lot of love and thought went into the home.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay and Heather
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything you need, great amenities. Better than a hotel."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the best AirBnB experience we have had. Perfect description and every little detail was attended to. It was lovely to have body wash and some shampoo/conditioner stocked, waters in the fridge, and a few snacks on the counter. The Kcup selection was also great! The bed was very comfortable, as was the couch. I am so bummed they aren’t open when we’re in town next. Book this spot!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! The place is new, had all the things that we needed and it was spotless. As a bonus upon arrival, when we looked outside the window, we saw two deer and a red squirrel outside - it's that quiet and secluded. The host was kind to provide a generous bowl of snacks in the kitchen and was always available via the app, when we had questions.
The place is stand alone house, so there was no one above or below us, which is perfect. If you're looking for a romantic getaway for two, this is definitely the spot!
Thank you for hosting us; you have a beautiful place!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"if you like peace, quiet and wildlife this place is the place to be,everything was perfect,thank you very much for having me!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Heather was wonderfully responsive and polite leading up to and throughout our stay. The tiny home was comfortable, well stocked, nicely decorated and clean. With its full kitchen and king size bed, it certainly didn’t feel tiny to us.
This place served as a peaceful place for us to unwind and reflect during our stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is camping without totally roughing it. Janet leaves drinks and a candy dish (which my daughter helped herself to. LOL) The cabin is clean and bed was comfortable. I was too busy to enjoy the amenities, but sitting on the porch or a campfire would have been quite easily enjoyed."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful! Janet was very helpful and the cabin was beautiful. Would go back 100%
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely cabin in a picturesque setting. Fire pit out front, rocking chairs and porch swing on the porch, stable of horses and a donkey next door. Oh, and our dog loved the property, as well!
I was looking forward specifically to enjoying the hot tub. However, I discovered that the hot tub was in an indoor room on the lower level of the house next door. I expected it to be outside and close to the cabin. So I decided not to use it. But the rest of the experience made up for the disappointment."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We highly recommend this adorable quaint cabin stay! Beautiful surroundings. Welcoming host. Awesome amenities. ❤️

She had everything you’d need for a couple nights stay. She had just the right amount of furniture for the space. Shower was warm, and the fireplace kept the place very warm and comfortable.

The location couldn't be better - 3 blocks to downtown, with wonderful restaurants, some cute shops, the Delphi Opera House, and two galleries offering the work of local artists. Tyler is an exceptional host (and I've experienced several)... he responds in seconds to questions, he provides timely and comprehensive information about the house, and - most of all - he offers a truly lovely home for his guests. Don't miss looking through his books on local history and interest in the library. And enjoy sitting at the kitchen table with your cup of coffee in the morning, looking out at the lovely patio area. We love Sterling House!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed our quick stay at The Sterling House. My favorite part was the attention to detail and love put into the home.

The two cats that were free roaming from the neighbors were the best attraction for our 2 year old twin grand daughters! Tyler is a good host, there when you need him but gives you privacy.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cool old house! It’s in a cute historical neighborhood, and just two blocks to the town’s adorable downtown with multiple local restaurants, a coffee shop, market, etc. Check in, communication, all that was a breeze."
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,The sterling house was a vintage lovers dream come true. Every inch of the house was beautiful! Several of us went down for my brothers wedding and every single one of us fell in love with the home. Tyler was very responsive and made a last minute accommodation for us which was truly appreciated. Being able to do laundry was amazing! Each room had its own charm and there was so much to look at and take in. We will definitely be staying here again on our next visit. Book this house. Don’t think twice!
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at this location during the week leading up to New Year's. This house is really interesting in its like staying in your very own game of ""Clue"". Yes, I mean the board game. The house is very nice and the very beautiful. It is just not a very inviting space. The furniture reflects the home, but doesn't invite one in to sit down and relax. It feels more like staying in a museum than a home. If you have something going on in Delphi (my in-laws live there), the location is awesome, right on the main street. I will tell you that its easy to get caught up in the aura of an old home next to a funeral parlor. I left several lights on as it can be a little creepy in the middle of the night going for a drink of water."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Purdue themes, history art and photography books add to the charm. We appreciated Tyler’s communication and flexibility."
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place in a great location. Lots of room. The house is beautiful.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Beautiful, comfortable home that is walking distance to some great restaurants. Tyler is a great host who responds to questions immediately."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are visiting friends or family in the Delphi area; if you want to spend a few days taking in the historic trails and sights of Carroll County; or if you just want to get away from it all for a few days and stay in a lovely, tranquil little slice of heaven, this house is for you. My sister and I just completed our second stay at Sterling House - this time, we were there for 3 nights. You just can't beat the location - we walked to the Pub and Fika and the Chapel Gallery and the Opera House and the grocery store and strolled the historic homes in the neighborhood. Lots of parking out front, if you have more than 2 cars. And you will love sipping a cup of coffee, sitting at the kitchen table in the quiet morning, watching the red squirrel that hangs out in Tyler's back yard. Tyler is easy-peasy to work with. Responds almost before you ask the question. I look forward to staying at The Sterling House again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We needed a place to stay in a little unknown place called Delphi. My brother was having a wedding and my family was coming up with me. It was perfectly located and plenty of room for six of us. Not only to my brothers house but to the small little town. It was walking distance to the courthouse, art galleries, little shops, restaurants, and bars. This house is absolutely incredible. My father is a finish carpenter from back in the day and was really impressed with all the woodwork. It was hard to get him to leave the library where he had his coffee every morning. I preferred the veranda, especially on the rainy days with a beverage. Anyone who stays here will not be disappointed."
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We really enjoyed staying at Tyler’s house, it’s beautiful. The house has a lot of charm, very clean and a lot of space to spread out. It felt like home. I would definitely recommend staying at this house."

2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Tyler’s home is absolutely incredible. He was great with communicating, accommodating and thorough. We travel and stay in Airbnb’s frequently and this is easily in our top 3 favorites! Very spacious for 6 people, we enjoyed every room. The wrap around porch was perfect for coffee in the morning, and the back patio garden was so peaceful. The beds are incredibly comfortable and he had everything we could possibly need. A quiet neighborhood in walking distance to a few nice eateries and drinks which is great considering no Uber in the area. A great home full of charm and character. The library was one of my favorite places to sit and read. Every day we found something charming and intriguing in the home. Thank you Tyler for being such an incredible host! We can’t wait to stay again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend!! This is a beautiful, historic home with modern amenities. Tyler is a wonderful and very responsive host, you can tell how much love he has for this 121 year old home. This is a fantastic and unique place to stay in the Delphi/Lafayette area. We were in town for a family wedding and we couldn't be happier with our stay. A whole world better than staying in a hotel, and at a comparable price. We would definitely stay here again."

2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Delphi is a quaint small town and the Victorian house is charming with lots of room. We really enjoyed our stay. Tyler was very helpful and communicated everything with us - he also has lots of info about the town (where to eat, visit etc) which was very thoughtful. We loved the history and antique qualities of the house but it is old - so there are things that are not up to date but everything was in great working order."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic home and stay. Tyler is a perfect host and we can’t wait to stay at the Sterling house again.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This Victorian home is absolutely beautiful! The rooms are decorated to fit the era of the home but still offers modern conveniences in the kitchen and bathrooms. You won't be disappointed!
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Tyler's place was the perfect meeting spot for our family who is divided between Chicago and Bloomington. We had never explored Delphi before and it was so interesting and everything was within a few minutes walking distance because this beautiful home is right on the main street! We were torn between wanting to stay on the amazing and relaxing front porch...or be inside to feel the history of this ""cozy museum"" built in 1900...or walk on any of the many, many trails right nearby...or visit all the great parks. We definitely needed more time!! We had everything we needed and communication with Tyler was fantastic! We desperately hope to be back for another visit soon!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house! Highly recommended!

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely home, as pictured and described in listing. Tyler was very helpful and responded quickly to all questions we had."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for an extended weekend getaway in a nice, quiet place, and Tyler's place checked all the boxes. This 120 year old home is oozing with character - each room distinctive, tastefully decorated, and just a really comfortable space. We especially liked spending time on the wide front porch, just watching the occasional person pass.
The house is two blocks away from the grocery, a nice pub, a great sandwich shop, and a bakery. It was easy to get around both by car and on foot.
Tyler has decorated the house with a huge collection of Purdue memorabilia - a nifty treat if you're an alumnus or a fan of the university - yet tasteful enough to not offend your sensibilities if you root for that other school.
We were particularly impressed by how quiet the place was. Despite the bedrooms being at the front of the house, traffic noise didn't disturb our sleep - the house itself has good sound isolation, and the road isn't terribly busy, despite being near everything.
Tyler prepared lots of helpful documentation on the area and the house itself. Communication was great. Very easy and relaxing stay. We'll definitely look to stay here next time we're in Delphi."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We spent two nights in this lovely home with our 4 kids 15-9yo. They all adored this house and said multiple times that this was one of their favorites (my kids are well travelled).
Tyler was incredibly responsive if we needed anything and you can tell he cares for this home a great deal. It’s kind of him to let us experience it! That’s what this house is, an experience! Erie Canal is a block away, the area is rich in history! We would definitely recommend!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"very pleased with my stay in this beautiful house, thank you very much I hope to come back soon!!🙌🏽😇🙌🏽"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Tyler is an excellent host. The home has so much history and character. The beds are so comfortable. My family had such a wonderful time with our month long stay. If you love history abs Purdue it’s a must stay!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the second time I've stayed at your incredible piece of history, and will come back next time. The home is beautiful inside and out. All amenities are as described in the listing, and communication is SPOT ON. Thanks Tyler, you rock!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend staying at this cozy, well cared for Victorian house.

We highly recommend and will be back!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is our second time stay at Tyler’s place this year. It’s like stepping back in time. It’s one of our favorite Air BNBs. Tyler is great with his communication and is beyond hospitable.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place and excellent stay! Tyler's Victorian Home is amazing! The beautiful woodwork, thje large rooms and many of them made for a wonderful 2-night stay. Tyler was quick to respond (nearly immediately) and explained everything very thoroughly. If you enjoy a trip back into time, when the ""deluxe"" of the early houses were made, you will find this to be a very pleasant stay. I recommend Tyler's place wholeheartedly."
2020-11-01,4.0,Group trip,Overall a great experience. The electricity went out in the entire town most of one day through most of the evening. Clearly not Tyler's fault... I only mention it because of Tyler's exemplary communication. He kept track of updates through from the electric company and from neighbors through the day to pass on to us throughout the day. The house was si charming. We enjoyed our stay very much. Would stay there again if in the area.
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Good times
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tyler's Sterling House is an absolutely beautiful Victorian with the comforts and decor of a cozy home.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was beautiful. It was very close to town so we usually walked. There is a very cool park that our girls enjoyed playing in the creek a couple blocks away. We ate at the Blue Moose, and the Mexican Place the food was very good. Tyler was a great host and pretty much had everything we needed. What little things we did forget we walked to the general store a couple blocks away. I would definitely stay here again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spacious old house in a quiet little town. You’ll feel like you’ve gone back in time. Tyler is great with communication!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Sterling House is gorgeous. It’s like stepping back in time. Tyler was attentive and responsive for our entire stay. The house itself was the perfect place to step back, pause and enjoy life. Our boys loved the feeling of staying in a house so large and old. Every aspect was taken care of, from linens to kitchenware to comfort. If you’re a history buff, Tyler has the house fully stocked with tidbits of Delphi and local history as well.
While there isn’t much to do in Delphi itself, you’re halfway between Monticello and Lafayette. We spent the afternoon on a pontoon boat on Lake Shafer, which was a short 20 minute drive away. Delphi is the perfect location.
And if you’re looking for a good meal, the Brick and Mortar Pub is 3 blocks away and has fantastic food. We ate there 3 times over our weekend stay. I can’t recommend it enough."

Nice backyard and front patio too. Thank you Tyler!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED staying here! The house is big, beautiful, and unique. Our kids had so much fun playing hide and seek in all the rooms. It was fun to imagine what life was like when the house was built. Tyler was very easy to work with. We had a great vacation."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is gorgeous! Very clean, comfortable, quaint, spacious, and unique. We loved it very much. My 7 year old and 4 year old had so much fun playing the provided board games or just hide and seek in all the cool rooms. I slept great because the beds and pillows were so comfortable! I was able to get a load of laundry done at the end of our stay which was very helpful. There was plenty of space around the house for us and our extended family. Can't say enough good things. We loved it :)"

2019-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was so much fun staying in a beautiful Victorian home ( that was featured in more than one tour book). And we loved walking in the town of Delphi and learning about the Wabash canal at the museum. Our purpose of traveling to Indiana was to attend our nephew’s ( and son’s) PhD graduation from Purdue; Tyler’s house was a perfect place to stay, especially with his curio cases full of Purdue paraphernalia, including a Barbie doll Purdue cheerleader!

With limited availability for the area, this house was the best listing I found. He was very responsive and thorough in his instructions as it’s an older home. Lots of helpful info for the area too. If it’s available gig our next family reunion, I’ll definitely rent it again!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived there around 9 pm. So it was dark. We opened a kitchen side door and turned on light.
We were surprised, because the kitchen in front of us looked so amazing. But that was just a start. As we went into the house through a dining room, a living room, a TV room, and a front porch, we were overwhelmed by the sight folded before us.
We are all Asian business travelers. We used to stay at hotels. Always the same. Not bad. But boring. This time we decided to try AirBnB, because it would be a great opportunity to have a glimpse on life in the USA at a different stand point of view.
This house is the best case for what we tried to look for.
Basically, the house was very clean and everything was working fine.
Very convenient and comfortable.
i thought this house itself can be a good travel destination.
I would like to thank the host for sharing this house."

2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful Victorian home was just beautiful as pictured and what we expected. The beauty and elegance of the stately mansion could be seen throughout! The woodwork was so beautiful and Tyler’s patriotic passion for our country (and the Purdue Boilermakers-Boiler up!) was evident. It made us even more comfortable seeing that! Speaking of comfortable, the Temper-pedic beds...they were very comfortable!! Much better than I expected and we slept so well! We spent each evening in the Library. I loved that room. The whole place was so comfortable and cozy! Now..onto the host...I’d like Airbnb.com to know that Tyler was the absolutely best host anyone could hope for. Tyler was so accommodating to every need or request we had. You will not find a better host-I dare you!! I can’t say enough and I can’t thank you enough, Tyler! We will most definitely be back for years to come! PS. My Purdue daughter and her friend enjoyed this little get-away from campus too!❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was amazing!!!
There were tons of towels, linens and pillows. And also toiletries! We didn’t pack any and had everything we needed.
Everything that’s listed in the description was accurate.
The host was incredibly accessible and helpful! This was by far the best Airbnb experience we’ve had!
Thanks Tyler!! We will definitely stay here again if the opportunity arises!

2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is a grand location just a short walk from historic, downtown Delphi. The downstairs has spacious rooms that accommodate a large gathering of family or friends."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Travelers can expect a lovely historic home with a modern kitchen and bathrooms. The home is within walking distance of quaint and lovely downtown Delphi and within driving distance of the many activities that the area has to offer. The home is spotlessly clean and the host provides lovely towels and every kitchen appliance and utensil imaginable. The library is full of interesting books and the house is supremely quiet -- I read two books and several magazine articles while I was there. The backyard and front porch are good for relaxing.
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I had such a great experience! My husband is more of the tech savvy one(he books Airbnb’s and hotels) and he had to go out of town for a work emergency. I was very nervous about getting into the house and how everything worked. Tyler was great! Very quick to respond/answers every call/text and is very friendly! He even gave me a quick tutorial over the phone on everything in the house once I was there. I couldn’t have had a better experience not to mention the Victorian house was absolutely beautiful! My family could have spent a few days looking at everything in the house! Highly recommend!!!!
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a hidden gem so close to Purdue University! Beautiful home with great local, handcrafted guidebooks! Tyler was very responsive and attentive in a respectful way throughout the stay, but since his house had everything we needed we hardly had to bother him. Highly recommended!!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where to begin... OK - let me start at the beginning. Tyler responds almost within seconds, any time you ask questions. The check-in process was easy peasy.
And then there's that house. Oh my gosh - to be able to stay in an historic home like Sterling House is such a privilege. Tyler has furnished it with fabulous antiques (be sure to check out the round desk in the upstairs turret). We enjoyed every part of the house, though we found ourselves using the library, kitchen table, and front porch as the spots to visit with friends and drink our coffee and wine.
The house is spotless, and Tyler provides plenty of fluffy towels and amenities in the bathrooms and kitchen to make your stay easy.
The location of this home couldn't be better. We could walk three blocks to the Brick and Mortar Pub and the Delphi Opera House Gallery and the shops in downtown Delphi. There's always plenty of parking on the street in front of the house, in addition to the two spots at the side.
Let me point out two aspects that make this particular house so special. Tyler is a Delphi guy who loves his community, and it really shows in the photos and artwork by local artists displayed in his house. In addition, he has an extensive collection of books about local history which he offers in the lovely library. You can't help but feel the history of this small town.
Which brings me to the second ""plus:"" this gorgeous historic home sits among many gorgeous (or becoming gorgeous or potentially gorgeous) historic homes. Sit on the front porch and look across the street at the transformation going on at a Victorian mansion and at a beautiful example of mid-century limestone ranch homes situated on a 3-acre wooded lot. Walk around the neighborhood and see example after example of classic architecture.
Delphi is a lovely historic town with many attractions - the Opera House and Gallery, the Wabash and Erie Canal Center, the Historic Hiking Trails, Riley Park, Deer Creek; and Sterling House is a perfect home base for exploring and getting a feel for this charming community. I definitely will return to Sterling House (and I'll bring friends!). I highly highly recommend it. Well done, Tyler."
2018-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely the most beautiful, charming old Victorian home I’ve ever seen. So spacious and beautiful decor. All amenities were great . Kitchen was fabulous. Just overall - wonderful to stay and have several guests with adequate space. Loved it !"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful place to stay. We were in town for a family wedding and it was the perfect location to meet up with other family in town. The host is so accommodating and available. The coffee maker wasn't working and he had one delivered within a few hours, so great service! And there are plenty of places to grab coffee within walking distance anyway."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Talk about a wild ride! The vibe this place has is insane. We came from New Orleans where everything is haunted and we felt like we never left in this home. it's so big and has a lot of little things to explore. A very fun eclectic place. Book it!

2018-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great stay. The house is beautiful. We had fun looking at all the nooks and crannies of the house. Tyler offered to show us how the light switches and locks worked, but it was more fun figuring it out ourselves. Loved the back yard and the front porch. The beds were very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this house. Thanks for making our first experience with airbnb great."
2018-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We just used for a few days while in the area for work. Everything worked very well and we had zero problems. Tyler was on top of things and always available!

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this charming 100+ year old home. We were delighted the minute we walked through the door! Rounded windows, oak woodwork, and inlaid floors, in the dining room. It was like stepping back in time but with today’s conveniences. House was very clean and so spacious!!! Beautiful, timeless home located in the heart of Delphi!!!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had 7 people needing a place to stay for one of our daughter's wedding that was nearby. We were hoping to find an Airbnb so we didn't have to pay for two hotel rooms and Patricia's house was perfect for us! The price for one night was cheaper than the price for one hotel room for one night which was great. The house was clean, instructions were clear, and the kitchen and living room were roomy. There was plenty of room for 6 adult sized people and our 9 year old. Patricia had a few small snacks set out (granola bars, crackers, pop tarts), which I was not expecting, but appreciated. There was also a variety of coffee and teas to choose from and lots of dishes and cookware to use if needed. Patricia was very quick to respond to any message or question I sent, even weeks before our check in. I would definitely stay at this house again if we were in the area."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,very nice place and set up like your home
,,,"Can't begin to express how unhappy I was with this attempted reservation.
I chose the property as it looked to have potential, paid, then waited.
And waited and waited. I reached out to host via text, phone and AirBNB messaging. No responses. I assumed I would get one, and continued my drive in the direction of the AirBnb. 30 mintues past, than an hour, then more hours. No contact from host. No directions or instructions on how to stay.
Arrived in the general area still without contact. Stress level rose. Contacted Airbnb. They tried to reach Janet, couldn't.
So I was stuck. Listing said ""no refunds"". There were no hotels in area. It was getting dark.
what should have been a stress free stay in a cute cottage turned into an expense ridden journey, where I had to backtrack many miles to find a hotel. Additionally spent a good four hours in text and phone conversations with Air bnb just to get a refund for this place.
Dont be surprised if you get no response from host after paying!"
