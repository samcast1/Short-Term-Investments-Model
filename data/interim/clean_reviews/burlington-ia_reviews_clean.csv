2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our time at the Mosquito Park Condo was great! Felt right at home. Great experience.
Will stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Clean and comfortable. Great location. John responds prompts to and questions. Highly recommend this condo!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Lovely place! Not only did it have a gorgeous view of Mosquito Park and the river, it was a quick drive to work (the hospital). The place was perfect for us as medical travelers because it was extremely well stocked with anything you could need."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,John was a wonderful host and the space was perfect. The views of the river were so pretty. John had a few staples in the kitchen and that was a wonderful addition to such a quaint home
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We got caught in bad weather and ended up checking in late. Checking was so clear that we had no problem getting in. Also, because it was so late, we had no chance to grab extras, but John had it covered already. Everything was provided. Even fast Internet/WiFi.
John made our visit wonderful in such a charming and beautiful home. We will definitely be to stay again on next visit.
Thank you for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home and making us feel welcome."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A good place. It is an old place so it comes with all of those pros and cons. The house has a lot of character, but we had everything we needed. The host checked in via texts frequently to make sure everything was good for us and even approved a change in our reservation plans. Overall a really solid stay for the price."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property is in a quiet historic neighborhood with a view of the Mississippi. The house itself is historic, over 130 years old, so has lots a charm and character. It creaks and has some cracks in the plaster, but that adds to the home and is not unexpected. The house was extremely clean and had everything needed including kitchenware, games, and books. The host was very responsive and provided clear instructions, which made getting into and enjoying the home simple. The location is close to downtown and within 10 minutes of anything in Burlington. Recommend walking the neighborhood to look at the old homes. Overall a great stay and first time using AirB&B. Would definitely go back if staying in the area."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the most well equipped air bnb I've ever stayed at, would love to stay again!! Such good communication too, and a neat location."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for photos . walkingdistance to downtown and Mosquitoe Park and Snake alley
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"stayed there for 5 months, I believe that I couldn't find a better place to stay there for that long, and John made it easy..... overall a perfect place to stay!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Neat place with a lot of personality and character. Nice views of the Mississippi. Need to be able to climb stairs well to reach bedrooms. Good kitchen stocked with pots and pans some basic cooking staples.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,overall a nice area and place to stay....
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice Place to Stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"overall great place, great quiet area .... I will definitely come back to Mosquito Park Condo ..."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, close to downtown. Burlington is a nice little quaint city on the mighty Mississippi. Definitely a hidden gem! Would definitely stay here again. Owner gave me some great recommendations on places to eat! La Tavola was great and thanks for getting me a reservation John! You’re the best!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"This condo was amazing! It was very clean and was more than big enough to fit our party of 5. We spent mornings walking the neighborhood and evening sitting around the table playing cards. It was easy to check into and spotless. The beds were comfortable and plenty of linens and pillows were provided. The kitchen was fully stocked and had more spices available than most AirBNB homes we have been to. We use AirBNB 3-4 times per year and more than once we commented that the amenities here were the best we have seen. The water took a minute to warm up but once it did, there was plenty for multiple people to shower without running out. The towels were mis-matched but large and soft and there were several of them. We felt right at home. John is a very responsive host and went above and beyond to make sure we had a great time celebrating our sons 21st birthday. If we come back to visit again before the end of his internship, we will definitely rent this condo again! Thanks John!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location was perfect for us Second time at this location First time with John Could not have gone any better Thanks
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"My recent stay was a mixed experience. While it had a certain charm and authenticity that added to the overall atmosphere, I couldn’t overlook some concerns that affected my stay.
On the positive side, the home exuded a cozy vibe with its old-world charm. The interior had a unique character, and there were some interesting architectural details that reflected the history of the place. Additionally, the location was quite convenient, with easy access to nearby park and just a short walk from downtown.
However, it’s important to address the downsides. The townhome was in need of maintenance and updating. The bathroom, in particular, showed signs of needed improvements especially in regards to water pressure and shower in general. The kitchen needs a dishwasher, which would help ensure dishes throughout the home were clean for the next guest. Lastly, I would suggest that all new/matching towels be purchased and remove all religious pictures, idols, and paraphernalia."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one of our favorite places to stay when we visit Burlington. The apartment is spacious and very clean. Jeff is the best host!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was just awesome!! We felt right at home and totally enjoyed our stay. Jeff and his parents were very helpful, accommodating and pleasant. We had wonderful conversations with Jeff's Mom and Dad. We would most definitely come back to this place!!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff's place in Burlington is ideally located near the recently renovated downtown. Unique shops,restaurants , and a theater round out the quaint area. The actual apartment was quite spacious as previously mentioned. We especially liked the balcony off the master bedroom with views of the river. Jeff was very quick to respond, especially when we misplaced the key and he promptly drove over and let us in. We would recommend this rental without reservation."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We have stayed here many times. The location is great. Walkable to several restaurants, bars, coffee shops and cute little locally owned downtown shops. Jeff is always quick to respond and easy to work with. The house is super clean and the beds are very comfortable. Just as pictured."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and really cool space! The pictures do not do this place justice. This place was much bigger than I expected and the layout is super cool and spacious.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,I felt at home and satisfie
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I felt welcomed. Jeff's father, Sam, was delightfully positive and we hit it off immediately. The view of the Mississippi River bridge was really great. I grew up in Burlington so my visit after a 30 year absence was pretty awesome. This place made my stay feel more like home versus the atmosphere of a motel hotel situation. We were able to cook for ourselves and catch Iowa Hawkeyes football game on the television. I will be back for sure."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our stay again!! Thanks so much
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"what a gem right by the Mississippi River. We were so comfortable. Jeff was an amazing host with many ideas of places to see! If you stay here, you must check out The Drake next door. That food is A+!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice space. Great host. The neighborhood has quite a bit of construction right now (7/23) and some is the locals outside after 10 did not make for a feel safe entry.
However the space was great, and the host made everything easy and comfortable. 5 stars!"

Jeff was very nice and responsive with texts sent back and forth, he even sent us text that the apartment was ready so could check in earlier than the 3pm time. We would most definitely stay there again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Jeff's place, it was super cute and very clean. It was also spacious and I loved the exposed brick walls. It's right downtown so there are quite a few restaurants and shops within walking distance. You can see the river from the little balcony which was cool.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed here before and will stay here again. The location is great. Walkable to all shops, restaurants and bars downtown. We also really enjoy sitting out in one of the 2 small balconies and watching the river flow by. Jeff is very accessible and accommodating. The unit is exactly as pictured and very clean. We stayed with our daughter, her husband and 2 small grandkids ( in sleeping bags) and we have more than enough space."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful house in a wonderful city! This home is HUGE for a downtown apartment. Having 3 bathrooms was one of the biggest perks on our girls weekend, as everyone had plenty of space to get ready.

The space is huge - it's 2 levels and it is gorgeous! Perfectly restored, the brick walls and beautiful ceilings are really cool, the beds were so comfy and everything was spotless!
Check in was simple, directions were very clear and Jeff called prior to our visit to touch base, his personal touch and flexibility were amazing!
We cant wait to come back this summer when we can sit on the patio, listen to nearby live music and relax with a beautiful view of the Mississippi river!"

We could see the Mississippi from the window which was nice.
The location was right off the freeway.
Only issue was one window was loose and it was very cold outside,but we did not notify Jeff about it."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed just one night. The apartment was so much more than a hotel for the night. Super comfy beds. The living room was comfortable. Loved having 2.5 bathrooms, 4 of us stayed. Nice downtown location and a view of the Mississippi."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay and while in or around Burlington. Everything that you may want or need is just a short distance away
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, very spacious living area and two separate bedrooms, each with own bathroom/shower upstairs. Two convenient reserved covered parking spaces across the street in a public garage. Very clear communication from Jeff on location and use of the unit. One caution for potential guests; access to second floor entry at rear of the building is via open grate steel stairway which might pose an accessibility for some; but was not one for us seniors. Would stay here again, location is perfect and only several blocks to great restaurants. Highly recommend The Good Restaurant!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, large apartment. The bedrooms are both the size of master bedrooms. Jeff was easy to work with and made sure our check in went smooth. The apartment is close to near by restaurants and a nice view of the river. We would definitely stay again."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a great place to stay! The downtown location has everything from restaurants and nightlife to quick freeway access. The two bedroom, two and a half bath was more than enough room for all four of us. Jeff is a super host!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazing place to stay. We liked it enough to stay again and Jeff was just as nice and clean as the first time. This is an amazing bang for your buck and doesn’t have a massive cleaning fee. It is one of the cleanest places we have stayed recently.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is awesome. The owners are super to work with. The area down by the river is really neat. Would recommend to all.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is literally the coolest place! It is so spatious and spread out that even with four people, there was plenty of room for everyone to have their own area. Its also right by the river so great views and great bars and restaurants within a 5 minute walk! Fun city was about a 5 minute car ride away. The bed was soooo comfortable too!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a huge and gorgeous space. You will have to climb some metal stairs to get to it, but if that’s OK, it is well worth it. It’s on two floors, with the bedrooms upstairs. It’s basically the size of a large two bedroom apartment, with plenty of class, amazing views, right next to a great restaurant. You can look out the master bedroom onto the bridge that crosses the Mississippi River."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As many of the other comments, we were amazed at the spacious rooms. The apartment was so comfortable and nicely appointed. Just a note that if stairs are difficult for you then this location will be challenging. There are two flights to the ""front"" door and another inside to the bedrooms. Other than stairs, we had a wonderful stay."

We were in town for a family wedding & took advantage of this beautiful location to enjoy happy hour at The Drake Restaurant, shopping at fun boutiques while staying downtown & even utilized the convenient store across the street a couple times! My favorite room was the kitchen, large enough for all of us to gather for morning coffee, meals & playing cards later in the evening. This apartment was fully equipped with both kitchen & bath necessities. I utilized the ironing board & iron as well & it even had two decks of playing cards which we had forgot to bring! Plenty of hot water while showering too!! Will definitely be back for another stay!! Thank You Jeff! You were a great host! Rosie Brueck Busta"

We wouldn't hesitate to return again and we highly recommend this place to all travelers."

The stairs might be a little much for older folks or those not accustomed or able to climb two flights, we didn’t find it a problem. The floor plan is set up nicely to be able to share the spaces and have some privacy and I loved the double en-suite masters! Full well stocked kitchen, large living room with comfy furnishings. Could not find a thing to complain about, right downtown, convenient to interstate, shopping and restaurants and a beautiful view of the river. Would love to stay again when in the area!"

The space felt private, we had our own door locks, etc. We stayed here with our 3 little kids and the bedroom setup could not have been more perfect. Youngest stayed in the dark green room, the bigs in the room with two twin beds, and we took the king.

Some really cute shops where we found a bunch of fun things and AMAZING restaurants. Hit The Som twice after Chris recommended it. We LOVED The Valley Monster for drinks. Such a funky town we plan on returning to with our families, hopefully this summer!"

Plenty of space for our group of five. The smart TV allowed us to have enjoyable nights in. All of the kitchen necessities for us to cook several meals. Great local restaurants that you shouldn't miss - The Som (for delicious appetizers) and Good Restaurant (for a nice dinner). Many cute local shops and boutiques. Really enjoyed the Bean Counter Coffee shop. We would definitely return and stay again at Christopher's place in the future.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The house was easy to find and the neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful! I loved the original woodwork on the main floor and unique look of the kitchen! We loved the charm of the house! The house had everything we needed for our stay and everything was easy to find. (We didn’t cook while we were there so can’t speak for pots and pans, but all the other necessities were available.)
One thing I overlooked in the listing is that there’s no central air, but there are window AC units in two of the bedrooms and one on the main floor. There’s also plenty of windows to get a good breeze through the first and second floor. Also a testament to how quiet the neighborhood was, we had the windows open each night and never had outside noise wake us.
Overall we enjoyed our stay and will keep it on the list for future visits!"

Especially loved the retro original kitchen in this beautifully decorated home. Great stay!
2023-05-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Deb was great - she is a fantastic host! The house needs work, it's definitely showing its age. Be prepared for the old house when you book, especially the Midwest musty basement smell and creaky stairs. I did have some cleanliness issues and there were not any cleaning supplies for guests to use (i.e. scrubbing the sink, wiping the counters, removing spiderwebs, etc) but all it all it was a lovely visit back home."

We had such a peaceful and relaxing stay. Highly recommend. Deb is an excellent host!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deb was wonderful! I accidentally locked myself out in the first 15 minutes of being there and she was there right away to let me in!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Deb’s Airbnb was absolutely perfect for our stay in Burlington.
Charming house in a quiet, convenient neighborhood. We appreciated the beautiful woodwork and the 1950’s kitchen. The house was very clean and nice amenities. We even enjoyed the sunrise on the Mississippi.
We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! The house was very roomy and very comfortable. The neighborhood was so nice with friendly neighbors walking dogs and their kids. Would recommend the place and would surely stay again. Thanks!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Deb's house is everything you'd want out of an Airbnb. great amenities, great location. wouldn't hesitate to stay there again"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Good stay in a nice neighborhood. Clean, great beds and water pressure. The house was easy to find and very comfortable.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a great house! Very charming house and the 1950s kitchen is fabulous! Very clean and Deb provided everything needed for a comfortable stay. We will definitely stay again when we are in town.
2022-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Overall it was a pretty nice stay, but we did have a couple hiccups at this Airbnb… When we walked in the front entrance, the room smelled like urine (only in the front entrance though). The kitchen tap water didn’t taste good/clean, and lastly, when we came out of the house in the morning we noticed that someone had tried to break into our car with a crowbar. So now there’s damage to our car that we’ll need to get fixed. All in all, it wasn’t the best end to our wedding weekend. On the bright side, the house was clean, yard was up-kept, the entry and exit instructions were clear, and the host’s communication was good."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Great house in a cute neighborhood. We'll stay again next time we're in Burlington.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely home in a very nice neighborhood!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Deb’s place worked very well for our stay. Classic Iowa home and kitchen. The air conditioning was nice during warm weather, and place was clean. Deb was very helpful and even assisted in locating another Airbnb when we required an extension of our stay- thank you, Deb! She is a great host."
2022-05-01,3,Stayed about a week,"Deb was a very kind host and willing to answer the many questions I had. However, we had a few complaints. Unfortunately, the house was not as clean as I expected. Scheduling conflicts interfered with her customary cleaning between guests and that's understandable, but there were areas that looked like they hadn't been cleaned in weeks. The bathroom sink, the shower, the ceiling fans, etc. We also had to wash all the dishes before using them because they were not cleaned well.
One thing I wish I'd paid attention to before booking was that the upstairs bathroom is carpeted. We didn't see a bath mat, so we folded a towel to put on the floor. The toilet in the basement is in a crude wooden stall sort of thing with little privacy and a sink all the way on the other side of the room (we only found the sink later when we did laundry). Only one of us felt comfortable using that toilet.
Otherwise, it was a very cute house in a very nice neighborhood. A friendly neighbor across the street gave me some tips on places to go. The river is very close and you can see it if you go down the street! But be wary of mosquitoes if you walk in the evening - bring bug spray!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Deb was a great host. The house was exactly what we expected…clean, comfortable, and close to the soccer fields. We’d definitely stay again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved this charming homey little place. I would have liked to dismantle the kitchen and bring it home with us. Thank you Deb!
2022-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Cozy home that worked great for a work trip. Good sized yard and nice neighborhood for dog walks. Nice water pressure and comfy mattress.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I usually stay with family when I visit but decided to get my own space for this most recent trip.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay, Beautifully decorated and comfortable to spend my time there while I was in town. I would rent it again definitely"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Fleetwood Inn is a perfect place for photos! Which is what I used it for. I did not stay over but the bed is a soft foam mattress and felt cozy. The home is quaint and decorated nicely and would be perfect for a couple’s getaway or a place to have a get together with board games and record player and also karaoke and books to read. The neighborhood is safe and near a park and down the road from restaurants and grocery store. It was clean and smelled nice. Tabetha was very responsive and let me check in early which I really appreciated! Price is also very fair! 10/10 recommend!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I loved our stay at the Fleetwood Bungalow! The entire place made us feel right at home and the decor was top-notch.

2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Place was cute and clean, however the listing was unclear concerning all fees. Host turned a minor misunderstanding into an Airbnb dispute that resolved in our favor."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was great! The decor was beautiful and along with all the little extras to keep us busy it was a very peaceful stay. My kids loved the karaoke machine, record player, board games, and coloring book. The house was very clean and the host was very clear with her instructions. The only complaint is I wish there was more sleeping space. The daybed on the porch was a bit chilly for December so our 2 kids slept on the couch and the air mattress. We knew this from the description before booking and it worked just fine for us, just wish there could somehow be a little more space! :) Thanks for the great stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place. Beautifully decorated. Listing was very accurate. Great vibe im the house. Very clean. Quiet neighborhood. Loved all the little details.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Clear that a lot of thought and time was put into this property. Also pretty evident it was a labor of love. The detail was impeccable!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I have an Airbnb and I was very inspired for how well Tabetha put the house together.
Probably the coziest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. Will come back next trip to the area for sure."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the perfect location for a little boho getaway!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We very much enjoyed our stay. Comfy surroundings. We felt right at home.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay! Our third time and we love it!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We chose Fleetwood Inn for our combined anniversary trip and writing retreat. Our decision was based on location, price, and the fact that it had an actual dedicated workspace, unlike some listings that claim this and you have a dining table and hard wooden chair. This place had 2 desks, making it perfect.
The space was so comfortable, making it possible to get good rest and stay productive. The living room was nice and cozy with lamps and throws. The desks were great, with comfortable chairs. I loved the fully furnished kitchen, making it easy to cook on our extended stay.
A day or so after we arrived, Tabetha checked in with us via text to see if all was well.
Thank you for giving us a comfortable space to (almost) finish our books!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Nice, comfortable, and very affordable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,such a relaxing place as always🩶
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Second year coming to Fleetwood Inn! Overall it’s a beautiful place and we will be back.
Only issues this time was dishes were left wet and stacked in the cupboards. My husband and I didn’t want it to come back on us so we took care of it.
Air fryer was dirty.
Kitchen trash was not taken out when we arrived.
Everything else was just like last year and it was a great night!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay at the Fleetwood Inn! Absolutely everything went smoothly from start to finish. The home is so quaint with its original floors and built-ins, but it also has the benefit of some amazing decorating. I felt like I was back in the 70s with the (somewhat) hippy decor and a functional turntable! I grew up in the area and have lots of family nearby, so it was nice to be able to host my siblings for some wonderful late-night talks around the intimate dining table.
I would definitely stay at the Fleetwood Inn again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Fleetwood Inn was the perfect choice for us! We needed a place that allowed pets, and we needed it conveniently located for our grandsons 2nd birthday. This one definitely fit the ticket!! Clean, cute and comfortable… We will absolutely be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay while visiting family, definitely a great place to stay with a fun vibe!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home with a very warm vibe. We stayed with our teenage daughter. the house with the perfect size and looked just like the pictures. You can tell they took time decorating and it all gives a very warm and peaceful atmosphere. The neighborhood was quiet and the beds were comfortable. Everything was extremely clean and well taken care of. We would definitely stay here again honestly, we will go out of our way to stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This is definitely a little hidden gem and worked out perfectly for our family of 3. The place is clean and stocked with literally everything and anything you need. The pictures match exactly with what you see when you get inside. Tabetha was extremely responsive and helpful. We'll be back next time we're in town and needing a place to stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place to stay! I can’t comment on her responsiveness as a host, as we only stayed for 1 night and were gone most of the time so we didn’t need anything. However, she sent instructions early. House was very clean & so so cozy. Highly recommend staying here as opposed to a hotel if staying in the Burlington area!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute and clean space. Bed was comfortable, and the space had everything I needed for my stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Fleetwood Inn was clean, cozy and comfortable. It was a great place to return to at the end of each day."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed here many times and it is like home away from home
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Deb was easy to work with and the house suited our needs.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was quaint and decent. Definitely well worth the cost. I appreciated everything provided and got some decent rest there.
The only two things I would suggest is, a very thorough and deep cleaning and provide a password for the Netflix that was sa8d to be included
All I'm all, this place was thoroughly appreciated."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third or fourth stay and alway comfortable, quiet, and everything we need."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great stay and nice area.
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The home was in a very quiet neighborhood. Great location as it was a quick drive to really anything you would need. The biggest issue was cleanliness. There was poo found in both bedrooms. The home had a musty smell that was easily covered with lit candles. The bathroom needs a cleaning before use. Urine was on the toilet seat, hair in the tub, and shower walls. built up soap scum between shower doors. Accumulated dust and dirt above the shower mirror as well as in the kitchen. Kitchen counters were visibly dirty and, again, a great amount of dust above the stove. This home has great potential. However, a very much needed deep clean would go a long way."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay. I recommend staying here.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place for staying, especially with pets. Deb was quick to answer my questions. comfortable beds, great sofa and loveseat."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Third stay here, it never disappoints and Deb is a great host"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed for the weekend. The place worked out great for sleeping and giving a place for the dog to run around in back. Small, quaint house. Stocked bathroom with plenty of towels, shampoo, & soap. Missing Kleenex and Tupperware was about the only complaint we had."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,cozy little house with a great back yard
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We needed a place to stay while visiting relatives. We needed a place to take our dogs and that was quiet. Deb's place is wonderful!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed last minute in early Dec. Unfortunately due to unexpected events we were only able to stay one night vs the two we had planned. Deb was very accommodating and worked with us on arrival time. We travel with our dogs and having the big fenced in yard was a huge win. The house layout is as pictured. Its a lovely small clean updated home in a quiet residential area. Casino and restaurants just a few minutes drive. Easy to access with private parking.
Beds were firm but not too bad.
If your looking to visit the area and have pets, this is the place. Value can't be beat."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was welcoming and exactly what we needed with a child and a dog traveling along. The house was comfortable and cozy. Deb was responsive right away as well. If I find myself back in the Burlington area, I will stay here again."

2022-09-01,3,Stayed with kids,"This is a nice quiet neighborhood and the place has the potential to feel like home away from home.
The home could be stocked better so make sure you bring everything you think you will need. I did let the host know, so I expect that to be improved as she seems to be a nice and responsive person.
Deb is commutative and quick to respond. It was easy to find the place and to get into with the instructions she provided."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very nice and clean. Check in was easy but for some reason had to put the key code in twice to un lock every time other than that very easy entry. Beds were very comfy .
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay and may consider staying again around Christmas time. We have family we come to visit yearly and this home worked out great for our large family with children. They absolutely loved all the closets to play hide and seek and build their forts in.

2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful host! Extremely responsive and very welcoming. Exceeded my expectations every step of the way. Well maintained and beautiful home!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a pleasant stay at this Airbnb property. It's ideally located, just as described, offering ample space for our family and a few guests. The host's communication was clear, and accessing the property was easy.
However, there's room for improvement. The outside area needs better maintenance; leaves were piled up so high that it led to a slip on the front stairs. Inside, the kitchen had grease stains on the wall and a dirty stove. Attempting to clean it didn't help much. One of the upstairs bedrooms had dead bugs on the window sill, highlighting cleanliness issues.
In summary, we enjoyed our stay, thanks to the location, space, and clear communication. Yet, addressing cleanliness and outside upkeep is essential for future guests to fully enjoy their stay."

The bedrooms were spacious with closets for all of our belongings. Nice patio in the back with grill. This was a great choice for my family members to meet in our home town coming from multiple locations including Florida and Wisconsin. This was our first time to rent a home on AirBnB or anywhere, the experience was so right on we would rent this house again, and use AirBnB again."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Thank you Mathew!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family enjoyed our stay at this beautiful home. It was very comfortable for a larger family. The host is helpful and responsive. The home has all the charm of an older home and the comforts and cleanliness of a new place.

2023-06-01,4,Group trip,"House was very cute and clean. There was enough parking on the street for the amount of cars we had. Only thing we ran into was we were 10 minutes early to check in and had to wait outside until exactly 3 to get in, but Matthew was very good at getting back to me when I messaged him. Checkout was very simple and easy. I would recommend this house for others to stay for sure."

Katrina was understanding and accommodating for our unusual checkin and checkout times. We all felt right at home, including the four-legged member of our party who was welcomed with treats and special towels for wiping the paws. A happy surprise was that Katrina’s home brings the antiquing to you - it is furnished and decorated with antiques and other do-dads that are for sale! So clever!"

The street only parking. Polk street is VERY rough. I know Katrina has no control over this so I didn’t ding her review - I just wanted to mention it for future visitors. 2 The ice maker in the fridge doesn’t work so it would have been nice to have trays available to make ice.
We really enjoyed our stay! Thank you, Katrina."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Katrina’s Airbnb in Burlington, Iowa, and I cannot express enough how fantastic my experience was. From start to finish, everything about this accommodation was exceptional.
First and foremost, the location was perfect. Situated right by the majestic Mississippi River, the view from the property was nothing short of picturesque.
Cleanliness is always a top priority for me, and I was thrilled to find that this property exceeded my expectations.
Katrina was attentive, responsive, and always ready to assist with any queries or concerns. Her hospitality was unmatched, and it made me feel like a valued guest throughout my time there.
Overall, I cannot recommend this Airbnb enough. If you're planning a trip to Burlington, Iowa, and want a remarkable experience with a stunning view of the mighty Mississippi River, look no further."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay which says a lot, and we'll be staying there again on our next trip to Burlington. It's a beautiful location high on a bluff overlooking a curve in the Mississippi river. Very quiet street and safe parking. We didn't get to meet Katrina in our first stay last July, but had some great discussions with her on this stay. She is totally committed to her properties and maintaining them as they should be in a historic district. There was one little issue with the innards of the toilet tank. Katrina responded extremely quickly with getting it fixed."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,loved the house and would come back again!

Would absolutely stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very enjoyable peaceful area and place to be in
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My sister and I stayed here when we came into town for a family funeral, and it was perfect for us! Some of our extended family came over for an afternoon, and there's ample space for seating and entertaining. The kitchen is stocked with all the basics, and there's tons of towels and blankets for your use. It was also wonderful having a washer and dryer!
We had a baby and a young child with us, and Katrina was really helpful in figuring out arrangements for our kids. She provided a pack and play for the baby to sleep in, there were outlet covers for most outlets, and cabinets with cleaning supplies had child latches on them. There's also a baby gate for your use.
Things to keep in mind with kids - the unit is heated by radiators, so make sure your kids will stay away from those. There are also two stairwells, one of which can't be blocked easily. Neither of these were problems for us, but for children of certain ages they might be. Overall great experience, I would 100% stay again!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I had a relaxing weekend watching movies and shopping. Katrina made us feel welcome the moment we booked the apartment. It was spotless, quiet, and located near the river. The best part was the tree right outside of the living room window which held a big bird's nest. I can only imagine how wonderful it is to sit and watch the birds in the Spring and Summer. We also had a great view to the river as well. It was a perfect weekend. I highly encourage you to spend a weekend or more at Katrina's."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment was great for a quick trip to Burlington for a downtown wedding. Check in was easy and the location was great.

It’s at the end of a dead end street so it’s peaceful and quiet. The scenery was magnificent. I highly recommend this place. iit has everything you need just bring your toothbrush, relax and enjoy your stay whether it’s for business or pleasure, I guarantee you will be pleased as I was."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"115 Polk is a great space that is exactly as pictured on the Airbnb website. It has the charm of an old home in a very historic area of Burlington, surrounded by some stately homes that are on the bluff overlooking the Mississippi. The space is well appointed for everything you might need for a stay. Very clean, pleasant and quiet. The view of the river bend and downtown Burlington from atop the bluff is pretty cool. Some others mentioned the brick street as being a bit uneven- which is very typical for a historic area. Just be cautious as you load and unload your car. Not a hindrance for us at all. The street is low traffic since it takes you to the bluff overlooking the river. You can take your time as you arrive/depart. We have a family farm in the area and this will be our first choice place to stay. Great value for what the per night fee was.
As someone that grew up in that area I really appreciated being able to explore. Just a block away is the childhood home of Aldo Leopold, noted naturalist, philosopher and writer that wrote the pivotal book, ""Sand County Almanac."" If you don't know about Aldo you should!! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldo_Leopold Thanks to Katrina, we'll be back! Jerry & Tim"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved out stay! We took several walks through the neighborhood looking at all of the old house. We would walk out to the end of the street each night to watch the sunset over the Mississippi. Just beautiful! The upstairs apartment was perfect for our needs. It is very nicely laid out and very clean. I got a good workout each day going up and down the stairs to wash clothes for the 6 of us though 🙂. Katrina was great with communicating with us and very accommodating when we had to make a date change for our stay. We highly recommend it!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,We had a nice time staying. We enjoyed the vintage feel with modern touches. Groovy place for sure!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"rina's place is beautiful, emasculateand in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood. Everything was fantastic.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katrina was a fabulous host! We checked in at about 2:30 in the morning and she had zero issue accommodating this.
This apartment was absolutely perfect! The beds are comfy, the location convenient, and the view phenomenal! Plenty of blankets are provided and there are so many little touches that make it so homey!
It is very easy to find. The water pressure is fantastic and the hot water doesn’t run out quickly.
The night we arrived it was about 6 degrees outside and the heater had zero trouble keeping up!
I love that pets are welcome (though we did not bring ours)."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My mom and I decided to go on a last minute date night and Katrina’s place was still available to reserve at 10am on a Saturday! Katrina was prompt with communication and answered a few questions I had.
Pros: The price is a great value when compared to the hotels in the area. The apartment was clean and had plenty of room.
Cons-ish:The location was somewhat out of the way but it was close enough to get to everything within 10-15 minutes, so not too bad. The bed was a little stiff but it didn’t ruin my sleep. For those who need assistance walking, the brick road is uneven and there are quite a few stairs to get to the apartment. This didn’t impact us but thought I’d include it for those it might.
Overall, a great find & I highly recommend."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great property. As advertised. Very cooperative and supportive host! We will return.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Katrina's place was absolute delightful! We were in town for a wedding and it was the perfect place to relax in between events. Would stay here again next time I am in Burlington!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Expect a very nice, clean, comfortable and unique place. Nifty old Victorian homes, nice view of the Ole Miss and a great host P.S. also a great value!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Wow-what a great place and great host. Beds and all the extra blankets were awesome and comfortable. I was staying there for several weeks-loved the living room & laundry room. Awesome vibe!!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can’t say enough about this place! First and most important, I have three dogs. No one accepts three dogs, so I was so excited when she said yes! For a place that is so pet friendly, I didn’t expect it to be so nice. The pictures do not do it justice. As soon as I walked in, I wished it was my permanent home! It’s HUGE! They provided a pet waste station right outside of the door which is super convenient, there is free in-unit laundry, and the kitchen has everything you need. I wish I was there for more than hunting because I loved the neighborhood and would have really liked to just walk around and look at everything. You can see the River from the living room and it’s just amazing. I ran into Katrina when I was letting my dogs out and she is extremely friendly! I slept comfortably every night and had zero issues. Definitely recommend this place!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katrina's place is fantastic. Great location and wonderful view of the Mississippi. It's stylishly decorated, comfortable, and a great example of a really well-kept old Burlington home in a historic part of town. We found the space perfect for what we needed -- close to family and friends and enough room for our cats to romp around without getting stir-crazy like they would in a hotel. Katrina is friendly, responsive, easygoing and flexible.
The only downside has nothing at all to do with the property -- it's that the street is really old brick, with an uneven curb. It's definitely not for anyone who's unsteady on their feet, but the fact that it's clearly described as being on the second floor will probably weed out most folks who would have issues. We would absolutely stay here again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Would definitely recommend this BnB to anyone coming into Burlington. It’s so close to downtown, and right off the river. Quiet neighborhood and Kat is great with communication. It made my time back home much more enjoyable!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Katrina’s place was adorable and very clean. She promptly responded to all my questions. I highly recommend her place!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A lovely place in a beautiful neighborhood. Wish we could have stayed longer!
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Katrina’s space was great! Particularly of note was the massive desk to get some work done, stylish accents in the living room, and adorable brick road leading up to the house. We were coming through on a road trip and found it a nice and easy place to relax for a few days."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Do not hesitate to book this very cute upper level apartment. It’s in a super quiet part of town with lovely views of the gorgeous Mississippi river just a few steps up the street. Travel over one block and you’ll see a large boulder commemorating Burlington as the birth place of Aldo Leopold. The architecture of the houses and in the downtown area including Snake Alley will transport you to another era of US history. You must also check out the downtown restaurant GoodmorningGoodnight. There are lots of hidden gems in this town and Katrina’s place is a wonderful place to have as a base camp for exploring or just to unwind and catch your breath. Two separate bedrooms and two comfy couches / futons provided the landing spots while the small but very functional bathroom helped us remove the grime from the road. This apartment was incredibly clean and nicely decorated and allowed us to unwind after a long car trip. We were able to make a simple dinner in the tidy kitchen and then our morning coffee the following day. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Nice home, great neighborhood."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the most pleasant Airbnb units I've ever stayed in. The unit is large, homey, comfortable, and thoughtfully well-appointed. It's located in a nice, very quiet area situated on a bluff above the Mississippi River. Check in was a breeze. The many windows fill the unit with light (although the blinds in the bedrooms shut out the light for sleeping in). Speaking of sleeping -- unlike some Airbnb places, the bed I slept in was extraordinarily comfortable. There's also a large, well-stocked kitchen with a gas stove and a large refrigerator. Compared to the sterile hotel rooms I usually stay in when visiting Burlington, Katrina's place is a real gem, and a bargain as well. Very highly recommended."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Katrina’s. Super clean and comfortable. Our 10 month grand baby loved the so. I ottoman. The street was very quiet and we loved the view of the river.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most personal, beautiful space. The owner has decorated so beautifully, including so many personal touches. Close to downtown and the river, but you may just want to stay in, such a wonderful home away from home."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great vacation. The locals were warm and welcoming.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend Brandy's. We appreciated her clear instructions on entry/exit (often a problem with other Bnb's). The place was spotless. Had the historic charm of exposed brick wall, large windows, and refinished hardwood floors coupled with the convenience of modern bathroom and kitchen, and comfy bed. We were visiting our home town. We loved being by the river and within walking distance of downtown, where we ate several yummy meals."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the best place to stay in Burlington. It’s beautifully decorated, clean, and homey. I would highly recommend Brandy’s place to anyone staying in Burlington."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about this stay! HIGHLY recommend! Incredibly cozy, peaceful, and had everything you would need! We have stayed in many Airbnb spots, but this is by far our favorite! Will be back!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a super short stay and can only speak to the surface of the overall experience. The Loft is every bit as engaging and bohemian-chic as the pictures claim to be.
Downtown Burlington is being revitalized—once the progress makes its way to Brandy’s building, there won’t be a single thing to not love about the area.
We’ll definitely be coming back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brandy is a great host and always the most accommodating. The loft is beautiful and comfortable.. I look forward to staying with her again soon!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a beautiful place to stay and get away for an evening! I wish we could have stayed longer… Highly recommend staying here.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at the Peacock Loft! Sadly, we were just in town for an evening so we didn't get to spend a lot of time in the space and enjoy it to its fullest potential but it was still wonderful. The space is decorated so beautifully...so fun and artsy! The loft was plenty big for the two of us and had lots of space to relax. The location is downtown near lots of restaurants, shops, etc. Brandy was very responsive to messages and just an all around wonderful host! We will definitely be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft is amazing! it has endless points of interest and personality to the max. I loved all the details, details are important. I slept really well and 100% will be staying here again on several occasions"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,A great hidden gem in Burlington. Comfortable and matched description perfectly.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the only AirBnB we've ever stayed at more than once. We came across it in August and loved it so when we had the chance to use it again we booked it.
When we walked in both my husband and I sighed and said ""ah, home"" lol we immediately looked at each other and laughed because it was WEIRD. But this place has so much character and such a comforting vibe it felt like it was made for us.
We will probably be back again- scratch that, we WILL be!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brandy created such a beautiful, peaceful atmosphere with this space! Will definitely be returning!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute spot for a night away.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place blew my mind! I guess I didn’t really pay too much attention into what it looked like as I just read the reviews and knew it’d be good…but seeing it in person was just.. wow!! This Airbnb checks all the boxes…. Location was great, spacious, super clean, decorated and styled up amazingly… it was funky, fresh, and creative. The shower had perfect water pressure… the kitchen had everything that one would need..and the recommendations of nearby sports were great. I’d definitely go back !"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cool space and so comfortable 💗
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Second time staying here this year, as my parents live in town. Access was easy and other than the trains, it's extremely quiet. My wife came with me this time and loved all of the design elements and we both felt at home, as we worked from here for a few days. Would stay again if still available when we need to go back next year. Thanks!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,By far one of my top Airbnb stays so far! The loft was stunning and unique! You can definitely tell it was beautifully decorated be an artist. I also loved all of the personal touches within the home.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a gorgeous loft with everything you could ever need! The couches are some of the most comfortable that I've ever had the pleasure of snuggling in--perfect for reading for hours. You'll be so happy you stayed here.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place is beautiful and amazing to disconnect for a couple of days.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We’d considered staying at a hotel but this was the same price or less and so much nicer. Beautiful loft, loved the way it was decorated. Close to downtown, which was s where we were attending an event. Would definitely recommend to others"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was wonderful and very clean we enjoyed our stay at the peacock loft.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give it 10 stars I would— I kept saying “I wish I lived here!” So clean, she was honest about everything, and the whole loft was an experience in itself. Truly a diamond in the rough."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 3rd stay at the Peacock Loft, and we're already looking forward to our next stay. As always, the place was immaculate, already nice and toasty warm, with all of the special little touches scattered about that the Peacock is known for. Leading up to our stay Brandy communicated and checked in on us.
We have come to absolutely LOVE the peacock, and always a must when we visit Burlington. Thank you again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The peacock loft is beyond amazing and so is Brandy!! Cozy and eclectic with the best style and amenities. 1,000% recommend booking here!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Pretty view of the water and the inside of the apartment is very cute. Love the kitchen and the high ceilings. The bed was fantastic! I have a very expensive bed and I liked this bed more than my own at home. The bathroom is cute too and the overall vibe of the loft is nice. Only downside is the neighbors place looks a little rough.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute space, well worth the price."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the loft. Beautifully decorated! Very clean. The stairs were the only thing that was a challenge. Understandable since it was a loft. I would definitely stay again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The aesthetic of this loft is a dream and the natural sunlight makes it that more beautiful! My husband and I stayed at the Peacock loft overnight after a friends wedding at the Barn in Fairview Acres which was only about 15-20 minutes away. The loft was easy to find with very detailed instructions on how to enter, where to park as well as what to do when checking out. Brandy made our first Airbnb experience really great and if we ever find ourselves in Burlington, Iowa again we know where we will be staying!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay here & visit to Burlington. First time was totally random, it looked like a cool, thoughtful AirBnB & worked beautifully en route a cross-country drive. It so exceeded our expectations, we decided to return to relax & spend more time in this interesting town along the Mississippi River. We ate two delicious meals at The Som & The Hawaiiowan Cafe. Brandy, the host is also a photographer, & we arrange a little mini-shoot with her too. It is a beautiful space & quiet, old town that we find interesting… check it out."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First and foremost, we absolutely loved it! The peacock theme was not only unique but also stunning. It added a special touch to our experience, making our stay memorable. The attention to detail and cleanliness did not go unnoticed. We truly appreciated the care you put into maintaining your space. My friends and I had such a fantastic time staying here! Having family in Burlington, I made sure to let them all know of this location so that they can experience the property themselves when visiting from out of town. Thank you so much"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous place. I'd love to live there.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing little hidden gem
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant- so relaxed in this luxurious place for spoiling yourself, wish we could stay longer! Maybe the next time."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at a charming Boho loft-style Airbnb the peacock loft in Burlington, Iowa, and it was an absolute delight. From the moment we stepped through the door, we were captivated by the unique blend of Bohemian and industrial design elements that created a warm and inviting atmosphere.
The loft was impeccably clean and beautifully decorated, with an abundance of plants, eclectic artwork, and cozy textiles that gave it a distinct Boho vibe. The open-concept layout made the space feel incredibly spacious, and the large windows allowed for plenty of natural light to flood in.
The bedroom was a true haven of relaxation, with a comfortable queen-size bed adorned with plush linens and an array of colorful throw pillows. The combination of exposed brick walls and dreamy light fixtures created a cozy and dreamy ambiance that made it hard to leave each morning. Our stay was such a delightful and memorable experience!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place! Came for a staycation and extended the stay an extra night because we enjoyed the space so much! Very much recommend!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had the best time at The Peacock Loft. It was perfectly our style, it almost felt like home coming back from dinner.
The couch was so extremely comfy, the decor was perfection, it is a beautiful place."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I had a great time at this airbnb!! Such a unique setting. The design is gorgeous and the host made me feel welcome. It was close enough to town that most things were only a couple minutes drive. The only downside was the noise at night; the building doesn’t cancel it out much. I turned on white noise and problem solved. I would love to stay here again & would recommend this location to friends!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"seriously, the place and the stay was amazing. It was a first date face to face with the girl I've been talking to and I don't think I could have picked a better location. It was very warm and homey. we were in awe at the location. we will definitely be coming back. Brandy is awesome!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brandy was very responsive and the instructions were clear. Great space for working while in town and then going over to see my parents. Liked being on second floor and the digital locks/easy access. Lots of windows and very well decorated with everything you need. No issues whatsoever; neighborhood is a mix of commercial and residential and perhaps not the best but I felt safe and comfortable. Would stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Simply gorgeous! We will be back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was exactly how the pictures looked if not better. It was so comfortable and peaceful, I wish I’d booked it for the entire weekend. I’ve been to a few great Airbnb’s and this is one of those where I could tell how much thought was put into every detail. Bravo Brandy, thank you, and happy Airbnbing!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great space and well worth the price if you're gonna visit burlington, then this is the place to stay. the only complaint I had was my wife said it was on Main St, which it technically was, but I would he hesitant to walk as it would he quite a trek and the neighborhood was rough albeit your on the edge so it's only a couple minute drive to Jefferson St."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Had an excellent visit to the Loft. Enjoyed a relaxing afternoon cocktail while listening to the record player. Will definitely visit this place again.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The loft space is one of the best AirBnb spaces I have stayed in. Beautifully designed. An absolute gem. Don't be concerned about how the neighborhood looks right now. It seems the area is going through some renovation. Also enjoyed exploring the town. Do give yourselves ample time to explore the loft space.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brandy’s loft is a gorgeous little place that is full of character. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there, and I would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,such a relaxing experience 🥰

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Peacock Loft felt like a one night vacation! the space is decorated fabulously - so cool and boho and chic. the couches were perfect for lounging and catching up with friends.
we didn't use the kitchen or shower but both looked lovely.
definitely a ""magazine worthy"" apartment.
super quiet space- never heard a sound.
a quick drive to restaurants (or a 15ish minute walk).
love Brandy's other space (a little further out of town) and absolutely love this space too.
we will DEFINITELY be back"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Listing is as described and a great space to stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brandy's studio was above and beyond our expectations. My daughter and I were in town for the Burlington Iowa Snake Run bike race.
The decor was absolutely awesome, the communication was spectacular. She thought of everything. She left very clear and concise instructions.
If you are ever in Burlington Iowa or just want to visit don't miss the opportunity to stay here.
Thank you again."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brandi’s place is *absolutely* charming. Eclectic & cozy with fun amenities like games, books of all kinds, and record player made for a fun long weekend away. She was responsive to my questions and flexible on check-in/check-out to meet our needs. Neighborhood is less than desirable and the railroad noise can keep you up a little later than you’d like, but overall, her place makes up for it and we would definitely be back in the future if we’re ever back in Burlington! Thanks, Brandy! 🦚 🩵"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Peacock Loft is so welcoming, comfortable, and relaxing. Loved the local shops and fabulous restaurants (thanks to brandy’s recommendations), but loft is so amazing also loved just staying in. Will diffidently be back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’ve never been to an AirBnb quite like Brandy’s. Every detail was considered from decor, to toiletries, to instructions. Great experience and I’m excited to re-book next time I’m in town."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the best stays I’ve had with AirBnb, and truly would stay again! If you are looking for a really cool place, and a comfortable place, this space is absolutely for you."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Love love love this space! The decor inspired my artistic side and the boho vibe made me feel right at home! This will be a top choice for the next time we visit B-town! Brandy’s place truly has everything you need plus all the things you didn’t know you needed. Thank you for a fabulous stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved this loft space! Super decorated and bright with all the colors and decorations to look at. Super clean and fun. Definitely will be back in the future.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brandy’s space is a destination in and of itself. The layout, thoughtful decor and details left something to discover throughout our entire stay. Whether you are seeking a space to reflect and create or desiring a relaxing and cozy experience, it is all of these."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We fell in love with this creative loft space. I think we could stay a week and still not see all the interesting items in the apartment. Fun and funky, yet also comfortable and romantic. And the bulletin board with suggestions for places to go in town was super helpful. We will definitely be back. It’s worth a trip to Burlington just for this pad. I’m not kidding."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best, if not the best, I’ve ever stayed in. My only complaint is that now I need to redecorate my entire house based off of this one!! So comfy. So unique. Everything was thought of in advance and it was so nice to unplug here for the weekend. Will be back :)"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved The Peacock Loft, such an eclectic place, it was a wonderful place for Valentine's Date with my husband :-) We had so much fun with the props, the record player, the books, the games, etc. It was cozy, nicely decorated, and very comfortable. We'll definitely come back! Thanks!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There are no words to describe how great and eclectic the Peacock Loft is!! Have stayed here two different times, and it will be my ""go to"" spot to stay when visiting Burlington. Brandy is an amazing host - clear communications, instructions, very responsive and friendly. There are so many great details in the loft that make you feel right at home - photos, games, decor, etc. The Peacock Loft is a destination in and of itself!! Highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brandys loft is definitely a place for an artist. It was a great space for my photo sessions! I would definitely use again in the future.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,I’ve been to this loft before as a guest and knew I wanted to stay myself. This loft is gorgeous and has everything you need. Vacuum and cleaning supplies were easy to find and it’s so cozy. Thanks for having us Brandy!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time we've booked the Peacock- once again it completely exceeded our expectations. From Brandy's impeccable, genuine communication, the cleanliness, all the way to the perfect little touches sprinkled throughout - with great updates to the decor since the last time we visited. There is so much thought put into making the most out of your stay in Burlington. It showcases everything that makes this town so great. Thank you Peacock- we will be back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We will absolutely be staying here again!!! Brandy has created a maximalist dream loft.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The Peacock Loft was beautiful and comfortable! We would highly recommend staying here!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks again! We loved staying at your place - it was beautiful and had everything we could have needed.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely get away before the holiday season! Will be coming back!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Peacock Loft was an incredible place to spend time reflecting on 2022 and business planning for 2023! I needed a space that felt creative, spacious, peaceful, and comfortable to sleep and The Peacock Loft checked all the boxes!
As someone who likes to play with photography and fashion, it was fun to take breaks on work to “play”. I especially enjoyed all the coats that can be used as props. Don’t worry about time of day or lighting. The Peacock Loft as great picture worthy vibes morning, noon, and night!
I also loved all of the extras including the record player and books. Jamming out to some chill music or lounging on the big comfy couch with an inspiring book was just what I needed.
I took a few of Brandy’s recommendations and checked out some shops. I loved Original Cyns and Beancounter Coffee. I had brought my own meals as I eat AIP/Paleo (gluten, dairy, grain free) but I’m positive I could have gotten a fresh clean meal close by. Definitely will continue to come back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous apartment in a convenient location. My husband and I rented this place for the Thanksgiving holiday and we will be back! No complaints, we really enjoyed our stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love Love Loved it here! The Peacock did not disappoint! 100% recommend!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute place to get away for a weekend. The location downtown made everything pretty much walkable. Loved having a stocked kitchen(cooking utensils) among other amenities!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing loft, artsy and yet cozy and warm. Perfect for hanging out and feeling relaxed as well as inspired. The town of Burlington is in the process of transformation and desperately needs revitalization.
The area where the loft is located felt old and tired and in much need of some care and vibrancy. The feeling is that the residents accept the decline and can’t find a way to fight back and regain their community.
We never felt unsafe, but the loft was definitely an unexpected gem in the middle of a neighborhood in decline. But we took a chance and loved it. The downtown area had little stores, coffee shops, restaurants and an art center, plenty to check out on a weekend. All the places we ate were great.
Overall we had an awesome time and we hope that the Peacock Loft is part of a renaissance for this town of long history."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at Brandi’s loft was fantastic! It was open, clean, the design was amazing, and there were so many amenities. We will definitely be back to stay when we want an overnight in Burlington. The bed is incredibly comfy and so is the couch.
A few things to note:
- the stairs are steep and there is a bit of an angle at the top
- our dogs did okay but you do need to go slow
- I found it easier to leave the top door open when we went out for quick bathroom breaks so they didn’t lose momentum as the landing is on the smaller side
- it was raining so they did get a little slippery, but the railing is very sturdy
- there isn’t a ton of room for your dogs to easily go to the bathroom right outside the door, but we just walked across the street and up for less than 5 minutes to the park
- the street is used/can be busy but not “city” busy
- there is roadwork happening so it can be sort of loud if you’re a light sleeper, but we didn’t find any issues with this"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down the best AirBnb experience I’ve ever had! Check in was a breeze, communication was second to none. The Peacock Loft was even more beautiful and homey in real life, it was hard to leave! We will definitely be back!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brandy has really created a magical space here. The design and layout provide such a welcoming vibe that makes you instantly feel like you’re home. The subtle design nuances, as well as the larger design influences, make this an extremely fun place to be. Do yourself a favor, throw on some records, kick back and relax. If you’re an art and/or photography geek you’ll appreciate the inclusion of the books and general vibe created in this space. My wife and I had an amazing time and we really had a hard time leaving. Thanks so much for providing such an amazing place to stay!"

We really appreciated all the small details she put into the loft to make it truly feel like a home away from home. If your looking for a cute and cozy staycation, I highly recommend the peacock loft!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Peacock Loft was simply amazing! I haven’t been to Burlington (and SE Iowa in general) in many years so when I planned the trip I was surprised to see such a great place right in the center of Burlington.
The decor is really nice and there is SO much space! Brandy has lots of amenities in the place and there is a fun but comfortable vibe there. The pictures are very accurate and the location is really close to everything. Checking in and out was super easy and Brandy was very responsive. Wifi was very good, I had to connect my work laptop once for a video conference and it was perfect. And off-street parking was available.
Downtown Burlington has so many interesting local shops and restaurants (Weird Harold’s records, The Som, Bean Counter Coffee…) as well as a beautiful riverfront and Snake Alley! I was there early in the week but it appears more happens downtown Thursday-Saturday.
Highly recommend and can’t wait to return!!!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I absolutely LOVED the Peacock Loft!!! We had a few of my local, best friends over to hang out and we had a blast. We dressed up had so many great laughs. My girlfriend and I will back again when we come back to visit my hometown. We’ve stayed at other Airbnb’s that our friends have chose but this is our first Airbnb we’ve rented and it exceeded all the others we’ve ever been to. Even one’s down here in FL!!! 😁 The attention to detail was awesome, even down to the littlest things you may not think you need on your stay. Loved the vibes! The Peacock Loft knocked it out of the park!!! ♥️"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Peacock Loft is exactly why I am loving on AirBnBs so much right now… opportunities to get excited about & visit places that I would have never experienced. We made this stop part of our journey home to Virginia after eloping in Montana. The details of this gorgeous space are perfect. The neighborhood is a little gritty & up-and-coming with the Mississippi River in sight, as well as good restaurants & fun shops. Absolutely refreshing overnight while driving across the US."

The loft itself is clean, brick everywhere, filled with art and beautiful things to look at. The linens are soft and comforting. The design is gorgeous from the countertops to the faucets. Everything is perfectly positioned and easy to use.
The city of Burlington also offers fun places to go. And has an interesting history. There is a guide book in the loft that has lots of info about what to do and where to go.
This is a 5🌟 experience for sure!"

From the unique layout and decorative designs, down to all the little complimentary touches, such as toiletries if you forgot them. Brandy was easy to get ahold of as well if we had any questions. She even offered top places in town to go visit during your stay on a cute photo collage board. The location to downtown Burlington with the views of the Mississippi River is superb! If you are looking for a unique stay look nowhere else. Let's just say after our stay even my husband said we will no longer look anywhere else to stay!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great airbnb and hosts.
Located just two small blocks from snake alley and many restaurants/bars. Pretty good noise insulation, especially considering how close to the train tracks the home is. The stairs are loud, if you have little ones. Very clean. There is a small, neighboring complex that is within ~10-15 ft outside the windows, so we did end up shutting blinds and closing curtains. Neighbors were very friendly. Very walkable."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Large, comfortable, quiet space an easy walk to downtown for a great price!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I booked this at the last minute so we could stay as an extended family for the memorial service, burial, community dinner, and other family events for of my husband's sisters. We flew in from out west, and stayed here with three other family members from different parts of Iowa and one from out of state. Everyone had a bed or shared a bed, and we were within an easy drive of all of the events. The house is in a great location for walking around beautiful downtown Burlington, and the views are great from the house. Heather was very responsive to my emails, which I greatly appreciated because I wasn't in the best of mental states given the circumstances."
