Beautiful area, the park along the canal is a nice peaceful walk.
Ned’s place was the perfect home base for swimming and exploring."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice cozy place to stay while in balmorhea. Perfect for my fiancée and I while I was scuba diving. Only thing I don’t like about Air BnBs is the cleaning fees that drive up the price.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Aloha All,
Ned and Judy's Rock Cottage is an excellent choice when visiting Balmorhea State Park, or any time you are in the area.

We will go back
Patrick & Meg"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ned was helpful from the initial booking request all way through our stay.
The cabin is as pictured, and the towels and linens were really nice. It feels like there was a lot of thought in putting together this place.
Very close to Balmorhea Park (4ish miles) and would definitely stay here again.
There is currently an RV behind the house. but we never saw nor heard anyone from it. Based on the photos, we thought the house would be a little more secluded than it was. It is about a block off of the main street in town, but sitting on the porch does feel private.
Great stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot if you’re wanting to go to the pool!
I grew up going to the pool then driving home the same day. It was so great getting to go back to Neds place and just pass out(and tend to sunburns)
He was so easy to get ahold of, and let us know that the water happened to go down in the town.
We were able to see the beautiful sunsets from the patio!
The central AC was also a life saver, especially for the fore mentioned sunburns.
It is also so close to Fort Davis and Marfa, which I had never been to, and again it was so nice getting to just go back and snooze after our adventures.
We look forward to booking in the future, and I will encourage my friends/family to look into staying here.
I truly have no negative comments or criticisms.
10/10. Perfect for our long weekend!"

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, clean and very well equipped tiny stone cottage. Ned was great to communicate with. Hope we can stay again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location after spending the afternoon at Balmorhea SP and walkable to the burger place down the street. Recommend arriving before dark since the dirt road to this tiny house might be easily overlooked. I enjoyed the hot shower & a lazy evening in watching Netflix before my drive back to Austin the next morning. Treat yourself to this lovely space!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This tiny home had everything we needed for our Balmorhea getaway! Very clean and quiet, and a super comfy bed. We’ll stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful cabin in a fairly uninteresting locale other than access to Balmorhea State Park. One room stone cabin with lounge seating, functioning kitchenette, charming porch. View not so great until night time when the stars flood the skies. Excellent responsive host. We travel Airbnb a lot. Very appreciative of this option in this community of notel motels. Well appointed. We were very comfortable. Reality better than the photos. Only wish they had screens so we could open windows."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This free standing stone home is back behind the main road through Balmorhea, giving you space and privacy. There is a dedicated parking spot right out front at the steps. It is not far from Balmorhea State Park, which is a gorgeous swimming spot!
The high ceiling makes it feel roomy. The bed and linens were very comfortable as were the bath sheet towels. The bathroom was very clean with a wall dispenser for body wash, shampoo and conditioner. We slept great as the area was very quiet.
There is a kitchenette with a sink, microwave, small fridge with a freezer top, a hot plate and coffee pot. It was well kept and clean.
The easy chairs to read or watch tv were comfortable and new.
We would stay again if in the area!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ned's tiny house was a great place to stay while diving at Balmorhea State Park! Ned was responsive and friendly!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We are very grateful to have such a quiet and comfortable place to stay while in Balmorhea. We will be back when we have a scuba diving trip at the State Park. Thank you for all your hospitality, Ned! It was fun seeing you at La Cueva for dinner."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location for a quick rest after spending the weekend in the Guadalupe Mountains.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ned was accessible and gave lots of good information about the surrounding area. The house was very quiet and on the edge of town. Balmorhea is isolated, but the place made for an excellent stop in a long journey across Texas. I would definitely stay at Ned’s again.
Note: If arriving after dark the gps considers Ned’s gravel driveway a ‘road’ so the turn off is subtle."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A beautiful place to stay in Ft Davis. Home was immaculate and we enjoyed the views from all the patios!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Tons of privacy. Has just about everything you need to make meals. Great views. Great location. Super clean and nice house. One of the best places I’ve stayed in Ft. Davis. Highly recommend

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful views and a great place to get away from it all. 360 degree outdoor sitting space to take it all in. House was beautiful and wonderfully furnished. Everything was exactly as advertised. Would stay again and bring guests visiting from out of town.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely space. Very quiet and peaceful. I loved how secure I felt as I was traveling alone in the vast open space & it was very nice to be on a private locked gated ranch. I really appreciated that. Great bedding, fully functional kitchen. Beautiful vistas. I personally enjoyed the Berkey water filter too. Thanks for a nice respite from the busy world!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Stargazing at night made this place worth it alone
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Incredible setting in Fort Davis! Beautiful home well taken care of. Would definitely recommend.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house is about 7 minutes out of town, giving you peace and quiet and privacy. The way it’s situated, you get views from all sides, especially from the back deck overlooking the mountains. Each bedroom has a deck. The kitchen is perfectly equipped. The master bedroom was roomy with a very comfortable king bed. I opened my eyes one morning and saw a buck walking by outside the window! It’s so dark at night; phenomenal star viewing! We took long walks right outside the door."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place! We are looking forward to coming back!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the most beautiful places I have ever stayed. Host was very helpful. House was clean and had everything we needed. I would stay here again. I would stay multiple times if I could!

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful property in a private location. Great host. Heat controls are tricky and need explanation.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Incredible views, quiet but accessible, beautiful property and house. Felt right at home and wished we could stay longer. Amazing sunrises and sunsets with great vantage points."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Maggie's house was a vacation in and of itself. Even though it is far from Big Bend NP (about 1.5 hours) the house allowed us to enjoy the gorgeous scenery while relaxing in a serene environment. The house was very well maintained and everyone slept comfortably. We highly recommend the house for a family vacation and/or get together. We wished we had planned better and had stayed for Thanksgiving. Amazing views of the sunset and sunrise. Thank you Maggie, we look forward to another visit!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Such a great place to relax. Gorgeous views. We will definitely be back.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Better than described, best place to stay in Ft. Davis. Stop scrolling, book it now!"

Hope to come back next year!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was exactly what my family and I were looking for. Peace & quiet with beautiful Mountain View’s. Maggie was such a great host and very helpful, will def stay again and recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had such a lovely time staying in Fort Davis. The views were breathtaking, and Maggie was an excellent host. We will definitely be back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stay in The Davis Mountain area once a year and this was by far the best place we’ve stayed. The view was unbelievable and the house was so private. We pretty much stayed on the porch the whole time. Nice furnishings and we also enjoyed the touch of having fluffy bathrobes like at a hotel. We will definitely be back!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great semi-remote stay. Its got great views inside and out. Lots of desert wildlife. Comfortable space with lots of windows. We loved that it was just removed enough from the towns and lights for our stay and great dark skies. There is nature center near by that was a hiking bonus!!! It still near a small highway so there were occasional cars, but it never bothered us.
Maggie was really helpful, and the place was really nice. Will definitely stay there again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location - wildlife roaming through in the am/pm. Recommend guests bring a set of good binoculars. Star gazing is A+, perhaps pack along a telescope if you enjoy that, though great viewing with just the naked eye. We usually go out for dinner when we travel, but we wanted to be at the house so we stocked up on steaks and burgers at Porter's in Ft Davis. Maggie has a very nice gas grill that was easy to use. I would say the cost is at a bit of a premium, but so is the location and the peacefulness of the property. It was worth the cost to create some family memories in a very memorable cabin."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"SO BEAUTIFUL! We planned a last minute getaway from the city and this home was perfect for our weekend. Home on the mountains, beautiful 360 views. Wake up early and enjoy the views before sun rise!!!!!!!! When we arrived at the home we explored “hiked” around the area a bit."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing house and location! Have stayed before and hope to stay again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is so beautiful with the most incredible views. So peaceful, tucked up high but also close to town and 20-30 min from Marfa, Alpine, and Macdonald Observatory. We loved everything about this place and would definitely come back but there was a little mice problem while we were there which did impact our visit. No other reviews mention this so I assume it’s an acute issue rather than ongoing. Would still highly recommend but would make sure to ask about the mice issue."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful spot for us to watch the meteor shower and enjoy the mountains. We will be back
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always come back here and it’s an excellent stop on road trips! Great stay 10/10 would recommend.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Rock House is an amazing gem - the views from all sides of the house are stunning. I saw the most beautiful sunrise the morning of our stay. The decor is modern and well done, and the vibes of the cabin are just perfect and we made some great memories. Convenient location to the observatory, Balmorhea, Marfa and Ft Davis! Be sure to read the check in details as finding it can be tricky if you don’t pay close attention or if you’re directionally challenged like me! My only regret is not having another night there!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing location. Stars for miles! Peace and quiet in nature at its best. Will definitely return!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most incredible places I’ve stayed in. Can’t recommend it enough!
Incredible landscapes all around and easy to get to with Fort Davis 5-10 mins away.
The house came equipped with everything we needed and the host was really nice and flexible."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Highly recommend! Very peaceful getaway, nice cabin set in nature. Booked as it was so close to McDonald Observatory, but saw almost as much from the house at night! Easy hikes close to the house, and saw lots of deer, javelina, birds and other wildlife throughout stay. Really comfortable setup, and could have spent another week just enjoying the relaxing views in every direction!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful home and location. This is definitely a must see and wish we could’ve enjoyed it longer. Maggie was very welcoming when we arrived. I look forward to returning in the future.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We needed a place to stay during a bad storm and found this gem. Gorgeous views and house! Probably going to skip camping next time and come stay here.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hard to describe how beautiful the property is.. we spent hours on the porches looking at all the views. Couldn't be happier with our stay. Perfect was the word we kept saying. Thank you, Maggie!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice place with a great view.
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home was absolutely stunning! Beautiful and calm. Great location with great views for a nice getaway from the city life. Had a wonderful family weekend; watching tv, cooking, eating together and just sitting back on the deck/balcony talking over our morning coffee. Close by Davis Mountains State Park and an easy and picturesque 20 minute drive to the McDonald Observatory. Maggie was gracious and understanding to our requests. We LOVED staying here."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay. I had some small complaints after our first stay last year but everyone of them was fixed. Can’t wait to go back!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Rock House is incredible! The location, the peacefulness, the sunrises and sunsets, the stars at night, and the house were all more than I even expected. I can’t wait to go back!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing views! Clean space with lots of character. The whole family had a lot of fun here. A lot of hiking on the property as well as being close to town while having privacy.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a lovely home with beautiful views! Very well appointed. I advise getting there before dark, if possible as the road is a little tricky, but well worth it!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We greatly enjoyed the casita. It is quiet and centrally located for all the daytrips we had planned (Davis Mountain State Park, McDonald Observatory, Marfa and Alpine)."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deanna was quick to reply to questions. The space was all set up for the 3 of us when we arrived. Fresh muffins were waiting for us. The kitchen had everything we needed. We loved the covered outside area for relaxing after a day of exploring. it was fun watch the sheep roam the hillside and their babies playing with each other around the rocks. Deanna was a great host. A great location for exploring the Fort Davis area.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Casita at Arabella was a wonderful homie stay. The mountains were breathtaking. The full size refrigerator and Keurig were very useful. The stars were bright and it was so quiet and peaceful. We will definitely be back.

Deanna and Lonnie were very kind and we enjoyed visiting with them.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy and comfortable for just relaxing. All you need with a nautical themed decor. Easy to drive into Fort Davis and hit Marfa for a shopping stroll. If you go to Marfa visit the Blackwell School, a new National Historic Site. If I were a writer I’d stay here to write my next novel."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely cabin a short drive from downtown Fort Davis. Clean, comfortable, and well-maintained. Nice view from the covered porch. My hosts made a blueberry muffin available on the dining table at check in. There was also microwave popcorn to snack on. There are also trekking poles (located in the corner near the guest book) for guests to use, so you don’t need to bring your own unless you want to. I plan to come back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a lovely place with an amazing view. Deanna and her husband were very accommodating. Highly recommend.

We would definitely stay here again when visiting the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very well located for main attractions. Deanna is a very well organized and caring host. She made us feel welcomed and provided with what we needed and even more. For us it was like “Being home away from home”.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The casita is exactly as described in a beautiful, peaceful location conveniently located between Fort Davis and the McDonald Observatory. My husband and I loved watching sunrises and sunsets and the stars in the dark night sky. We cooked in the fully stocked kitchen and also went into Fort Davis to eat or buy groceries. Our cell phones worked great (Verizon) and the wireless was also good. There are houses around you but you still have plenty of privacy. The covered patio is wonderful as are the zero gravity chairs for star gazing. There was Dish TV but the area is so beautiful we didn't watch TV. We also visited Alpine and Marfa (each about 25 minutes away). We did not visit Big Bend NP this time but it is convenient to that, as well. This place is located on Arabella Mountain so you have beautiful views. We met Deanna and she was so nice and also very responsive. This place is perfect for a couple and we would highly recommend it and would definitely stay here in again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Greats views. Highly recommend a drive through the Mountains. At the cabin we woke up to deer & pigs roaming the hillsides
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A great place to stay.
Deanna and Lonnie's place had everything we needed!
She had pumpkin bread for us and Lonnie stopped by to meet us and check up on us again the next day since the temperature went below freezing!
Clean, cozy, beautiful view and super location to get to the McDonald Observatory and Fort Davis. Great place for hiking and Star Gazing!
Absolutely recommend this place and if we return to Fort Davis would definitely stay here again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was close to things we wanted to do. The place was clean, comfortable and had a great view. Being able to use the washing machine was a plus. We will definitely recommend it to our friends."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always, this is our favorite place to stay in Fort Davis. so quiet and secluded. Can't wait to come back."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deanna’s place was perfect! We didn’t want for anything. We’ll definitely be staying here next time we go to Fort Davis. Our favorite thing was star gazing 💫 ⭐️ perfect location to soak up the big Far West Texas sky.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Deanna’s place! Perfectly located in between Fort Davis and McDonald Observatory, and close enough for day trips to Marfa and Big Bend. The Casita was clean and comfortable. We couldn’t’ve been happier with our stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great place to stay while around the Davis Mountains area that was quiet and easy to find. The dark night skies allow you to easily view the milky way and there are also zero-gravity chairs on the patio for better viewing. We appreciated the solitude and quiet this place provided and the scenery is beautiful around the property.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our third stay at Deanna's place. We absolutely love the casita for our trips to the State Park. Its perfectly appointed for everything we need and we love coming home from a long day of hiking and relaxing on the porch. You can't beat that valley view to watch the clouds roll by. The sunrise is also striking if you're up early. Hope we'll be back soon!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect accommodations for a hiking trip to Fort Davis SP and the Chihuahuan Desert Research Institute. Comfortable beds, roomy bathroom and a kitchen ready to cook in (if you go that route). There were a few places open in town to eat so we took advantage of having someone else cook for us. Would definitely stay at the casita again if we return to town."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing! Great views and has everything you need. Very clean and spacious. We really enjoyed our stay here. Will definitely rent again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location if you are a night sky enthusiast. Clean and comfortable. Well appointed -- we had everything we needed and then some. Very comfortable for a couple. Not sure I'd recommend for more although there is a sofa bed that provides for more. Very pleasant outdoor sitting area with table chairs and lounge chairs. Also a charcoal grill available with lighter fluid (supply your own charcoal). If you need access to internet though, it's non-existent. They have installed a cell phone booster, but with AT&T, I had only one bar. Verizon may be better, but anything else is probably hopeless. Come to relax, unwind and ""unplug"" and you'll be very happy."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, weather was wonderful in late July. The Casita was comfortable and well stocked."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Well furnished and provides for everything you need for a short stay or extended stay. Location is close to both Fort Davis and the McDonald Observatory. The neighborhood is great with very few people and lots of wildlife.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A great homebase for exploring the area. Beautiful surroundings and even though there are houses around it felt quiet and private. The chairs provided for stargazing were wonderful. The house was very clean and well cared for. The host, Deanna is super nice and made sure we had what we needed. If I'm ever back in the area I'd love to stay here again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were really impressed with this AirBNB. Very good value, and extremely good views. We also really enjoyed the opportunity to hike the mountain. The views were fantastic on top and we agreed that hiking that mountain was probably the best experience we had on our entire trip to West Texas. (There is no trail though for this mountain, so I’m sure moderate experience with hiking is a must to hike)"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great outdoor space for stargazing!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great getaway for the weekend or longer. Very clean, simple, with a well-stocked kitchen, and incredible nighttime views of the big W. TX sky. Close to Ft. Davis and the observatory but secluded enough to feel relaxed. Would certainly stay again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay. It is out of town in a hilly area but close to both town and McDonald's Observatory. We loved it and the birds! I think Deanna thought of everything when she got this place ready.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,These hosts are great and their place was perfect for my husband and I! Great location too! Very pleased with everything.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,All good.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved this location and cabin. Just north of the park for hike and town. Beautiful view of the stars and plenty of room for sleeping and cooking
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, clean and spacious guest house with a full kitchen, washer/dryer, satellite TV and internet. Deanna and Lonnie were so helpful with information and anything else we needed. The location was in the country so very quiet and peaceful, yet close drive to amenities at Ft. Davis and many recreation opportunities like Davis Mts. State Park, Chihuahan Desert Nature Center, Balmorhea State Park, and a short drive to the attractions of Alpine or Marfa. Will definitely come here again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are visiting McDonald Observatory or Fort Davis area, stay at this gem of a home! Everything is as described and more so! Deanna and her husband double-check to make sure you have all you need. The home is so well stocked with basic necessities that it was a home away from home."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying at the Casita. You can’t beat the hospitality or the location. It is perfectly situated between Fort Davis and the McDonald Observatory. We appreciated having the perfect seats to view the star-filled skies.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic way to visit the Davis Mountains, the Casita is close to McDonald Observatory and Davis Mountain State Park, ideal for accessing activities in Fort Davis and surrounding area! Scenic, very clean, well appointed, great location...."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very thoughtful host. Our stay is full of pleasant and memorable moments.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved this location! Hosts were very attentive and offered great advice. Super clean and had everything needed. Highly recommend!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The casita was such a well appointed place to stay! We loved the peaceful location for visiting the area attractions. The little extras provided by the host were sure a nice touch! Highly recommend!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Casita lived up to everything we expected it to be. We were in need for nothing...as the needs for our stay were all there, and well thought out. Deanna and Lonnie were very gracious hosts, and we would be happy to come back for another visit to Ft. Davis...and get more Blue Bell Ice Cream at the Green Caboose. Really...a Green Caboose...you have to come and see it for yourself!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna's Casita was just perfect for us. It was very clean, had everything we needed and Deanna was very helpful. The Casita has a great view of the Davis Mountains, including 7,286-foot Blue Mountain. The neighborhood is very quiet, which is exactly what we were looking for. And the location is convenient to the best attractions in Fort Davis. I highly recommend it."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was a great spot to get away from the noise and light pollution of the city. The hosts were very responsive and helpful. They keep books, maps, binoculars, and other items to assist you with the area, the history, and star gazing. I was lucky to get a couple of dark nights to see the Milky Way. It is a short drive to the observatory and the Davis Mountains State Park. I will look for this site on future trips."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place to stay for our trip to the McDonald Observatory. 12-15 minutes to the observatory and 12-15 minutes to Fort Davis downtown. The Casita was comfy and easy to access. The muffins were also so delicious! We had a relaxing and fun weekend.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay. We felt right at home. The location is superb in relation to the observatory. We will definitely try to stay here again when we come back.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quiet, secluded location with easy access to all the attractions in the area."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this casita! It was very comfortably furnished with foldout couch and bed as well as a full eat-in kitchen. The hosts were very responsive, providing great information on the area and important extras like walking sticks and binoculars for our use. We loved the beautiful mountain view, learning more about the Davis Mountains and hiking in the Chihuajuan Desert Research Institute outside Ft. Davis. The star party and daytime views from McDonald Observatory also were awesome. Highly recommend these great hosts and fascinating area to visit!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This is a fantastic space! Cozy, clean, easy to find, amazing views, comfortable bed, well equipped kitchen, and friendly hosts. We're already planning to come back."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I appreciated everything about this place. It was very clean and comfortable, and the hosts were very thoughtful! I hope I will be able to return and stay there again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here was absolutely magical. It is so close to both fort Davis and McDonald’s observatory. I hope we/ I can make it back some day. It was remote, no wifi, and it was the perfect birthday getaway. Deanna was a gracious and warm host. I highly recommend staying here"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is fantastic! The pictures don’t do it justice for how cozy it felt and welcoming. The location is great for going to the observatory and going into town. Loved it and can’t wait to go back and stay longer next time!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect little house for visiting Fort Davis. Hosts were so friendly and helpful. Will definitely stay here again!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value, our second time here. Always so clean. Lots of wildlife to view, and very close to the Observatory. Can't beat it !!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent hosts, comfortable casita, and delicious muffins! Highly recommend for those visiting the Fort Davis area."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Fantastic experience, perfect location for exploring the Davis Mountains. Beautiful views. Immaculately clean and very well appointed with all the necessities. Can't wait to return. Highly recommended."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for some peace and quiet with a view, the Casita on Arabella Mountain is the place for you. Deanna and Lonnie are great hosts; personable, professional and generous with their time. The location is great for exploring Fort Davis, Marfa and the surrounding area."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Casita. It was very clean, comfortable, welcoming, and well-equipped. Deanna even provided binoculars and hiking poles! The views are spectacular, and it wasn't as hard to find as we were afraid of. We were visiting and sightseeing with friends who were staying in the Davis Mountains State Park, so the location was perfect. I would give it six stars if I could!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The casita has everything you need to have a relaxing time right in the Davis Mountains.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a GREAT place for a weekend getaway! :-)
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely delightful stay! I would highly recommend this to others. The Casita itself is nicely set up, and it's not that common to find a place with a full kitchen set up. (As my brother put it: ""They've got everything! I could make a cake in this kitchen right now!"") The view is spectacular! You're right in the heart of the Davis Mountains, just 10 minutes from the Observatory and maybe 15 max from Fort Davis itself. (Depending on how comfortable you are driving low mountain roads.)
The only caution I would give anyone is that the Casita itself sits on a stretch of dirt roads with some fairly steep grades. This can be intimidating (it certainly intimidated me the first trip up). BUT! I can say that I made it in and out multiple times in a 4 cyl Kia Soul so... it is ""normal car"" friendly, just might be a bit of a test for a driver not used to such roads."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna and Lonnie are excellent hosts. I have stayed with other ""superhosts"" and if they had a title label as ""SuperSuperHosts"" they would hold the honor. My wife and I have stayed with several AirB&Bs and we expected that there would be items that we would need to have. When you stay here, they have thought of everything. We loved the peace and quite of the location. I still wonder how Deanna and Lonnie were able to que the wildlife for us. The first morning we woke up to see a family of Aoudad's and a few hummingbirds. The next morning, we awoke to see what awaited us and found they had queued the Javalinas to pass by. All in all, it was a great stay although we were flooded with rain every afternoon, it was a pleasure to spend time back home. Looking forward to our next visit with Deanna and Lonnie. Thanks for everything."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful view, and delicious muffins to boot. Great location if you are going to the Davis Mtn. State Park or the observatory."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had the most wonderful experience. They checked on us and made sure everything was nice. This place is perfect and location is wonderful and puts you right in the middle of everything. Was able to visit Davis Mountains state park, Balmorhea swimming hole, Ft. Davis. Nice being able to cook your own food if you want too. Couldn't have asked for a better host. Also do yourself a favor and visit the ice cream shop and antique store the host owns. They are great establishments as well. I will definitely stay there again and many more times!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay, beautiful night sky views and great secluded location yet close to nearby attractions. Deanna has everything you might need available. When it is dark, it is easy to miss the turn to get to casita, I recommend using a mile tracker to know when to expect it. Definitely looking forwards to returning!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place and so close to McDonald observatory. We appreciate the hospitality of the owners! We would definitely come back and stay here!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dont write public reviews
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location. Very nice outdoor spaces to enjoy mountains and stars at night. Spacious on the inside and comfortable. Deanna and Lonnie were great hosts. Recommend them highly.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed Deanna’s place.
It was cozy and nicely furnished. The view of the mountains was great during the daytime and the view of the stars at night was amazing.
We would love to stay there again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Casita was a gem in the Davis Mountains for sure! We loved our stay and the host was also awesome. If you are looking for great views of the Davis Mountains, peace and quiet, awesome night skies, wildlife viewing, and relaxation, this is the place for you!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed the stay! Perfect location for our excursions to Ft. Davis State Park and McDonald Observatory. Charming place with incredible views, both night and day."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at the casita! Fabulous views day and night. Deanna was a great communicator and we appreciated the amenities provided to make the most of the location.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fresh mountain air, stunning views from the front porch and plenty of hiking in the area. Deanna is a wonderful host...her muffins were amazing too!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent - clean, thoughtful accommodations, everything provided for a wonderful stay. We enjoyed it from the minute we arrived. From the amenities, to the decor, to the views.... just amazing. Gracious and warm hospitality, would definitely stay again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful location and great proximity to the observatory and the state park.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The casita was a great base for exploring the Davis Mountains area. We had tons of space, and the hosts are pleasant to work with."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We highly recommend this place - the hosts have gone out of their way to make it such a pleasant home away from home.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,First off the host Deanna was quick to get back to us to set up booking. Larry dropped by after we arrived to see if we needed anything & make sure we knew if anything was needed to let them know.. A very peaceful place with everything we could of ask for. The Casita isn't very far from lots of places to go shop or grab a meal. I would recommend The Casita to anyone for a great getaway.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little house in the mountains is in the perfect location! You’re about 15 minutes away from the McDonald Observatory and 15 minutes from Fort Davis. It’s perfect! Also keep an eye out for the aoudad sheep hanging out around the property! Very cool to see! Just a great and very clean house to hang out in the Davis Mountains. Super sweet hosts! Would definitely stay again!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for your hospitality. Hope to One day have the pleasure of staying there again.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect serene setting and location! Photos just can't capture how nice and relaxing Deanna's place is. The indoor space is clean and comfortable for sleeping, watching tv or cooking. Nice shower & washer/dryer too. We especially enjoyed the ""dual"" outdoor spaces... one for grilling and bird watching and the other for star gazing. If you wear bright, floral socks you just might get kissed by a hummingbird like I did! The location is PERFECT for exploring the Davis Mtns. McDonald Observatory, Ft Davis and even Marfa. The hosts were quick to respond to questions and it was nice of Lonnie to stop by to welcome us. If you need a place to chill out I highly recommend staying here. The star gazing and bird guide books were a nice addition too. We will definitely return!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is like a little secret that I don’t want to give away and at the same time want others to know. Very easy access to McDonald Observatory and to the entire Davis Mountains area as well as Fort Davis town. Perfect place to get away from it all so don’t expect great cell service (ATT seemed better than others, followed by Verizon). Well equipped for a short stay and clean. Lots of interesting books especially on the night sky, and many movies (but we prefer not to watch TV especially when there is such a lovely sky and views. Deanna was great with her communication and we had no issues at all. Her husband came to check on us to make sure everything was okay. We hope to go back sometime again given that we visit the area about once a year."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the Casita! Despite getting in well past midnight, the Casita was easy to find. Once getting in, it was not only so clean but so cute! Definitely will be staying here again on another trip to Big Bend."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, loved going to Fort Davis, the state park, and McDonald Observatory. Skies very dark at night, and could see lots of stars. We saw some pigs and deer from the Casita. Recommend the Blue Mountain Bar and Grill in town, much better quality food and better service than the place across the street."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding in all categories! Views, hospitality, cleanliness, beauty - can't wait to return!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thoughtful amenities and a beautiful view! This was the perfect cozy home base for our west Texas trip.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Deanna’s place is beautiful, the pictures of the views don’t really capture how it feels out there. The home had all the basics, plus all those things you don’t realize you need until you are traveling. It’s touches like this that made us feel so welcome. And the location is so close, in fact right in between Davis Mtns SP and the McDonalds Observatory. We would love to go back some day!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was the perfect place to relax and chill. The owner's, Deanna and Lonnie, are friendly and accommodating. Their place is clean, convenient, well appointed and comfortable. My wife and I stayed for one week and had a wonderful time. We have nothing to add. We particularly enjoyed viewing the stars at night, with a glass of wine and grilling a couple of steaks. The grill, charcoal and lighter fluid was provided all you need to do is bring the meat. We would definitely stay again. Mike and Marie"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location for a weekend getaway, we had a great time hiking in the Davis Mountains. The casita was clean and well equipped, checkin/check out was easy, and Deanna was an excellent host."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and had everything we needed when snowed in.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The casita had everything we needed and more. Excellent place to stay!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deanna’s place was very comfortable with all the amenities of home. We enjoyed star gazing in the amazing night sky. The Casita is close to the McDonald Observatory and Ft Davis State Park. We will return!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna’s place was perfect for my husband and I! It was far enough from any other home to give plenty of privacy. It was also very cozy and had lots of special touches such as filled ice cube trays, travel size toiletries, plenty of towels and blankets. We also cooked a meal during our stay and had everything we needed to do so."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna & Lonnie were great! Their communication was exemplary. The casita was just as described. They even had thoughtful touches of popcorn, sparkling water, and muffins waiting for us. They offered the perfect blend of being attentive (checking to see if we needed anything) & giving us space to relax and enjoy ourselves. NOTE: Cell signals are low. However, this area is meant for enjoying nature, the surroundings, and connecting with whomever you came with. Deanna & Lonnie have created a great escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. Thank you so much!!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place for a long or short getaway! Deanna and Lonnie were exceptional hosts. We came for a star party at McDonald Observatory that unfortunately was canceled the day before we were supposed to go. No matter because the star gazing at this property is incredible! There are zero gravity chairs that allow you to look straight up and enjoy the view. Even provided binoculars that make those faint cluster of stars that you can just make out with the naked eye just pop through the binoculars.
Beds were very comfortable. Location is very quiet. All in all a very good value and close to a lot of things to do in Ft Davis."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Deanna’s Casita was perfect for our isolation vacation :). The drive in was beautiful and we even got to see snow on our last day. We even hiked Arabella mountain with our 3 year old! I left with a want to return in the future!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Casita is a treasure. Sparkling clean, a great value...and if you're lucky like i was, you might get one of Deanna's delicious banana muffins!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t go wrong with this location, outstanding views, close enough to Fort Davis for supplies etc. Don’t miss the Scenic Mountain Trail Drive! The Casita had everything one would need. Definitely would go back!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great little place very close to Davis Mountains State Park and McDonald Observatory (the latter is currently closed due to pandemic; however Casita has no lack of beautiful star viewing on its own). The place has everything you need for a comfortable stay, and hosts are more than welcoming. Books about Davis Mountains, astronomy and great binoculars (for wildlife viewing and stargazing) were especially appreciated."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the casita!!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect home base for anyone visiting the Davis Mountains. It is perfectly situated just miles from Davis Mountains state park, about 8 miles from McDonald Observatory and 12 miles from Madera Canyon preserve.
Deana has thought of everything and will make sure your stay is comfortable, at and outside the cabin. You are greeted with muffins, walking sticks are provided to help with the steep hikes in the area, binoculars are provided for bird watching, and reclining chairs outside allowed us to enjoy the night sky without straining our necks!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, perfect Casita. Don't pass up the opportunity to stay here. Best value I've had in years. This place was spotless and had everything you could possibly need... plus a little more. When the line of cars come down the mountain from a McDonald's Observatory Star Party, you'll be the first one to pull in to where you are staying. Every other car will be envious as to how SMART you were to stay here."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Casita on Arabella is a super cute home away from home in the best part of Texas. The hosts are super responsive and provide all those special small touches that make the stay memorable and of quality. We recommend it for anyone looking to get away to find real peace and quiet blanketed by starry skies. And should the weather not be amazing, you can stay inside and chart your way from the Rio Grande to New York Harbor following the maritime charts that cover the Casita walls."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is incredible!! Location is stunning and very affordable! Everything was just as detailed yet MORE!!! We will definitely be back to the Casita on Arabella Mountain~
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Casita was comfortable, clean, and a perfect home away from home during our stay. The location is perfect for stargazing and watching sunrises with a cup of coffee in hand. Deanna really goes above and beyond to make sure guests have everything they could need while visiting!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time at Deanna's place and we hope to be back again and again. The casita is home away from home with everything you could need and the perfect patio to relax on after a day of hiking!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay and lacked for nothing. Great spot, great views, great hiking!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great hosts, great views, great little casita...just a great place to vaca!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, very private, great views, great amenities, we will stay here again."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna's place is wonderful. It is quiet and relaxing, with lots of opportunities to bird watch, stargaze and go for hikes. The casita is clean and spacious with everything we needed for a little vacation away from it all!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Casita was wonderful. Super clean and plenty of room for me, my husband, and our toddler. Deanna is a thoughtful and sweet host and is available if you need anything. View from the Casita is gorgeous and the star gazing at night was my favorite part of the stay. We had a wonderful time!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location. Great amenities and close to great hiking locations and the state park. Great location if you want to stargaze and take some good shots of the Milky Way. Deanna gave great directions and the check in was super easy.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The casita was a great location - not too far from the park, fort, and town, yet a feeling of seclusion. We really enjoyed climbing the mountain behind the cabin! Absolutely incredible views! Everything you needed plus extra thing like muffins, popcorn, charcoal, etc. were available."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay! We loved the beautiful scenic views and very comfortable bedding and towels. We spent our one day in Fort Davis at the Chihuahua Desert Nature Center, which I highly recommend. We did some great hikes with our small kids with no problem. Afterwards, we came back to Deanna’s and my husband hiked up to the top of Arabella Mountain in about 40 minutes and waved down to me and and kids. We would definitely like to return here the next time we are in this part of the Texas, when the observatory reopens."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful setting. Very clean. Good communication.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent value, great location, friendly host, and smooth check in and check out procedures! We would definitely stay here again."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time at Lonnie and Deanna’s Casita. They were very welcoming and responsive hosts and have thoughtfully provided everything you could need. The location between Fort Davis and McDonald Observatory was perfect. The views from the Casita were beautiful and we enjoyed watching the wildlife, the thunderstorms rolling in, and the stars in the dark skies. Based on a tip from Lonnie, we were able to see the comet. We hope to return in the future."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna's place was even better than we had expected. Extremely clean, comfortable, with everything you could think of needing for the time away. The location is ideal for the state park, and sitting on the patio was an ideal beginning and end to each day. We also enjoyed not having internet, truly an escape. We will certainly be back."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect getaway for a couple or a young family!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was such a gem and a wonderful respite for relaxing and enjoying the view of the valley and stars. Due to covid, many places were closed (McDonald, Balmorhea, etc). We anticipated that and prepared by bringing lots of food, portable air purifier, our hammock stand with hammock, and downloaded the star-gazing app. We hiked the mountain behind their property and even glimpsed the silhouette of the aoudad sheep that live on their mountain. At night we enjoyed our own personal star-party with the app - the views were spectacular with the milky way, shooting stars, and venus and jupiter shining bright. Great location, highly recommend for some peace and quiet."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The casita was such a relaxing place to stay! It was super clean which I know is something we’re all concerned with, especially these days. It had all of the basic things you need to cook meals if you choose to eat in.
It’s remote so the views were wonderful in every directions. The views were my favorite part of the stay. We got to see the beautiful sunsets, sunrises, and even the bright, full moon every night.
If you’re in to hiking, the casita is close to the state park hiking trails, and there’s even an option to hike in the back “yard”! There’s a relatively challenging hill/mountain right behind the casita. There were 360 views from the top. You can even see the McDonald Observatory from up there!
I really enjoyed Deanna’s and Lonnie’s casita, and I’d definitely recommend their place to others looking for a remote spot to escape to from the hustle and bustle of the real world."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our time at the casita! The hosts were friendly and helpful, there is hiking right outside your door, the view from the covered patio is beautiful, and it is so quiet and relaxing. You can see so many stars!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay when visiting the Fort Davis area. Even though it’s a studio, it has plenty of space for 3 people. Large kitchen and dining area and a good-sized bathroom. Location cannot be beat. You’re close enough for a quick run into town or to Davis Mountains State Park, but far out enough in the country to take advantage of the famously dark skies. House sits up on a hillside and offers tranquility and amazing views. Close to the McDonald observatory and located on one of the most scenic loop drives in Texas. Highly recommended!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Deanna is such a great host! She reinsured several times during our stay that we are having a great time and was very much following the new Covid 19 cleaning guidelines set by Airbnb! This was a beautiful and relaxing stay even or especially during crazy times like this! My kids and I really enjoyed the scenery with all the wildlife!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location! View of the mountains, deer, quite lovely and peaceful! Photos do not give this place justice."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I don’t know how I couldn’t give 5 stars! Our stay was wonderful, the casita was amazing and we enjoyed our time there. Deanna was such a great host, we felt welcome from the minute we booked until we pulled out to drive home. The location is great, an easy drive to Fort Davis and the State Park, but also quiet and secluded. We will definitely be back!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect trip to get away and relax. You can explore and hike or sit back and enjoy the view. Either way, the casita has something for everyone."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place!! Just perfect for a quite get away. Highly recommend this place.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was blown away by how well taken-care of and clean the Casita was when we arrived. If the quaint little house doesn't capture your heart, wait until you see the stars!!! It was well worth the trip!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,amazing place! panoramic views of the mountains + great location for checking out the area.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a beautiful place. The location is magical. Deanna was very communicative and hospitable. I recommend staying at the casita!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have been to the Davis Mountains many times and stayed at several places in the area and this is my favorite! For the price, it is unbeatable, as you have quick access to many of the area attractions and are staying up in the mountains. To be surrounded by the mountains and bright stars of West Texas is truly amazing and this place brings it all together in one package. The hosts are very accommodating and genuinely friendly, helpful people. Check-in was the easiest I’ve ever had, the location is great, and the super clean, well-stocked house has everything you need and more. The bonus muffins were awesome! Definitely recommend this stay!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect spot to stay for a visit to the Davis Mountains. Great location, very cozy and comfortable with a beautiful view! The Casita has everything you need and an extremely gracious host! We will definitely stay here again. Highly recommend!!"

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here! We got to chat with Lonnie and got some local recommendations while watching javelinas run by. Perfect place to stay in the area, would stay again without hesitation."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really nice place. We were headed to the star party at the observatory and they cancelled it because of the coronavirus so we just relaxed on the patio at the place and it was great. I’m sure on a clear night the stars would be awesome also. We would definitely stay again.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place to stay. I would definitely stay here again.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy. Clean. Perfect place for anyone visiting the nearby observatory or Marfa or just wanting a quiet getaway with a beautiful view.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Deanna’s welcoming touches make this a wonderful place to stay! Coffee, Muffins, bottled water and more were waiting for us. She had an abundance of information about the local area to read and take away—maps, tourist pamphlets. And there were detailed books that you could read while there about Texas flora, fauna, and sites. Everything we needed to know about heat, trash, checkout, etc. was clearly posted on the refrigerator. Deanna even texted us a welcome message when we arrived to let us know we could call if we needed anything (she could see the lights on and car in the driveway.) In addition to the warm welcome, the place was cute, clean, and well-equipped. We especially loved the wallpaper (topographical charts from all over)."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna was a great host, checking in with us and explaining the heating system, etc. This was one of the most impressive Airbnbs we have experienced. The casita was spacious and very well furnished. Deanna had many pieces of literature about the area, birds and cacti. She left two large, delicious muffins for us. Little thoughtful touches were left throughout the casita, such as a flashlight, Kleenex box, and a complete collection of good kitchen utensils and quality cookware. The views outside were beautiful and it was an easy drive to McDonald Observatory. We would love to spend more time at Deanna’s casita!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a comfy home! Beautiful views just outside. Deanna responded quickly and checked in to make sure we were okay. Highly recommended!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely recommend this place to stay. Lonnie and Deanna were truly super hosts and wanted to make sure everything was going well for us. This place was very comfortable and had everything that we needed for an enjoyable stay.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time at yalls wonderful place! Thank you so much!
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Superb location between the McDonald Observatory and Ft Davis State Park. Easy drive to Ft Davis for dining and strolling about town. Very roomy, and responsive host . Great views of the valley."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Deanna was very quick to respond with local tips and other questions. The location was perfectly located just outside of Fort Davis. Cute little town with a good restaurant. We thought about hiking up Arabella Mtn but we headed out early to get to Guadalupe.
The Casita was very quaint with cute touches. We had muffins and since it was NYE’s and my boyfriend’s birthday she left champagne, glasses, and cupcakes with candles.
Super easy check in, we accidentally went to their house first, they were very friendly.
Great place and would definitely come back!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice little cottage within beautiful scenery. Very quiet and in close proximity to the Observatory. Actually if you come for the stars, you might also just sit on the patio and watch them from there! Cottage is well stocked and beds are comfy. Very clean and neat. Communication was great, we also got the chance to meet in person, which was a pleasure. We enjoyed our stay, thanks Deanna!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay in the casita on Arabella Mountain was absolutely perfect. Deanna and Lonnie are such thoughtful and gracious hosts, and went above and beyond to welcome us. The casita was charming and cozy, and full of thoughtful details. Amazing views and convenient location near the McDonald Observatory. We are already planning our return visit!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved Deanna’s place! The location is ideal, tucked up into the hillside and with expansive views of the area. The guest house space itself is surprisingly spacious and worked really well for our family of four. Easy access and plenty of space for parking with minivan. We were welcomed by a family of deer and enjoyed sitting in the outdoor porch area, just enjoying the peace and lovely views. The house is super clean and spotless, also very comfy beds. Heaters worked really well during a cold snap. Deanna and Lonnie are gracious and welcoming hosts. As others have said, an ideal Airbnb experience. We hope to come back and spend more time in the area next time. Thank you!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place with lots of cute touches. Perfect if you'd going to McDonald's Observatory and want to get some more star-viewing in after getting ""home""--or if you're on your way to Big Bend or Marfa. Very homey, with all sorts of cute and thoughtful touches."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Thoughtful kitchen accessories for cooking simple meals. Very good communication from owners as well. Would recommend!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was perfect! Loved the location, within 8 miles from McDonald Observatory. Enjoyed the outside seating area for more star gazing, and enjoying the sunrise in the AM. Place was warm and had everything we needed. Thank you!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I absolutely loved staying here! It was clean to the nano spot, and had an amazing view. The location was so peaceful, perfect for a healing vacation. There weren't any hazards that we had to take care of. Warm hospitable owners. Really worth the money"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family with young kids had a nice quick stay for one night. Wish we could have stayed longer as there are lots of fun destinations nearby that we didn't get to see.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great cozy place in the mountains. Deanna communicated very quickly and even left a few lights on in the place for us when I realized we'd be getting in late. Definitely THE place to stay if you're vising the McDonald Observatory. Very convenient.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There’s so many positive things to say about our casita and Deanna and her husband. Our hosts were thoughtful and accommodating from the first moment we connected. She remembered it was my birthday with a card and cupcakes. Her husband escorted us from town to our casita on the mountain. They checked in to make sure we were doing alright. They explained the roads and events around the area. The list goes on. When you meet them you have met friends. The place was perfect, clean and organized. The views spectacular. The mountain peaceful. This is what Airbnb is all about. Meeting new people, seeing new things, and accommodations as though you were home. Thank you Lonnie and Deanna. The both of you made us feel important and truly welcome. Until we meet again, all the best to you both."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great Place to stay. Amazing views for star gazing and watching the morning sunrise. Quiet secluded neighborhood. Great for a weekend getaway.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view from the porch is amazing! The space is a little small but very cozy, and it was perfect for the two of us. Our night at the observatory got rained out, but I almost didn’t mind because the view we had gotten the other night made up for it!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, clean, very homey. I wish I could have been there before dark to enjoy the views."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location if you are looking to explore Fort Davis and the McDonald's Observatory. Enjoyed our afternoon and morning patio time at the casita. A sweet, relaxing place on Arabella Mtn.-- Looking forward to coming back!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I spent one night at Deanna's ""Casita on Arabella Mountain"". We wish we could have spent more time there and would love to go back. It is a wonderful cabin... very comfortable, well equipped, and nicely decorated, and quite new. We found it very helpful to have a washer and dryer available also. In addition, it is in a wonderful location, halfway between Fort Davis and the McDonald Observatory and close to Davis Mountains State Park, on a hillside at a mile-high altitude overlooking a valley. Even at the end of August the temperatures were pleasant. Deanna and her husband were great hosts, easy to communicate with."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna’s spot is a perfect location for a get-away! Conveniently located to both Fort Davis and the McDonald Observatory, it is itself a wonderful place to stargaze, or sip on coffee and watch the wildlife in the morning. Would definitely return!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host who made sure my stay was great. Great view of Davis Mountains.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location for McDonald observatory, Ft. Davis state park and West Texas exploration. The studio was well stocked and everything was communicated clearly. Air conditioner could be loud at times but the views and wildlife made up for it."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Deanna’s guest home was absolutely amazing. It is cozy and has everything you could need in a home. I felt like I had bombarded her with questions but she never failed to quickly reply to them in a very nice manner. We were her first guests and were somewhat nervous, but we felt like she was an Airbnb pro hostess with how professional everything was and the cleanliness of the home. The location is absolutely perfect as well. It is only 10 minutes from the McDonald Observatory so there’s no long drives after the late night star viewing at the observatory. The views of the stars from the house at night are just like at the observatory, unobstructed with very little to no light in the neighborhood. This was a perfect stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I had a great stay here! The communication was thorough and timely. It was very easy to find and the unit had all the amenities we needed.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Box House Village is a nice quiet place to stay. My husband was working in the area and we wanted a nice place to stay for a few days. This was a comfortable place to rest and cook a few meals together. We enjoyed our stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It felt like home away from home. Very comfortable and clean. Quiet and peaceful. I will absolutely stay here again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly as promised. Had everything we needed and was very clean.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was a great place to stay. me and my husband really enjoyed how cute the tiny home was. the host/company was super responsive and had amazing customer service! they took care of us and made sure we were happy at the tiny home!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,110% recommend . will definitely be back !!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,place was great
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great place to stay, clean, great host."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Most comfortable stay in my whole road trip. Will definitely book again. Quality beds, mattresses, and a clean space."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay for those in the area. I liked how the house had many of the amenities you need for the night.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay and highly recommend Box House Villages.
The directions sent prior to check-in were easy to understand and the video provided made unlocking the door easy. I am always worried about the bathroom in homes and hotels. I was pleasantly surprised, shower has great water pressure and there was enough hot water for two of us to shower and clean up the mornings dishes. The kitchen was spacious with a full size refrigerator.
The bed was comfortable, clean,and even with the West Texas winds we slept peacefully every night.
We were traveling for back and forth to Kermit, the property was easy to find and quiet when we would arrive back to the property late in the evening.
If you are looking at this property to rest your head go ahead and book, you won’t be disappointed."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The boxhouse I stayed in was great. The communication is wonderful and they are very nice people. I would high recommend these boxhouses if you’re need somewhere to stay. Thank you!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,nice place
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great Place to stay for work.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice inside. Clean and simple!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super clean and just what I needed traveling through.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our BoxHouse was cozy, inviting, and well-appointed. Our host was super communicative and touched bases with us before, during, and after our stay. Great value!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Despite what some of the reviews said it was actually pretty easy to get into with the difficult locks. They sent a video that showed how to open the door and lock them too.
We brought our pack and play and there were plenty of extra blankets and towels for our 4 day stay. Everything was very clean and they were putting up fences between the buildings so you won’t be able to see your neighbors which is nice.
It’s right near Monahans Sandhills which is a really cool spot to check out.
10/10 would recommend this place. The host is very friendly."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, would definitely recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy space, perfect for our quick trip through. The tricky doors aren’t as big a deal as some in the reviews made them out to be, even my 10 year old could do it just fine. 😆
The only downside was that there wasn’t any hot water at all in the mornings (which wasn’t a big deal for our needs, but if you want a hot shower in the morning it might be good info to have ahead of time!) There was hot water later in the day so it was fine for us.
Overall we’d definitely stay here again, it was a good bang for our buck!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very helpful, responsive & friendly. unit was beautiful, comfy. clean & had everything (great bath towels, too!) as well as toiletries. it's part of about 40(?) other box homes in a big lot. Easy parking right in front.
Its a perfect spot for an overnight or passing through or for field workers (no outdoor area to sit for example-but that's not what these units are for). Monahan's has the Sand dunes. but not a lot else.
They are re-doing the door locks, which will make it easier to get into your unit.
Quiet hours were observed by the other homes. Would stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great value, very new and clean, easy to find!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The box house was clean and the host was very responsive. The only complaints were that the door lock, A/C and bathroom sink (plug) were difficult to figure out as you have to research and watch videos to show you how to use them. Also the Internet service was sketchy. However, if you need a place to stay near Monahans I would definitely recommend this place."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was spotless and very comfortable. We will definitely stay again when in town. The box home was so well put together with all things needed. We were surprised that we could even order things from door dash. Host was super helpful when we had issues with operating the lock. The only downside was operating the door as its horizontal instead of vertical operating. Overall 10/10
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay. In & out, easy-peasy. Would stay again if I’m in town."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's hard to find accommodations like this in a small town like Monahans, but these guys thought of everything. I'm a super light sleeper, but I brought a small travel fan and slept great! The entire space was clean, the full kitchen was well-stocked (even had a can opener... thank goodness!), and the location was ideal! I'll certainly return for my next trip to the area! Oh, and it's definitely worth a mention that Agave Mexican restaurant was fabulous, and the drive was well within a reasonable distance to all points of interest! Thank you guys for a superb weekend, and for your quick responses, generous local recommendations, and Texas-sized hospitality!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was a perfect size for two people. We loved how quiet it was.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Definitely interesting setup, like a little community of modern tiny homes. Could use a general store as there isn’t any amenities near by. Host was very helpful and accommodating. Would recommend to others 9 out of 10."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute and cozy. Perfect for a quick over night stay

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The BoxHouse was such an incredible experience for my weekend stay in Monahans! The open layout was perfect for me and my boyfriend to relax and feel right at home. The property manager, Rachelle, was extremely helpful in answering questions and messaging us before we arrived to welcome us to BoxHouse! I had a great time and will absolutely be returning in the near future."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband had a wonderful stay! We will be booking again. The host was very responsive from the beginning. Beautiful place and has everything you may need.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is ideally a place for the migrant workers, but, we really like it! It is convenient to the Interstate. The small house is well taken care of and clean. It’s quieter than most hotels. We enjoy doing for ourselves, so the kitchen is areal plus."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was a pleasant experience for my family and I. We'll definitely be reserving again on next trip!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,nice little spot for remote location work. There's still some construction going an they schedule it very well. I was never inconvenienced by any ongoing work. 10 out of 10 will book again
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was really cool. I was just passing by and needed a place to crash and this stay was comfortable and spacious! Not much in the area tho so I highly recommend hitting a grocery store/getting all your essentials before heading over
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very tired making my way through for work. stopped just for a night. This place was a very relaxing, comfortable, & a safe place to rest for my journey. Thanks the the place and response for our needs. Would most definitely stay again. I do recommend this place."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Host! Clean/new units!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were traveling from MO to NM. We were going to stay in the Midland/Odessa area but we were so glad we found this place!! I strongly recommend that you watch the video they include - you will need that information. The place was immaculate, toasty and quiet. Getting the door unlocked was a bit tricky as they forewarned us, but the video helped. I don’t know if the heater is on a timer but it was very cold by the time we woke up. We played with the control and figured it out. It warmed the place right up. Would definitely stay again and recommend highly. The hosts even gave us a great recommendation for a Mexican restaurant about 8 minutes away. It was delicious and the prices very reasonable."

Very easy checkin and out with Esther readily available for any questions. Was so much nicer having our three families together in a comfortable home with toys for the kids, etc., rather than three hotel rooms, which probably would have cost about the same."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Pedro was a great host and was very responsive and helped us out a lot. He was very understanding and the house was extremely clean and super beautiful.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The box houses were really cool to stay in and had a modern feel to them. They had nice furnishings, the heating and cooling was fantastic in the unit as the weather was up and down warm and cold during our stay. The only thing that lacked was a reliable internet source which deemed the smart TV being virtually in operable as it could not connect to their internet source. The bathroom amenities were great as well as the water pressure and plentiful hot water with the inline hot water heater and the added plus of having a washer and dryer in the unit to wash laundry after a long adventure in the Big Bend Area of Texas."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great new place. Looking forward to seeing what more they add

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed the space. Easy to get to, easy to park, and we felt safe.
The thing we appreciated the most was the intensive guide on the airbnb and Marfa that the hosts put together. Every question we had about the airbnb, such as how to turn on the AC, get on WiFi, use the shower, etc. were answered in the guide, making things very easy. Additionally, the hosts guide to Marfa, including restaurants, bars, coffee, actives, art galleries, shopping, etc. was very helpful and made our trip easier.
Thank you!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a comfortable, easy-to-find stay just outside Marfa. We enjoyed the large lot, quiet location and unobstructed views of the Marfa Lights. We enjoyed the decor, comfy bed and sofa. The fridge and oven came in handy. Being able to open the garage door on a lovely spring day was a treat."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time in Marfa and the Big Sky was our perfect home base while we explored the area and took a day trip to Big Bend. Unique, well styled, comfortable, and the views were amazing."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The space is very welcoming and peaceful. We enjoyed eating meals and spending the day with the garage door open, watching the beautiful sunrises and breathtaking night sky. All the creature comforts are available in the home, but step outside and enjoy some of the most beautiful solitude. We visit Marfa once or twice a year and I don't think we'll stay anywhere else."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful time. Great spot and easy to get around while still being off the beaten path!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean, and the host thought of everything that might be needed! Very clear instructions and helpful local recommendations and instructions. Hope to be back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,SO INCREDIBLE!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pros: great location. Clean. Amenities. Stylish. Spacious. Heating and cooling. Guide book.
Cons: asked a few questions and didn’t hear back from the host. There was a trailer outside which blocked part of the sunset (guide book mentioned that it is not there all the time so don’t let it deter you from booking)
Overall the stay was great, they’ve really thought about the details that you want and look for when staying in an Airbnb. Id recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hut was beautiful, in a quiet location on the edge of town, with great views of the mountains to the southwest. The space felt warm and inviting but still clean and minimalist. I loved the garage door that could be opened to let in fresh, cool air. The propane fire pit outside was also super relaxing to sit next to while looking at the Marfa Lights.
I would absolutely come and stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hut was perfect! The location was close to town (only about 9 minutes), but situated in a location that felt very remote and quiet. It was perfect for sitting by the fire and stargazing at night. It was a good home base for our trips to Big Bend and Alpine. The hut was very clean and comfortable, and we slept great every night."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, private location just outside of town. A quick 5-minute drive got us to all the nearby restaurants and shops on our list. Perfect views for sunrise, sunset, and stargazing at night. Highly recommend visiting!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot for passing through town. Star gazing was worth it all.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful basecamp for your Marfa and west Texas adventures. Really enjoyed the peacefulness and tranquility of the location. The home is furnished well and the owner's put their own touches on things throughout. Would 100% stay here again. Hopefully you'll be lucky enough to witness a rainstorm or the Marfa lights, making for an even more memorable stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary and it was exactly what we were looking for! The place was private and secluded, but still close enough to town that we were able do groceries and grab coffee/a bite to eat. But honestly the place was so well-equipped with kitchen supplies so we found ourselves being able to cook a meal or two while we were there! Our absolute favorite part though was being able to see the STARS! Coming from the city, we’re never really able to see the stars at night so it was really special to be able to point out the constellations and even see the milky way. Not to mention the beautiful sunset over the mountains at the end of the day!
All in all, would highly recommend if you’re looking for a quiet West Texas getaway. A hidden gem for sure!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ylana's quonset airbnb was amazing! Extremely clean, open, and comfortable. Excellent style in the furniture. Very near Marfa's town center, about a 3-5 minute drive so very close to restaurants and everything Marfa has to offer. Also a great view of the Marfa lights! Amazing airbnb for some peace and quiet, while exploring Marfa and the rest of the Big Bend Region. Can't recommend highly enough."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were only passing through but this was the perfect place to relax after many hours of driving! Place was clean and decorated very beautifully. Great location, would definitely stay again if we are ever in Marfa again!! 10/10"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Beautiful place just outside of Marfa where you can see the marfa lights by a fire on the patio. It was a lovely get away and it was such a peaceful space. I look forward to coming back soon!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot to stay when staying in Marfa. This location is quiet and serene. You get the beautiful views of the sunrise and sunset everyday.

This entire airbnb was so relaxing. We really enjoyed our stay."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Love Marfa. First time staying outside of town. Place was excellent for a great sunset and sunrise. Super cool and quiet. A great 8 day stay-zero issues. Will be back soon, thank you!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the 4th time I’ve stayed here…it’s my favorite because of the beauty of the accommodations and the beauty of the desert, mountainous surroundings. Peaceful and lovely."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We squeezed in a last minute stay with our kids for one night and we are SO glad we did. Ylana’s place was stunning, both inside and out. We loved the fire pit and looking at the stars. We’d love to stay here again in the future!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is exactly what we wanted in a rental in Marfa: remote, clean, contemporary, well appointed and with fantastic vistas.
Being 5-10 minutes out of town in Marfa beats being in town because you get the best of both worlds: the fun bars, restaurants, and shops are super close and parking is never an issue.
But in the mornings, evenings and nights, there’s no where better you can hope to be than a place just like this rental."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great time! Awesome place to stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"i’ve stayed here a few times now, each time has been amazing and so easy. love the views and the isolation but still close enough to Marfa!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a good stay! The Airbnb was beautifully decorated and about a 8 min drive to all of the recommended places in Marfa. Ylana was very helpful with her communication and instructions. I would stay here again!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely great place! Quaint affordable place to clear your mind from the busy city lights. Great location to a fun city like Marfa.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful location, gorgeous views w/ privacy & natural surroundings, but close enough to the main part of town to get any needed essentials. Place was easy enough to find, & detailed instructions were provided beforehand. House manual had all the info we needed, included local recommendations. Place was thoughtfully stocked w/ essential items (lighter, kitchen tools, facial tissues). Made it easy to relax and enjoy the vacay since there was so much less to worry about! Would recommend to anyone looking for a calm/relaxing spot to stay & will 100% look for this spot again if I have another chance to get out this way. 💛😁👍"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Deset Sky Kwonset was well worth the money and then some. Our stay in the desert was one of the most peaceful, awe-inspiring experiences my husband and I have ever had. We saw the Marfa lights, the stars, the peace. And in a beautiful venue. The instructions in the book at the Kwonset were very well done! The overall experience is a 20 out of 10!! It’s no wonder it’s booked a year in advance! Loved it!! Thank you for a wonderful experience!!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Can’t say enough great things about this place! Peaceful and isolated but really easy to follow instructions to get there. Beautiful and intentional decor. Thank you for opening this space up for us to stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We LOVED this special gem in the desert and wished we could have stayed longer!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My favorite place to stay in Marfa (third visit). The place is Marfa Modern, artsy and comfortable. I love the view—the quiet desert, the mountains and sunrises/sunsets on the horizon. Pristine accommodations."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Yllana’s place is perfect for a stay in Marfa, close enough to the city but far enough away to feel like you’ve got the desert to yourself. The house is well stocked with cooking supplies for a home cooked meal and a comfy bed with fresh linens and plenty of space to stretch, listen to music and take in the desert views. We stared up at the stars, and even saw the moon rise; it was the best."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely perfect, loved every moment of our stay"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A magical location and beautiful interior ! Very clean. Beautiful view of the sky and just few minutes to drive into town. Perfect for peaceful getaway.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a magical desert getaway, this is the spot, look no further. There are not enough words for how stunning the night sky was out there, we watched the stars for hours and hours. You can also see the wild and unusual Marfa lights from the home! There is true calm and quiet out at the Desert Sky Oasis, and its extremely private.
We did run in to a few problems while staying there. The door lock decided not to work for us, but Ylana was extremely responsive and sent someone out to remedy the situation for us immediately.
The shower also didn't work and there was no hot water, but she was extremely prompt to send someone out to fix things for us. While the hot water never ended up working, the shower did get fixed, so we just took a cold one. Very hot outside, so not a big deal.
Even with those few mishaps, I would 1000% stay here again! The space was stunning and the communication was quick and helpful. The view, stars, and privacy are worth all of it and then some."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute little place, dark skies for great stargazing minutes outside Marfa. AC works great even when it’s over 100 outside, and bed is super comfortable! I’ll stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is magical. It is beautifully decorated, the views are amazing and it feels very peaceful. During our stay the sky was clear of clouds and the stars looked so pretty. We got lucky and were able to watch the Marfa lights from this location. We will definitely be back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location with the most unbelievable star gazing! Really enjoyed staying here.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was beautiful and CLEAN 🧼! It was the perfect get away. The stars shinned bright at night and it was peaceful and quiet. We were the only people in the area. I felt safe and comfortable. I trusted the reviews and someone said “stop looking and stay here” and he was so right. STOP LOOKING AND STAY HERE! The bed was comfortable and the shower was really nice. It’s in a convenient location. Not too far from main attractions, shops, and places to eat.
I have to warn, I HATE spiders 🕷️, and I did kill about 5 daddy-long-legs during my one night stay. The place is CLEAN but remember you are in a DESERT 🌵. It is expected. As much as I screamed and freaked out when seeing them… I would still stay here again. I know they are harmless though."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay here. This was my fifth time out to Marfa & I would stay here again for every future visit because it was that great! The hanger is such a unique space; it’s peaceful, comfortable and private. We were able to sit and view the Marfa Lights both nights which was such an added bonus. The location was on some land so it felt private and magical under the stars but it’s also close to downtown. Best of both worlds!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Special place Togo and switch off and relax
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the perfect place for a getaway and a quiet place, not even spotting any humans at our sight. And also its perfect place to hang out at night and look up at the sky. In the dark, the Milky Way galaxy left us speechless and dropped our jaws. We only stayed for one night. We definitely wanted to come back for an extra couple of days to stay. The hut is cozy and comfortable 100%"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So beautiful even on the hottest day of the year. I had everything I wanted and more. Amazing sunset and sunrise views. Beautiful space. Nice linens. Strong WiFi and decent cell signal. Chargers everywhere. I’d love to go back

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location, peaceful and serene. Perfect size, with all the essentials for a great stay. Loved sitting outside in the late afternoon/early evening to watch the incredible Marfa sunsets! 10/10 would stay again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an incredibly special place! Stay for a day if you’re passing by or stay here as a destination - you won’t be disappointed. We were incredibly impressed and were reluctant t leave - we’ll definitely be back!!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Desert sky was everything my husband and I were looking for when it came to relaxing after our wedding. Amazing moments under the stars, the breeze felt amazing and the interior space was perfect! We had the best time here and cannot wait to go back. You’ll absolutely love your time at Desert Sky!! Ylana was very easy to communicate with and prompt in her responses when you have questions :)"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space is beautiful and exactly as described. The location is close to town, but far enough away that it is private. We will be back. Amazing experience."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing place to get away for some much needed R & R. The scenery was beautiful and the Hut was so comfortable. We felt right at home. Being able to open the garage door to let the outside in made our stay even better.
Thank you for the wonderful experience. This is a one of a kind find. So glad we had a chance to enjoy it."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb was the perfect get-away from city life for relaxing and star-gazing. The decor and furnishings was picture perfect and comfortable. We loved that the hosts thought off all the extras to make the stay so enjoyable and stress-free! Thank you Desert Sky for the best weekend! 🤍
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing view’s. Perfect weekend getaway thats close to the city.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect little getaway just far enough outside of Marfa to feel remote and private but close enough to venture into town multiple times per day.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent accommodations if you want a view of the desert, privacy, and comfort. We would definitely rent this place again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing stay! one of my fav places to stay in marfa
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hut is a perfect spot to enjoy the west Texas views. If you're looking to get away for some peace and quiet and enjoy the desert, this spot is perfect. So perfect that the next house in Marfa that we went to wasn't as great as the hut, however, it was closer to town. #tradeoffs"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing location and very peaceful, and great views. Enjoyed our stay. Would strongly recommend.
Host set up is extremely thoughtful. Had everything we needed."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fun little Airbnb on the outskirts of Marfa. Feels secluded, yet you are only 10 mins away from everything. Highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cool place to stay. Sitting out by the fire after dark was a highlight.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I loved ending our vacation at Ylana's place! We had camped all the nights before so it was a luxury to be in the comfiest bed with the most beautiful views. Her booklet of instructions and recommendations was so nice to have. Getting into the house and locking up when we left was so easy as well. We would definitely stay here again and I will be recommending to others :)
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The style and comfort exceeded expectations. Absolutely every need was considered by the host. The bed was extremely comfortable. Everything was perfect.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is absolutely gorgeous. It is beautifully decorated and the remote setting is peaceful. It was exactly what we were looking for. I would have loved to stay longer. The bed was super comfortable and the roll top door and view made for a great morning. We went to a night event at the Macdonald observatory so we got in super late. We had trouble finding the place because we missed a turn but the instructions were clear and we made it once we backtracked. Marfa is a fun little town and Big Bend is beautiful. I'll definitely be back and I would absolutely stay here again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful hidden gem! We felt completely restored after a weekend at this lovely peaceful hideaway. The desert is so beautiful, and we were treated to nights of stars and coyote songs. Would recommend this place to anyone wanting to enjoy Marfa along with a quiet place to unwind."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying here and we loved it just as much as the first time. Enzo my dog was sad to leave but I told him not to worry as we would most certainly be coming back!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I have stayed in dozens of Airbnb places in the US and Europe...This place is perfect...creative design...nice touches...
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Marfa! Private and secluded. Such a comfortable and peaceful place. The Airbnb was super clean, had everything we needed and a great abundance of hot water to shower! After hiking Big Bend and getting back having a nice shower with hot water during colder days was the best!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great trip!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location, great for taking a break from the city and watching the stars!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really lovely listing away from the bustle of Marfa. The property is quite serene and private, and it is gorgeous to wake with the desert sunrise. The home is spotless and the bed is quite comfortable. Guests should note that this home is accessed off of a dirt road, we had no trouble getting here in a small car but the grooved pavement made it a slow going drive to the property. Many thanks for a memorable stay Ylana!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cute , dreamy little airbnb. Def would stay here again in future if I ever make my way back to Marfa :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Desert Sky is magical! It is so peaceful and just the best place to get away and be quiet. During our trip to Marfa, there was a severe wind storm (50+ mph sustained winds) and we had to basically stay put for several hours- but we didn’t mind at all because of the peaceful oasis (and stability) the home provided. Absolutely spotless clean, decor is on point, and the most comfortable bed and pillows. Subtle note- we think you can actually view the Marfa Lights partially from this location! We were sad to check out, but were happy knowing the next booking would enjoy it as much as we did."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for a weekend getaway. Private, scenic and great view of the stars at night. Ylana was attentive and accommodating."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,my husband and i LOVED this place!! so so much! it’s a must experience. at night the stars alone brought me to tears. very close to town and everything you need there. first time in Marfa. can’t wait to go back!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This stay was so peaceful, quiet, restful and relaxing. I wanted a weekend in the desert to recharge and this place was the perfect setting for this. Ylana was so helpful and patient with me. Definitely want to make this an annual if not more frequent visit!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was exactly as described and perfect. I appreciated the detailed house manual, the portable light switches, awesome Bluetooth speaker, and quick and easy communication with the hosts. Highly recommended!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely LOVE this AirBNB. It’s gorgeous and complete nirvana. Had the best time!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect in its simplicity. Far enough from town to give a true sense of quiet - the sunrises, sunsets and the stars are unencumbered from this location. Close enough to town for coffee and breakfast taco runs to the Sentinel every day. I'll be back."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Worked remote here for 3 days and it was wonderful. You can tell a lot of love was put into this home. Not to mention the beautiful property and surroundings! I heard coyotes singing the first night, saw a family of road runners the next morning. Incredible sunsets and sunrises. I enjoyed exploring Marfa too - would love to return sometime! Thanks Ylana!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely spot! Exactly as described, peaceful, great location. Great attention to detail, very comfortable."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The perfect place to start the new year. Clean, close enough to town while still feeling secluded, beautiful sunrise view, overall a great stay for me and my family."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cutest place! Amazing views during sunset. Great decor!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We spent almost a week at the desert hut and found it to be a wonderful December oasis. Beautiful and remote surroundings (despite being just a 5-minute drive to Marfa’s center), extremely clean and open space. It made our family feel right at home!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Simply put, you are doing yourself a disservice if you don’t at least try to stay at this Airbnb. The space itself is immaculate and looks straight out of a catalog without feeling cliche. It’s an absolute vibe."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the second time that my family stayed at the Desert Hut. Great location, great space, great stay. We look forward to returning!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love Quonset huts so it was a treat for us to stay here. Ylanda was an incredible hostess. We actually broke down on the way there and she even posted in a local online forum to help us find a ride. The place is wonderful. The setting is what you hope for in West Texas.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a great stay! The Quonset was comfortable, clean and stylish. The only thing I would say is there should be clearer instructions on how to get the shower to work! There's a hidden lever on the bath spout you need to pull lol"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location, you could see all the stars at night! Amenities were well thought out and the space was very intentionally designed"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"There are many reasons to visit West Texas, but the open land, sky and light are on the top of my list. Ylana's hut maximizes your experience of the land and light in a way that is magical. I hope to return."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the best air bnb I have ever stayed at! The location couldn’t be better. Absolutely stunningly beautiful views all around and just 10 minutes to town. We loved watching the sun rise and set every day. The garage door really tops things off as well and makes for an incredible experience. Everything inside was pristinely clean with excellent attention to detail-including providing convenient lighting and outlets and phone charging cables! Ylana has truly thought of everything to provide a relaxing, beautiful, easy desert escape."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, amazing views, very close to town. Will definitely be back!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely to stay in a remote locale, while being close to town."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Probably the best airbnb experience I have ever had.
Clean, tidy, thoughtfully furnished.
This was the experience I wanted, and the property, the service, the attention to detail all contributed to make that happen.
I'd give 10 stars if I could"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay! 5 minutes from all the fun in Marfa. Super quiet. Super clean. Beautiful view! Can’t wait to stay here again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super easy to get to and such a lovely place to stay! Already trying to plan a longer trip back to Marfa so I can stay here again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay here. It was nice and private. Had sunrise and sunset views from the property.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stop your search and stay here!!! Literally the best, cutest, and vibiest place. We pretty much just hung out at the hut most of the time because it was so so peaceful. You have a great view of the mountains and the sunrise and our dogs had the time of their life. If you want to go to downtown, it’s literally 8 minutes away. Only downside is because it is the desert, we killed over 20 spiders. So if you’re scared of spiders.. might not be the stay for you. Us personally, it wasn’t a big deal! We will definitely be coming back 😍"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was perfect for myself and my pup Enzo! The only problem is we wished we could have stayed longer!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely lovely. Hubby and I with our dog stayed a few days. Right outside of Marfa. Takes you 5 minutes to get to downtown Marfa. Lovely dessert area. You can wake up and take long walks. House had everything needed, an iron, phone chargers, dishes, etc. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Obsessed with this place! We had a wonderful stay here. The vibe is on point and super cute! Unfortunately we didn’t get a chance to open the garage, but I’m sure that would be an amazing highlight. It was a great evening spent in Marta!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Will be back!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely stunning. A must stay while visiting Marfa!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely perfection. Feels so removed but literally insanely close to everything. The morning light inside is magical and the night vibing is soooooo goood! Completely obsessed. The most comfortable bed I’ve possibly ever slept on. Having this kind of place available as a dog option was EVERYTHING. Definitely didn’t feel like a dog place 💯
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and peaceful! Very clean and a great view!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unique and amazing experience! Would definitely be staying here again in the future. There is a lot to experience among these small towns, and the place that Ylana has created really brings out a different view of the desert. Definitely a must!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful hut with phenonmenal views for sunrise AND sunset. Everything you need for a get away. The inside was thoughtful with amenities.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hut is the perfect place for couples or singles to stay! Everything was perfect, clean and very modern. Everything was provided for - toiletries, towels, kitchenware, even phone chargers and a speaker!
I highly recommend staying at this hut for your stay in Marfa."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our restorative out in Marfa was exactly what we needed to gear up for a busy fall. This hut was the perfect spot - quiet, private, scenic, clean, organized!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very nice townhome inside just be aware it will get dusty very quick because (west tx) no grass.. alot of dust. Nothing much around but it does the job while working here and the host was very accommodating with any questions or concerns. Neighbors are friendly and parking is great! It is a little pricey but everything is here for the most part. Would recommend this home away from home
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for work stay💯💯💯💯
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was clean and had very comfortable beds. Had everything we needed for the short visit. Quiet location and friendly atmosphere. The rooms and bathrooms have enough space for 4 ppl without feeling crowded or too compact. Airbnb host is very responsive and informative during entire process. Would stay again for sure.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great communication definitely worth your money! And works however he can to help with crazy work schedules with checking in. And getting everything ready to make you as comfortable as possible. Definitely where I’ll stay every time I come to this area for work!!!

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Stayed here for a week. The pictures don’t do it justice. The place is much nicer than it looks. Very spacious two-story, 2bed, 2.5bath. Every room has its own TV. Brand new laundry and kitchen appliances. Located right next to a grocery store, United Supermarkets, that was pretty well stocked.
Depends on your reason for traveling through, but there’s not much else in the town. We needed a place in between Carlsbad Caverns, Big Bend National Park, and Marfa. Maybe in the future I would book separately for Big Bend and Carlsbad but all in all, it worked out fine."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean
Beautiful
Very Neat
Great essentials for stayers"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay in Pecos
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Samuel and Alex’s place was a nice place away from home. Was able to cook, study, hang out while we visit some places on the way to Big bend. Easy access to grocery and highway. It is middle of nowhere but he has everything you need for a stay."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay in Pecos, specially if you’re working around the area cheaper than most hotels!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for three nights while visiting the mountains and Marfa. Apartment is spacious and brand new. It was missing a few essentials, but Alex was quick to respond and stock the place up with what we needed. Would recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The trailer was cosy and very comfortable! Had everything I needed. Better for just one, a little tight for two people or a tall person. Porch was great to hang out on and the grocery store across the street was perfect and the people were great!
Loves my stay!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great experience!!!! Great host !!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We spent a few days exploring Balmorhea, Alpine & Ft. Davis. This was a lovely little place to rest in between our adventures. It felt like glamping! Look forward to staying here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a fantastic stay here! The space is exactly what's shown, and while the bathroom is small, there's a full bathroom close by if we ever wanted something else. The host was super helpful and responsive and I wish more hosts were like them! If you stay here, basically every restaurant in town (though there's not a lot) is within a short walk. One of the absolute best things is to go outside an hour after sundown and see the INCREDIBLE view of the night sky!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Last Resort was great! If I am ever back in the area I would glad stay again. Simone was a great host. Responsive, incredibly accommodating, and helpful. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and appreciated the communication."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simone was very responsive and the RV was a great place to relax after hiking in the cold weather. Detailed directions with photos on how to find the place were provided which were so helpful. It's so close to the Davis Mountains and the McDonald Observatory, as well as grocery stores and restaurants if needed. The night sky view is amazing and the super friendly gray cat was an added bonus!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Comfy, peaceful, warm & clean with great hot showers. Just off the main road so close to everything in Fort Davis and a great jumping off point to explore Marfa, Alpine and the Big Bend area. Really appreciated the separate small fenced area for the dog! Thank you!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Spent a week here in January. Everything went great. Responsive host, nice property, everything inside was clean and had clear instructions. Wi-fi was good. Was able to work using the fold-out side table. The heater worked great, it got down to about 9 degrees Fahrenheit over night but I was comfortable inside the entire time. Would recommend."

The space was well cleaned, organized, and the outdoor space was nicely groomed and unkept."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at Simone's place in the Last Resort. Perfect location for bicycling in the area, and just off the main street but very quiet. Would definitely stay here again if in the area!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I’ve stayed at numerous airbnbs over the years and what I appreciate the most about these accommodations is when owners pay close attention to the small details. This airbnb did just that and I absolutely loved it!! The mattress/sheets/bedding were top quality, the dishes and silverware were great, and the towels were super soft and plush. Those are the amenities that I appreciate the most and I would absolutely stay here again and recommend to my friends."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Hostess with the Mostess!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I did a 4 nights stay during the 4th of July weekend and loved it, and we're planning to come back next year to bring our grandchildren, I love how Simone had made this place cozy, clean and comfortable with the little space, fits everything we needed. We spent a lot of time sitting in the deck watching the sky, enjoying the weather and talking to neighbors… I love this place❤️"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Simone and her network are Amazing. Always there for help and very friendly. We have stayed at this location multiple times, it feels like home. The accommodations are well thought out and taken care of."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is a great place! Small, but big enough with just the essentials for an easy stay. Host was very responsive and helpful. A great deal!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great stay! The place was wonderful and comfy and near everything. It’s a fabulous and centrally located, and the proprietors are top-notch! We WILL be back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute little RV park just off the main road in Fort Davis - convenient location to visit the downtown shops and restaurants (2 minute drive) and state park (about 5 minutes away) and Marfa (20 minute drive). I appreciated the permanent deck and canopy over the camper and the common bathroom was pristine and nicely renovated. Simone was very responsive and detailed in her instructions on how to access the home and flattened the learning curve for some of the differences between a camper versus a hotel (water consumption, electricity, etc.) It was just the right size for my husband and I with a comfortable bed. Our two dogs loved it too!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Simone was very accommodating and we very much enjoyed our stay
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We booked a last minute trip to Fort Davis and wanted a space that we could be connected with the outdoors and bring our dogs. The camper was the perfect option to give us a camping experience with the comfort of a bed, shower and kitchen. The unit was extremely clean, super cute and newly renovated and the stand alone bathroom was super clean and is a nice perk for some privacy. We loved that we could walk into town for coffee or dinner and we are only 20 mins away from Alpine and Marfa as well as less than 10 mins from hiking in the state park. Simone was a wonderful host and was very responsive and helpful before and throughout our stay. We have already recommended this airbnb to friends and we look forward to visiting again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place for my fiancé and I to stay at while passing through. Excellent place to bring a dog! The bed was also surprisingly very comfortable. Usually camper beds make me feel stiff but this was perfect!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, clean camper close to Davis Mountains, Marfa and Big Bend."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was great! Really quiet, pet friendly, and just a simple but fun place to stay. Will definitely be booking again when I come back."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Simone was very responsive and helped us get checked in when we were in a pinch and needed a place to stay. Great location right in the middle of town. Comfortable place with everything we needed.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Simone’s place was perfect for us—right between Balmorhea state park and Marfa and right across the street from a friendly general store. The trailer has been carefully remodeled and is very comfortable. Simone was a great host!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect little place for one or two people right in the middle of all that Ft Davis has to offer. Very walkable to restaurants and shops. Love this town and this is a perfect spot. Thanks!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome bed!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,we loved this place! the trailer is so cute and our dogs loved the dog run!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simone’s place was great it was clean, bed was comfy, quiet, easy to find. Well equipped for cooking. Communication was easy with Simone. 5min walk to downtown where they have two great restaurants and souvenir stores. Would recommend to stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location and cozy stay! Highly recommend!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at cute little RV - Simone was very helpful with some car issues we had. You can easily walk to the nearby shops and restaurants in town. Would definitely recommend :)
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I traveled with my dog over the weekend which was New Year’s. There were two other RV’s occupied on either side of me so I felt safe arriving after dark. The host sent straight forward instructions and after a few tries I found the correct RV and let myself in. The 17ft space was enough for me and my dog just fine! The description doesn’t mention there being a fridge so that was nice surprise. I cannot believe how quickly we fell into comfort - good sleep, quiet mornings and a coffee maker which came handy. There’s actually a lot of storage above and under the bed and the wall has two tables installed that can stand alone or be folded down. Some nights I was able to get a signal on the emergency radio I brought with me and there were enough plugs for a lantern and electric heated blanket. It was very cold at night and in the early morning but the RV had AC/HEAT. It works well at least in December/January. Property is right off State Street and only 25-45 min from other nearby towns."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and perfect place when you need to get away and explore the entire area
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"EASIEST and most thoughtful check in ever. Best location. Extremely thoughtful kitchen, amenities, and accommodations not to mention the cutest little cozy vintage travel trailer. Perfect view inside the trailer to watch the sunrise from the fold-down table or on the large covered porch and table while sipping Simone's complimentary coffee from a local business is THE BEST EXPERIENCE! I cannot wait to return!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Even better than expected! Very comfortable! Great location, everything you need in a cute little space. Perfect for traveling with your pup ❤️ I’d definitely stay here again"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed for a night and it was great! Super cute, easy to find your way around. Walking distance to food and coffee. Would definitely stay again. Simone was a great and communicative host!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simone's little Nomad is ADORABLE!!! Way better than I expected and everything person could need was available including coffee from Bea Tea K's, a Fort Davis brochure AND a cuuute Fort Davis postcard < SO thoughtful!! Thank you, Simone for the thoughtfulness and care you put into this lovely little travel trailer home away from home. ALSO your stand-alone bathroom was epic as were the 'Feral Cats' program and seeing the CUTE KITTIES ; that says SO much about you and your heart <3"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at The Last Resort was wonderful. The trailer was so adorable with upgrades that showed attention to detail. The description was spot on so if you're new to staying in a RV, be sure to read the details. RVs are a bit different than a hotel room, but we enjoy more unique experiences! We never had any issues with hot water, heat/cooling (we really enjoyed the nightly cool breezes by opening the windows), power issues, etc. Bonus-there is a nice full size shower and bathroom on the property for guests to use, but mostly we just used the bathroom in the RV. It was perfectly sufficient for us. The bed was comfortable and surprisingly large...seemed as big as our queen at home??? The town is small with not a lot of restaurants and nightlife, but hey! it's a small town so very peaceful/relaxing. We tried Cueva de Leon and really liked the food! Not Tex Mex but more authentic, which we love. We also attended a community barn dance that was put on by the Chamber of Commerce. It was so fun to be a part of that! So be sure to read community boards and ask locals for things going on! Affordable and great place to stay if you want to enjoy the Davis Mountains, McDonald Observatory, Marfa, Alpine, etc. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you need up stay in the town of Carlsbad, this is the place. New construction. Very clean and quiet. We will be back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved staying here! This will be an Airbnb we will return to for sure!

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here many times. Great spot.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a phenomenal stay! The home is beautiful and very well kept. It was a great location and settled between a great little coffee shop and a boutique where we enjoyed some shopping. They were very responsive, Brenda was absolutely amazing. We were quite comfortable spending time in the living room, watching movies after a long day of hiking or sightseeing and even lounged around on the back patio a couple of times. Oh, the beds! Soooooo comfortable!! I highly recommend!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! The house was perfect and the host very responsive. The bakery/coffee shop two doors down is a must. The restaurant recommendations were on point. We loved eating at Lucky Bull Grill, El Jimador and Yellow Brix! We were able to hike Guadalupe Peak and Carlsbad Caverns then come back to the house and relax. We loved this part of our trip and highly recommend staying here."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super clean and in a great location! Plenty of room to stretch out and wind down after some amazing hikes. Easy check in and check out. Super responsive hosts. Brenda was great and very friendly.

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"""The Welcome Home"" Airbnb is a true gem! Located conveniently close to Carlsbad Caverns, it serves as the perfect base for adventurers. What truly stands out is the hassle-free check-out process, backed by fantastic host communication that ensures a smooth stay from start to finish. The beds? Utterly comfortable, guaranteeing a good night's sleep after a day of exploration. Its ease of location, coupled with ample parking, takes away any travel stress.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful place! It was clean, cozy and even decorated for the season. Such a great deal as well. We enjoyed it as a home base for exploring White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns, alien hunting and just hanging around town. The restaurant next door was also delicious with very friendly service (we went there every morning). Any questions we had were promptly answered by the hosts. Thank you so much!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice Host! Great place to stay and explore caverns/Guandalupe national parks which are within an hour
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a nice holiday. The beds were very comfy. We did have issues with the wifi so the tv's wouldn't hook up. The house is sooo lovely and roomy as well. Love the decorations and the furnishings. Note if you have little ones there is no baby gate or safety features on the cabinets. Also, it only has one thermostat and its downstairs. So the upstairs gets pretty warm if you set the thermostat for downstairs only. The hostess was very responsive. Overall we enjoyed our stay immensely!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place close to stores and host was so kind and responsive.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a nice home to stay, we travelled to Carlsbad to visit carven national park and took 1night stay at this place. it was super perfect just as described in the listing. Host Lyle was amazing, very responsive and clear communication. Highly recommend this place if anyone travelling to Carlsbad"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed staying at Lyle’s house. He had plenty of room for our van and trailer. We also enjoyed relaxing in front of the large flat screen TV. It was just what we needed to accompany our stay to the caverns.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hands down, this is probably the nicest place you will find on Airbnb in all of Carlsbad. New property, well maintained and cleaned (cleaned by the owners). Not only that, but it is in a prime location. Walking distance to the grocery store, and a very nice cafe (Blue House Cafe) literally one house over for coffee and breakfast. We had their breakfast burritos and salsa, and it was wonderful. Lyle and company were very responsive and accommodating. We ended up booking last minute due to issues we had with 2 other properties on another site. You will not be disappointed."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely house. Everything was really clean. Thank you!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Owner was very responsive, house was clean and accommodating for a large family, and the location was fantastic with a local breakfast café next door and Carlsbad Caverns less than 40 minutes away.

After searching for Aliens, shopping and eating we had such a clean, comfortable, place to rest. There were suggested restaurants which we used and were amazed. The pillows were the best! We all slept very well wow! It was super clean and comfortable without clutter. We will definitely go back another time.Bravo!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely beautiful house. Lovely decor and space for everyone. Nice kitchen space and dining area. Morning bakery located nextdoor. Grill and secluded patio for outdoor grilling. Very clean house. Definitely a value.
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is amazing! We stayed with a family of 8, 3 adults 4 teens and a toddler and we had plenty of space and could have probably been comfortable with a few more. The home is absolutely beautiful, clean and well decorated. The hosts were awesome. We ran out of propane and they had a new one in a few minutes. The location is perfect. Two spaces down is an amazing local coffee/breakfast place and one block down there is a grocery store with a Starbucks inside. We stayed wile visiting Carlsbad caverns but because the home is so close to beach park we also spent some time there as well"
2020-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Really nice house close to the Carlsbad lake. Nice quiet neighborhood. Close to this friendly bakery

2020-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay at this property 100%! There was plenty of space for our group of five, and such a lovely, nicely decorated home. Everything was very clean. The beds, pillows and linens were super comfy. Lots of big TVs! We walked to the cafe next door for breakfast every day, and went to the Caverns, hiked the Guadalupe Mountains and visited Roswell."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our first time to use Airbnb and we were beyond pleased! The home was great and immaculate and warm and cozy. We highly recommend it!

2020-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Due to some not great weather, our initial plan of camping at Carlsbad Caverns didn’t work out so we’ll... but no worries because this space was a great substitute. Really nice, clean, and close to downtown. The little cafe next door is great for breakfast."

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best three bedroom available in Carlsbad.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Brad and Melissa's response time was amazing. We requested a few things that we would like to have in the kitchen and within one hour Brad was at the door with a basket full of all the brand new items that we requested. The house was spacious, modern, and had many different styles of beds to fit our comfort needs from firm to soft and in between. The kitchen had plenty of counter space for us to prepare all of our meals. The living room was great with the large T.V. and comfortable reclining sofa set. Bathrooms were clean and spacious as well. It was also nice to have a separate laundry room so we wouldn't have to wash all of clothes when we got back home. Having a comfortable clean spacious modern house to come back to after being out all day really made our vacation that much better. Even though we were just two people in such a large house we could see how it could still be perfect for larger groups of six to eight people. The only minor downside was the internet being slow or offline for short spells but with a little patience we were still able to get our office work done and stream movies and sports on the huge T.V. with the Amazon Fire Stick. If we ever come back to Carlsbad again we would hope this house is available."
2019-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed the house. The layout is great. The beds were very comfortable. The host was very prompt with their communications even responding during our stay to a specific issue. Directly next door is a small cafe that has coffee, pastries and full breakfast in the morning.
I recommend parking behind the home in the parking spot rather than on the street.
I did recommend that the host increase their wireless speed. Perhaps it was just the provider’s speed the night we were there but it wasn’t capable of streaming a show on the TV that evening."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house is very nice with great furnishings. The patio in the back is great for relaxing. It is very clean. I would highly recommend this place.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, beautiful home. We were a large group and they noticed right away and brought extra towels and blankets. Very lovely people. If we go back to Carlsbad we will definitely be staying here again"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent hosts, beautiful new home, perfect for our 2 night stay in Carlsbad. The hosts went above and beyond and communication was stellar. Thank you."
2019-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were 8 of us and stayed here for one night. There was plenty of space for all of us ( essentially 3 families). The house seems quite new and contemporary, which we liked. The location is convenient as well - right next door is a grocery store.
Overall a great stay!!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and New. Comfortable home with nice open concept that we really enjoyed.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a very nice place and nice people! Can’t wait to book again with Lyle!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic property!! This was our first Airbnb experience. I would have to say we will never ever see another hotel room again while in Carlsbad. We already have three other stays booked at this wonderful property. The host along with Airbnb make this too easy. All the comforts of home
Thanks"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Home was brand new, breaking it in for the hosts, very comfortable, host was accommodating, gave us a late check out thou we left earlier than required, we worked through a few things because house hadn't been used yet but it all worked out great anyway."
,,,Great stay! Clean. Awesome view. Thoughtful. Provided nice extras like muffins coffee and chocolate.
,,,"I think this is the first time I left a 1 star review in years on Airbnb. Three issues. First, the door lock is obscenely hard to figure out, even with the instructions on the front door. It took me about 5 minutes of frustration to finally get it open. Second, the place was FREEZING. They have a wall unit in there but it is not nearly sufficient enough to heat the place up. I had to sleep in full clothes under blankets and I was still cold. Lastly, there doesn’t appear to be a water heater so good luck with the shower. The water was freezing, even after turning it all the way to warm and the same applied to the sink. I had to skip the shower. Also, I just want to say since “freezing” and “cold” are subjective that I’m a 30 year old dude and can handle uncomfortable. When I say cold, I mean the water was ice bath cold and did not budge. Overall, I would NOT recommend staying here unless they fix issues that are frankly fundamental to anyone renting out their property."
