2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"It's a fair bit out of the way, but the view and bungalow are both great. Love the amenities like the bidet, solar, EV charger, oatmeal packets, and hammock. Friendly hosts."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was a wonderful and unique place to stay! The landscape was beautiful! Would recommend a car that can handle turns and gravel road, as the trek to the bungalow was a little iffy with a small car. It was a beautiful and fun place to stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mauricio's place was perfect!
It was very nice and clean.
I was so impressed by how much Mauricio think of the natute.
I think the quality of the water is nice. My hair got very soft texture now :)
She also provided lots of information like Hilo's restaurants and good places.
I am glad that my husband and I could make lots of memorable moments while staying at Mauricio's place :)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"a wonderful accommodation in the middle of nature high above hilo.
Very comfortably furnished.
Paola was a very nice and sympathetic hostess. She showed us the whole property, the plants and fruits. She was also able to tell us a lot about the surroundings and history. It is more than just a place to stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We spent only one night here but absolutely loved it. The space has everything you need and the grounds are gorgeous! You would never know that this was just 15 minutes from Hilo and all the city has to offer!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved meeting Mauricio and Paolo! They were the perfect host and learning about their story and how they got to where they are was incredible. You can tell how passionate they were about Hawai’i and our Mother Earth. We did not want to leave and wished we stayed longer, we will definitely be back with my mom and our new baby in the future!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! What an amazing place! Pictures really don’t do it justice. The place was beautiful and serene and I wish we could have stayed there longer. The hosts were very helpful and quick to respond. They even offered us oranges from the field when they were harvesting. We would definitely stay again given the opportunity!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved to view and surroundings. So peaceful, wish we could stay longer. Really close to Lavaloha Chocolate Farm if you are looking to do a tour."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Mauricio and Paula’s bungalow was the height of our vacation. The AIR unit is beautiful and the bed super comfy. This peaceful and lush location is fantastic. They are doing an amazing job creating beauty on their land. And they could not have been friendlier or more caring of and attentive to us and our needs. I can’t recommend this enough!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the most unique airbnb's I've stayed at. Truly a great experience all around and I will return with my friends if we're lucky enough to get a night again. A little out of town but it is worth it for the views and quietness of it all.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Best place to stay in or around Hilo! Incredible views, cleanliness and kindness. You will be LUCKY if you can book a night here. :)"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at Paola and Mauricio's bungalow was amazing! Paola greeted us on arrival and was so welcoming, friendly and informative. She told us all about her little Eco Village and you can tell it's a true passion project for her and her husband. The bungalow was gorgeous, immaculate and beautifully decorated. The surroundings were peaceful and had wonderful views of Hilo Bay and the city below. We loved the location being on a quiet mountainside while also being just a short 15 minute drive to the city. We wish we'd had more time to stay in our little bungalow and will definitely be back if we ever visit Hilo again! Mahalo/Gracias, Paola!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a fantastic, peaceful retreat. The owners put their heart into the design and are kind to share their oasis. Make sure to talk to them; they have great tips on where to go and are great conversationalists. Take a walk around the property; it’s very relaxing. The location is perfect for day trips on the island's east side, including Volcano Park. The town has a few good food spots but can be a little gritty, which magnifies the benefits of staying on this property."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely gorgeous place . It was magical and the host were lovely.
A perfect mixture of modern yet rustic outdoors."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay! The hosts were very friendly and responsive. They were available on-site if needed which was reassuring. They also had even more offerings than listed (coffee, oatmeal, first aid basic needs, bug repellant).
I will definitely be recommending this Airbnb to friends and family!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Paola and Mauricio’s guest house. Details of the place are so well thought out, you can tell the moment you step inside that there has been a lot of thought put in! We had a wonderful conversation upon our arrival and got to partake in feeding of their sheep! However, since the previous night’s guest left the interior string lights on we were unable to enjoy them ourselves which was disappointing. There were also several unwritten house rules/requests that we were happy to accommodate but made us feel somewhat restricted while we were there. That being said, we would definitely return to Paola and Mauricio’s place and we appreciate the opportunity to stay with them!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the most unique Airbnbs I've stayed in. The hosts were very helpful in providing clear instructions on how to reach the unit. We were lucky to learn about and experience their renewable project. The place was very clean and well designed. Highly recommend as it will add a lot of value to your trip!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Stunning…if you have the chance to stay here while visiting in Hilo definitely do. This place is awesome! We were sadly was only able to stay for a night but it was the perfect addition to our trip to Hilo. The sunrise was perfect from the hammock. We had the chance to meet the friendly owners Paula and Mauricio. Their mission is to reforest and plant native fruits and plants back to the Aina. The completely self sustaining bungalows are one way they fund this admirable project. I also got to pet a sheep on their farm!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful stay with great people! Paula and Maurice were delightful hosts who are clearly passionate about the land. Cozy, well crafted stay with beautiful views over Hilo and the bay. Loved wondering the acres and learning about the different plants and trees being grown . Will book again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mauricio and Paola’s place was the perfect getaway from the hustle of Hilo! Feels like a different world once you pass the gate and into the quiet farm lands! Loved the eco concept and appreciated all the hard work that goes into living off grid! Very quick responses and Paola was very sweet! The sunrise was beautiful!!! Thank you so much! We can’t wait to visit again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is in the middle of the woods and grass in a beautiful setting, very quiet, the host service was warm and thoughtful, gave us a briefing on the local situation and had the opportunity to definitely stay again.Thank You very much."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a taste of the extraordinary experience and enjoyed it.The starry sky at night was the most beautiful!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The bungalow was cute and had incredible views in the morning. It is located in the farm lands. You do have to punch a code in at the bottom of the hill after a certain time since it is located in a gated community. We didn’t have much trouble with this except one night someone was blocking the entrance. Not sure what they were doing. But also didn’t want to get out the car at 12am in the dark. So we just waited patiently. The road up to the bungalows go from paved to gravel and for some portions can accommodate only 1 car. We saw wild pigs on our drive up to the bungalows late at night which was amusing until we had to get out the car to unlock the gate at the bungalow. Haha. Bring a flashlight if you’ll be back late. In order to secure it, you have to grab both gates and wrap a bike lock around. I would highly recommend upgrading to an electric gate. Otherwise, the hosts were amazing. They were friendly and offered helpful tips. They even left the porch light on for us."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very remote, peaceful, cozy for two. Country setting Up above it all.. Finishes inside lodging top quality"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and area. Kind host. Bed was very very hard though!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A very cozy and clean bungalow with beautiful views of Hilo!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stayed. Beautiful and peaceful.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mauricio's place is one of a kind place to stay for a vacation in Hilo. It is located within farmer's community which is unique experience. We truly enjoyed our stay. This property has made our vacation in Hilo more interesting and unforgettable. Highly recommended.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I couldn't be happier with our decision to stay at the ECO village during our visit to Hilo. 10/10
The bungalow itself was very clean, well thought out, intimate and comfortable but the real treasure is the property, views and most importantly the hosts Mauricio and Paola. They are very welcoming, friendly and honest and good people. We loved our interactions with them and wish we got more time to enjoy their company.
The property is full of many new trees that are labeled and Mauricio said we were welcome to walk about and explore and he let my daughter pick some fruit which she absolutely loved.
The views of Hilo in the morning from the patio with my coffee was absolutely my favorite part. Paola was kind enough to give us a list of recommendations for the rest of our trip when departing which was appreciated.
We highly recommend this location to couples traveling through Hilo and hope to be back one day."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What beautiful place! Such a warm host! It’s near everything yet away from the city. You can easily just hang out without going outside if it rains.
Be sure to get there before dark. Be aware that there is no hair dryer."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We came to Hilo after a long day hike at Volcano National Park and requested a same day booking. The host responded right away and was very welcoming when we arrived. We woke up to watch the beautiful sunrise and enjoyed walking the property, looking at the trees, and drinking coffee on the patio taking in the view :). The hosts were so nice and they have created a very special place here. I would definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,What a beautiful place. So peaceful with beautiful ocean views. The room was wonderful and I love how they focus on sustainability with solar and rain water collection. Paola was lovely !
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the best Airbnb stays!!! Mauricio and Paola were amazing. The space itself was magical.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's a great place to stay with a breathtaking view of the coastline.
Particularly noteworthy is that the hosts gave us a very friendly welcome.
We have received from you own apple bananas to eat. Super tasty. We were also invited to reap all the fruits for consumption.
Furthermore, the ecological structure with rainwater use and solar energy should be mentioned.
If the way to Big Island takes us again, we would love to be guests with these amazing people on your impressive property again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The wife and I were looking for a place to unplug and unwind from our normally busy routine. Mauricio’s place met our needs perfectly. Its beautifully designed bungalow set atop a hill provided spectacular views of Hilo town and a beautiful sunrise each morning. Its almost isolated location provided the peace and serenity we were looking for. Our host provided detailed instructions upon our arrival to the Big Island. Upon arrival to the eco village we were greeted by host who gave us a brief overview of the property. We love knowing that our stay was helping Mauricio’s goal of re-foresting the island. We would definitely return.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our couple has stayed in many Airbnbs around the world for over 10 years, but this place gave us a lot of inspiration and a curiosity to live. Even though the weather was unusable with rainy days during our stay, it created a fantastic atmosphere. The view from the bed every morning was enough to make travelers leaving home feel comfortable, and the post-breakfast walk was even better. We clearly say that this is a place we want to visit again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view is unbeatable!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely a beautiful home! Quiet and peaceful. Mauricio met me when I came and showed me around. The place was just about perfect. The only thing for me was the gate into the property. I was traveling solo so I had to get out to open and close it and I struggled in the rain. But that’s probably more user error haha.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,It's really an amazing experience here. I like Paola very much. She is beautiful and smart. And she's very kind. The room is pretty new and clean. The view is the best in Hilo. I'll miss everything in Paola' house.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a truly unforgettable experience with Mauricio and Paola! They are some of the kindest, friendliest people I have ever met and their property is stunning. Whenever I find myself in Hilo again I absolutely plan on rebooking here!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was incredible! It’s nestled up above the city of Hilo in a very private area. The view is incredible and Mauricio and his wife are wonderful hosts! The home was spotless and super unique. We had a wonderful stay and they went above and beyond to accommodate us!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful location and all the amenities we needed for a one night stay. Views were amazing! Would highly recommend
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was in a peaceful location with stunning views. It was such a great place to relax and take in the surrounding nature. Host was very accommodating and communicative.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"It is my pleasure to be the earliest Chinese guest in this house!We stayed here for one night and as the last stop of the Big Island event, we didn't have any special activities arranged this day, just to slow down life and enjoy the feeling of a day's vacation.I also highly recommend everyone to do that, this place is so worth it!When you come by car, you will pass the iron gate of the ""private area"", and you usually see this sign that you have to take a detour, but now you can drive your own car to enter, as if you have opened the gate of the new world.The house is on a grassland, with many new seedlings planted in the middle, and it is a grand blueprint made by the host and wife during the pandemic, making this grass a forest!They have been working hard for this for three years, and the small forest has begun to take shape. Don't hesitate to witness it!The landlord and wife are very welcoming. We talked for a while before checking out in the morning. We marveled at their legendary life. I really want to stay here for a few more days. Looking forward to the next time the trees are long and tall!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay with Paola and Mauricio was pure bliss. The sunrise from the huge sliding doors seen from the bed was breathtaking. I wish we chose to stay on the east side of the BI longer just so we could stay at this airbnb for a few more nights. The property is incredible, and the hosts are so welcoming and wonderful. Paula gave us wonderful recommendations for things to do, and was an absolute pleasure to chat with in general. The space was as described, and the surroundings are absolutely beautiful. This is a wonderful airbnb for a couple that wants to stay in a tranquil, quiet area to unwind that's off the beaten path. We hope to stay again in the future!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Best experience ever, they kindly pick us up at Hilo, can’t wait to come back again and bring more friends to come here, excellent"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in this wonderful place has been magic. Mauricio and Paola are the best hosts we could have ever wished. They made us feel like we were at home, showing us their beautiful project and the real vibe of Hawaii. Our little house was perfect, really close to Hilo, so clean and new, well designed to recharge our energies. The best thing is that you feel like you are in the middle of the paradise, with sea views, a huge garden with trees and animal sounds which is really relaxing, but it is just 10 minutes away from Hilo, where you can find restaurants, supermarkets and everything you need. We will repeat for sure, we have fallen in love with that place, mahalo Mauricio and Paola."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is fantastic. The view is wonderful and the room is beautifully decorated. Both power and hot water come from solar panels. Paola and Mauricio were very friendly and we had an amazing time. We look forward to going back to Hawaii and staying at their place.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mauricio and Paola are truly inspiring! Their mission is powerful and they’re doing Mother Nature proud. The bungalow is incomparable with the serenity, cleanliness, and views it provides. They were also so understanding and accommodating to our needs. Don’t hesitate to book this place. I hope to be able to have the opportunity to stay with Paola and Mauricio again as this place was heavenly!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mauricio and Paula were wonderful hosts and their place was beautiful and a wonderful spot to stay for a few days. It’s very relaxing and still just 8 min from Hilo if you need anything. If you are looking for a quiet getaway, this is the place. Would definitely stay there again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great restful overnight stay. Bungalow was well appointed and provided an awesome view of the night sky.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The place is beautiful! The actual lodging was perfect for what we needed. They have everything you need and it was quite beautiful and clean. Mauricio and Paula are very nice and helpful. Great stay away from downtown Hilo but not too far at all.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was happy to stay at Mauricio's Eco Village bungalow. It is a beautiful place to connect with nature, peaceful and a great view."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is an absolute must! The views of Hilo Bay are incredible with good trade winds in and out of the bungalow. The bungalow is beautiful with ample natural lighting, situated to showcase the views from in and out of the room. The room was very clean and decorated beautifully with lots of details. The entire property is eco-friendly using solar power and natural rain water. The location is in a gated farming community that was fairly easy to find with GPS. There is a chocolate farm less than a mile away that offers tours and Kulaniapia Falls about a mile away as well. Downtown Hilo is a short drive down the mountain that made it easy to find food and drinks. Mauricio and Paola are gracious hosts and very accomodating. They are an incredible couple with an amazing story! Their mission is to give back to the island and restore its natural beauty starting with this property! All proceeds go back into this sanctuary. We will return for sure if only to visit our new found friends!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredibly beautiful property! We loved our east-side Hawaii experience so much because of our stay herr. The property is incredible and waking up to it laid out in front of your unit with views of Hilo and the ocean and the clouds behind it was so lovely. After being in Kailua-Kona for a week, this was such a fascinating change of ecosystems (both sides have their unique beauty!)
The unit is so comfortable and well appointed. It was built by Mauricio and Paola and the love they pour into it shows. It has everything you need to sleep well, clean up and rest and then wake up and have coffee. So many nice details like a French press in the unit, dishware, and toiletries.
We enjoyed talking with the both of them and learning about their lives and their recommendations. We can’t recommend this property enough!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you to Paola and Mauricio for such a wonderful stay. Their property is a great opportunity to reconnect with nature and appreciate the gorgeous island. We look forward to our next stay :)
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"If I were given an option to stay in 5 star hotel vs this place for same cost, I’d chose this bnb. Words can’t describe the place and experience. Paola and his husband are very warm and welcoming. Best sunrise in Hilo for sure. Only thing to take care before coming here is having food in hand as there’s no restaurant nearby.
Definitely coming back with family next vacation. I am very happy that my money went to the people who decided to take care of Mother Nature and I feel like helping them a little by staying here.
10/10 score."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark and Alex have a wonderful garden oasis and the perfect ohana suite. We stayed 5 nights and were completely comfortable and had everything we needed. This place is magical, peaceful and beautiful. Thank you Mark and Alex, we will be back to see the finished chicken coop and koi pond!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Such a special property to share with the hosts. Their gardens are just magnificent. Mark & Alex responded quickly to all our communications. As a precious Airbnb host, I was very pleased with this Ohana."

The garden is spectacular, early morning and evening wandering were a highlight for us!
Thank you Mark and Alex for sharing your beautiful space :)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and spacious place. They were responsive and addressed our questions right away.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark and Alex’s home was a little paradise!

Would love to come back during my next visit. Really appreciate how kind Mark and Alex are as well :)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lush botanical garden springs from the volcanic ash…. A result of Alex’s extreme efforts In gardening are awe-inspiring!

Hilo is full of happy surprises. Go there you will be blown away!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay and their beautiful garden. I loved listening to the night birds and frogs!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark and Alex have done a fantastic job with the landscaping and it felt like we were staying in a rainforest retreat.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark and Alex were fantastic hosts; they proactively communicated, were thoughtful, and gave you space. We enjoyed walking through the gardens, use of the kitchenette, and the lanai. The only thing I’m sad about was not getting to see the chonky/ fluffy black cat we saw once again! We’ll definitely keep this on our short list when we come to the Big Island again and have already recommended it to friends and family.
Mahalo Mark and Alex, and a hui hoa!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had such a lovely stay at Mark & Alex's place! I was blown away by their communication - they were extremely proactive and very helpful. We didn't get to chat with them much over our quick two-night stay (which is a bummer because they seemed awesome!) but they sent multiple helpful messages via the Airbnb app and I knew that I could ask them anything. Their garden is exceptionally beautiful, the beds and pillows are very comfortable, the curtains block out all light, and there was a lot of space for my toddler daughter to run around and play in the center of the room (no sharp edges either). Everything was as described and we'd definitely stay again if visiting this side of the Big Island!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mark and Alex's place is possibly the best in Hilo! They were very responsive and easy to contact. We had a peaceful stay and the guest suite is nicely decorated. The backyard garden is a plus. Location is also very good. Highly recommended.

It was great to have a nice, clean place to stay and we loved the array of beautiful plants just outside our window and all over the grounds to enjoy. I was especially impressed to see that the windows must have been recently cleaned which added to beauty of the yard as we looked out. They even had a 5 gallon bottle of filtered water with a spout inside as an extra touch. Alex met us the first day and gave us tour of the yard, taking time to tell us about the many different kinds of plants and trees on the property. He was really nice and made us feel very comfortable."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark and Alex were great hosts! Their place is very nice! Updated, very clean and very comfortable. Easy access in and out. Great neighborhood.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay here. Super clean and Mark and Alex were very responsive. I chose the location to be close to Volcanoes National Park and it was super easy to get there early for a day of hiking.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay at Mark and Alex’s place. They are wonderful hosts and made us feel very welcome. They provided us clear instructions on getting to their place, so it was easy to find. The guest suite itself is lovely. It is clean, cosy, quiet and private. We really appreciated the large drinking water container provided in the suite, given that the tap water in Hawaii doesn’t have the best taste. This was a very nice touch. The garden surrounding the suite is a piece of paradise. I spent a good few hours wondering through it, admiring the variety of plants and searching for critters to photograph. It was such a treat to have it right outside of your doorstep. I want to say that I was so surprised that there were no mosquitoes around given that it’s quite wet and tropical environment. Mark and Alex’s place is very well located between the volcano park, biodiversity reserve, Akaka and rainbow falls, Hilo, Richardson park and other beaches. This is the place you gotta book!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Exactly as advertised, wonderful neighbourhood, access to the garden with easy host communication.
Would come back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. The room was spacious, clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed (literally!). The most delightful aspects were the thoughtful, little details: the white noise machine, the bathroom night light, the glassware, the umbrella and ponchos, the guestbook, the beach towels, and on. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little place to stay, perfectly situated between hilo and VNP so it made things easy for me"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really homely and cost-effective accomodation on the big island. Hosts were super chill.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,perfect
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the location is at south of Hilo, 10 minutes drive to major supermarket and restaurants. many beaches and farms nearby. the zoo and Mauna Loa factory are must check. The room is in the botanic and there are so many hummingbirds. they tweeted at night and get quiet over 12 AM. when we listene to the sounds and look at the starry light. it is what we think of the big island, all about nature and the universe. compared to the lodging cost of Kona side, Hilo side is much more affordable. And it's the same distance if driving from where you stay to the summit or volcano park, probably Hilo is more close. We will choose Hilo side again next time and probably stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our 3 day stay here! The location was ideal for our visits to VNP and the Botanical Reserve. Coffee under the gazebo in the gorgeous garden with the crowing of nearby roosters was a perfectly peaceful way to start each day. The room is very bright, spacious, and impeccably clean. Beds and pillows are super comfy! This was our first visit to Hawaii, and it was great to have the opportunity to chat with Mark and Alex about life on the Big Island. Look no further - this is a little slice of heaven."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed every part of our stay! The house is really clean and comfortable. Thank you for the great place!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark and Alex’s place was perfect! It was like a little home oasis away from home. Finally had a spot with a nightlight in the bathroom so when my 6mo pregnant self got up 5 times throughout the night I didn’t have to blind myself by turning on all the lights! Lol. But truly it was a spectacular little abode. We absolutely loved all the little lizard and snail friends outside too!
Thank you for a great stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is impeccable, very comfortable, the garden is very nice and feels a lot of tranquility, the bed is comfortable and everything works perfectly. It is 25 minutes from Hilo by car, so you should have a car to go to the tourist sites and restaurants. Excellent place to rest."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, quiet location, it was the perfect place to get through our jetlag. The garden is simply phenomenal. Easy to visit the Volcanos national park, Hilo, and the Akaka falls. Look no further to stay in the area."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Mark and Alex's Airbnb was fantastic. Amenities were as described and incredibly spacious for two people. The property is beautifully landscaped, and could tell they took a lot of time and pride to beautify their location. This area is located in an excellent spot of Hilo that is quiet and peacful, and also not too far away from any of the usual local spots.
Mark and Alex were very helpful, responsive hosts, able to provide ample suggestions on what to do locally and where to eat. One such suggestion was a botanical garden hiking trail which leads people through a gorgeous tropical preserve that showcases the rich biodiversity and local history of the big island.
Overall we had a wonderful stay and phenomenal experience. This is the kind of Airbnb stay that would make any trip to Hilo worthwhile in very postive ways. The next time we visit Hilo, we would definitely consider staying here again."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark and Alex offer an excellent value at their place in Keeau! The place is private and quiet, offering a very Hawaiian setting on the Big Island as you find yourself wrapped in the lush garden they maintain. The unit has a very new air conditioning system and updated appliances/fixtures. The bed offers a serene sleeping experience in comfort and environment (even napping during the day was a wonderful experience). There’s brochures for recommendations to local attractions and the hosts are keen on making sure you have everything you need. You will have a dedicated parking space on the property along with a gate remote for easy ingress and egress. The hosts were absolutely the best, offering very helpful local tips and suggestions for exploring the area, food options and making the most of your stay. If you are in the area, I highly recommend this airbnb for everything it offers at a great value."

It's a 20-25 minute drive to downtown, and I recommend stopping by the farmer's market before Wednesday.There are no street lights in the alley to the house, so I don't know if I'm not familiar with Koreans, but it's okay if it gets completely dark once I go during the day and adjusts. The garden is beautiful, so it's fun to wake up in the morning."

They provided many helpful brochures and maps of the island, as well as plenty of towels, dishes, extra sunscreen and space to hang your clothes if needed. There is a beautiful backyard and sitting area, although we never took advantage of it because we were so busy touring the island. The location was perfect for our itinerary. We were very happy that we took the time to go to the Hilo Hawaiian Tropical Botanical Garden. The walking path goes down to the ocean and has some amazing views and the flora and fauna are gorgeous - we highly recommend it! We also highly recommend this place!
Thank you, Mark and Alex!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can't beat the location, just south of Hilo in a quiet and residential area. Great home base for us during our 1 week on the island. We have a family of 3 and were able to stay comfortably here. Nice garden, Mark and Alex are very helpful hosts and respond quickly to messages. Very affordable and made us feel less like tourists and more like we lived there!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place overall, definitely recommended. Let me quickly break it down into the details:
The good:
- Place is quite new, cozy and has most of the things you will need
- Parking spot is right by the entrance
- Has a very good ceiling A/C system
- Very quiet with nice garden views and privacy
- Comfortable bedding
The not so good:
- Wi-Fi is very slow, Verizon cellular from my phone was much faster
- No washer/dryer
Overall it was a very pleasant experience and I can definitely recommend it if you don't mind the small issues described above"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a delightful stay! Check-in was easy. The space was very clean and we loved falling asleep to the sound of coquis. Hilo and Volcano NP were both easy to get to. Would definitely stay here again.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay and we really enjoyed the views and sounds of the garden, during our stay. We loved how Mark and Alex thought about the guest and how to make them feel welcome. Would highly recommend this property, if you are staying in the Hilo area!!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this place is amazing. The garden, the room, the personal touches, and the serenity. Very quiet area, tons of birds and wildlife in the garden that you can watch from the windows. Alex and Mark are truly kind and genuine people. They make sure you have what you need in the room and it's very clean. They really thought of everything. We truly enjoyed our stay here at this peaceful, remote location away from noise and light pollution. It's a bit of a drive to grocery stores and Hilo (about 20 to 30 min) but it's worth it. At night if the skies are clear you get a beautiful view of the stars. If I'm ever in the area again, I'd stay here in a heartbeat!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this Airbnb! Wish we could’ve stayed longer.
Airbnb was very clean and had a great modern look/feel. Host provided easy to follow instructions on how to find the place. One of the only airbnbs we stayed at around the island that had a/c!
Great location as well near Hilo & Volcanoes National Park."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Navigation couldn't get me there, but Mark and Alex had sent detailed instructions in advance and those worked great. This was a lovely stay, I hope to stay again on my next trip to the island. Thank you!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing airbnb with even more amazing hosts! They are so fun and have an amazing garden! This place is a great launching point for exploring the island!

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this place was perfect: the backyard garden, the fence securing a private driveway and entrance, a garden gazebo within a few feet of the unit, and a quick drive to Hilo and beaches. We stayed here for 5 says and explored the entire island, using Mark and Alex’s airbnb as home base."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Was above and beyond are expectations! 100% would stay here again. Beautiful place inside and out! Paradise!!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best airbnb that we have ever stayed in. Mark and Alex's attention to detail made our stay extremely comfortable.

If you are looking for a place that is comfortable, quiet, and relaxing, you should stay at this airbnb!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Great location. Great hosts! Highly recommend!!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark and Alex's guest suite provides a relaxing respite in a beautifully landscaped setting. As hosts, Mark and Alex communicate nicely and quickly, offering suggestions for sightseeing, restaurants, etc. The suite itself is comfortable and complete - their description and photos accurately describe the home. Please note that the location is about 5-8 miles from Hilo and Pahoa, so if you want a quiet place away from lots of activity, the location of their oasis offers an opportunity to disconnect and refresh."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mark and Alex’s place was amazing. Exceptionally clean and a very convenient location between Hilo and Volcanoes National Park !

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great value for a very clean and modern guest house. Location was also perfect for us as it was not too far away from stores or the attractions we wanted to visit. I'm book marking this stay and recommending to everyone I know as the place to stay if they visit The Big Island!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to have the most amazing stay in the Hilo side, book this place immediately. I stayed at many Airbnbs and this one is definitely one of the top for so many reasons. Mark and Alex are incredible hosts, and staying at their place was paradise. They have everything you need and more, they have thought of everything, and we only wish we had more time to explore their beautiful property. We would definitely come back to stay again! Ooh and also, clean as a whistle!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb is the best place I have ever stayed! The garden is so beautiful!! The place is clean and quiet! Mark and Alex are so nice, you can ask them any questions! I encourage to stay!! If I have any chance come back, I will stay here again!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy studio. The garden is so adorable.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My only regret in staying here is that I didn't book for a longer stay. WHAT A FABULOUS PLACE!! Mark and Alex went above and beyond stocking the place with all the comforts one needs. The garden, out door seating area and inside space is lovely. Could very comfortably be a space for 3, although just 2 of us stayed. Perfect place to stay if planning to visit Hilo. Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,EXCELLENT AirBnB! We highly recommend staying here. The space was spotless and felt very luxurious and comfortable. We particularly liked lounging on the big couch :) We use AirBnB a lot when we travel and this was definitely one of the best places we have ever stayed. Book now- you won't regret it!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A clean and well maintained property with beautiful gardens

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely unit with a great view. We loved watching the surfers below and falling asleep to the peaceful sounds of the ocean, birds, and Coqui’s. Very close to town and the Hawaiian Tropical Botanical Reserve which is not to be missed."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Leigh was a wonderful host and even let us check in early to accommodate our early arrival. The views of the coastline from her home is breathtaking. I would definitely want to stay here again on my future trips to Hilo.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leigh was a wonderful host and we would love to stay again! Leigh greeted us, pointed out where the space to stay was located and it did not disappoint during our stay!
The location was a ten minute drive to the downtown core, but was private enough where you were not at all disrupted by sounds from the road.
The views from the living quarters were breathtaking with a view of the water, and the living space was immaculately kept and well-equipped making our stay very comfortable. Everything felt very clean.
Leigh was always available for questions, and gave us a lot of excellent local recommendations for our stay. All in all, a fantastic stay, and we appreciate your kindness Leigh!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy stay just outside of downtown Hilo. Beautiful waves and scenery outside. Highly recommend!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place! We enjoyed going to sleep with ocean sounds. During the nice weather at night we could hear music from the beach, and it quieted down when it started to rain. Loved the view!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leigh's ""surfer's paradise"" was just that! Neither my wife nor I are surfers, but we enjoyed the outstanding view of the bay below filled with surfers and boogey boarders. Just part of the spectacular views.
The place is very comfortable and looks just like the pictures. We had a great two nights there with a marvelous breeze felt through the many windows. We would go back in a heartbeat, I wish I was still there instead of at home writing this note.
Just a quick addition, this may not be everybody's dream as the kitchen area has no water, must use water from the bathroom sink. We found it to be no problem. One more water issue, it takes forever and I mean forever for the hot water in the shower to get hot, but when it did, it was fine, though the water pressure could be stronger.
Very minor issue compared to the enjoyment we experience staying with Leigh. Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend Leigh's Airbnb! We would definitely stay again! You can't beat the location for the price it's a magical experience being able to overlook Honolii beach from above!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location to see the Volcano National Park! A lot of options to eat near by. The view, especially at sunrise, is amazing. You can watch the surfers start to show up around that time as well. Would stay again"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a great place. The surf was great to watch, lovely garden and a great space Leigh has! It’s really homely and Leigh the host is so nice and helpful! We visited the volcanos and the botanical garden and waterfalls all were easy to reach from the accommodation. We would definitely recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leigh was so friendly and helpful, before and after check-in. The bed was super comfy. You’ll hear some noise, as Leigh and her family live upstairs, but nothing crazy, and everything quiets down by sleep hours. The best part is being able to hear the ocean in your room at night, the most soothing lullaby. It was rainy while I was in Hilo but that ocean view can’t be beat."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay. Will definitely be back.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying here during the first part of my trip to big island! Such a nice place, so quiet, and the view from the outside is just amazing!
Really close to the center of Hilo with everything you need to have a great time visiting the island!"
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Charming but basic accomadation with beautiful scenery
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a great place to stay! Her place is gorgeous and so peaceful! We loved the location and the view!! We were very comfortable and Leigh is so friendly. I highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"loved this Airbnb, the room and space was comfy and had everything we needed. the views were amazing and was great to enjoy our breakfast too."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s the little,touches that always gets me and Leigh had a few up her sleeve 😀"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Leigh’s place! Greta location, felt cozy, view was absolutely amazing to wake up to and super close to restaurants!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leigh was a wonderful host, very welcoming and easy going. Her daylight basement was very clean and comfortable. We arrived at night and during a torrential down pour so carrying our luggage down to the room was a bit of a struggle...another light for the step down and a walkway to the room would have made it easier. We enjoyed meeting Leigh & her husband. They were nice to spend some time talking to us and gave some local beach and restaurant recommendations. We really enjoyed the botanical gardens ($30 each well worth it), Mauna Loa Macadamia nut tour, Lyman Museum, Free Zoo (with tigers, monkeys, anteaters, etc) Kilauea Volcano, Richardson beach (Carl Smith had something going on with police present), and of course, a couple trips to sunny Kona for a couple beautiful beaches and dinner. One of our favorite dinner places was White Guava. Loved the Magic Pineapple too."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing Airbnb find. You could not ask for a better view in Hilo. We found ourselves falling asleep to the sound of waves crashing and waking up to the most picturesque sunrises one could fathom. Will definitely be back!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leigh was a wonderful host. We had such a wonderful stay here. The apartment was peaceful, cozy, clean, and restful. We saw so many whales from the porch and lawn! We enjoyed eating dinner there and watching the sunset/sunrise and the surfers at the beach below. Close by to a great beach. Would highly recommend to anyone staying in Hilo!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was the perfect little getaway stay! I loved waking up in the morning and being able to look out at the ocean and watch all the surfers. Leigh was a great host and gave us fantastic recommendations!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bery comfy place...quite and private..just you and the waves...and a stunning view!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful view!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy space, beautiful view, good location. Leigh responded quickly and was a great host. Would stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay!!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view is gorgeous! The weather wasn't great when we were there, but it was still such a cool view even in the rain. Also, it was super nice and relaxing to watch the surfers every morning. The place was cozy and peaceful, and felt like a little escape. The host gave some great recommendations and was incredibly easy to work with!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely amazing!!! The view from inside and outside the room is breathtaking and even more spectacular than the pictures trust me! We had better view of whales from the Lanai than when we went on our whale watching tour. The location is great as its central to Hilo and great if your wanting to eat and tour around Hilo. if your not scared of the little insects and small reptiles that come with being in a remote location in Hawaii, I would definitely recommend this as its an absolute gem!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our two-nights stay at Leigh's place and even though we didn't see Leigh personally, we felt very welcomed as she left very helpful clear instructions, local recommendations and even a card with champagne and pineapple for our honeymoon. That was a very nice touch which we really enjoyed. The apartment itself was clean, with good amenities (everything you need: big fridge, cutlery, nice coffee, towels, snorkeling gear, bug spray, and even very nice books including travel guides, etc.) The apartment is also large and has a very nice lookout to the ocean where you can see surfers.
The only thing that was a little bothering is wildlife. I am ok with geckos, but there were other not harmful but also not pretty insects that were probably coming from windows and it is better to keep your luggage closed so they don't travel with you :)
Overall, we enjoyed our experience and had a great time visiting Hilo! It is a beautiful city and the place is near everything we wanted to see."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leigh was a great host, very welcoming and was responsive! Everything about her location was great. And of course cannot forget about the best part the view! I would definitely recommend this airbnb. Again mahalo 🌺🤙🏽"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Likely the best View in Hilo.
Beautiful ocean view overlooking Honoli’i surf break.
The apartment was very clean, quiet and private.
Highly recommend."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Great host.
This is fun and happening area as well."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,She was great. I was able to stay a little later than my checkout time to work last minute. Beautiful views. Love falling asleep to the sounds of the ocean. I felt very safe and comfortable. Thanks for the extras!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A house at the height of the description, a host full of attention. I highly recommend it."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed watching the surfers and the sunset over the ocean. The apartment was comfortable and well equipped.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute and comfy airbnb. Beautiful views of Hilo beaches.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolute best place to stay in and around Hilo!
The View!!!!!! The pictures in the listing don’t do any justice, the view from the yard is just stunning. You wake up and fall asleep to the sound of the waves.
The place was super cozy and we felt right at home. Leigh actually rearranged the spot from what it looked like when we booked it and we couldn’t be happier with that decision. It was super roomy and gave us plenty space to relax.
Leigh was very responsive with any communication and had great tips for the surrounding area for restaurants and activities.
Would stay here again for sure ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is beautiful and peaceful. Leigh is a wonderful host. Nice room with privacy. Would definitely recommend. The views are also phenomenal.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leigh was lovely. Her place has a great view.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and cozy, easy to get into Hilo or the many the sights out of town."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy place, with a breathtaking view! I definitely recommend it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay in Hilo at Leigh’s place. Great location and amenities for our visit! Bidet was a perk haha :)
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leigh was a warm and friendly host. Our stay was relaxing and peaceful. The sunrise view was breathtakingly spectacular each morning! The bed was comfy and the space was enough room for the two of us during our short stay in Hilo.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice basement Airbnb just north of Hilo. The unit was well equipped with a big fridge, dishes, disposable plates, corkscrew, etc. Bed was comfortable. Location is just north of town but a quick, scenic drive away and awesome cliff-side views. The shower takes a while to heat up and you might encounter a lizard or bug, but overall a great spot, good value, and Leigh was a super friendly and helpful host!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had the pleasure of staying in this lovely Hilo apartment for a week, and we highly recommend it. The location is fantastic, with a beach a short walk away, and we enjoyed watching surfers during breakfast.The apartment is a gem, featuring a beautifully designed bathroom, a well-equipped kitchen (including a large fridge), and the option to grill, though we didn't use it.Our hostess was exceptionally kind and informative, enhancing our stay. Should we return to Hawaii, we'd choose this apartment again without hesitation. Thanks for an unforgettable experience!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!! Such a beautiful view and a wonderful host!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow what a nice view! We've never seen anything like it. We felt like at home and the bed was very comfy. This was our 3rd Airbnb in Hawaii and we slept by far the best. It was very pleasant to fall asleep with the waves and you could really darken the room. The coqui frogs were not very loud.
Unfortunately, we were only able to stay one night. We would definitely go back there but next time for a long time"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Really cool location close to one of the few good surfing beaches on the island and close to shopping and dining in downtown Hilo! Leigh was super friendly and loaned us lots of great beach equipment. She even let us stay a little longer while we surfed! Thank you Leigh for a great trip!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was sooo beautiful! Leigh was amazing! We genuinely felt like we were a part of the Hawaiian community. She and her family helped to bring the feel-good ""aloha spirit"" into our trip. It was always a pleasure to get home at night time to the great view of the beach (occasionally with people stoking fires in the distance). She treated us special and not like another number. It made us feel like we were special :D She had great local recommendations, and helped make the trip even better than it otherwise would've been!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my favorite stay so far on my trip to the big island. The property is BEAUTIFUL and you don’t even need to leave to have a great time enjoying the views. Super nice space Leigh has set up, had everything we needed, and we honestly didn’t want to leave at the end. Lots of coqui frogs at night which are nice to listen to, lizards outside, and rainy mornings. Can be a little humid but fan helps a ton (that’s just the area really). My partner and I loved it here and highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing veiws! Awesome hosts! Great location in Hilo!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very good welcome from Leigh, whom I thank very much. The accommodation is very well arranged and the view is very beautiful. I enjoyed this place!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We love staying at Leigh’s place. She is always so welcoming and her hospitality is amazing! She had so much aloha spirit and hospitality, and always so sweet n communicates well! Her place is lovely and so peaceful and relaxing and easy to get places."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying here! Host has thought of so many details to make this a comfortable and welcoming place to stay! We would definitely stay again! Everything was sparkling clean. Lots of attention to details (extra towels, beach towels, not a full kitchen but-microwave, refrigerator with water filter for cool water, toaster oven, pod-style coffee maker, access to borrow beach chairs, umbrella, cooler, etc.) We arrived during an especially warm and humid time. Although there is no built-in air conditioning, there was a portable unit and fan set up. Lots of windows with views and sounds of the ocean! Host was super clear with instructions and gave recommendations for local eateries, etc. Very responsive! Host lives upstairs and was ultra quiet! The only less than perfect things was privacy. There is no door separating the downstairs unit from the main house upstairs. However, it does go up to a switch back staircase. So, no one can see up or down. Still 5 stars!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is in such a cool location! We couldn’t get over how scenic it was. The sound of waves rolling and coqui frogs at night.
The layout of the room was cute and the shower was fully stocked.
We will be back soon for sure"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wowzers! Book this place while staying in Hilo! What a serene and peaceful view! So postcard worthy! We traveled to Hilo for a night and kicked ourselves immediately for not booking several nights! Leigh's place is adorable, and has everything you need (including parking!). Aside from being spotless and having the perfect view, Leigh's home sits on a quiet street and is a short drive to fun hotspots and restaurants. Both hosts-Leigh and Christine- were very responsive and friendly. We will gladly book again during our next visit to Hilo."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The pictures give this place no justice. It is beautiful. The view is breathtaking. You can hear the waves. The bed and pillows were super comfortable. Nice size fridge. Lots of amenities. Wifi worked great. The AC worked grear.
Cons: the were birds chirping for hours. Eventually the died out or we fell asleep before them 😂.
The water in the shower takes a while to get hot.
I would definitely come back and stay here."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leigh is an amazing host! She is so sweet and has very great communication! Her place is fabulous and it’s so peaceful and relaxing while still close to everything. Her place is amazing and she is amazing!!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at Leigh’s place while doing volunteer work nearby. Once again… the surroundings are so beautiful, bed is comfortable, place smells fresh, (which can be hard in Hilo due to the damp environment). Leigh goes out of her way to provide a Keurig and the coffee, plenty of towels, beach gear, umbrella for the occasional sprinkle. If you get a chance, go to the beach on the other side of the bridge (Honolii) and swim in the river for a crisp cool down (not the beach unless you really really really know what you are doing surf/ wave wise… not for anyone but experts). Somehow the TV remote was gone when we arrived… Leigh gave us her own! Talk about hospitality!! We will be staying again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leigh is a wonderful communicator. She was very attentive to our needs. When we had a small difficulty she fixed that situation very quickly. She went WAY above and beyond… So much so that we have booked to stay at her place again coming up very soon. Saw another reviewer mention ‘bugs’… there was not a one in sight. Very pest free…If your wondering. The bed is comfortable, the temperature inside is super comfortable with the ocean breeze (even a tiny bit chilly in the early morning). Super cute twin bed ‘loft’ up the stairs, to sleep three people. You can’t beat the view of Honolii beach. Great spot to just sit on the lawn chairs in the evening sipping you fav “drink” an catch your breath with the amazing panoramic view."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This stay was my all time favorite, Leigh is an incredible host to say she is accommodating is an understatement. To add she also is extremely friendly and kind. 10/10 host with a breathtaking view every morning. I will be recommending this airbnb and staying her in the future."
2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful view very much enjoyed it. The space wasn’t very clean I found lots of bugs coming in through the screens. The door to the entrance didn’t fit the frame to close properly so geckos and bugs would also come through there. Host was very friendly and easy to work with. Not much to cook with so plan to eat out mostly if you are staying here. Host has good recommendations for food and restaurants to check out.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Words can’t describe how wonderful Leigh’s place is. Inside had everything we needed. We fell asleep and woke up to the sounds of waves crashing and birds chirping. There were also chairs, boogie boards and beach towels available which was awesome to have available. We also made friends with their outdoor kitty. The views are so amazing and the location is convenient to everything. Wish we had stayed longer. 10/10 recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location on the cliff overlooking the surfing beach was awesome! We fell asleep and woke to the sound of waves crashing on the beach below. And got to watch the surfers while having our coffee in the yard each morning. Nice new shower and bathroom. Toaster oven, microwave, and fridge were all we needed. A cozy place to use as a base to explore the eastern island."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leigh, was very helpful and friendly! Easy check in and quick responses! We had a later flight and checked in after dark in the evening and she was kind enough to leave all the outside lights on for us!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little spot where you can watch surfers and listen to the rain! We would definitely stay again if ever in Hilo.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute place, with awesome view of the beach below. Can also walk to a secluded waterfall. Close drive to restaurants and the farmers market. Leigh was a great host!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location! Very peaceful and amazing views. Leigh is fantastic!!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, comfortable little spot right outside of Hilo. Leigh was extremely helpful with her local recommendations and local updates."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Leigh was super friendly and helpful regarding things to do in Hilo and recommending good restaurants. Her place is so beautiful and relaxing…we really enjoyed the view and the sound of the ocean. We would love to come back again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leigh was a great host. The location was amazing. One of my favorite things to do on the big island was to just sit in the lawn chair and soak in the surroundings.
The bed was comfortable and clean. The ocean view, breeze and sound was amazing from the room. Good windows and good for sleeping in.
Close to many great restaurants, snorkeling and water falls.
I highly recommend if you are on the big island."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Leigh is an excellent host! Very accommodating. Place was very relaxing and has a great view. Overall fun experience there. Will be looking forward to staying there again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mahalo nui Leigh for everything you done for me and my family. We had a great stay and mahalo again for your aloha and hospitality. You are AWESOME!!
Mahalo,
Mark, Kari, and Jayse"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"It’s a wonderful location, where is about seven-minutes drive to Hilo’s downtown area. The decorations of unit is beautiful and view is amazing. We enjoyed a great starry night at the lawn and sunrise. Also, Leigh was very friendly to show us the home and gave us tips. The instructions were clear, but it’s a little bit hard to find a direction at night. Generally, it’s a wonderful place to stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend the apartment! The view is just amazing, it was really clean and cozy. Leigh was super nice and helpful. Everything was even better than we‘ve imagined!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great air bnb & would book again! The views here are astonishing. Enjoyed waking up each morning & watching the surfers & beautiful scenery. You feel right in nature & can fall asleep to frogs & wake up to birds chirping - so cool! Leigh is very friendly & helpful! She told us where to boogie board & where not to (when waves were too high). She also had beach equipment available (umbrella, chair, & 2 boogie boards) for us to borrow. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,super friendly. lovely view. great location. excellent place to begin our trip.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view is even better than the photos!
2023-02-01,3,Stayed one night,"We imagine that the place would be nice in warm months however in when we there it was cold and very rainy. The room smelled damp and the path to the room was dark and slippery.
Based on that and the fact there’s no kitchen facilities, I found the price quite high.
Otherwise am sure on warm bright days, the entrance could be left open and food could picked up to eat outdoors."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were so excited about our stay at Leigh's place, but we unfortunately experienced unexpected travel changes. Leigh was so communicative, kind, and understanding of our situation. We are incredibly grateful! We highly recommend booking with Leigh, and we hope to stay at her place another time in the future!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leigh was an exceptional host!! She was so sweet and so friendly, great communication, and her home was perfect for the two of us!There’s IMMACULATE views of the ocean right outside our room where my fiancé watched the surfers below as we drank our coffee and ate our breakfast. Her home is in a great location as well to food, Hilo farmers market, grocery stores, little shops… it was maybe 7 minutes away. When we walked into the airbnb the room smelled amazing and she had cute little fresh flowers. 100% will be renting with her again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a wonderful stay at Leigh's! She took the time to take us to Kilauea for an evening and gave us lots of good recommendations for the Hilo area. Very responsive and easy to work with. 10/10
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at an Airbnb in Hilo, Hawaii, and I must say that it was a truly wonderful experience. Our host was incredibly kind and welcoming, making us feel right at home from the moment we arrived. They went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed, from providing us with detailed instructions about the property to offering recommendations for local restaurants.
I would also like to add that the view from the porch was breathtaking. The host had thoughtfully set up a seating area, so we could sit and admire the panoramic view of the surrounding lush greenery and the beautiful Pacific Ocean.
Overall, I would highly recommend this Airbnb and its host to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay in Hilo. They truly embody the spirit of hospitality, and I would not hesitate to book with them again in the future. Thank you for a wonderful vacation!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous place to stay! Quaint and peaceful. The view, including watching the surfers, was just amazing. Hoping to book again on next trip to Big Island."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leigh's place is nice and quaint. Perfect for a couple exploring the big island for a few days. The sounds of the frogs and waves crashing were a great way to fall asleep. The view of the surfers on the waves against the backdrop of the sunrise in the morning was an excellent way to start the day. No A/C was no problem, as the sea breeze through the open windows and the oscillating floor fan were sufficient. Leigh was responsive and friendly, I recommend her place! Thanks."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful view from this Rental, so pretty day or night. I loved hearing the Ocean at night time. Leigh was a wonderful host and the place exceeded our expectations. Very nice."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leigh was very nice and informative. Check in was easy, they had coffee and munchies available and the bed was comfortable. The view from the yard is incredible since it looks down over Honolii beach park. Great if you’re looking to check the surf in the morning. Great little crash pad but it lacked a some privacy. The bathroom didn’t have a door and there’s a staircase that leads upstairs into the main house, not sure if there’s a door there either. Other than that, I can’t complain. Very nice people in a clean place and right in the water. Aloha."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was fantastic. The views right outside your door are unbeatable. The hosts were the friendliest and incredibly easy to communicate with. One of the best air bnb’s I’ve ever stayed at. Will definitely be coming back here again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough good things about Carrie’s place! The house was very very nice, on a beautiful property. While the stay is connected to their house, it still feels very private! Additionally, the house is located very close to the main part of Hilo making getting around super easy. Lastly, the hosts make FABULOUS recommendations. They left a binder of takeout menus from places close by and sent a few additional recommendations my way. During our stay, we tried quite a few of them and all of them were stellar. Highly, highly recommend staying here!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, quite beautiful garden, Hilo bay view from hill top, everything clean, the host is nice, of course. It was very relaxing. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hugh and Carrie were great hosts. Super friendly, respectful and quick to respond. Their property is well maintained and quite beautiful. It’s close to all the sites of Hilo and a quick drive into town but far enough away to feel calm and quiet at night. Their property and hospitality made our trip to Hilo."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie's place is wonderful. It's a great place to come back to after exploring the area around Hilo. Loved the lanai, with that beautiful view. So peaceful going to sleep to the sound of tree frogs and waking up to bird song. Highly recommend it."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nestled in a private gated community on top of a hill that overlooks the Hilo bay. Can see wild pigs in the morning and hear coqui frogs at night. Peaceful location 10 mins away from downtown Hilo. Place felt very homey and has all the amenities you need to have a comfortable stay. Enjoyed chilling on the hammock on the lanai. Host was very responsive throughout our stay.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family loved staying here. Quiet, beautiful, and serene, the nature is incredible. The place is pristine. Clean, well maintained and the pictures do not do it justice. Close to everything you would want to do in Hilo. Incredible place, incredible host. Next time In Hilo will 100% be staying here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb was cozy and very clean! Great location to downtown Hilo, although not walkable to downtown. You do need a car as it’s about a 5 min drive, very doable. We also never had any issues finding free street parking in downtown. We spent majority of our time in Hilo at the national park which was about 45-50 min away.
The airbnb had all the amenities you would need and we especially enjoyed the outdoor deck/hammock to look out at the bay. We spent our evenings watching movies on Netflix and hbo max, both provided by the host. They were also very responsive and answered our questions quickly"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, sunrise in the hammock on the lanai didn’t disappoint"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Relaxing, peaceful, lush landscaping, beautiful interior. Exactly as described. Would stay again if we get the chance to return to Hilo."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and serine. Highly recommended especially if your looking to just relax and reset.Mahalo for sharing such a beautiful home away from home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best location in town.
Beautiful view!!
We love to come back Carrie’s place."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Amazing sunrise,.
We were given helpful information of the area (placed to enjoy)..
The location is perfect to venture off around the island from and / or wander into Hilo to learn of the island life.
We had slow, relaxing walks and long drives around the island.
Perfect base camp."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fell in love with Hilo and this bnb. We’d stay here again in a heartbeat.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place to stay! Everything was just perfect, and the condo was pristinely clean and beatifully appointed.
Carrie and Hugh were fantastic hosts -- Hugh even invited us up on their lanai of the main house for a bluegrass practice session with his band. AMAZING!
A terrific few days in Hilo ... thanks so very much!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Breathtaking views, beautiful island vibe, pristine inside stocked with everything, perfect location, and super sweet hosts!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie's place is the perfect location if you're looking for a peaceful place to call home while you're exploring the eastern side of Big Island. From her place you're not more than an hour's drive to Volcano National Park, the northern valley, and only a 5 min drive to downtown Hilo and a few of the local swimming holes, beaches, restaurants, and the farmer's market. It was always a great feeling to be able to return home after a day out and just relax in the beautiful home, and also watch the sun rise over Hilo Bay from the awesome back deck. Can't say enough about this ABNB! Probably one of our best rentals yet! We would come back to the Hilo area just for the rental!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place. Mile or two out of Hilo with a nice view of the harbor, super peaceful. We thought it was the most well-appointed Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at. Everything is right where you need it and very thoughtful. Very clean and nicely decorated. Feels very new. Also feels very private."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place!! Most amazing views of Hilo, peaceful setting, with great amenities. Clean, spacious interior with the comfiest bed. Big kitchen and grill outside. WIFI is very strong for those that need to work/have internet.
Carrie and Hugh are AMAZING hosts who make you feel right at home. This is a rare spot that is close to town and surfing while offering quiet relaxation. Not to mention the front porch views of sunrise and sunset after glow!! Truly one of a kind. And we can't wait to come back! Mahalo for an amazing time!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view and seclusion of this property are amazing. Porch hammock at night listening to the breeze and frogs couldn’t be beat. Decor is very nice and everything was clean. Very short drive to downtown Hilo. Appreciate Carrie’s flexibility and recommendations.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay went fantastic from check in to check out. The communication with the hosts was perfect and timely. We had our own space and the view was amazing. We had hoped for a place within walking distance to town but this wasn’t the place. Not the fault at all of the hosts, just wish this would have been closer to town, but then again you’d most likely give up the luxury of this type of space. Overall I’d recommend this space for a Hilo stay. Thanks Carrie and Hugh. Appreciate the hospitality."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay could not have been better. The in home apartment is absolutely beautiful, artfully decorated, with complete privacy. We had everything we needed - boogie boards, chairs, even a little cooler to pack a lunch. The view over the bay was priceless. Carrie is a great host, always responding quickly to our questions. Spectacular!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely location and beautiful indoor and outdoor space. Super comfortable, clean and stylish. The hosts were very welcoming and we really appreciated the tour of their tropical garden. It was a very enjoyable stay in Hilo."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful place. Hugh and Carrie were fantastic hosts! One of my favorite airbnbs I've stayed at. Everything you could need is provided, and they also gave some tasty fruits grown from their own yard."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie and Hugh were excellent host! They welcomed us with a bottle of wine and fresh fruits. You will get a breathtaking view, you can see the ocean from the living room. I loved the hammock in the patio. The host provided all the mentioned amenities. The place was nice and tidy. I highly recommend this place."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was an absolutely wonderful stay! Such a beautiful place with an amazing view and location. We were exceedingly happy with our choice to stay here and couldn’t recommend it more.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time staying in Hilo and Carrie’s place met all of our expectations. Super clean, modern, peaceful and great views , especially waking up to the sight of the sunrise out the front door. Carrie’s property is filled with many native fruit trees and plants. This gives such an awesome feel to the property. I would highly recommend staying here and we would again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the most beautiful and peaceful places we’ve ever stayed. Sitting on the porch in the afternoons looking over the water, it was just stunning. I don’t know when we’ll get back to Hawaii, but there’s no other place I’d rather stay when we do."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying at this beautiful place in Hilo! It truly felt like living like a local, with beautiful views and excellent proximity to beaches and the center of town. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay while visiting Hilo for a few days. The grounds and view were amazing and the home was clean, beautiful and comfortable. We would stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best stay we had of four different places over two weeks in Hawaii. It's perfect if you are looking for a low-key vibe where you can chill. It had a 5 star quality in terms of the beauty of the view, the fresh fruit - their yard was amazing as well as the view of the Bay!
They were also very flexible with us on check-in and check-out which was greatly appreciated. Overall, it was just a perfect stay and a perfect place. If we can go back to the big island, we'll definitely book to stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay!The hosts lived next door and welcomed us warmly and provided a lot of useful information.The view of the house is particularly beautiful, there is a big lawn in front of the door, and the sea can be seen in the distance.A few minutes drive from the town center, conveniently located!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,A fantastic location with a beautiful view over the bay. The hosts are especially accommodating and responsive. Whenever there was an issue it was resolved quickly and in friendly fashion. Will look for this one whenever i come back.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay. The location was just outside of the main Hilo area and absolutely beautiful, with a lovely view. The Airbnb was comfortable and had all the amenities we needed. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My stay at Carrie's was very nice!
The place was clean and as described. The terrace, the very well-maintained garden and the view of the Bay of Hilo greatly contributed to all these good times.
I would definitely recommend this apartment and would definitely come back if it wasn't so far from France… 😊"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A peaceful place near a fun surf and swim spot! Great for relaxing.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the cleanest, newest place I’ve ever stayed at. Hosts were fantastic and friendly. Harold and Jane(parents) gave us great tips on seeing the volcano and other things to do. Volcano at night is the best."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie provided exceptional directions and check-in instructions to her home made our arrival smooth as silk. Carrie's place was cozy and comfortable. The kitchen and bathroom were truly one of the best at any other Air b and b. The large bay window in the bedroom provided a nice view into the beautiful gardens. We had the added benefit of interacting with Jane and Harold, who live on the property, who were both extremely lovely, inviting, and helpful. We would definitely stay at Carrie's place again the next time we visit Hilo."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a great space surrounded by an amazing garden, away from noise (except for the frogs) but very close to Hilo. 100% recommended to see the volcanoes national park and Mauna Kea. The owners Harold and his wife are great and super hospitable. Easy parking if you go by car. A/C and fans, full kitchen, barbecue."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts and appreciated the fruit!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great view of the Hilo bay from the property, which is located in a quiet and safe neighbourhood. Really enjoyed the stay :)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Carrieʻs place was a great place for a few days in Hilo, a couple of minutes from bay front but also a great starting point for exploring the Hamakua coast. Having a day bed and lanai were great ways to spend the mornings and evenings overlooking Hilo bay in peaceful surrounding. Additionally, the full-sized fridge, sink, and microwave were very helpful when traveling with an infant and toddler. Would highly recommend staying here!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was spacious and comfy, clean, with a classic style. Seems to have been renovated recently. Had an amazing porch with a beautiful well maintained back yard. Close enough to town to be convenient and far enough to feel relaxing. Host was communicative and friendly. Both check in and check out instructions were simple and straight forward, no bible length house manual, no laundry list of cleaning either, which I personally appreciated. Has 2 AC units that worked great. It’s attached to the owner’s home, although I never saw anyone & felt privacy. It does not have a full kitchen, but It does however have a full size fridge, microwave, basic utensils just no stove. Would suggest to add seasonings & oil. Overall I did enjoy my stay. The only truly negative for me was that the curtains in both the bedroom and living room did not fully close due to the ACs, if you are a light sleeper like me, and need completely dark rooms to sleep in, that might be something to take into account."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location in Hilo and a beautiful place with a gorgeous view. Super clean and cozy! We loved our stay here and would do it again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We live in apartment in big city so we’ve always wanted to live in a house with a big yard and beautiful view. This dream has come true thanks to this house. Big island is an amazing place and it’s great to have a quiet and beautiful place to go back to after a long day. It’s about 3 miles from Safeway, target and lots of other supermarkets. Carrie her family are super nice and helpful! I love their cat kitty very much!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Carrie’s place was absolutely pristine, gorgeous, comfortable! Super private and relaxing. Close to downtown Hilo and the water!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great stay in a a peaceful atmosphere that is located close to everything you'd like to see in Hilo. We had everything we needed and I enjoyed being able to grill food instead of a traditional stove. Hugh was able to greet us and made us feel right at home. We are very grateful for our stay there. The pictures are accurate and the place was clean.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was such a beautiful place. Amazing view. Close to Hilo. Lovely porch. The accommodations were wonderful.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was great. Very clean and nice. Flowers and fruit a nice touch. Very quiet. Nice view. Easy check-in and check-out. I would stay here again.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is really nice and well-kept, the garden and lanai are very nice. Carrie and her husband were very kind and friendly in providing us with information about Hilo."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was perfect for us, so quiet and in a beautiful setting yet easily accessible to town. So many windows gave great light. We had a sunrise every morning from the lanai. The place was very clean and comfortable for 2 adults although the day bed and crib could accommodate a small family.
Fresh fruit and wine made us feel welcome and the flowers in every room were a lovely touch.
We loved the town of Hilo, quirky but with some great history. Carrie kept in touch with us to make sure we had everything we needed. We will remember our time in Hilo fondly."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. We loved the space and the location, a perfect getaway close to town and local attractions, but plenty of peace and quiet."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pure slice of heaven is here! I loved the space so much, I’ve been island hopping and this was the best place we stayed for sure! Truly a gem 💎 loved the privacy and beautiful nature views. Oh I wish I could live there!! Everything was as described, I was planning on doing laundry but was out too much so I didn’t utilize that. We did borrow the snorkeling gear which was super nice at two-step beach! :)"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for the Merrie Monarch Festival and it was the perfect location being only 10 minutes from all the events and activities. t’s exactly like the pictures and as described. Loved it!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best locations at Hilo!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carrie’s place is in a very quiet and nice neighborhood and it is close to down town Hilo as well. The place is clean and has everything we needed. They also let us do laundry there. Carrie is super responsive. She always replies to my text within two minutes.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hugh and Carrie’s place was awesome!! Beautiful place with a view of the bay. Hugh gave us great recommendations on local restaurants and things to do. It was quiet and very conveniently located to get to town and to a local surf beach. Overall one of the best Airbnb’s we’ve stayed in! Also lovely touches with the flowers, wine and fruit."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a very relaxing and peaceful stay here. Watched the sun rise over the bay from the pretty lanai while sipping some coffee. Great location just outside of town.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie's place is the perfect balance between city conveniences and rural beauty. The view from the patio is outstanding as you are at higher elevation and have a very big view of Hilo's waterfront. The night sky is spectacular because you are above the city lights. The interior of the place if beautiful and it's a great place to just relax after a day of biking, snorkeling, going to waterfalls, or many other outdoor pursuits which are close by. This was the best place by far we stayed at on our three week trip to Hawaii."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean. Place was as it described and looks like photos. Beautiful view of Hilo bay. Peaceful (what we like), relaxing. My daughter enjoyed the yard and hammock. Location was right outside of Hilo town, but still close to a lot of places, beaches. My husband got to surf, was able to borrowed a board (thank you!), definitely made his day. We enjoyed staying at Carrie's place! Overall great place and location!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Had a great stay at this beautiful airbnb right outside of Hilo. Very private with a nice view of the bay. Hugh had lots of Aloha and was very accommodating. Always responsive if I needed anything. The welcoming fruit basket was a nice touch. Hope to be back!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie’s place is better than the pictures. Wonderful sunrises and view of Hilo bay. Great landscaping with lots of fruit trees. Short drive to downtown, but quiet neighborhood good for walking. Walking distance to nice, small black beach and pretty walk/drive on little used road through gorgeous terrain including waterfalls. Best of all, Carrie and her husband are terrific hosts."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,A++ host. Great accommodations and the surrounding area.. highly recommended
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We are very satisfied with staying at Carrie's place. Great location overseeing Hilo bay. The host is very friendly. The room is spacious for us.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were absolutely blown away by the views, the garden, the deck, the neighborhood, and the quality of the apartment. We were holed up there with our infant and it was amazingly comfortable. We loved watching the sunrise from the hammock every morning, cooking on the grill every night, and enjoying the super thoughtful fruit basket harvested from their impressive yard :)"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very spacious and well appointed. Awesome froggy chorus in the evening, and nice sunrises from the lanai in the morning. Large, well maintained property in a private neighborhood, minutes away from a local black sand surf beach. Showers every night, but mostly clear and sunny during the days."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Working from Paradise! We booked a week on the Big Island intending to work full days on mainland time and then get out to see the sights during the afternoons. As it turned out, I was so swamped with work, we didn't leave the property for days at a time. Thankfully, the house is so nice and peaceful, perfectly located on a hill with views above Hilo Bay, large grounds with fruit trees, and frog serenades at night, that I couldn't have asked for more from a work-from-home set up. Key point for us - the internet was strong and reliable, with two of us running video calls simultaneously. We ate most of our meals at home, cooking on the BBQ on the excellent lanai (with hammock!). When we did manage to make it off the property, we popped down into Hilo Town to enjoy the great local restaurants and shops. The location is perfect for reaching the whole windward side of the island, and the hosts are the best hosts I've ever had!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is hands-down one of the best Airbnbs I've stayed at! Carrie's place is clean, comfortable, and spacious. The space was new with quality furnishing, it felt like being a guest rather than renting a room. It was a treat, and I hope to be back."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carrie and Hugh are great host and very easy to communicate with. Great location with a stunning view on the Hilo Bay and beautiful sunrise. The rental is super clean with a lots of natural lights.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie and Hughes place is absolutely beautiful and was completely spotless upon arrival. Has all the necessities for a comfortable stay and a great entertainment setup (Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Disney and more). There’s a great view from the lanai and the surrounding neighbourhood is very peaceful and safe. Would love to stay again if we find ourselves in Hilo. Will note for anyone staying that it’s about a half hour walk into Hilo downtown and there isn’t much street lighting, so would recommend a car for anyone staying here or in Hilo in general. Would also note, in case it’s not apparent from the photos that the space is located downstairs from the main house, but was still very private and quiet."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the kind of stay that we wish they all could be. The place over-delivers on it's promise - bigger and more beautiful than the pictures can capture. And it's managed by hosts who are smart, thoughtful and friendly! If you've fully read the description and you like what you've read and what you see in the photos, you should probably book now, before it gets snapped-up - it's all entirely accurate. Great location for accessing Hilo - and being able to retreat to peace and quiet whenever you like for a wind-down in comfort and style."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quiet place to relax and recharge for Big Island adventures! Home is super nice with great Hawaiian wood features throughout. Awesome deck to watch sunrise, Hilo bay, and flights coming and going. Super nice hosts to top it off!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here. very clean, private, true to the photos and description. Super close to downtown Hilo but far enough away to feel like you are out in the country. One thing to note, if you have 3 people/are planning to use the daybed on the living room, there are no curtains and it gets light early!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent location that is close to fun activities and good food, but outside of town for some peace and quiet. The place is comfortable and clean! We loved it!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best AirBnB experience I’ve ever had. The place is so comfortable. There is a hammock on the porch where you can sit and watch birds. There’s a great view. The location is very cool. It’s even visible from postcards of Hilo. Anyway, 10/10. Great place."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We did a two week island hopping trip across several islands and this place was by far the best and most enjoyable stay during our journey. The house, garden and neighborhood is super well maintained and lovely. The condo is equipped with literally everything you would need, but note that there is no oven/stove. A microwave is available though. The whole family was super helpful and really kind. The cat was very friendly and visited us to hang out a bit.
Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it anytime."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was the best spot we stayed at on our trip to Hawaii. The view is beautiful, there is so much space and the neighborhood is quiet. It is also a short drive away from the city center. The hosts were also very accommodating and easy to reach. Would definitely stay here again if we come to Hilo!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Gorgeous, clean, and relaxing! We loved our stay here. Carrie responded quickly when we had questions, we were able to do some laundry while we stayed, and checkin/checkout was so smooth. I love that the Airbnb came with beach chairs, towels, and snorkels for instant beach fun. Highly recommend this place if you’re looking for a stay on the big island!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very pleasant stay and loved everything about Carrie's place! The cleanness, the comfort, the amenities, the decorations, the view, the location... I can go on and on. Carrie really thought of everything to give guests a great experience, and the amenities can almost match a fancy hotel. The guesthouse is located on a beautiful property with a huge backyard planted with different species such as a pineapple plant! We also enjoyed the hammock on the lanai and Carrie's friendly cat who greeted us every time we returned to the house."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a beautiful home with some amazing views from the hill, where you can spot a sunrise right from the deck.
We really enjoyed the homey touches , soft towels and privacy.
Check in instructions were simple and clear.
I would recommend to anyone who is staying in Hilo, and looking for a great retreat spot. By the way the home is located in a perfect location!!!
Mahalo Carrie"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay, such kind and generous hosts. We would stay again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay in Hilo. Great location looking over the bay. Everything is a describe. Very friendly and welcoming.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely wonderful place to stay. The space was private, very well adorned, spacious, and beautiful. Carrie and Hugh were wonderful hosts -- very accommodating and generous with suggestions (and with giving us privacy). The space is spacious and very comfortable, with a great porch and hammock perfect for taking in the bay. Very close to the main areas of Hilo. Can't say enough good things -- one of our favorite stays. Highly recommended!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We’ve had the pleasure of staying at this rental twice now and both times we absolutely loved it! Its beautifully decorated, extremely clean and has everything you’ll need for a comfortable stay. It’s in a private gated community and is very peaceful. The view is an added bonus and is so pretty. The Hosts Carrie & Hugh are very helpful and knowledgeable about the area. They’re quick to respond to any questions and make you feel right at home. We wish we could have stayed longer!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome multi-day stay in a beautiful property surrounded by nature! Carrie & Hugh were incredible hosts. Terrific location, central to numerous points of interest. Would absolutely love to stay here again in the future!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Lovely one bedroom guest house in Hilo, HI. Very private, well maintained and had everything we needed to make our stay perfection. Although, we didn’t get a chance to meet our hosts, Carrie and Hugh, we did have contact with them through texting. The house sitter, Ana, was here to answer our questions and provide anything we needed. Thank you for a very enjoyable stay."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my fourth stay on the Big Island, and as long as it is available I won’t stay anywhere else on my future trips. Such a serene setting with an amazing view just a few short minutes from Hilo town. Nicely appointed, plenty of space, great deck with seating and a nice hammock. Easy access to Akaka Falls, the Botanical Gardens, and just 45 minutes up the mountain to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. We were even able to have restaurant food delivered when we were too tired to go out to eat. Absolutely nothing to complain about. Thanks so much."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We has a wonderful stay at Carrie and Hugh's home in Hilo. The space was perfect for our family. My kids, wife and I enjoyed the morning sunrises in the hammock, and running through their big beautiful garden.
The home is perfectly situated in a quiet part less than 5 min north of Hilo. It was the perfect jumping off point for enjoying the beaches, hiking in the national park, and exploring the Island.
The hosts offer great advice about things to do and places to eat tailored to your specific needs.
We would definitely stay at Carrie and Hugh's again if we come back to Hilo!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome Airbnb. Hosts were very friendly and helpful. The location is beautiful and convenient. There’s also a cool local boogie boarding / surf spot really close by.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Carrie and Hugh couldn’t have been nicer. Their property is gorgeous and the Airbnb is great. Super close to Hilo too!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a marvelous place, lush and exotic. The sunrise gleaming through offshore cumulus is sublime."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Three of us stayed at Hugh and Carrie’s beautiful home which is in the gated community. The view of the bay was amazing! The place was very comfortable and spacious. Just know there is no stove top to cook a meal. It was described so but l just assumed there would be after buying ingredients for breakfast. There is a microwave. So, I learned to make poached eggs in it! No problem! Just one thing I wish they provided would be some essential seasonings such as salt & pepper since we the renters don’t need big salt & pepper shakers during our trip. They were very quick to respond. The bathroom was gorgeous! Highly recommend!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carrie and Hugh were excellent and accommodating hosts. Would rent again!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nothing but good things to say about our stay here! We loved a peaceful sunrise and coffee every morning. The location is perfect and the apartment is beautifully and thoughtfully furnished. Beware, if you stay here you will never want to leave!!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The spacious sunny unit is thoughtfully furnished and was perfect for us. We enjoyed the morning sun and views on the porch and hanging out there later in the day after sightseeing. Carrie and Hugh are super nice hosts and have wealth of knowledge on the area. The setting is quiet, yet only a few minutes drive into Hilo."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place with incredible views. Carrie and Hugh are exceptionally nice and helpful.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hilo sunrises from the patio are the calmest wonder. Carrie & her husband are highly responsive and offered great local foodie spots.
The location makes it easy to hike all the nearby falls and a commuters drive to Volcano.....that’s if you can escape the time machine hammock on the patio ;)
Mahalo nui loa iā ‘oe"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful experience here! The location is absolutely phenomenal and it overlooks Hilo Bay. Absolutely sparkling clean inside with updated modern decor. Had everything you needed from the kitchen to the bathroom. TV and Wi-Fi set up we’re very nice. The lanai is gorgeous and the hammock was a nice touch.
We were greeted upon arrival and given a tour of the house. They were very receptive to communication and our timing. Can’t imagine a better place to stay in Hilo. Thank you so much for everything."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie’s place was amazing. The views, decor, and all the extras touches were so appreciated. Perfect place to stay will be back."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay and comfortably enough for our family of 3 (2 adults and a 4 year old). It is a few minutes outside of town in a quiet neighborhood. Hugh was very helpful and explained where everything was. No stovetop, which wasn't a big deal as we only booked 2 nights. Bring microwavable food, or head into town for some great restaurant options. Would stay again when in Hilo."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I am recommending this B&B
2021-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,This place exceeded all expectations - it's in the perfect location so close to everything yet is so quiet and serene. The views are gorgeous; I loved the moments on the lanai. It feels very private yet Carrie & Hugh are always available and super responsive. I highly recommend!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie is a truly lovely host who provides lots of extras in the apartment to make the stay comfortable. It is in a new house, tastefully furnished, with restful views over the bay and up Mauna Loa. The queen bed in the bedroom is the most comfortable I've ever slept on. The couch bed in the living room is also pleasant and gets the morning sun."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was absolutely great! Waking up in the morning and lying on the hammock with that view of the water was unbelievably nice. They had all kinds of suggestions for places we should see as well. Will absolutely stay again if I come back to big island.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great view.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here. Hosts are super friendly with helpful tips about the area. The place is exactly as described if not better. Would highly recommend!!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious and super clean space. The rental is very convenient to town in a quiet, safe neighborhood. Would highly recommend."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Carrie's place. It was very clean and well located for our discovery trips outside of Hilo, yet close enough to downtown for evening dining. We would be happy to come back."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Carrie and Hugh’s place. The location was great, as it was just outside Hilo, and it also had beautiful views outside each window. Sunrise over hilo Bay on the lanai was a special treat. The decor was lovely - granite and beautiful wood - and the furniture and bed were very comfortable. Carrie and Hugh were available to answer questions if we needed, but mostly we felt like we had our own private residence. We are planning to return!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After a busy couple days in Kona, I felt very fortunate to land at Carrie’s place in Hilo. It was very cozy, clean, and comfortable. I honestly had a hard time getting motivated to do things sometimes because it was so welcoming with beautiful views of the ocean and lots of nature sounds."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view is so pretty. Sitting on the lanai and watching the morning sun rise will fill one up with peace and tranquility. The amenities offered are plentiful and thoughtful. The location is minutes away from downtown. Overall, the house is gorgeous, very clean, quiet and situated on a serene location. Carrie is quick to respond and they offered many local tips to help us get the most out of our journey."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hugh & Carrie’s is just outside of Hilo, on the north part of town. The area offers great views over the Hilo Bay from the lānai, which is breezy and a great spot to watch the sun come up in the morning. All amenities at the property were well kept, and looked after by the owners who are not far away if you need them. We can’t fault anything about our stay, as the hosts were warm and welcoming, which is what we prefer as a little human interaction and personal feel goes a long way for us!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very private and the location was great. Close to town and close to an awesome surfing spot. Did not disappoint. Communication was always quick and they were very helpful when I needed something. I hope I'm able to return someday, and soon.
Thank you for a great stay . Loved it."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic space! Comfortable, clean, and under 5 minutes from downtown Hilo. Carrie and Hugh were extremely welcoming and friendly, and we would absolutely stay here again!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is fantastically located in the countryside. The veranda invites you to spend beautiful hours there.
There were three of us and it was completely sufficient.
There was no stove, but there was a microwave and nice dishes.
A large fridge was available.
The hosts are very friendly and strive to ensure a nice stay.
It was nice that there was no carpet, as usual in the United States. This makes it nice clean living.
We would like to thank you for the bottle of wine. We enjoyed these at the sunset."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sparkling clean, great view, great host and little away from the Hilo downtown to have a quiet environment, but close enough to reach. It's also very close to a beach full of surfers."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic property!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, lovingly and very thoughtfully furnished apartment with plenty of space and beautiful corners to settle in comfortably.
Carrie and Hugh are very accommodating hosts who do everything they can to make the stay as pleasant as possible.
Thank you!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a stay! My parents who never use Airbnb loved it! I will certainly recommend a stay here!
2019-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Carrie's place is the perfect spot to explore Hilo as well as the rest of the Big Island! The location can't be beat as it's a quick drive up the road from Hilo, so you get the peace and quiet of being out of town, but can get into Hilo very quickly for fun, food, and anything you need. Carrie and Hugh were very kind and welcoming and their place was spotless. Check-in was very simple and it was great getting to know Carrie, Hugh, and their place. We highly recommend this place and would stay here again on any future adventures to Hilo!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great value , you get a lot for the cost , best location ,"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carrie and Hugh's place was great and the view was amazing from the Lanai. We felt right at home and would definitely come back and stay longer.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie's place is exactly as described, absolutely gorgeous, peaceful and serene, with beautiful views of Hilo Bay. It's far enough out of town to feel like you're a world away from quaint downtown Hilo, yet it's only a short drive away for all its conveniences. Carrie and Hugh are warm and welcoming, and have great local tips to share. Carrie left gardenias, wine and fruit for me--such thoughtful touches to an already perfect place. I'll be back for sure!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Again a very nice place to stay while in Hilo. Well decorated and cared for. Wonderful view of the bay and oh so quiet when you need a good nights rest. Hosts are friendly and always helpful.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie’s place is a wonderful space - very close to all the restaurants and sights in Hilo. It’s very thoughtfully decorated and had all the amenities we needed for a very comfortable stay. Hugh and Carrie were friendly, helpful hosts, but gave us all the space and privacy we needed. We hope to be back on the Big Island soon, and would definitely return to this wonderful space in the future! Don’t hesitate to book!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a top quality, 5-star experience - high ceilings, stunning views, private entrance, natural wood everywhere, granite/tile bathroom. A serene and natural environment that is a pleasure to wake up in. Carrie and Hugh are available but not intrusive and the welcome with fresh papaya, lemons, bananas, wine and fresh flowers was perfect. The home is perfectly situated on a rise overlooking Hilo bay but also with an incredible view of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. You can get to Hilo town in 5 minutes but don’t have to deal with tour buses and exhaust. I highly recommend it!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carries place is beautiful and serene. Lots of area between neighbors, area is quiet and peaceful overlooking Hilo Bay. Carrie is very attentive and helpful, goes the extra mile. Communication is great and we would recommend her place to all our friends and guests."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay, my partner and I are extremely satisfied with our stay at here! Highly suggest to take a jogging in the morning. The air is fresh, and the people are nice!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful view and space and wonderful host!
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place. We especially loved lounging in the hammock on the lanai while enjoying the view, and chatting with Carrie and Hugh, who are lovely and great hosts. It's a great location, close to downtown Hilo and a nearby beach, but feels far away. The space itself is beautiful, more than enough for 2 people. We'll come back next time we're in Hilo!"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When I arrived, I was surprised because it was too dark.
And I heard all the sounds because it was connected to the owner's house. But the next morning when I woke up, the view in front of me was so beautiful. It was nice to feel delicate and kind. This was the most wonderful place to visit in Hawaii."
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful home (inside and out) in an ideal location. The views are amazing, and it’s just up the road from a fantastic beach. Carrie and Hugh were amazing hosts; kind, communicative and very helpful! Plenty of tips on beaches, and areas to surf/hike. This AirBNb really made our vacation - I will definitely book it again!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie and Hugh were warm and welcoming throughout the process. They were always prompt with their responses and very helpful in getting us oriented. Their home is *lovely*; located on a beautiful spot with views of the bay, and in close proximity to everything. There are small but lovely touches throughout which will make anyone's stay comfortable. We also got a lot of privacy; they strike the balance perfectly between being available and giving you your own space. We'd strongly recommend this place as your hub while on the Hilo side and hope to visit it again someday soon!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie and Hugh are amazingly welcoming hosts! Not only did they await us when we arrived but had also fruits and wine prepared for us.
The apartment is very stylish and there couldn’t be a better place to greet the sun in the morning than their wonderful lanai in the middle of nature overlooking Hilo bay!
Great location to explore various places of Big Island, can only recommend staying there!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really comfortable place, Hugh and Carrie are very thoughtful."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space with a beautiful view! Carrie and Hugh were so warm and made us feel comfortable right away, great hosts!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie was a fantastic host - super helpful and available. The place was immaculate, amazing location and made you feel like you were in your own home and owned the sunrise!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, responsive host. The unit is part of a newly built home, and is comfortable and stylish. Very close to Hilo yet a bit out of the city, surrounded in green and with a view of the bay. Loved it!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So modern and clean! It’s a very relaxing location too. Great view of Hilo and the break water. Close enough for accessibility, far enough for seclusion!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An outstanding apartment just a couple of minutes north of Hilo. Awesome hammock on the covered deck to relax in while feeling the cool breeze roll in off of Hilo bay. Very clean and modern. Make sure you follow Carrie's directions to the house as Google maps got us close, but not quite there."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carrie was an awesome host! Her house is beautiful!!
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie and Hugh were the best hosts. Informational, hospitable, and respectful of privacy. The location is perfect - close enough to town but far enough to feel that you’re in the country. Fall asleep to the sound of coquí frogs and wake up to the birds and roosters. Beautiful new apartment, full sized fridge, great lanai overlooking the Hilo Bay, with plenty of space to relax and unwind. We WILL be back. Don’t hesitate, book this place NOW!!!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carrie's place is beautiful and she is a wonderful host! Appreciate the hospitality and the attention to detail applied to their home
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carrie and Hugh are incredible hosts. We can highly recommend a stay with you. The view is beautiful and the in-law apartment very spacious and clean. The ideal location for excursions on the Hilo side of the island. We would book again immediately!
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at this place. Wonderful hostess, very hospitable and helpful. We couldn't wish for a better place to stay. This place is very private, beautiful views of the bay. It is very new and updated. The location is in perfect distance from downtown Hilo and very close to Aka Aka falls and Rainforest Botanical Garden. Carrie even left us exotic, local fresh fruit to taste (papaya, passion fruit and lychee. We didn't want to leave. It is a must place to stay.A++++++++++"
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place! Beautiful, new, clean, private, and safe. We felt like we struck gold -- and so fortunate to have stumbled upon it. Carrie was a great host, very accessible and responsive. Location was great - minutes from downtown yet felt like you're on a country estate. Best moment: sipping my morning coffee on the deck, while listening to the birds chirping... can't get much better than that!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay while in Hilo. We used to live in Hilo and know t the area well and the location does not get much better. Peace and quite yet minutes from town. Very clean and nice. Carrie and Hugh were great hosts! I highly recommend staying here.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for the weekend. My son had a baseball tournament for the weekend and it was just what we were looking for . Would definitely recommend to others if they are planning a trip to Hilo .
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Ohana house is a comfy, serene place to get away from the hustle and bustle of city sounds. The only sounds you’ll wake up to are chickens, cows, frogs, birds, and other animals. The studio apartment was very clean with all the basics (except for laundry, which is noted in the description) and had lots of natural light. Island breezes and a ceiling fan meant no air conditioning needed. The large wrap-around lanai allowed awesome views all the way to the ocean. We had a great stay and would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the Hilo area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather was an excellent host, she always responded to your time messages and helped facilitate us a little cooler for our 3 days.
The property is beautiful, surrounded by nature and as the publication says you will wake up with the rooster song and the birds around. The chickens are the most since they have their routine every morning and I even did a video with them. Love this place and very flexible to all destinations. Hilo is beautiful and this place is a faithful representation of what you see on the Island .
Thank you Thank you
Reviví my memories about my Natal Country."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time in a wonderful room. Thank you very much.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The whole studio apartment is yours, so it is very private. The unit is spacious and comfortable. It is located upstairs making the views from the deck impressive. The large deck comes with a table and chairs for outside dining. My only regret was that we only booked 2 nights."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we loved our stay at Ohana guest house. The views are beautiful. Loved the fresh tangerines and grapefruit right off the trees.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Such a beautiful space to stay for the week. I was supposed to be in Hilo for a training but it got cancelled last minute. I was so glad I chose this peaceful place. I wish I could’ve stayed longer!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent stay at Heather’s place. The accommodations and property were above and beyond our expectations! It was bigger and more private than we expected. The property was so peaceful and beautiful. We would definitely stay there again. We greatly appreciated her book of helpful suggestions of things to do, places to shop, and restaurants that were recommended. It was very well thought out and helpful. You can tell she pays attention to even the smallest details. She is very friendly and our vacation at her place was our favorite on the island."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was exactly as described and closer to the university than I expected. Nera looked and sounded intimidating at first, but she is so incredibly sweet. The chickens that followed us to the gate everyday was fun, and the rabbit was a surprise. It was a great few days."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Heather has a lovely home and it is so tranquil and lovely!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific place, accurately listed. Was greeted by a friendly fluffy bunny the first night and enjoyed sounds of nature through the stay. Place had lots of room and temperature was enjoyable even without heat or AC for a February visit. Beautiful surroundings and friendly place!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay when travelling to Big Island. We really enjoyed our stay, BEST location of our 2 week Hawai'i trip. If you're planning to stay in Big Island, 100% reccomended. I would stay again if I return to Big Island. It has all the amenities you need to feel like home. Heather was very welcoming and agreat host."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great property in the counrty side. we stayed for a week with our 2 teenage girls and the space was perfect. Lots of room and a beautiful deck area to enjoy. We will look to book again if we come back to the Big Island
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay. Beautiful location out in the country, but still close enough to town. Place was very clean, check-in/check-out was easy, and Heather was always quick to respond. Just a heads up, you'll hear nature sounds around you, especially roosters in the morning. Overall, highly recommended!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Heather’s place! What an oasis just outside of Hilo. The space is very comfortable and the lanai is fantastic. The kitchen offered a great mix of gadgets for some self-catering (we enjoyed making waffles with the waffle maker) and the beds were very comfortable. Heather was also very flexible with check in and check out times, which we really appreciated. Would love to stay there again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don't normally write reviews - but this place was worth it.
It's a tranquil home situated a bit outside the city, but you have a car anyways when visiting the Big Island. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen is adequate, and the views from the deck are what your soul needs.
When booking in Hilo, so many reviewers complain about the sound of nature when sleeping - I can assure you, this place has sounds of nature, but they are what you want. It is an experience that you will want, especially if you're visiting the Big Island from the gates of suburbia. Embrace the sound, smell, and sights - book this place and go enjoy the outdoors.
The hosts were very understanding as well."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chris and Heathers house was perfect for me and my bfs short vacation. They were very friendly and helpful. The view was amazing. 10/10 recommend.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying at the Cozy Country Ohana House. The place was clean, had an abundance of kitchen utensils, towels, and bedding. It is located a short drive outside of downtown Hilo, giving guests easy access to the city's amenities while also providing a charming countryside feel. We really enjoyed hearing the sounds of nature each night - it felt like a tropical oasis.
Beyond the facilities, the host was super responsive and friendly.

We booked this spot last minute and Heather was super accommodating and helpful. Her directions to the house and on how to check in were very clear. The space was welcoming and had everything we needed. It was such a peaceful location. We loved seeing the chickens and cows from the lanai. We even saw a full double rainbow! I know Heather didn’t arrange that for us, but it still made the space feel even more magical 😊. Definitely book this space if you’re visiting Hilo!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautiful place with plenty of space to lounge around in between excursions. I love the cows in the pasture, but watch out - they lick! 😅 Heather and Chris are warm and inviting, and really wanted our stay to be great. It was, and we'll be back!"

Sylvia was the ideal host and had snacks and bottled water in the kitchenette area, and an umbrella for the rainy Hilo weather. She checked every day if I needed anything . I couldn't recommend this place enough for a solo traveler, whether you're traveling for leisure or business."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. Sylvia was clear in her communications and very responsive. She lent me a towel for the beach which I appreciated. The basement studio was very clean and easy to access. My only 'but' comment is that the ceilings are low in the studio, I'm 6'2"" and my hair brushed the ceiling in the bathroom. Probably should set a height limit of 6'3"" for guests. Still a 5-star place and host."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sylvia was a fantastic host! Lots of clear, timely communication before and during the stay. Instructions leading up to arrival were clear, and the room was exactly as described, perfectly spotless and cozy, and exactly what I needed for a short two-night stay on a business trip traveling solo. I stayed in early December and the weather was cool after some rain when I arrived so a fan and open windows kept me comfortable without A/C. Sylvia had a list of recommend restaurants driveable and walkable, lent me a larger umbrella when it was raining, and even picked a bowl of tangerines to share form her tree that were delicious! Would stay again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay at Sylvia's who welcomed me in person to show me around her lovely studio. It is very comfortable with a living room area and one bedroom area.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I drove over to Hilo from Kailua Kona for a business meeting and decided to stay for three nights for a much needed get-away.
When I arrived I just loved the place. Sylvia and Jeff were amazing hosts, and my room (with a private entrance and my own bathroom - a must for me) was quiet, cozy, and beautiful, and the location was perfect. Their communication was easy, and they were quick to respond. They were helpful and available if I needed anything.
On the second evening, after sitting in bed working on my computer, I got off the bed, took a step, and rolled my foot. I broke my foot and ankle! Luckily, it was my left foot! Off to the ER I go.
My hosts let me know they were there if I needed anything and even offered to help me pack up when time to check out. The morning of checkout, I got a text from Sylvia asking me to text her at work when I was ready to go, and Jeff would be there to load my car. I accepted their offer being in a boot and not to be putting weight on my foot. When ready, I sent the text, and in minutes, Jeff was there to help! I was so grateful!
I will go out of my way to take another get-away so I can enjoy another quiet stay at Sylvia and Jeff's abode!
A hui hou Sylvia and Jeff!"

Rachel and Dan were wonderful and friendly hosts. We would surely return again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had a wonderfully peaceful stay at Kulike Farm. Dan and Rachel were fantastic hosts, giving us a tour of their farm and sharing their chocolate-making process. The chocolate was the best we have ever had! Their property is simply amazing, providing a quiet retreat surrounded by nature. We especially loved the DIY breakfast basket filled with fresh fruit and eggs from the farm. The location is also convenient, being close to many attractions. Should we ever visit the Big Island again, we will definitely stay at Kulike Farm.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This secluded paradise on kulike farms was just what we needed during our stay . We got a tour of the farm where Dan took us through all of the plants and choate making process ! We were still close enough to Hilo and got to do all the things we planned while getting to stay in a secluded spot .
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying at Kulike farm! It is a perfect getaway to feel refreshed, recharge and get blissed out. We love the surroundings and the waterfall. Beautiful place to ground yourself. The house is cute and quaint. Rachel was responsive and helpful! This was our second time staying and we definitely will be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I hardly know where to begin! This magical forest retreat was so amazing. It was extremely private, and having our own waterfall so close was so special. I love the philosophy of the farm (off grid - and growing organic chocolate!!). We spent the majority of our trip to Hawaii here, and it was absolutely the right place for us. And the drinking water was fantastic! I usually need to add lemon to our water at home, but the fresh water at the farm was soooo good. I loved listening to the rain - which usually occurred only at night. The frogs were loud at night- I used earplugs, but my husband slept soundly without them. It was a truly memorable experience. I hope to be back one day!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Staying at Forest Hale was like staying in paradise. The accommodation was the perfect size for my family of three. We loved the waterfall (bring water shoes!), private views, and the overall sense of peace we had while staying there. The place was very clean, and I didn’t see a single cockroach inside or outside the house (which hasn’t been my experience with other Hawaiian property rentals). Rachel and Dan were very friendly and welcoming, and we loved taking a tour of their farm and meeting the animals. If you’re looking for an unique, off-grid, and beautiful place to stay that’s in nature, and if you don’t mind driving 20-30 minutes to get into town, then this is the place for you."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really appreciate Rachel and Dan's overall assistance and guidance on living off grid, as well as their consideration to help us create lifelong memories on their paradise of an off-grid site. Our time together was a gift. Of course also their farmstand treats, and farm tour! We are extremely grateful for all of your efforts in growing food and creating abundance and kindness in the community. Hopefully we can meet again soon! Thank you again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful stay at forest hale. The information book on table was very informative as well as the quick response from host -very responsive. It was truly a therapeutic stay. I look forward into staying again in the future .
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a highlight of our trip to Hawaii. Dan and Rachel were lovely hosts. Dan took us on a tour around the farm, taught us all about organic farming and chocolate making. Our boys absolutely loved it and will be talking about that cabin for years to come. The waterfall was a bonus! what a gem!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,We really enjoyed this jungle oasis. It had everything we needed and was very comfortable.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a pleasant time here surrounded by the rainforest. We especially enjoyed the sounds of waterfall, frogs and birds."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a treasure! The drive in through the countryside is so beautiful. The house is nestled behind tropical plants and feels so private and peaceful. Inside is simple, but comfortable. We left the windows open at night to enjoy the sounds of soft rain and coqui frogs. It was also such a neat experience to try the fruit and chocolate from the farm. It was some of the best I’ve ever had!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredible location. Unique and peaceful. We loved our time at the farm - we'd love to come back!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Two thumbs up and would highly recommend. This farm stay was exactly what we were looking for. The route to get there was gorgeous. The mornings and evenings were so peaceful. The hosts were helpful and friendly and the farm stand produce was delicious. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this beautiful and well maintained cottage. This is a gorgeous part of the island. We also loved our farm tour.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel and Dan's place truly felt like a home to us. I only regret we didn't stay longer! My wife and I stayed here on our honeymoon. The waterfall is so beautiful, and the carefully laid pathway to it is awesome - they have taken great care to put in perfect stone steps and a railing to guide you down to the waterfall. The home feels very private and boasts the best stocked kitchen of any airbnb (gas stove, metal utensils, cast iron and stainless steel cookware). Take the farm tour and buy some of their unique and carefully crafted chocolate - it was one of the highlights of our trip! The farm stand is great too. The bed is comfy and high quality."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and peaceful setting. Exactly what we were looking for. Beautiful grounds with an amazing waterfall and swimming hole.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The waterfall was very pretty, and the fruit and chocolate baskets were fun."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, and the breakfast basket was definitely worth it"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,As described with some fun things nearby. Enjoyed the waterfall and the make it yourself breakfast offerings.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very pleasant time in Rachel and Dan’s cabin.
The environment is perfect for resting and escaping, in the open country of Big Island."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to have a genuine Hawaiian stay. Including the most magnificent waterfall imaginable right out the back door. Rachel and Dan are the most genuine lovable people you will ever meet, and you can taste that love “Aloha” in every chocolate bar they produce and everything they do around this beautiful permaculture farm. If its available book now. They need to raise the price. Mahalo."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cannot express how beautiful this place is.... It's a perfect stay
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rachel was an awesome host! We throughly enjoyed our time and hope to stay here again in the next year. A delightful breakfast basket and the coffee and tea were amazing!
Thank you, Rachel. You made this whole trip even better than it already was. The beach gear was a surprise and we really took advantage of it! What a beautiful property and we highly recommend the breakfast basket!
There are some playing cards and other games on property and we had some great connective family time swimming at the waterfall and at the kitchen table playing games. It was a delight through and through."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay at the farm. Exactly what we were looking for.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place! We loved how secluded and private it was, and the waterfall was amazing! Great fresh eggs and fruit as well, and we are big fans of the chocolate from the farm stand!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful surroundings and waterfall on an awesome organic self sustaining farm. Rachel and Dan are very kind and welcoming. Loved the organic fruit and goods available for purchase at the on sight stand. The DIY breakfast basket and cacao tour offered as an extra are highly recommended.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel's place is one of the most unique and beautiful places I've stayed at. It is relatively secluded on a farm, surrounded by nature, but doesn't feel ""remote"". The bedroom is very comfortable and the kitchen is well-stocked (we got fresh eggs, chocolate, and fruit from Rachel). It rained one night while we were there, but the sky was clear the next day and the view of the stars was almost as clear as from the top of Mauna Kea.
The location is close enough to places we wanted to visit (about 30 minutes to Hilo and restaurants, about 1.5 hours to Mauna Kea, about 1 hour to Volcanoes National Park) so it was perfect. We'd love to stay here again when we visit the Big Island again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family enjoyed the stay at Rachel’s cozy cabin, which brought back fond memories of my childhood. The natural beauty and sounds of the farm have been a refreshing change of pace."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel’s place is an hidden gem.. don’t miss it.. go for it…Kulike waterfalls is a huge bonus.. due to rains, we couldn’t enjoy as much but next time🙏"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"3 miles off the main highway, the location is peaceful and quiet. (With lots of coqui frogs at night!) Sadly, it was a bit too cool to try the private waterfall/pool but it sure looked inviting!
The cottage is cozy, clean, and simply appointed.
Try Rachel's delicious DIY Breakfast basket! Eggs and a variety of fruits from their forest farm. And treat yourself to farm-made chocolate bars from their farm stand! Delicious and made under the best conditions.
We didn't get a chance to book a farm tour but it is on our list for when we return."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved the farm! We got a fruit basket, and it was amazing! The space was so peaceful, surrounded by nature. Must checkout the waterfall! Amazing stay, would stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a stunning little cottage that exceeded all of our expectations. The cottage is in a more remote area, but believe me when I say it is incredibly plush. Do not be afraid that it is partially off grid; the gas stove and propane heater ensure you can cook all your food and take a (reasonable; don’t be wasteful!) hot shower. The location is unparalleled and the local fauna and onsite waterfall were magical. We thoroughly enjoyed sitting outside each morning and admiring the plants. The frogs were nice white noise at night, too. I would also encourage guests to enjoy the optional fruit + egg basket and to purchase the local chocolate from the farm stand. Altogether, we had a delightful stay and would thoroughly recommend this place to other prospective guests."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rachel’s place is in a beautiful location with a private waterfall. Make sure to opt in for her delicious eggs, fruit and chocolate baskets. A real unique experience!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This farmstay is an amazing spot. The walk down the road at sunrise was one of the highlights of the stay--the ocean appears over the horizon as you walk down the road. The water at the waterfall was quite cold, so we only went swimming once, but it is beautiful. We appreciated learning from Dan on the farm tour, and we couldn't get enough of the honey-sweetened chocolate they make and sell at the farm stand!
Rachel went above and beyond by mailing us the brush that my daughter left behind when we checked out."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We originally were staying at a Hilton resort which immediately after checking in we realized that it was not the way we wanted to spend our time on the big island. We cancelled the rest of our stay and found Rachel’s place after a last minute cancellation that they had. We came to the place late at night and Rachel was responsive in making sure we made it! We loved the place, the farm stand, waterfall, breakfast basket and chocolate basket that we were able to purchase from the farm. The obvious pro to this place is the location you are in the middle of the jungle but that is also the only negative you are in the middle of the jungle. Expect bugs, moths and loud frogs. While we never saw a frog we sure heard them at night! My partner found it peaceful, I put in some earplugs. We loved relaxing on the porch and walking around the property looking at all the vegetation. If you can handle a little bugs and frogs and this place is available, do it, it’s 1000% worth it! Thank you!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home and farm are beautiful. Spacious, fully stocked with everything we could have needed, and very very clean. The waterfall was such a treat. The farm stand has lots of delicious and hand crafted items. Our only regret was that we didn’t book a longer trip! The hosts were really sweet and the farm tour was very cool! I would recommend this place if you wanted a more laid back experience."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and peaceful place, exactly as advertised. Waterfal was so special, owners were responsive and helpful. cabin is off grid, but has wifi. it was a nice escape!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Forest Hale cabin and farm was even more fantastic than the pictures! What a stunning, peaceful and secluded spot. I was expecting the cabin to be like “glamping” but it’s way closer to a standard hotel suite— just on top of nature. Rachel was a fantastic host and the tour of the farm was very informative. She was very welcoming. Everything we ate from the farm was incredible. I can’t imagine getting to know Hawaii any other way. We’d go back in a heartbeat!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW!! I cannot even begin to explain how magical our stay was! Falling asleep to the sounds of coqui frogs, walking around the gorgeous grounds and spotting geckos and various fruit trees was so fun! We purchased some goodies from the farm stand and enjoyed farm fresh eggs and the best chocolate I've ever had! The highlight was the private waterfall/swimming hole! The water was chilly but absolutely worth getting soaked under the eaterfall. Our swim was pure magic--peaceful, private, and we even spotted prawns! If you are looking for a relaxing, gorgeous stay that highlights Hawaii's natural beauty, this is it! I've already recommended this stay to family and friends. We would definitely come back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of my favorite airbnbs I’ve stayed at so far. The house was great. It was remote and off grid but so cool! I loved the private waterfall most of all! Being able to buy fruit and chocolate was nice too. The house was clean and the host was very responsive. Would definitely stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very lovely and private jungle setting. The road in was just as lovey. The water fall really is just 3min walk from the front door but it rains so frequently that we didn’t find the water too inviting (murky).
The place was clean and lots of thoughtful items included to make the stay comfortable. Lots of items available in the kitchen to use, more than what we needed to cook. Our hot water/propane gave us hot water the entire stay. Everything was well cared for and maintained. The host was very responsive and checked in on us to make sure we arrive ok.
The only down side: mosquitoes were more abundant than expected - but that should have been expected.
All in all - incredible."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was the most beautiful place I have ever been. The place felt right at home and had everything you could possibly need in the kitchen and plenty of towels. The drive up there was so beautiful from Hilo and the waterfall absolutely took your breath away. And the farm stand was an absolute plus! We are from Oahu and will definitely be back. Thanks so much again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay! The singing of the frogs at night rocked us, the environment is very relaxing. Despite our late request Rachel was able to provide us with a great breakfast basket 😊 All good! Thanks again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a country loving bnb! The waterfall was an amazing little feature to have. Keep in mind, steep and slippery steps down to get to it. From the house, you can hear the falls pumping and it adds to the already peaceful surroundings. The basics were provided in the home. They even had a pack n play for our littlest traveler. Hawaii living at its finest with provided rules for recycling and composting. Be prepared for sorting! The fruit flies are ever present with the abundance of fruit just outside your door but the hosts were prepared with all needed items to combat them indoor and out. Great atractions nearby for everyone in the family. Overall, I would stay here again and stay longer! A firepit or fire feature could be a good addition for the home if the owners were open to suggestions. Loved our stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you're a fan of nature this is the place to be. Highly recommendable and great host.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful part of Hawaii, felt like we were escaping the tourist bustle. Quiet, secluded, very private in amongst lush gardens. Highly recommend the fruit & egg basket, which Rachel thoughtfully put together from their farm! We LOVED the sounds of the frogs and forest at night - beats city sounds any time ;) Thank you for a fabulous experience."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a relaxing few says at the Forest Hale and would highly recommend it! Unfortunately, I had to cut my trip to the BI short, but I will definitely be back to stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely stunning place. Our favorite place during our 9 day stay on the Big Island. Spoke with Rachel a few times and had a great time. Truly breathtaking experience. My husband loved the chocolate that they sell in their fruit farm stand. 10/10. Gets your away from the crowds and people. Ultimate getaway experience. Thank you for letting us stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rachel’s place was fantastic for our family stay. The waterfall and swimming hole were delightful for us and the kids…just the path through the bamboo forest to the waterfall was an adventure for us! The farm itself is so peaceful. It wasn’t far to Hilo, and we spent a lot of time there, at farmers market, Carlsmith beach, and the many good restaurants in town. We find ourselves coming to the Hamakua coast again and again, and our stay at Rachel’s convinced us that we will be back soon."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing spot on earth, bless Rachel and her husband for creating this farm and sharing it with the rest of us! Only wish I had not had an emergency that cut my stay in half, but I'll be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A very homey and welcoming cabin in the food forest. The cabin had a bedroom, and separate sleeping accomodations for kids in the loft above. Loft looks down into the living room / kitchen area. Washer and dryer were very handy when staying for over a week. Not only did the hosts provide helpful pointers, but they also had equipment (e.g. boogie boards, towels, etc) one could borrow for the beach.
Hosts were super responsive. Any time we had a question or needed something, they replied promptly and helped.
The farm stand had delicious fresh produce (fresh local fruit and veg is the best!) and chocolate. The stand was conveniently located on the way in. They also provided eggs and sugar cane lemonade at a stand up the hill a bit.
We opted for both the farm and chocolate tours. They both were fascinating! We learned a lot about this place, food forests, and how chocolate is made."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel is great. like the experience we had to sleep at her place. my 21-year-old son felt very good. we had never slept in such a place. if I could, I'll put 6 stars. yet I'm afraid of insects. but everything is good. the waterfall is very beautiful but I haven't been there, too many mosquitoes. thank you again, we loved your cottage. very well equipped in addition. thank you"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful little home with peaceful surroundings. Lake, trees with fruits , plants all around the home , ducks , smell of pure air is just mesmerizing. One should be lucky to own or stay in a home like this. My 6 years old daughter experienced this for the first time and she is so so happy. I am glad that I chose this place to stay. Rachel, thank you so much for letting us stay here. Not forgetting, the cookies and chocolates on the farm stand are so delicious."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a treat to stay here. So thankful for there to be Airbnb’s such as this. Easy to feel right at home here. The hale itself has everything you need-and is very well kept and clean. The surrounding property and area is simply beautiful.
I had been to the property another time before, but was not staying the night. This time around booked for two nights as I had my folks visiting. An absolute gem this place-look forward to returning!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cottage in the middle of incredibly green. For 2 adults and 2 children well enough. Well maintained bathroom. Kitchen with more equipment than you need for a few days. Breakfast basket with cacao fruit, soursop, papaya, apple bananas, some herbs and eggs was a blast. An ideal hideaway for a few days of relaxation in the rainforest. By the way, the frogs are noisy, part of a wonderful nature and not disturbing at all. We loved them."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Authentic and fun experience. Loved our stay there.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The place as described in the details with lush surroundings, peaceful, and off the beaten path.  The DIY breakfast basket was a nice touch. There aren't any eateries nearby so plan ahead.  Host was very responsive.  Nice place to stay for a night or two."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here for two nights and would love to come back. The farm is beautiful and it was so much fun to swim under the waterfall. We saw several cute geckos and even one frog. The kitchen and bathroom had everything we needed. We loved the stunning views and the farm stand.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I considered not reviewing this Airbnb. I want to keep it a secret. It’s not in a resort area. It’s off grid, and I love that. Let’s just say it’s authentic, special, one of a kind. Rachel and Dan were the best Airbnb hosts I have ever had. I am just praying this place will stay available for years to come as I play on staying again asap. Thank you so much for the gorgeous fruit basket, chocolate, sugar cane lemonade. Thank you Dan for the amazing tour!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our families ( husband and 2 teenagers) favorite place we stayed on our trip .. they loved the waterfall, the night time frogs, the sounds and the feeling of being in such a beautiful secluded tropical place with the fruit stand and breakfast baskets giving us new and interesting fruits to experience. We used one of the 10 percent off coupons in the cabin to do book the Botanical Gardens zip lines and Gardens which are basically on the property and this gave us a great glimpse of the surrounding land and a feeling of how special this place is. Book zipline ahead and just tell them you have the coupon.. We booked after we arrived but the time slots where limited. We stayed two nights... we could have stayed longer.. great location to Hilo and Waimea. Make sure you do the nearby scenic drive to explore other rivers coming down the valley. Thank you Rachel for sharing your beautiful space with us it was magical."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed in 3 different places on our trip around the Big Island. This was our favorite spot. It was the perfect place to wind down and relax at the end of our trip. Rachel was the perfect hostess. Thank you!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! Really nice off the grid place. Middle of nature and it’s beauty. Rachel and Dan were amazing people to meet during the farm tour. Highly recommend. Also, you get used to the nature sounds, no worries."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,The most beautiful place I’ve ever stayed! I swam in the waterfall every morning! Rachel responded very quickly to all my inquiries and was very welcoming and kind.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage in the rainforest was exactly what we needed to get away from it all. Everything was very clean. Rachel included little extras that made our stay so convenient such as thermoses for coffee to go and umbrellas. The frogs are very loud at night but the fan that was included allowed us to sleep peacefully. The farm store was so much fun and allowed me to indulge in special treats right from the farm during our stay. We opted to do the farm tour with Dan and learned about regenerative farming and the fruits grown on property. Thank you Rachel for being such a responsive host and we hope to return again one day!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A special experience in the jungle of Hawaii.
You can't miss a small waterfall nearby. I rested comfortably thanks to the friendly host."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This experience was more than we expected. if you're looking to truly unwind and get away from the crowds and lights of the city. Enjoy this open land ranch experience 3 miles from the highway tucked deep in the forest. we could not have asked for a better place to spend our week in Hilo. From the market stand on the private driveway, shared lagoon and waterfall. to all the suggestions and information for traveling and activities our time was perfect. we never needed anything, and our host was available and responsive if needed. We highly recommend staying at the farm."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Based on where the place is located is enough to speak highly of. Remote, very quiet. Fresh fruit, fresh eggs and mountain water. We loved the tour of the farm, too. We can't forget to mention the freshly made chocolate! The waterfall on premise was a huge bonus!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was by far my favorite place we stayed in Hawaii! I prefer quiet, rural, farm like settings with wilderness around in this was exactly it. Furthermore, there was every tropical fruit you could imagine, including cacao, which I have always wanted to taste fresh pods from a plant, and this was probably the best possible place that I could’ve ever found for that! I also learned some new things about keeping chickens, as I have my own chickens and gain some new ideas from Dan on how to improve my set up where I live, which is also rural, but much colder! The cabin was wonderful: it was bright, clean, lovely breeze, and lovely view, and just a short distance to a wonderful waterfall that you could swim in. I just can’t say enough about how much I love this place! Thank you Rachel and thank you Dan for such a wonderful time I wish I could’ve spent my entire vacation there!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most unique and beautiful locations we have stayed in Big Island. Conveniently located between Akaka falls and Hilo, Rachel & Dan's Kulike farm is beautiful, peaceful and a relaxing getaway. If you are looking for a place to unwind, away from the tourists, and get a flavor of the real Big Island, then this is your spot. The best part of the location was Rachel's amazing fruit basket and the farmstand - allowing us to enjoy the local flavors. We look forward to our future stay at Kulike farm."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel’s farm was beautiful. The house was perfect, clean and simple, loved the sound of the rain on the roof. The waterfall on the property is a truly special place, magical!!! Highly recommend the farm tour and say yes to the farm fresh eggs and fruit basket in the morning. Choosing this location to explore Hilo and the waterfalls was a perfect choice."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at Rachel’s. Perfect for unwinding and being closer to nature. The proximity to waterfall and fresh fruit right on the farm was a nice perk. Make sure to say yes to the fruit basket prior to arrival!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family of three stayed at the Forest Hale for 4 nights, it was both fantastic and memorable. The property was exactly as posted, and we were so happy we chose to stay here for our vacation. Rachel is a wonderful host; we also went on a farm tour to learn all about the transformation of the area into the gem of an off-grid eco-friendly fruit farm it is today. Very inspiring, a wonderful place to visit! Highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel and Dan's regenerative farm is a heavenly place to stay where the surroundings are beautiful and their attractive well maintained cottage provides everything you need for a very comfortable time. The location is ideal for travelers who want to experience the amazing waterfalls and dramatic scenery along the eastern coast of the Big Island as well as have a chance to visit Hilo, the largest city on the island. Rachel and Dan were very friendly hosts. Be sure to enjoy some of the food sold at their farm stand and to sign up for a tour of their farm as well."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We went during the rainy season but the farm was still beautiful.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, great host. Nice to be off the grid!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel & Dan’s place is exactly as advertised. It is a very private and well equipped cabin located on a cacao farm. It is quiet and full of light. Yes, there are frogs at night but you will miss them once you go home :-). Despite not being on the property during our stay, Rachel responded quickly to our messages and communicated well. The road in is fine. Hilo and the local beaches are only 25-30 minutes away. Overall, a great base to explore the east coast of the island."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A remote, peaceful place on a working farm… but you’d never know that other than by the sweet farm stand at the entrance. We purchased one of Rachel’s fruit baskets, fun to get an array of foods we’d never tried before. Cabin is well appointed, particularly the kitchen. We cooked during our stay and found everything we needed. Bed was very comfortable. Very good WiFi connection. We took advantage of free passes for the nearby botanical gardens, was fun to walk down and explore those."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location off the beaten path and very private. Great value and plenty of room for our family of 4 (kids loved the loft). So fun to use the self serve farm stand. We all enjoyed the farm tour and learning about different tropical fruit (that wouldn’t even grow in a greenhouse where we live). We purchased a fruit basket from Rachel and we all tasted fruit we had never even heard of before. So fun. Excellent introduction to permaculture in Hawaii. Oh and they have a beautiful private waterfall that is about a min walk away.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love this place so much. A little hard to find, but we finally made it. Definitely will come back!! The surroundings area so amazing. Super comfortable bed!!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique and lovely place! So peaceful and located near some beautiful sights just outside of Hilo.
The house was comfortable and clean and just what our party of 3 adults needed.
The farm itself is so interesting
and shows what hardworking people Rachel and Dan are. We really enjoyed meeting them and even some of the rest of their family! I hope we get to go back some day and would highly recommend it to anyone that wants to stay in a safe, quiet place while visiting Hilo area."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it was exactly as advertised and the waterfall was so beautiful. about 30 minutes to Hilo. Not as remote as I had thought. the breakfast basket was so good. I'd stay here again
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rachel was incredibly responsive and helpful. The stars at night and farm are stunning. Great experience away from Hill city centre
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super comfy and peaceful. Very jungly and quiet. So nice and restful. If you’re looking for a peaceful home base I don’t think you can do much better than this. Loved the kitchen and the big windows and the silence.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was so serene and the location was beautiful. It feels like a dream come true! A private waterfall and a farm stand was one of the highlights. The host was so accommodating in every way!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here! The surroundings were absolutely beautiful and so unique. It was 100% worth the 30min drive to Hilo for day activities and meals. As it is mentioned in the description, a suv would be best to access their property. The kitchen is fully equipped, we made several meals during our stay, and the coffee that is provided is wonderful! I highly recommend the fruit basket, we were able to try some new fruits we wouldn’t necessarily buy ourselves (our favorite was the Abiu). The waterfall was amazing and the hosts very communicative. We would 100% stay here again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Where do I even begin? The Forest Hale is a lovely retreat and also an unique experience that is the highlight of our stay on Big Island. Highly recommended. Rachel is a terrific host who made sure we had everything we needed to be comfortable. We look forward to being back again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had such a relaxing vacation at Rachel & Dan’s farm. Our kids miss the farm. When we go back to the Big Island, we want to stay there again. When our family talked about our top two favorite parts of the trip, everyone named Rachel’s farm as one of them. It is truly a special place - a cottage with a loft, a farm with a waterfall, walking paths with fruits, and a farm store that has yummy chocolate Rachel & Dan make.
Rachel was a lovely host and gave our kids their favorite memory of fruit picking. Rachel gave such a detailed description of how to get to the farm. We had no problems at all despite arriving at night. She was also very responsive and checked in with us to see if we were comfortable. We had everything that we needed to feel at home in the cottage.
The location is a short drive to downtown Hilo, Coconut Island beach, Carlsmith beach (yes folks Hilo has beaches), Akaka falls, and the World Botanical Garden & Zip Line is literally at the bottom of the hill."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Awesome little off grid cottage just north of Hilo
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Accurate description that matched what we were looking for. Delicious produce and chocolate!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so wonderful, the waterfall and pool underneath were a real treat! It was also well stocked with lots of extra supplies we didn't even think of and definitely used, like umbrellas and coffee travel mugs. The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of pillows. I do think the upstairs was super cute! We did not need it, because it was just two of us, but I think as a teenager I would have loved hanging out in the loft upstairs. It is definitely not stairs for very little kids, but for slightly older ones it feels like a cool hangout. The views outside the living area and bedroom were beautiful, the perfect place to wake up and have a lovely breakfast in the morning. The frogs serenaded us at night and I loved it, but they were loud so if you need silence when you sleep use the ear plugs they provide. Overall it was the most magical stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to be secluded. Amazing view and the water full close by was awesome.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you came to Hilo for a beautiful, private, fantastic jungle hideaway, this is a great choice. you are literally in the middle of your own jungle oasis. this place has all the things you need to be comfortable and cozy while you watch the rain fall outside the huge picture windows. really remarkable"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great relaxing place to stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"this place is magical just like the Big Isand it is on. I'm so grateful for the opportunityto stay here. The property is AMAZING!! There are many fruits growing, property is very neat and organized. I got a tour of the place and learned what the farm is all about. Dan and Rachel are geniuses in my book. I received so much Aloha from every person I met on the property.
Rachel responds to messages right away.
you have access to the most beautiful and private waterfall. I slept soundly to the symphony of rain forest sounds. No light pollution so I saw a sky full of stars on clear nights. You can hear the waterfalls from your room.
so many amenities: fresh coffee beans French press, kettle, thermos, coolers, umbrellas, bathroom toiletries etc.
I can go on and on. I'm home now and I can honestly say I miss the place. I hope to return again and again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an awesome experience! The cottage was just as described and the farm was even better! I didn’t have high expectations for the waterfall and I was overwhelmed with its beauty, just steps away from the front door. The shower has great pressure and was hot!The king bed was extremely comfortable and we fell asleep to the coqui frogs and woke up to birds chirping! We also sat outside at night in awe of the stars. Dan was kind enough to take us on a tour of the farm so we could learn how they live off of the land.
Highly recommend this place if you’re looking for something unique!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful. The setting is breathtaking, the cabin gorgeous, and Rachel was welcoming, engaging and very helpful. I can’t recommend this place enough - the whole experience was one which will stay with me for a lifetime. I took the tour, opted to get the fruit basket, and bought some items from the farm stand - all of these were well worth doing. Definitely don’t miss out on the chocolate which is handmade on the farm!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,A one-of-kind Hawaiian forest experience.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was Great! It did not disappoint. The special care in details to make guests comfortable was exceptional. I would stay again and again. 10/10. Mahalo!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We just left this Airbn gem and can't wait to come back. If you love high rise, posh resorts, this wouldn't be for you. If you want to experience old Hawaii and rural countryside, this is it. I just hope that Rachel has availability when we come back! Thank you for a wonderful, peaceful stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an experience for someone who wants to see and feel nature in the midst of a place that is utterly unique. Like living in a jungle with fruits and flora you have never seen. A great diversion to the traditional beach scene and one that we will never forget!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed three nights and wanted to stay three months. Rain and frogs and waterfalls. Everything you need and comfortable accomodations. Nothing like it.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is truly magical! The surrounding beauty that can be found at Forest Hale is what makes this Airbnb so special. The path down to the waterfall located a few steps from the front door is a once in a lifetime experience! Our Airbnb had all the amenities that we needed for a relaxing stay. Get the farm basket from Rachel and you’ll receive all the yummy foods needed for a nice breakfast. Make sure to explore the land at Forest Hale and stop by the farm stand to grab some yummy treats or beverages. Rachel responded easily and quickly to messages and was a great host. Thank you Rachel and Forest Hale for giving both of us an incredible visit on the Big Island.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice stay, very quite and relaxing area. Nice and cool as well so a/c needed. Check in was smooth and so was check out. The fruit stand is a nice plus as well and it’s in walking distance from the house. Had an issue with bugs but other than that great stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful healing sanctuary off the grid. Quiet, soothing & gorgeous with everything you may need for several days. The waterfall and emerald swimming pool is very special it feels secluded and private while being surrounded by lush greenery and protected by a tapestry of golden green striped bamboo. Magical."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four were very happy with our stay. The kids (4&6) enjoyed the loft and running around outside. It had everything we needed and there were no logistical issues (ie road, driving directions, drinking water, toilet and shower) that had caused me to hesitate when booking. Perhaps the highlight was driving down the road after arriving in the dark and seeing the ocean view!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Communication, location, comfort, amenities, etc were all immaculate! Would come back for sure"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Rachel and Dan's place.
From the cottage they created to the waterfalls, through the small farm produce stand, everything was absolutely perfect and so authentic.
An unforgettable experience that we highly recommend."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful experience! We loved the jungle vibe. The home felt very secluded and swimming in the waterfall
pool was magical. We enjoyed the little market and diy breakfast too! Hilo was a super special place and it wasn’t a big deal to drive into town for restaurants and activities. Definitely a travel experience to remember!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a highlight of our vacation in Hawaii! The cottage (""Forest Hale"") is surrounded by greenery and a short walk to a waterfall (maybe 20 ft high?)
Our kids loved seeing the animals on the farm and sleeping in the loft. They did not enjoy the fact that there was no TV, but still said it was their favorite place to stay in Hawaii and want to come back for longer next time.
Very clean and comfortable for our family of 4.
Short distance to larger waterfalls (Akaka falls), botanical gardens, and zip lines. Highly recommended."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The property exceeded our expectations. The waterfall was a special, magical place. Even bigger and more beautiful than the pictures. Dan and Rachel were terrific guests. The farm stand had amazing fruit, chocolate, yogurt, eggs, and wine! Highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rachel is a dream host, and the Hale is a fantasy stay. We have been in paradise. Our hearts will always remember this lovely location."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful waterfall and farm!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rachel was a wonderful host. She was very responsive whenever I had a question. The place was wonderful. We enjoyed being out in nature, especially the beautiful waterfall. We had breakfast out on the patio many times enjoying the views. We also enjoyed the breakfast basket with new fruit for us to try. We would definitely come back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect end to our two week trip around Hawaii! My two girls loved learning about the farm from our host, the accommodations were very comfortable, the location was beautiful and close to plenty of things to explore and the farm stand was filled with tasty treats. We wouldn’t hesitate to return. Thank you for sharing your slice of paradise!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was a wonderful place to stay! We loved the farm and the waterfall. They also make the most delicious chocolate!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the best family vacation we had! Rachel and Dan are very knowledgeable, hospitable and created a beautiful environment. We miss the home and the waterfall. It was nice to be surrounded by nature. Very serene and peaceful. Also we recommend taking the tour and buying local from the self serve food stand. Delicious!!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was fantastic! Exactly as we had pictured it.
The cabin is clean, spacious, private, with all the amenities you may need.
Rachel is an excellent host. Great communication.
We had the farm breakfast basket both mornings which made our stay even more pleasant. The area is beautiful and peaceful. Great location on the hilo side- close to waterfalls and central between hilo and waipo valley."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a truly rainforest experience, with the frogs at night and a little rain. We enjoyed a tour of the farm ($45/couple). Rachel is a responsive, pleasant, and responsible host. We didn’t have any problems getting up to the property on the 1 lane road. Day trips to the falls and volcanos is a must. House is basic and comfortable enough, and matches the photos."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing place to stay. It felt very secluded and private. The farm stand was a convenient way to get a few supplies to cook, and the diy breakfast was so generous, as we were able to try a variety of delicious local fruits. The cabin itself was very clean, spacious and had everything we needed. The instructions for everything was incredibly detailed and easy to follow. Communication with Rachel was easy, she answered any questions quickly and offered suggestions and insight to make things easier. The waterfall was a dream! We would love to return and next time do the farm tour. Overall it was probably my favorite Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rachel & Dan we’re great & quick communicators. We loved staying & can’t wait to come back! Dan provided a farm tour and we learned so much/enjoyed learning new things from him. The space is magic!! Everything was way above our expectations. EVERYTHING was perfect about this stay! Thank you for opening your space and sharing the land 🤍
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This hale is a wonderful place to escape into nature! The waterfall is amazing, and so peaceful with the bamboo on the banks. I regret not swimming there more often. Because it's 30min from town, it gets very dark and you can see stars for miles during the night. For this same reason, I recommend you get there before sunset on your first night. The road going up is hilly and winding, but offers amazing views of the forest and ocean. As for the hale itself, the gigantic bed was so comfortable, I never wanted to get out! The entire place is very cozy, and Rachel provides all the cooking necessities and more. She and Dan are so very welcoming, and I felt the Aloha as soon as I got there. The gate opener is a must, especially on those rainy days."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The cabin right in the rain forest is so nice . Truly a connection with nature.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible stay here! The place was clean, had all the amenities we needed and more, and was so comfortable. We loved going to the waterfall and swimming there, eating breakfast out on the front porch area, and visiting the farmstand everyday. The shower was also great - great pressure and temperature. We are already looking forward to coming back! Highly recommend!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I wish there was an option for more stars because I have never been so impressed with a place. It was WONDERFUL. Not a single complaint. Book it!! We already have plans to come back. ♥️♥️♥️
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I stayed on the Farm with my husband and 9 year old son. It was such a wonderful place to stay. We loved the Farm tour, Farm Stand and breakfast baskets! Rachel was very easy to get a hold of and the house had everything we needed. Staying here made our trip to Hawaii even more special!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great experience! The beauty of the surrounding rainforest and farm, fresh fruits, room for the kids to play, and, of course, the waterfall. Many family memories were made here! Thank you, Rachel!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely forest hale! We had a great time exploring the farm and swimming under the waterfall. The home was cozy and had everything you needed! Rachel and Dan are great hosts!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Kulike Farm. The setting is remote and relaxing, and Rachel was welcoming and communicative before and during our stay."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It is amazing how much more you get from an AirBnB compared to a hotel of the same price. Rachel’s cabin is a hidden gem in a tropical paradise. She both gave us privacy and was attentive, via text, to ensure we were enjoying our stay. We spent most of our holiday time on the Kona side of the island but are super happy that we spent 3 nights at Rachel’s place near Hilo."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our favorite part of our trip! We loved the cabin. It was beautiful, serene and everything we hoped for to end our vacation. Definitely recommend this stay!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We are a family of three, two adults and a 9 year old. The Forest Hale was a great base for exploring Hilo and surroundings, but it was also a lovely place to relax and enjoy the lush countryside. Rachel and Dan are fantastic hosts, warm and helpful but never intrusive. There’s a great self serve farm stand with fresh fruit, drinks, and baked goods on the property. Fresh eggs and greens are also available. Just a wonderful little spot, beautiful and exactly as described!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful house near gorgeous waterfall, pool, and river, spacious, light and clean. Kind hosts with quick responses via text. Personal guidance where needed. The bathroom was large and clean with a great shower and plenty of towels and hot water. The pictures are accurate. Kitchen supplied with basic equipment and condiments. We used fresh coffee beans and grinder daily. Especially nice refrigerator. Broiler worked fine as a toaster. Electricity was perfect for lighting and getting all our devices charged. Internet did great for streaming."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really loved our stay here. They cabin is delightful, the farm and people are super interesting, the location and views are beautiful and swimming under the gorgeous on-site waterfall is the best start to your day. Stay here!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing location with everything you need to have a wonderful getaway. Beautiful gardens and private cottage. We enjoyed a tour from Rachel and learned a lot about their farm. The location is also just a few minutes away from the Botanical Garden and zip lines.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Nature all around. Frogs were a wonderful sound a night. A bit of a drive into Hilo.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Would definitely want to stay here again!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very enjoyable stay. Everything exactly as marketed. Very clean, have everything you need and more. Bed very comfortable. Access to washer dryer greatly appreciated. I would not hesitate to recommend this property fully!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic cabin in an idyllic setting. Very convenient to Hilo despite the remote feeling of the off grid experience. Delightful hosts!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Forest Hale was magical. For those who love peace and nature it is the perfect place. The cabin/ container is two-story and our little daughter loved her little empire under the roof. Communication with Rachel was flawless. The waterfall right next door was our private pool. Jumping into the fresh water was fantastic. We felt comfortable and safe.
It has a small farmer's stand right next to the accommodation. You can buy eggs, seasonal vegetables or fruits, and more.
The sounds of the frogs in the evening did not bother us.
It was 2 too short days. :-)"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Forest Hale is a relaxing oasis.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a peaceful and tranquil spot, glad we had no plans to leave during our two night stay. Waterfall is spectacular to have literally right down a path from the house, fortunately we went down for a peek before it started raining as might be very slippery when wet. We took the farm tour and learned about new plants (ice cream tree was such a treat!) The place is set up with everything you might need, plus a lot of little extras Rachel has added to make your stay comfortable. The kitchen knives were actually sharp, this is incredibly rare in a rental."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. Nothing like falling asleep to the sounds of the rainforest and getting off the grid for a few days. Will be back for another stay. Highly recommend!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The farm was amazing to stay at. The private waterfall was spectacular by itself. Rachel was an amazing host and did everything to make us feel comfortable. Her farm is outstanding and she has so much knowledge about the island and land! I wish I could have stayed in this bnb forever!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, beautiful surroundings. perfect temperature for sleeping. no TV but the but the network is ample for steaming unless you just want to enjoy the beauty of the place."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Rachel is a wonderful host and we had a great time staying in the farm. It’s close to some of the most picturesque places and some great activities. Don’t miss the delicious treats in the farmstead.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great rainforest stay
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is an enjoyable place in its own right... bright and lively decor, layout, and absolutely fantastic surroundings. But I also enjoyed having this eco-friendly place to stay in as a contrast to traditional hotels. No A/C (but yes attic fan), no TV, no dishwasher, but yes cool features like untreated water used in the toilet (that just flushes like normal, don't worry), recycle/ compost, walk to farmstand, and off grid power that made the lights twinkle sometimes. I LOVE how lightly this place allows you to tread on the Earth with just a little extra effort. It's still so fun and comfortable: awesome beds, great WiFi, hot shower, super close to Botanical World and its awesome zip line adventure (I told them where I was you're staying and they might give you a discount, but Rachel doesn't have like a coupon code) . Rachel and Dan give good guidance on how things work, and are there to support as needed. Dan also recommended a great beach (Richardson Ocean Park), and hooked us up with sand toys my kids used for digging and such there.
FYI, breakfast is not included. Happy to pay for the tour of the farm... such amazing work there!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved Rachel’s place, the songs of the birds at night, and the awesome breakfast"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful farm stay that I wish was longer! Rachel was incredibly nice and helpful. We didn’t get a chance to tour the farm, but had we stayed longer, I would have loved that. The waterfall on the property is beautiful and a very short walk from the house. There was a charming farm stand there to pick up some local fruit (and natural bug spray). Overall a great stay that I’d recommend!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing off-grid farm. If you’re looking for an off-grid experience and a peaceful stay, this place is a must! The location is relatively close to Hilo. Getting to the Forest Hale is easiest by mapping Kulike farm and follow Rachel’s turn-by-turn directions when you get to the gate. There is a cool waterfall just a short hike away from the cabin. You can swim there too. The sound of the coqui frogs will lull you to sleep while gazing at the stars through the huge window from your bed. After I left, I realize how much I miss the frogs. You can tour the farm and see first hand how permaculture farming works. Rachel and Dan are wonderful hosts. We bought some amazingly fresh eggs, apple bananas, homemade chocolate bars, and sugarcane lemonade from the farm stand. They take cash and Venmo. We would stay here again!"
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel and Dan were quite kind in accommodating a very last minute change of plans due to unexpected travel changes I faced. I was grateful for their flexibility and willingness to go with the flow (and understanding of a separate length of stay mistake as well!). My interactions with Rachel were just what you’d expect from a super host. Her willingness to work with me, be so accommodating, and responsive was greatly appreciated. I hope to rebook so I get to enjoy the waterfall one day! Thank you Rachel."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Forest Hale! The house is very private so you can enjoy the big windows and leave them open to enjoy the fresh air (all have screens). We were very comfortable and took advantage of the chairs on the lanai to stargaze and even see several shooting stars. Highly recommend the farm tour early in your stay and that you take advantage of access to the waterfall and farm stand. We wished we had more time to just enjoy the waterfall and go swimming. The tour with Dan was easily a highlight of our trip. Easy access to Hilo and several local sights/activities. Rachel and Dan were very responsive and helpful as we planned our trip. Would definitely stay again!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A unique experience of a working farm and a magical waterfall!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! They have everything you need and the property is gorgeous! Make sure you plan to spend at least a few hours of daylight here, don’t want to miss swimming by the waterfall!"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, very clean home in the forest, only about 30 minutes from Hilo. The farm tour is incredible, it's really neat what they are doing and Rachel is very knowledgeable. The chocolate they produce on the farm is delicious. Internet access is very limited; don't plan on being able to work or stream information. Enjoy your time in the rainforest!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private, spacious and cozy stay at Kukile Farm! Unique and impressive farm tour, including feeding chickens and tortoises and learning about natural farming. Delicious lemonade and fresh farm breakfast ingredients. The waterfall swim was a highlight. Lots of amenities and a restful stay."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Forest Hale is a beautiful space with plenty of room and a great view of the farm and sunrise. Rachel is a great host, gives detailed instructions for finding the place. The house manual is really detailed and informative. We enjoyed the farm tour and DIY breakfast. Would highly recommend and hope to return again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel and Dan's farm was the perfect place to escape the city life. It is about 20 to 30 min drive to Hilo, but it really is worth the extra drive if you are looking for a great experience. The farm itself was great. Rachel gave us a great tour and we learned a ton about the plants they grow and why. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook all our meals included different coffee options such as a french press and pour over coffee. The waterfall on the farm was also amazing! It is perfect for swimming in and is a very short walk. I am recommending this place to everyone I know that plans to visit the big island, or Hawaii in general!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hale Kulike was a beautiful experience for us! We loved the unit, the rainforest, the farm stand. Rachel and Linda were so very kind and accommodating. We only hope that we will be able to return. An experience that won’t be forgotten!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Book this place! Rachel was a wonderful host, great with communication and very kind. She greeted us when we arrived and gave us a brief tour around the cabin. Being on the farm in the forest, listening to the frogs at night and hearing the rain in the evening and morning, it was magical. Some reviews said the frogs were really loud, I thought they were a nice muffled background noise (we had all the windows closed at night). We stayed in October, so it got chilly at night but the bedroom was always a little warmer than the rest of the cabin, for us it was the perfect temperature. I loved the peaceful mornings, drinking tea and looking out the windows. We got the breakfast basket - I highly recommend - and we loved getting chocolate and extra eggs from the farm stand. We got to swim in the private swimming hole with the falls! It was cold (of course!) and amazing and a highlight of our stay. There is no picture of the shower, but it's got a really nice and large shower head with decent pressure and the water stays hot! Everything was very clean and very comfortable. The bed was perfect. I'm a small person with chronic back pain, and I was a little worried it would be too firm from the reviews, but it wasn't. For me it was ""soft but supportive."" There's a magical mattress topper that, combined with the bed, made it the most comfortable AirBnb bed I've ever slept on. I woke up with no pain! There is a handy binder for guests and we took advantage of the 10% discount for Ziplining at the Botanical World Adventures just down the road, which was so much fun - just bring the little discount card to them. We rented a Jeep, which we were grateful to have for the farm roads. Location was perfect for exploring this side of the Island and going to Volcano National Park and the Summit. The wet side of the Big Island is definitely the best side! - beautiful lush green forests and waterfalls and plenty to see and do. The dry side is basically all volcano rock and resorts, though it does have nice beaches and interesting historical sites, but you can check that out to and from Kona airport. Stay with Rachel, you will love it!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rachel’s place is a true paradise and was exactly what I needed for a quiet few days away. The waterfall on site is epic and the location of her place is perfect to reach the beautiful sites of the Hamakua coast.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a must! If you are looking for something quiet and relaxing while having a kitchen to cook in and a private waterfall/swimming hole! We loved it here!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just book it! Forest Hale is a little slice of paradise in a beautiful farm/jungle setting. Rachel and her team truly make it as comfortable as possible living off grid. The cabin is comfortable, beautiful views, sweet waterfall/swimming hole, farm stand is so convenient, the farm tour is amazing, and you’re only about 30 minutes (easy drive) from downtown Hilo. Miss it already and can honestly say this location made my trip that much more special."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute cabin in the jungle. Great amenities. Big, comfy bed. Short walk to private waterfall. Friendly hosts provided lovely tour of the farm."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Forrest Hale is a perfect getaway.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super beautiful location in the jungle! We loved swimming at the waterfall and the cabin was well equipped and comfortable.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel’s place is a very cool off the grid experience. The farm was a huge plus. The kitchen is well equipped with everything you need. The hale is secluded and private. We had one clear day to explore the area and it was wonderful, the views, the rainforest….a very cool area of the island. If you looking for seclusion and to experience some serious rainforest, and don’t a lot of rain, Rachel’s place is the spot."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Wonderful place to stay. Private and beautiful with lots of thoughtful touches.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a must-do! The farm stand, the coqui frogs, the people (if you see any), the views (including the observatory)-everything was FANTASTIC. Be prepared for a true once-in-a-lifetime experience in nature…oh, and have a vehicle! Uber/Lyft won’t be an option here as we found out (still the best place we’ve stayed in awhile)."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay on the farm, what a beautiful drive up and comfortable place to stay. Nicely located near Hilo."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay. Quiet and feels like the perfect oasis. Perfect place to unwind and we loved having all the fresh fruit and other items available at the stand! We were able to see everything we wanted and more then come back to a calm space to relax at the end of the night.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a magical place! We loved visiting the waterfall, buying chocolate, and just relaxin. Definitely recommend!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Magical place. Our kids loved the forest and farm animals - ducks, chickens and even a tortoise! The house had everything we needed for a comfortable stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a very peaceful and serene experience at Rachel’s forest cabin. The location and the beautiful waterfall on the property makes it magical. Enjoyed the farm tour with Dan learning about their farming techniques and hydro electric project. Ideal place to unwind.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time at the property. Rachel and Dan are indeed super hosts, very responsive, friendly and accommodating. The place is clean, well equipped, located in such a beautiful area of the island, we thoroughly enjoyed the stay and hope to go back."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very accommodating host, friendly, and such an amazingly beautiful place to stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very cool cottage and had a great stay! So close to all the waterfalls for sight-seeing and kids loved sleeping in the loft.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing. The area is lush with Greeks and fruits. Dan gives an incredible tour that is very informative and everything from the farm stand is delicious (especially the bread, sauerkraut and apple butter) I highly recommend staying here if your looking to truly experience all the island has to offer."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a lovely home in such a unique location. I thought it would be difficult to get to, but it was much easier than I imagined. The forest house is beautiful - tucked away in the trees. It is clean and comfortable. The mattress on the bed was one of the best I’ve had in an Airbnb!
My daughters, age 9 and 14, enjoyed learning about all the plants you are cultivating on the land. Also thanks to Rachel who saved me a pile of money on zip lining, by sending me a copy of the coupon a month or so before our stay."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! WHAT AN AIRBNB! We wanted a unique experience for it being our first time to Hawaii and we could not have asked for anything better. The house was comfortable and the views are spectacular. Plus a private waterfall?!? It was a little slice of beaver for us, thank you Rachel and Dan!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable! Clean, efficient, eco-friendly farm stay but definitely not a “glamping” spot. So much more. The bed is firm and huge, which we enjoyed. The kitchen has everything you need - the coffee is a must try. The location is out there, not super close to much of anything and we liked that. Dan was so cool and informative to talk to. Our only regret was that it was torrential during our stay and we didn’t get to hang out in the waterfall area as it was moving very fast. Be aware that this can be a pretty wet area on the island - but it makes everything here beautiful!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay here! We loved the seclusion, getting massages above the falls, and the lovely fruit and eggs we received. Great location to still be accessible and, but super quiet and peaceful. The host was so friendly and easy to communicate with as well. Really special place, thank you!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The Forest Hale was a very peaceful, tranquil and beautiful stay. Rachel and Dan’s communication was fantastic whenever we needed something. During our extended stay we felt very comfortable with everything that the kitchen had to offer from pots and pans to sharpened cutlery. It’s obvious that they payed close attention to what folks will need during their stay..The waterfall was a nice way to cool down at any time of the day. We will echo other reviews and say, We highly recommend staying here for any period if time!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,wonderful stay at this little slice of heaven.. if the country is your thing this place cannot be beat.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely wonderful. The waterfall is fantastic and refreshing. We will definitely book this place again next time we’re on the big island!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was magical, especially the land. We enjoyed the peace and quiet, massages by the falls, our farm tour, and having dinners at the Hale. Thank you for everything. Everyone was so very friendly. Thank you for welcoming us!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot to kick back and relax! The swimming hole and waterfall are wonderful and just a short walk away. Fresh eggs every morning and yummy chocolate from the farm stand. Lovely spot to sit out on the deck and read and take in the surroundings. Perfect for our family and striking distance to Hilo and hiking/beaches nearby. We would definitely return!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Such a wonderful space. The farm is beautiful and so is the waterfall. Definitely a real Hawaii experience. Wonderful hosts- we really couldn’t ask for anything better!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an exceptional stay. The house is located just far enough outside of Hilo that you can easily get to it by day and come relax with some amazing views by night. The walk to the waterfall was one of the highlights for sure. would highly recommend if you're looking to stay in the area and have a relaxing time.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fully enjoyed our tour of the farm and peaceful setting. Thanks!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved our six days at Forest Hale!
This is exactly why we like staying at B&Bs.
A hotel in this kind of setting....well, does not exist, nor should it. The setting is everything, and its very important not to ruin it with too much of anything. And they've done it beautifully.
Be aware that the gathered fruit and eggs for the Breakfast Tray can be very special - you won't find some of this at the usual Fruit Stands in Hawaii, so you may get a chance to try some unique varieties, depending upon what's on the trees.
The Farm Tour is very worthwhile also, if you have any interest in the functioning farm up the hill from the Hale. You may be quite amazed, as we were, in all that interacts in a farm like this. Think ""The Biggest Little Farm"" movie - but smaller, and in Eden."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The amenities were fabulous, scenery was unbelievable, they were super kind and gracious hosts, and it was the best choice we could have made in terms of where we stayed on the island"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We so enjoyed our stay at the Forest Hale! In retrospect, I wish we had booked 4 nights instead of 3, just so we would have had more time to take advantage of some downtime in the beautiful setting! Rachel was fantastic with communication from the start. The Hale was such a neat place. From enjoying our morning coffee on the lanai overlooking the property to the well stocked kitchen, we had everything we could have possibly needed to make it a comfortable stay. We especially loved purchasing items from the farmstand (especially the lilikoi butter and coconut chocolate chip cookies!). Those frogs at night are really something else! My husband can sleep through anything, but I was prepared with my earplugs, so sleeping was not an issue. The morning of check out, we did a tour of the farm with Rachel. It was fascinating to hear their story and see all that they’ve done to truly be living off the grid. This was definitely a one of a kind experience. We highly recommend Rachel and Dan’s Forest Hale!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We absolutely loved our stay here. The house had everything we needed, the farm was so fun and interesting, and Rachel and Dan patiently answered all our questions about it! It truly felt like being nestled in our own little food forest. We loved the waterfall, ducks, eggs, fruit, and chocolate- not necessarily in that order...
It was also a great place to use as home base for all of the exploration we did of the Big Island."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed Rachel’s forest hale! It was very much off the beaten path, which we loved. The waterfall was beautiful and our kids liked walking the paths and checking out all the toads, fruit trees and geckos. Rachel was kind enough to let us purchase a local breakfast basket last minute with delicious tropical fruit and eggs. The house is a ways from a town so come prepared with your own food for dinner and breakfast, the kitchen has everything you need to make a good meal!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a one of a kind location! The space is clean, has exceptional touches and a generous layout given the size. Rachel and Dan are extremely gracious hosts and suck kind people. My kids loved it and have declared they can’t wait to go back."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The waterfall is wonderful and close enough to hear from the cabin. The cabin is secluded in a tropical forest, but when you emerge, the view is so wonderful! I would definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed my stay! Location was super convenient to exploring Hilo and Volcanoes National Parks. The outdoor bathroom was such a unique and fun highlight, and the entire unit was clean, comfortable and had everything I needed."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice quiet place to stay, is relatively close to food / grocery stores. Will definitely need a car to get around if you're staying out here. The set up outside is great, very relaxing but the roof does leak by the toilet when it rains."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at this little cabin! The outdoor shower made this stay more unique, and everything inside was pristine and exactly as described. We were surrounded by nature, which is a great stay if that’s what you’re looking for. Would stay here again if we’re ever in the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Calming getaway from the city with great food options a short drive away in Hilo and surrounding communities. Ideally located for visitors to the National Park. Toddler loved the space and even saw a frog and a mother hen with baby chicks! Outdoor baths were super peaceful and let you relax with the natural surroundings. Also would like to highlight that Hilo as a whole is wonderful for young families with the Imiloa Astronomy center and botanical gardens on the UH Hilo campus, plenty of playgrounds throughout the city, Japanese gardens, and even a free zoo and rainforest."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the private outdoor bath, everything was exactly as described in the listing. Only thing I would caution is if this is your first time visiting Hawai'i and you're looking to do more touristy things, the location is not ideal for that since that's mainly on the other side of the island. However, if you're looking to stay fairly close to Volcano National Park and a lot of great hikes, than this is a great spot!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of my favorite air bnbs ever! The bathroom outside was one of the most romantic things I’ve EVER done. The rain right next to the rainforest made the trip. The communication was great! Would stay here again if visiting this island!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I couldn’t recommend a more peaceful setting 💖 the other airbnb is family friendly but we didn’t notice until about 0830 the following morning. Remember to bring some bubble bath because you’ll easily spend most of your time in the bath listening to the frogs
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed staying here. It was so relaxing and peaceful. We will definitely be back.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, very serene and in a great location away from the hustle and bustle."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Melissa's and Morgan's place was wonderful. Morgan was a wonderful co-host and very quick to answer any questions. The place is beautiful and exactly as they describe it. I would highly recommend staying in this little tropical oasis.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay here and would stay again in the future. The location was private and not too far from Hilo. The outdoor shower/ tub was amazing.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an awesome space for my husband and I - just what we needed for a few days away from Honolulu. The location was a little away from town but peaceful, easy to find and not too far from the main highway. I loved the outdoor bath and soaking tubs - they were a really nice touch."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa’s place was such a beautiful retreat. Of course the biggest feature was the tub area. It is very clean and in great condition. It was nice to listen to nature while taking a warm bath.
The bed was super comfortable and the place was clean. You’ll definitely need a car to get here but if you are looking for a private get away it’s amazing. I would love to come back here again and spend a few more days."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was really lovely and peaceful :)

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome Airbnb. Close to lots of restaurants in the area. Can access Hilo in about 30 min. We really loved the outdoor bathtubs/ showers that they have. They’re awesome after a full day of hiking. Place is clean and has microwave and a small kitchenette.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a gem! This place has all that is described and the outdoor tubs are such a unique feature. Spotless and well equipped. What a wonderful place! The hosts are very easy to deal with and put lots of extra little touches on the listing - local cookies and the bath bombs to name a few. Do not hesitate to book - you will not be disappointed! So peaceful and perfect.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Melissa's place. She and her co-host were very responsive and helpful. Easy to find and get in, place was clean and exactly as pictured. The outdoor tubs were a great touch. Thanks so much!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa’s place has been a lovely and unique! place to stay; clean and nicely appointed. The location was central for our needs and felt private.
Melissa was responsive and attentive of our requests, and all household needs were in place.
The outdoor shower area was much more than that, making a beautiful extension of the cottage."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The outdoor bath was such a highlight! so nice to take a bath or use the toilet while out in nature during the day and at night, it was magical! My husband and I slept great, loved spending the day in Hilo or other surrounding areas and driving back to this place. There is a mini-fridge inside and a larger fridge/freezer right outside. Microwave, toaster oven, and electric skillet was perfect for our needs. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I stayed here for a few nights while on the big island and loved our time here. Melissa was very accommodating and her place was very clean not to mention the beautiful outdoor baths that were great after a day of exploring the island. Would definitely stay here again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I frequently travel to Hawaii to visit my family. I have had the opportunity to explore all the islands, and I must say that this particular location provided a truly delightful environment for relaxation and tranquility. Should you find yourself in the vicinity of Hilo, I wholeheartedly endorse considering a stay at Melissa's establishment.
With sincere gratitude,
Melissa."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and cozy studio in a tropical environment. 10/10 experience.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This little space was beyond perfect!
It was recently updated and is so, so nice. Clean, comfortable and stocked with all the necessities- not to mention the sweetest little personalized welcome message! The patio baths were warm and very comfortable and the A/C was a blessing. Easy check in and out, pretty garden, and friendly chickens. A 30 minute drive to Hilo, it’s great for a peaceful stay. We would go back in a heartbeat!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was amazing, the outdoor shower and bath were the highlights; the bed and pillows were super comfy and they provided such a perfect space to come home to at the end of the day. Melissa delivered the aloha experience!"

We'll be happy to go back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"cozy place close to downtown, the owner was quick to respond and provided a fan for the bedroom, which was a great deal to make the stay comfortable"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Super great spot for a solo traveler but could also be wonderful for a couple on a shorter getaway. Aesthetically pleasing, well ventilated, awesome shower, great price. A fan of some type that could be set up by the bed would be a nice touch as well as some larger trash cans but these are small quibbles - if you book this place, I would fully expect that you will enjoy your stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really lovely studio in Hilo! We enjoyed the back patio & the location was great for exploring the east side of the island.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Hosts were very informative and accommodating. Condo small but squeaky clean and well furnished. Ninth floor view. They anticipated our every need including quarters for the laundry! Unfortunately, flying termites hatched that night and they were everywhere. Hosts understood and issued a refund with no squabbling. They are super nice."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Big bed and AC! :) Thx from California!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shae's place was perfect for our short visit to Hilo. Location was great in the center of town with a nice view. The bed was extremely comfortable, kitchen was well-stocked, and information guide was extremely helpful. Would highly recommend."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can’t put into words how wonderful Shae was. She provided the best and descriptive recommendations and the condo was incredibly cute and had everything we needed and more. The views were incredible. We would highly recommend to anyone spending time in Hilo. Thanks Shae!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful is the word that covers it all. From location, to amenities, to great communication and overall ease.
This was an absolutely fantastic stay. What a great gem this place is ! And what calm and what a view from the balcony...
Very clean and very well stocked.
The bed was very comfy, and we appreciated all the extra (cafe, chocolate,shampoo, bathrobe, beach chairs, mask...: everything you might need will be there ! Mahalo Shae.
We 100% recommend staying here you will not regret it !"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Shae was very responsive. Her comprehensive book of instructions was much appreciated. The kitchen was very complete. Will definitely consider a return visit. Thanks

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great experience.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place had everything I needed and then some.

Shae was an amazing host and super communicative. I’ll definitely be staying here again when I visit Hilo 🌺"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at this AirBNB. As this was my first time ever using the app, it was an amazing experience. Shae was very responsive whenever I’d message her. Her home was very neat. I especially loved that she included things like toothbrushes, sunscreen, umbrellas, and etc. if needed."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice condo and very responsive host. She attended to every detail to ensure our stay was comfortable.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shae’s condo has been the best AirBNB we have ever stayed at! It was well stocked, extremely clean and well taken care of. The bed was very comfortable. It is in walking distance to a couple of local restaurants, and 5 minutes from pretty much anything in Hilo. Shae has all sorts of extras in case you forgot something. We even used the laundry room while we were there. The building leading up to the condo is older, but don’t let that deter you. The condo is great! I loved the kitchen."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about the place was as described. Stunning views, ultra comfortable bed, dedicated outdoor parking spot, fully equipped kitchen and little extras. The hosts were exceptional, very thoughtful and provided detailed instructions for checking in and out as well as a welcome book. Highly recommend! We'll take wonderful memories of this place with us."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was my boyfriend and my first time staying in Hilo. We enjoyed having some local treats for us when he checked in. Also Shae had left detailed notes throughout the condo for us and it was greatly appreciated. We loved sitting on the lanai looking out over the pond and relaxing. We explored a lot of the big island and Hilo town was by far our favorite for a local Hawaiian feel. I highly recommend taking the time to go to Green Sand beach while you are there! Thanks again Shae!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is small but perfect for two people. Check-in and check-out instructions were easy. The view from both rooms is peaceful and absolutely beautiful. I spent quite a bit of time walking in the park next to the building, enjoying the lake, looking at the birds and taking in the scenery. Shae was always available to answer questions and provide help and recommendations. She very thoughtfully left instructions and tips on how to work appliances, provided wonderful bathrobes, and a list of things to do in and around Hilo. We look forward to returning in the future."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We can’t say enough about Shae’s condo! And about Shae! We found her place to be clean, so comfortable and very quiet. Sitting on the lanai with morning coffee or evening glass of wine was just the best! Beautiful sunrises and virw over the park. Shae responded immediately and was very proactive. When she heard we were planning to grill, she came right over with a brand new grill kit for us. And how often have you been to an Airbnb where they have beach chairs, snorkeling equipment, beach towels, suntan lotion… Everything you need! I’ve never have been at one that’s been this well equipped! Even provided quarters for the laundry. Shae, you and your place are exceptional! Thank you!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic apartment. Great host.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Well organized and appointed!! A kitchen that's better than my own. Bed and bedding that's more luxurious than my own. Fantastic location. All Air BnB hosts need to take a page out of their playbook. Absolutely fantastic!!! Thank you 😊
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Shae was a great host. Very responsive and helpful. Host gave clear instructions. A gorgeous place with every amenity and more. That made us feel the aloha spirit. Very comfy bed! I could have spent weeks here if I had the vacation time. Will be back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Shae went above and beyond to recommend things to do and restaurants in the area. She was very responsive. Condo building is dated but the unit itself is great!!! All the amenities we needed and the bed was super comfy!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"100% would stay here again. Quiet, comfortable, clean & well appointed with lots of thoughtful extras like bathrobes, local snacks, beach chairs, really soft cotton bedding. Loved the small lanais and the view over parks to the beach & panoramic sunrise. Easy walk to old downtown Hilo. Super quiet neighbourhood. Shae was incredibly responsive and pleasant. Why stay in a hotel when you can have a kitchen and such peaceful privacy?"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shae's apartment went above expectations, we only stayed for one night but regret not staying for longer. The view from the balcony was breathtaking, the apartment itself gorgeous, and we felt spoiled with all the care from Shae.<3 The bed was extremely comfortable, and we really appreciate the extra thought she had having reusable and disposable options for take-away to our hikes! The place was easy to find, good parking spot and ok walking distance to the restaurants where she had given great recommendations!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Good location. Beautiful view from the balcony. Place is dated needs an update.
Didn’t care for the town of Hilo, unfriendly people at some of the recommended places. This was our first time here and unfortunately won’t return to Hilo"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved my stay at this centrally located apartment in Hilo! Shae was incredibly accommodating, ensuring a seamless experience from check-in to check-out.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed in many Airbnb places. This is one of the best well equipped kitchen and apartment with very modern amenities. Shea left some welcome goodies for us with lot of very useful information about local restaurants and places to visit. We had a spectacular view of sunrise. Shea is also very accommodative and let us check in early. We will definitely visit her place again. Shea was kind and generous. We highly recommend her place.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only had a chance to stay 1 night at Shea's place, since we had to cut our trip short. The place is very clean and comfortable, with every amenity and detail a person would need. She even left quarters for the laundry machine down the hall. The views from the balconies are lovely, close to everything of interest. I would recommend it and would not hesitate to book it again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location was amazing, host was super responsive when we had a slight snag. The one thing we were worried about was being right in the middle of things and how that would affect sleeping at night. We had absolutely no issues sleeping at night. I would stay here again and again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we would happily recommend this condo
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, well stocked with everything you'd need and next to a beautiful park with walking trails. Local food places in walking distance close by. Small shower but not a deal breaker, overall we had a great stay in Hilo!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay!
The condo is spacious and the view of the sunrise from the balcony is amazing. Everything was well thought out and the kitchen is very well equipped. Loved the ""Forgot anything"" box and everything else that was provided in the closet.
The location is a good base to visit the water falls, the Volcano National Park, and a day trip to explore the north part of the island.
Overall a nice and relaxing stay. The personal touches really made it memorable for us. Shae was an excellent host and touched base with us regularly to see if we needed anything."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed for three nights in Hilo and Shae was a great host. He was always responsive to my messages and made everything easy for me from check-in to check-out. Regarding the apartment, I liked very much the beddings - extremely clean and comfortable, the tile floor - very clean, and the two balconies giving a great view of the park next to the building (hosting several Nene geese - I saw six), and of the ocean. Overall it was a perfect stay and I am looking forward to return there on my next trip to Hilo."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean place, nice view, would go back again"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, apartment was very clean and well stocked with everything we might need. Very clear instructions on how to access and use all the amenities. Appreciate the super soft linens and the beach supplies on hand in the unit. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Shae’s place was beautiful and very clean! Great amenities had everything we needed to enjoy our time in Hilo! Would definitely recommend Shae’s place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place! 9th floor amazing view. Clean, modern, well stocked. Luxury. Bath robes! Ha! Do it! So happy with this place!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the condo. Nice sunrise views, great space with everything we needed, squeaky clean, and clear instructions. We wished we had planned a longer trip so we could explore more of Hilo. We really appreciated the laundry room and the chairs/bag/towels/etc for the beach. Shae had thought of many nice touches. This is a great place to stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful short stay! Great time exploring the local restaurants and shops besides the Hilo Farmers Market. Right out to Wailoa State Park, which the views are spectacular from balcony doors of the condo. Wonderful central secure location to explore. The condo is nicely decorated and loved the beddings for a great nights sleep.
Host communicated well and got back to any questions for my stay. House manual well organized to navigate the workings of the condo and amenities. Definitely recommends!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Shae is a great host. She was very responsive and proactive in sharing recommendations.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shea's condo in Hilo is the perfect place to stay! The view from it is incredibly beautiful. The location is convenient to everything in Hilo. Inside the condo, Shae has decorated nicely and tried to imagine what any guest might want. It was great to have the Nespresso to make a delicious cup of coffee. The pool looks very plain, but it's actually a great pool and a good size. It was fun to watch all the birds and look at the beautiful lagoon and grounds from there. I will always stay here when I'm in Hilo!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shea’s condo is very nice , quite and clean
Beautiful view . Great AC both in bedroom and living room ( love it )
The location is great and very peaceful.
Host was amazing and very responsive
I highly recommend to stay with Shea.
I would stay with her again"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shae's condo is everything I was looking for in an accommodation in Hilo. It is right in the smack of town, many good eateries nearby, close to the airport, Rainbow Falls, beautiful beaches. Onsite security made me felt safe. The condo is large with two balconies, lots of room to spread out. Nice view out to the lagoon & mountain. Gorgeous sunrise was captured. Shae was very responsive & did her very best to make my stay comfortable. From our dialogues, I feel Shae is a very kind, caring person 💕 I go to Hawaii to explore & be with nature so didn't spend much time inside. What's important to me is a nice sleep & I did. What a comfortable bed she had! And she provided Nespresso coffee! 🎉 Never seen that in any Airbnb that I've stayed. I miss my Nespresso coffee when I travel so excited when I saw it. A perfect morning every day! Various snacks, water, fruit drinks, detergent & coins for laundry too! How thoughtful! I was very pleased with my stay. Will book again for sure."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We live on the other side of the island, and are so happy to have found the perfect spot to spend a night or two in Hilo on occasion.
The unit is spotless, with many well-thought out touches.
Mahalo Nui Loa! We’ll be back."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our relaxing 4 nights in Shae’s place. Great location, great views over the park/lagoon and the property is extremely well equipped with everything you’ll need. We particularly appreciated the nespresso machine, the comfortable bed, the balconies & the laundry facilities. Shae was super- responsive throughout & a pleasure to work with. Easy to walk into Hilo, to restaurants, the Botanic Gardens etc. & an easy drive to stunning waterfalls & great hiking. Thanks Shae!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mahalo to our hosts. Would absolutely stay with them again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Couldnt be happier with our stay. Shae was very accomodating and the rental was perfect for our relaxing stay in Hilo. Location was great and very peaceful and quiet after spending long days exploring the island. Would rent again in a heartbeat.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shae was an excellent host. We would highly reccomend this unit. The location is great, quiet and clean facility. Would rent again in the future. The snacks, drinks were appreciated and attention to detail was great."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed this location,it has amazing views of Hilo town and the bay front ,the whole condo is in excellent condition and you can tell pride has been taken to ensure guest have everything the may need ,for a comfortable stay . I will definitely book again and look forward to my next stay ."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shae thank you for a wonderful stay at your place. It was very nice inside and loved the extra things like beach chairs, snorkel equipment and towels. I never had Nepreso (sp?) coffee before but I loved it. I might have to get a machine when I get back home You thought of everything someone might need for a wonderful stay. I highly recommend your place!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The condo is very clean, quiet, and exceptionally well stocked. The grounds and park across the river are lovely and relaxing to look at from the balcony. Shae and Azylynn are very welcoming, friendly, thoughtful, and helpful. They have anticipated and provided everything a guest could want. We enjoyed our stay in Hilo in good part because of this condo and its hosts. They truly are “superhosts”. We highly recommend them and staying in their condo.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place right on the water. She was lovely & honest. Clear directions, clean home and comfy space."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We liked the vibe of that former hotel. It feels a little like a lost place from another time, but once your in the apartment you'll enjoy the AC, the amazing view from the two little balconies and the most comfortable king size bed. Shae equipped the apartment with Alexa, Smart TV and Nespresso machine and everything you might need..."
2024-06-01,2,Stayed one night,"The host is friendly. However, it doesn't fit with the marked parking location. It's hard to find the back door parking, so I wandered for over 10 minutes. Hot water came out, but there is no air conditioner, so it is humid and the bathtub drain water does not drain, so it looks like it needs repair.
I saw small bugs, and the bedding smelled humid. The location from Hilo to the airport can be reached within 10 minutes, but it's perfect. It's a one-day stay.
There is no elevator, so it's difficult for heavy luggage.
If you want to stay near the airport, this is it. But a long stay is a reflection. The thing to remember is that the host is very friendly:)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is exactly as described. We did a laundry. Heads up: You'll need your phone as you have to load an app to access your credit card, but do that on the WiFi in your room as it wouldn't load in the laundry area. It's a basic room with all you'll need. Feels safe. just a short walk to Ola Brewery with good food and beer. Host was very helpful and quick to respond."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, clean condo within a few minutes of anything you’d want to do in Hilo. Second time hosted by Ki and would definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a beautiful and quiet condo, location was convenient and everything we needed was close by!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a pleasant stay in a very clean room that was well cleaned.The explanation in advance was also kind and very detailed, so there was nothing to worry about.However, I was a little confused about getting to the nearest parking lot."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ki’s studio apartment was sufficient for my purpose. It’s a bit more rundown than the photos demonstrate, but the bathroom was clean. He had fans available, which helped because it rained a lot and was humid. The on-site housekeeper helped me get into the laundry room and was very kind. Finding building #5 was a challenge (its down the ramp from building #7), but once I figured it out, I moved my car around to the back parking lot (off of Hualani St.) because it was closer. The laundry worked well (just download an app and add money) but the pool looked kinda gross."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Rental was close to walking distance to dining and Big Island Candies. Loved the proximity to the airport and the beautiful serene grounds. I wish we had a couple more days in Hilo. O
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Was very clean. The instructions were super detailed and useful. Walking distance to some local places. Would definitely stay here again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,very cool place.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and transaction
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best stay of our trip! Ki’s place was the perfect mix of location, comfort, and outdoors. The balcony and nature walk nearby was lovely, but once you closed the door it was so quiet and easy to sleep. Wish I could go back and stay here longer!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely location, off the beaten path. The history of the property is amazing."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great spot in town. not fancy. you get way you pay for. was perfect for what we were looking for. cheap, clean and easy"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved this little place! Was perfectly located and exactly what we needed for the one night ! Only thing I wish I HAD noted was that there was no AC. Otherwise it was perfect!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was very pleasant and we felt right at home. The apartment was very clean and had lots of utensils in the kitchen, which we liked a lot! It looked just like on the photos. The area is beautiful and quiet and we had no trouble at all getting anywhere. The infos about the area (fuel stations, grocery shopping, etc.) provided by Ki we’re very helpful."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"A simple, clean, convenient location in Hilo with plenty of secure parking. I will definitely consider booking this unit again when I'm on the Hilo side again for work."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ki was extremely friendly and accommodating with the booking.
Location was great, walking distance from downtown and lots of restaurants.
Pictures were very accurate.
Beautiful lanai with the pond to see and some wildlife to watch.
Extremely close walking distance to the local park with great walking paths and beauty.
High recommend"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Place looked like the photos. Hilo in general is old and a kind of run down. The pool was closed the days we stayed due to the water needing to be treated which was a bummer since there aren’t really beach areas around.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Would come back again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our short stay at Ki's place. It was great to have laundry access close by.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ki is an excellent host and the stay was wonderful. It’s a great place in a great location! The bed is very comfortable and it’s a cozy studio. Love the lanai for morning breakfast 😊 Will book again!
2024-01-01,3,Stayed one night,"We stayed for one night. The unit was old but clean. We noticed that the drainage in the bath tub was bad. Also the bedding was smelled like strong perfume, so I had to cover my pillow with the bath towel not to smell the smell.. it was still game me a hard time to sleep. But overall, this place is located at the convenient area and the price is not too bad."
2024-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,This place is good and was not very expensive but it does need a lot of work- a good deep clean and fixing the bathroom would help; dishes were also not very clean. Location is good though- walkable to a lot in Hilo.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I happen to be a former resident of Hilo and have experience not only living there but also staying short term in various AirBnB properties there. This Christmas was my first time to use Ki's condo in Building 5, and it was pretty fantastic. Since I know the town as a former resident, I can say that so many spots I love for food, beach parks, a riverside grassy lawn, and shopping & errands were accessible by an easy walk or just beyond easy walking distance. Not to mention the fact that I was running late for my flight out of Hilo, but the condo erased the problem of my failure to plan well by being so close to the airport. Fabulous location.
*Word to the wise: take advantage of the photos Ki included for finding the exact location of the condo once you arrived in the complex. Those photos provide good details, without which you will struggle.
Ki was responsive, friendly, helpful, considerate, and easy to work with.
Thanks for everything, Ki - I'll definitely be back."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in Hilo! Easy to get around to all the highlights of the area
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I saw three owls by the lake around sunset time. It was magical. I also love all the ducks if you like birds definitely stay here and walk around the neighborhood by the lake. Hopefully it’s not raining!
2023-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Shower backed up a decent amount, overall place was clean. Simple accommodations but worked for a one night stay"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A sweet small studio has basic everything you need. Central location, easy check in and parking. ki is very responsive and kindness that allows us early check in."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great amenities and right in the middle of town. It did smell a little musty, but most places in Hilo are with the amount of rain the area gets."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ki is very good with responsiveness and helpful. His unit is as described and pictured on the site.
We had a pleasant couple of days in Ki’s place."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Really good AirBnB !
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved my stay, apt was just described and very clean. I had no problems getting in, Ki was very responsive.
And I was so happy there was good coffee avail to use in the morning and some microwave popcorn for the evening."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ki's apartment in the apartment complex was all we needed while visiting Hilo.
Great location, enjoyable pond below, free parking, ...
The kitchen was bit dusty and missing more basic cookware. We were also missing any kind of storage shelves for our clothe.
Overall we had a joyful stay. Thank you Ki."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Lovely calm place in a great location
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean & simple condo in a very peaceful complex. There’s running water and trees right outside the balcony which makes a really serene vibe in the middle of Hilo. Definitely would stay here again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is very centrally located in Hilo and you can easily reach everything. The apartment corresponds to the pictures.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great experience! I would definitely stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I felt very relaxed.
However, the laundry system didn't work, but we'll use a resident's card.
That worked"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Play sus, perfect clean the fans could’ve worked a little bit better but besides that everything was great but definitely rent again"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very pleasant small stay in this quiet and soothing residence
The studio is functional and everything went well"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Convenient and reasonably priced. Nice to have a place that I didn't need to share because I had to get up very early.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you. We had a good stay. Host is very friendly!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at Ki’s place! Location is very convenient.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ki’s place was beautiful place to chill out after busy day of activities. Peaceful and enjoyable.
2023-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Good value for money but furniture is basic and very very old. The whole appartment would need upgrade including bathroom. If you are light sleeper, bring ear plugs because walls and ceiling are very thin and you will hear neighbors walking in the appartment above - also during the night."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy check in/check in process. Great location to Hilo town. Complex felt safe and in a chill area. Spacious studio. Would recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place matched the description, very close to all the tourist spots in Hilo. I will recommend this place."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ki's place is in a great location. Very close to the airport and walking distance to a lot of different spots I needed to get to. Great communication as well.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good stay! Thanks
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a bit on the older side but for the price, it was perfect for the two of us. We just used it for a place to sleep. It’s plenty spacious for a “studio.” No central A/C so it can get hot but they have several fans. It’s not super walkable to things but if you have a car, plenty of parking. Beach towels were provided."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was centrally located to everything in Hilo! Got to cook in the kitchen and enjoyed our time hanging out on the balcony.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Excellent location, literally blocks from airport. Good size for a studio. Owner very responsive to my questions. Good value."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The appartement is located close to the airport (10mn) which is very convenient. However it is badly soundproofed so we easily hear the neighbours above walking. While we were there (2 days) the pool was unfortunately not opened. Apart from that, it does the job and is spacious."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I wish I could rent the place permanently!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Listing as advertised
Unfortunately non-functional pool during our stay"
2023-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"I stayed in the studio for one night since it was right next to the airport. Don't expect much if you book here, but it gets the job done. Really good location for exploring Hilo."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in Hilo. Quiet area, close to everything in town. Very relaxing. First time with an Airbnb rental for me, but check-in/check out was incredibly easy. Would definitely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice condo in a good location. Perfect for my stay visiting friends. Mahalo
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place for exploring Hilo even without a car , Coconut Island is nearby and a wonderful park to relax is only a few minutes away. I can recommend the place and felt save and welcomed 🌈"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying at Ki’s studio. It’s an older building but still very comfortable, and the surroundings are very peaceful. You can watch the koi in the ponds right below the lanai, which make for a lovely therapeutic setting.
I would suggest this studio to any of my friends. The price and location, peace and beauty of the area are all very much worth the price. Ki is very warm and friendly. You can hear and see how much he cares for your comfort and enjoyment listening to his voice and actions.
The bed is very comfortable but the futon couch…..for an adult is not too comfortable but for smaller little ones….it would be fine.
As for no a/c…..not a problem. A floor fan and ceiling fan with the security door locked and main door open for ventilation, make it more than comfortable for sleeping.
I hope this has been helpful…..Aloha"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cheap accommodation in a good central location, not far from the airport and the city centre. You can walk to the center in about 30 minutes through a beautiful park. In the evening you could relax and talk on the balcony with a pleasant view. We have not regretted the booking!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ki is a very responsive host and the airbnb was very clean and close to most places. Would stay again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay that is extremely close to town and the airport making it easily accessible and easy to get around. Ki's communication was also fast and clear and gave easy to follow directions of where we can park and how to check in to the unit as well how to use the other facilities available on the property. I'd stay here again when visiting Hilo!
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice space close to everything .
Only down fall is no AC."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay , would stay again"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"As an overnight stay Ki’s apartment was perfectly acceptable. Well equipped, Clean. Quiet building and area. Easy parking."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Space is very cozy and a very comfortable distance from anything you could need, being directly in Hilo. I’ve stayed much further and this was a nice change to have everything I wanted to do within 10 minutes of the room. Parking is plentiful as well. I’d say more stalls than rooms, which is ideal. I didn’t need much and didn’t message Ki much, but he was extremely responsive (within a minute or two) to each and every message I did send. I really do appreciate that."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great! Will definitely stay here again.
2023-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"It was a good place for the price, but I stayed for 2 nights, but the towels were not changed"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an awsome opportunity and enviorment for me and my wife, we both loved watching the koi fish, along with a nest full of duck eggs."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy place, nice location in Hilo! Close to farmer’s market, good starting point for the day"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location for what we were in Hilo for. Price was great, no complaints other that the bed was basic but fir the price and location I would definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Really liked it. Especially the pond in the back.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ki's place is a studio in Waiakea Villas, beautiful place close to Waiakea pond, through which you can cross bridges and walk to beach front or Hilo downtown. Ki is very responsive and provided detailed instructions and location of the building #5. We have no issue during self check in. We stayed there 6 nights and felt It's a perfect location for all tourist attractions, shopping, farmer's market and all kind of restaurant choices. Room is clean with all supplies you need, it's truly like a hotel experience. Recommended to everyone who plan to stay in Hilo for a few nights."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ki’s place is an affordable place to stay in Hilo, he was responsive with our requests which made our stay stress free. The studio however is quite old but does have everything needed for a comfortable time.
Also special thanks to the housekeeper Spring who lived only a few doors down, she was very helpful and welcomed us like family. She even lent us long sleeve clothes after finding out that we were going to the Moana Kea Summit as we did not pack for such cold temperature.
I would recommend Ki’s place to anyone who is looking to come to Hilo!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good location as value for the base of Hilo. Ki is very responsive and helpful.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,The place was perfect. We needed a place in Hilo so we would be close to family.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay while in Hilo rather it be for a short amount of time or long. Located in a central part of town. You are able to walk or drive to shops, restaurants or the farmers market! Will definitely use Ki again here in town. Can’t thank him enough for the hospitality!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ki’s place was perfect for our last minute stay! The place was clean and stocked with plenty of towels, blankets, and kitchen utensils. We LOVED the balcony and took advantage of having access to the pool and laundry. I definitely recommend Ki’s place!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I was embarrassed because I was stabbed as soon as I entered the accommodation. I contacted the host to get extra cleaning and fans, so it got a little better. But it's not recommended for people who are sensitive to smells. The pool is closed early every day, so it has never been used. Overall condo location and size is easy to use"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ki was wonderful, very responsive and kind. The unit was clean but outdated, which I didnt mind given the price. I liked how the laundry area was set up, it was clean and easy to use. My only one negative thing was the noisy neighbors at all hours and occasionally smelling cigarette smoke but overall this place was a good value."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was in a convenient place. It was modest, basic and simple just as advertised. A lovely feature is the close proximity to Waiakea Pond which is a gem to walk through on the way into town. We also enjoyed sitting out on the lanai at night, listening to the frogs."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ki's place was great .. had everything we needed and then some !
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Easier to get to from the back side street. GPS kept directing us the top parking lot. Lots of parking in back. Looked like a new bathroom vanity, bed was comfortable enough. Glad they had an electric kettle that worked great, big fridge and freezer worked fine.Stocked with lots of clorox disinfecting wipes and trash bags. For the cost in Hilo worked fine for us since we basically only used the unit to shower and sleep."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"She was great. I had trouble with airline. So I was very tired when I got there. She was so helpful
Place was great. Right by Airport
Easy in and out. I really like it and Location."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Had a nice 5 night stay. It was a little hard to find the correct apartment building and park at the back lot closer to accessing the unit. GPS app took me to the front parking area which does not go through to the back parking area and had to drive all the way around the neighborhood until I found the driveway to the back parking lot. I also had a little problem locating the keys and finding the light switch inside the unit but called Ki who replied immediately to help. The housekeeper Spring then came by and was so nice to bring me extra little things to make my stay comfortable. Starbucks ground coffee and coffee maker provided which was a nice touch. Location close to restaurants and shops.
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Ki's place was clean, easy to find, and just as described. Ki is very responsive and communicates. It is walking distance to downtown Hilo. The lanai view is really beautiful, we watched the ducks and the koi swimming right below the Lanai. There is a park close by that is a great place to go for a walk. It is great for the price. Could hear upstairs foot steps but was overall quiet and peaceful. Would recommend, would stay again."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"This place was clean but plain. It took us a bit to find building 5. The key situation was a little tricky. We did have everything we needed, including a comfy bed."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is super clean place to stay.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ki’s listing was just as described and pictured. It was spotless when we arrived. Our only issue was the shower took awhile to heat up but Ki informed us of some tricks to speed up the process.
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very close to downtown and within walking distance of resturants."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place and location. I always look forward to staying in one of the condos at this location. perfect location to see lots of local sites and enjoy great restaurants. Extremely quiet. A huge perk is the on-site laundry facilities.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Ki is awesome
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ki's place is very conveniently located. It was perfect for a weekend tennis tournament in Hilo. Would definitely stay there again.
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We had a really nice time staying here. Great location and the place was just as advertised!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a little hard to find the building. Instructions could have added to park in the back lot near the yellow fire hydrant, walk down the path and cross the creek, Building 5 is behind Building 7.
Convenient location. Apartment was spotless. Great wifi."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay in Hilo. Nice location and beautiful water feature outside the balcony!
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The best part of this place was the lanai overlooking a little pond in the complex. It is only a short drive to downtown and many restaurants. We like others had an issue with bugs in the place. Ki was really responsive and sent his house manager, Spring. She was incredibly sweet and offered to spray and clean the house right away. If you have any concerns please don’t hesitate to reach out to Ki or Spring. They are really kind people."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice , Clean place. Location is good."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The condo was exactly as described, no surprises which is appreciated after a long day of delays. We stayed for one night only and only saw the place at night so no other comments from us."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Studio apartment in a convenient location. Suited our needs well for a quick night in Hilo.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice location
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,thank you
2022-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Nice and cozy place. Had everything that is needed at a bnb. Would have loved to give 5 stars but for the issue we had with roaches.
Host was also very responsive."
2022-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Ki was great to communicate with, very responsive. The instructions to get to and into the apartment were fine. But, I did find the neighborhood a little concerning. Many of the apartments had security screen doors. For those that did not, I noticed some splintering of the door jams around the locks which made me concerned about break-ins. The interior of the apartment was dated, but generally clean. There was a pair of underwear (or swim trunks, I did not pick them up to look) left on top of the refrigerator. The inside of the refrigerator could have used a cleaning, so I kept anything I stored in there in their paper bags. I noticed the can of Raid under the bathroom sink and I was concerned about bugs-- but I did not see any. The TV was unplugged and the cord did not reach any of the outlets, which was ok because the wi-fi worked fine. I did not notice the extension cord in one of the drawers until I was packing up to leave. Overall, ok but I would not stay again."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,It was convenient and a great price
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,as advertised
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The walkability of the location was just what we wanted in Hilo. The Koi and ducks as seen from the little lanai were fun to watch. Beautiful walks to down town across the bridges over Waiakea pond. Two breweries close by also. Not fancy but OK, for the price this is a good place."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Ki's place was just as excellent as it had been last time: Spacious, clean, quiet and safe. Ki responded to my messages quickly, and the housekeeper's care was also wonderful. I will check the availability if there is another chance to visit Hilo."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This condo is in a beautiful complex and a great location. Close to airport and within walking distance to a beautiful park and restaurants. A nice view from the lanai over the Koi filled pond.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Recommend
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient, clean, everything I needed was available. Bonus to see the nene and their babies and the fish everyday."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ki was communicative and accommodating with my requests. The location was very nice and clean. The coffee provided is also very tasty.
2022-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in Hilo, slightly aging development, but did the job."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place has everything! Its kitchen is well equipped. It looks exactly like its photos on the Airbnb App. Its location is near major shopping stores, and most importantly, it's right next to the airport. It is truly wonderful and peaceful. Money well spent!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,A pleasant overnight stay at Ki’s place. Some shops nearby and conveniently located near the airport!
2022-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We had bugs in our room, advised the host and her cleaning lady came in, knew exactly where the bugs where and already had a poison that would kill them… Feels like it’s not the first time that this is happening and that a professional exterminator should be called. The pool was green and not clear, not like in the photo. The upstairs neighbor is noisy (moving furniture until 1 am and start back at 6 am) so make sure to bring ear plug if you want to sleep well.
Otherwise, everything is as described."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Another great stay at Kai’s place in Hilo. Highly recommended!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly as described. Convenient location. Lovely place. Nice to have laundry facilities too. Would return in a heartbeat.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location for arriving late from the mainland. Minutes from the airport and close to downtown Hilo. Nothing fancy but clean and quiet!
2022-08-01,3,Stayed one night,Nice and quiet.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location & price. Super convenient & very close to a lot of things including the airport. Communication was quick & informative. Didn’t know how to use the AC but there were a lot of fans available. Warm in the house so would be good during the colder weather/season. Overall, I would definitely stay there again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect clean and comfy
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a great spot to chill out after long days of adventuring! The location was amazing. I lived in the East side for a couple years and it brought back many good memories. Well within our budget and a true Hilo experience with the open air sliding doors. This place is great if you’re adventuring on a budget. It was everything you need.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Ki has great communication and answers fast. Great location!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what we needed at the right price.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I just stayed for one night and I arrived at 9pm (left at 8am). For this purpose it was perfectly located.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location is perfect. Right in the heart of Hilo. Near Ola Brew. Place is very clean and has a full refrigerator and a full kitchen. Has everything you need to enjoy your stay. The price is also the cheapest in town. Parking wasn’t a problem, self check in, swimming pool, and quarter laundry mat on site. Ki also replied quickly and is available and easily accessible."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I really loved it. My only complaint would have been the woman working on her motorcylce nearly every day. It doesn't have a muffler and she revved it loudly really often, and people kept yelling from the windows for her to stop. Maybe it has stopped by now, lol. But that was a small problem, compared to how enjoyable the the place was. That stream with all the fish and ducks was so nice!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Sweet little room but rather small for three people. Minimal kitchen equipment was available. Free parking closeby and located close to town and shops. There is no air conditioner, a fan is available but it might get warm during the night."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything you need perfect location I will definitely stay again thank you so much many Mahalo’s
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Easy check in. Full kitchen and lani. Koi fish swimming below. Close to parks and downtown. Great price.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great private location well equipped and the bed was super comfortable. Great price and near the new brewery which you can walk to in 5 mins if you cut through the other parking lot! I’d stay again for sure.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"We had a hard time finding the correct parking lot to get to building 5 but once we got there, everything was good. Everyone we met was very nice and it was helpful to have labels on the lights.
It was quite warm at night as we didn't feel safe sleeping with the doors open and just the screen. As others said, it is quite dated and a little rough looking when you pull up.
Location was great though! Just a block to Hawaiian Style Cafe and a few minutes drive to the Bayfront. Definitely worth it for the location if you're going to mostly be there to sleep and keep your stuff while you're out and about."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great and affordable place to rest. Only had the basics, but we didn’t need much for a one night stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, simple condo in Hilo"
2022-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Ok stay. Convenient location. Would give five stars though the HOT Water weren’t working for our short stay of 2 1/2 days
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Pleasant stay in a dated apartment but equipped with everything you need. Beautiful view of the stream with fish and ducks. Good value for money.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Good
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A large quiet studio in a secure and quiet complex was reassuring and the view of the lagoon with fish and threatened protected native geese was really tranquil. Will return if available when I return to Hilo.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location !
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Was able to book us super last minute after a flight cancellation. Thank you!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great room for 2 or 3 people very clean, easy check in, and close to town. Would highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Host is very friendly, the studio is nice and clean with a breezy balcony, after a whole day activities, having a cold beer on it, overlooking a lovely pond with flowers, bamboos and ducks, birds, fell so relaxing, definitely recommend this place!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and clean. Beautiful surroundings. The lanai and pool helped to make the stay even more enjoyable.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little spot to crash for the night, easy check in process and good location to get to everything"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice little place to stay for a couple nights. From the balcony watch the koi fish swim and duck waddle. Gets hot during the day, but fans are provided for air circulation."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Was great thank you
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for a night. Ki is a great host.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice getaway
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"very well-equipped apartment, quiet quiet, close to amenities.
Ki is a very considerate host.
Small plus: have breakfast on the terrace with the relaxing water point."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Good location and great for kiddos because of the pond filled with fish and ducks to watch.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"Good if you want to just spend a couple nights. Interior is a little dated. Overall, an okay place to stay."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice stay in Kis apartment. The bathroom is excellent, seems to be renovated. The kitchen is a bit outdated and would need also renovation, therefore 4 Stars only."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient and easy access.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place with a great view and water stream was relaxing. Would definitely stay there again.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Accurate description of the spot. Open, spacious. It was a short stay so I didn’t explore the area."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"I didn’t realize there wasn’t any AC but the box fans helped. The bed definitely isn’t the comfiest but if you’re coming to Hilo to explore and just need a place to wind down and sleep, then this is the spot for you at the right price! Ki was great w/ communication."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Okay place to just stay at.
2022-04-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great for location. Very close to the areas i wanted to explore. Easy check in and good amount of parking spaces. When i arrived, there were a trail of ants on the floor and on the bathroom sink. We realized it too late and it was all over our belongings. I told Ki when i found out and he let his housekeeper know to clean with bleach (never told him location of the ants so wonder if this was a previous issue.) Told me the housekeeper cleaned it up, but the next day i woke up with bites all over my legs and arms. It made me think if the place was truly clean or not. Ki did have great communication and i appreciated his fast response, but i was ready to leave."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed one night,The place was the same as the pictures
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ki gave us very detailed information before arriving making the check-in process very easy. He was easily available and provided us with his housekeeper's contact. The apartment was what we expected from the photos, and as some other reviews said we could hear the people in the apartment above. Location is fantastic, very central, and lots of parking is easily available. We really enjoyed watching the ducks and fish from the balcony while drinking coffee in the morning."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ki is a wonderful host , very accommodated. and. great communication , fast to respond.
Flexible check out
The place is nice and in a good location ."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Expect a good stay
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This unit is a great location for Hilo Waterfalls, and Volcanos National Park. Owner responds quickly and the housekeeper is on the same floor and is very helpful. We arrived late due to flight schedules, and she offered us fruit and water which was very kind of herl. The Lanai ( Balcony) faces a nice garden with Koi fish and you can have breakfast watching the birds land in the water. The unit is not fancy but clean and comfortable. Bathroom is clean and shower is nice and hot!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very good
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A place for rest but not located in the center. The pond is very cute. Very well equipped but no detergent and there’s no detergent sold in the laundry room, you have to buy one at the supermarket 6 min walk away. Also the money you paid for the laundry service( an app called wash) is not refundable so you charge more than you need. The sound from upstairs neighbors is sometimes loud."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t be fooled by the gruff exterior of the complex, this is a friendly clean and comfortable condo experience. The balcony overlooks a pond that is hopping with wildlife 24/7 (noisy in a beautiful way if you sleep with the door open!) comfortable bed, futon isn’t as comfortable but great for a kiddo or smaller person I’d say. Stocked adequately but not overstocked. Great water pressure in the shower, though noisy when it’s running. (Not an issue for us, we know it’s an older building). The pool was chilly! Great for the hot day we had. We would definitely stay here again, the neighbors are amazing. We even hung out with some of them two of our nights there and exchanged information. So friendly."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved the ponds all around the complex; it kept my daughter busy seeing the fish and ducks, all amenities are provided to cook!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super cute studio, well equipped (no a/c but plenty of fans). My kid loved the koi pond outside the lanai. Great location, close to plenty of stuff. Ki is a great host, it was smooth and easy."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an excellent location and Ki was a great host. He let us check in early, which was really helpful. Overall enjoyed our stay and the apartment had everything we needed. There is no AC (as described in the listing), so it was a bit hot at night but otherwise was a good stay. Loved sitting outside on the balcony - great start & end to the day."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a very cute neighborhood.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location. Ducks in the pond had a lovely vocal morning, but I still slept well in the comfy bed. Woke up with a nice swim in the pool. Everything was great. Would live there in a heartbeat."
2022-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Overall a nice place in a convenient location.
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you go to the side road of the accommodation, the pond comes out right away and it was so good to go for a walk. The room is the same as what you see in the photo. You can hear a lot of sounds around in the morning."
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Location was great. Very close to local restaurants and sites. It’s a nice place to stay and sleep after a full day of adventuring.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice budget place in Hilo. apartment had everything we needed for a short stay.
2022-02-01,4,Stayed one night,Amazing location!! would stay there again.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ki has a lovely study and is very accommodating! Plus, Spring is an absolute doll! I highly recommend this place for anyone wanting a comfortable place to stay, right in the heart of Hilo. Mahalo!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ki's place was clean, at a convenient location, and met our needs. It was near the airport, which was a plus."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The apartment is very conveniently located within a handful of walkable destinations (food, drink, water/beach). We have a great time."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Both KI and Spring are wonderful hosts. All restaurants are nearby and very close to Volcano island. I will stay here again.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This studio is a great place to stay in Hilo. It was nice and clean with full kitchen amenities as well!
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,good location!!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was as expected here. Great location and easy access. Beautiful morning view from the balcony. Thank you Ki!
2022-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,The place is close to town and was at a good price point for us. The biggest downside for us which wasn't the hosts fault was the upstairs neighbors. Our first night they were up moving furniture and being loud from 2am until 5am. we assumed at the time they were packing up for an early flight. Then the 3rd night they woke us again at 3am. The place is basic and that's fine we just needed somewhere to sleep after long beach/adventure days. unfortunately for us that didn't work out the best. At no fault of Ki's! it's an apartment complex so we understand.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Ki’s place is in a perfect spot! We were on foot majority of our long stay and everyday we walked and explored someplace new. Great restaurants- Hilo burger joint, just cruisin, pineapples, and pretty much any spot downtown is excellent. The market is good price compared to the KTA for local fruit & veggies. The studio is basic but has everything you need. And if you need something Ki’s caretaker Spring will get it quick. She brought us yoga mats, umbrella, rain jackets, and lots of food! The apartments around the unit can be loud but the fan drowns out the noise. Place stayed cool with the fans and lanai door open. Pool is nice and warm also laundry on site. Ki is an absolutely amazing host and when we could extend our stay he offered us another unit for a great deal. Definitely will stay here again 🥰"
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,very basic accommodations. clean and convenient. bed is good foam. no frills. good value.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was clean, easy to access, lots of parking space, great location, and easy to communicate with Ki."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,just as expected super simple
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice condo central to town. Great wifi and Ki was fast to respond to any questions I had. Highly recommend.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay 🤙
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay while in Hilo. No ac though
2021-11-01,2,Stayed one night,"My error for not catching that there was neither A/C nor TV. Very hot (and humid) without A/C. Fans helpful but of limited benefit and no cross-ventilation.
Directions to parking area would also be helpful as we were quite confused.
No coffee.
Bed okay.
Shower pressure awesome!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This unit is well located between the downtown area and the shopping district on route 11. At one time it may have been a motel room but was converted to a condo with a large refrigerator and a complete kitchen. It's adjacent to the park with the famous bridges near the waterfront. Very utilitarian and should suit your needs just fine. Kitchen wonderful and we found the bed firm and comfortable, unlike many. Slept great. Ki will advise you to use the back parking lot off Hualani which makes it a very short carry for your things. Swimming pool not too inviting(!) but we loved watching the koi pond and the setting is restful and everybody around there was friendly.
Laundry: download the app ""Wash Sense"" if you anticipate using the w/d. $2/load. You add $ to your account ($10 minimum) from a credit card and use bluetooth to select your machine and away you go. It's very intuitive and very cool. I'd never used my phone to do my laundry before! You don't have to mess with coins or anything.
Really enjoyed it; no complications and Ki was great and responsive."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"The unit is in what I would call a middle of the road apartment complex. The unit is older and worn but was clean and functional. The hosts were great and the place was clean. It’s just not the nicest building. Pool was green so we weren’t comfortable checking it out further. Given the options and costs of other units it was fairly priced and a decent value. I would have preferred slightly nicer furniture and it is in need of a good quality paint job in the unit. Was a bit noisy up until dinner time and then the entire property quieted down for the evening. Good, simple, clean accommodations but not on par with some others we have stayed at and not “hotel” quality. A good paint job and quality furniture would make this place excellent."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved the place, it was very peaceful"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sweet Hawaiian get away! Had everything I needed to enjoy peaceful rest and relaxation during my stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mahalo, Ryan and Gina for a safe, clean, and peaceful stay. I appreciate all of your thoughtfulness during my stay. Your rental offers a lovely home-base sanctuary, with easy access to all aspects of the Puna/Hilo/volcano areas. See u next time!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Truly a great place to stay. My husband and I felt right at home. Location is perfect...close to Pahoa and Downtown Hilo. Definitely recommend Ryan and Gina's place.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan and Gina's studio is so charming! Very clean, easy to find, very peaceful, great location. The hosts were very responsive and gave us a great list of recommendations of things to do and places to eat. We really enjoyed our time here!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ryan's place was as described. It was very clean and a good location for going between VNP and Hilo. Ryan was responsive and made sure we had a great stay. The bed was a little too firm for me but my partner didn't mind it. Thank you Ryan!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan’s place is in a great location. I loved how central it was to Hilo, volcano National park, and Pahoa. The kitchen and appliances were helpful during my stay. I didn’t get a chance to use the pool since I spent most of my time at the beaches in Hilo. Overall a good place to stay especially if you will be out and about!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect place to stay while in Hawaii! This place had everything we needed and more! We especially appreciated the pack and play crib, it was even all set up for us upon our arrival! The host does an excellent job with communication. We enjoyed our stay and I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was exactly as described. Perfect spot. Had everything we needed. My husband lived the firm mattress. Ryan also provided a wonderful list of recommendations to do on the island from hiking, snorkeling, and places to eat. They did not disappoint."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Your perfect Hilo getaway! Nice place in midst of lush, green surroundings, very tasteful interieur, perfectly clean and neat. Kitchen was very well equipped, we didn‘t miss a thing. You can cool down in the pool on hot summer days, it was a shame we couldn’t use it due to the weather. 10/10 recommend!!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and host was responsive and had great local recommendations. A little smaller than I expected and as listed about 20 minutes from Hilo, but very well located to other locations. Beautiful area and tons of birds."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We like airbnb rather than a hotel- less noise, confusion. Ryan’s place is accommodating, very clean and tastefully decorated. Super host!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoy the accommodation and quick access to the main road. The space was exactly as expected. The host are friendly and very responsive. Great place to stay while being on this side of the island.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan and Gina are great hosts, they gave us very good tips and recommandations during our stay. The room is nicely decorated and fully equipped !! We definitely recommend this airbnb :)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan's place was perfect! Close to Volcano National Park, waterfalls and beaches! We had a very last minute booking and Ryan was great to accommodate our needs. His wife, Gina, was so kind and made sure we settled in. They also brought in a comfy single bed for our third guest. Water and snacks were a welcomed surprise. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,The place was very nice and we felt very much at home. She had good amenities and communication with Ryan went wonderfully.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for 5 nights and the place was very clean and new. Nicely decorated as well. It’s pretty much the size of a hotel room with a large bed and small kitchenette that served us well for our stay. There is a main house and the 2 private detached suites are farther up the property. 15 mins away from Hilo, definitely need a car (which we had). Overall a great clean place to stay and would definitely stay here again! Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at this place. Friendly owners, everything you need in the cottage, super clean, and easy access to a lot of beautiful hikes and great places to visit like Volcano and many waterfalls. Also some good restaurants nearby."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and clean. I didn’t end up using the pool because I spent most of the time at the beach. But the BnB had everything I needed at the end of the day. Good internet for when I needed to work. Plenty of fans to keep cool. Clean kitchen to cook breakfast. Comfy bed to sleep.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ryan and Gina were excellent. Their place is very quiet and peaceful. Great for visiting friends and family in the Hilo area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! Super cute and cozy. Had everything my partner and I needed for our 5 day stay. Would highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place!
All comforts!
Very nice pool to make a splash at the end of the day or at the beginning of the day before taking your walk.
Great location. Very
responsive hosts, kind."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ryan provided great recommendations for this side of the island! Great Airbnb experience and the sounds of the island put you right to sleep at night!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was a great place to stay, Ryan was always very responsive and ready to help with any questions or concerns. It's easy to tell that they are committed to providing a great place for people to stay, would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts were very welcoming, very responsive, and accommodating. The studio was cozy and everything we needed in a place to stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Well decorated. Close to volcano and Hilo being right in between. Host was proactive with messaging and friendly. Only qualm is place is listed as whole home but is a studio apartment. Can tell this from the photos however
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Let me say the place was well stocked, clean and in a great location for people exploring this side of Hawaii. We did however have two issues, check in was a little confusing as there are now two cabins. We didn't know which was ours so we tried both. Also, the pool we thought was private didn't realize till we got there that it was shared. Other then those two things everything else was great. Nice touch on the welcome gift on table.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Was exactly what I was looking for in a place:)
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing hosts! Clean and nice place to stay. The nature and beautiful surroundings is out of this world!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and enjoyable stay. I stayed in February, so no AC wasn't an issue. Equal distance between Hilo and beaches on the south eastern coast. I had a rental vehicle so driving was easy. The space was nicely appointed and everything worked as expected."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a baby during our travels and the hosts were very accommodating. There's a beautiful pool and bar space... Too bad we had rain during our stay, it looked beautiful.
All in all, great hosts everything was as described. They definitely go above and beyond"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! We came to visit Hawaii for our anniversary, and Ryan and Gina's place was perfect - private, quiet, peaceful, and romantic. There were a few great restaurants and views minutes away, Hilo was only 20 minutes away, and Volcanoes NP was a quick 30 minute drive. The house was the perfect launching spot and home base. The place was the perfect size for a couple, and we were able to use the kitchen to make breakfast and lunch. Ryan and Gina were super nice and friendly, and answered all our questions very quickly. Ryan also gave awesome recommendations on things to do all around the island. We loved our stay here and would love to come back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing tucked away spot. Far enough away that we drove to the Hilo town center, but we loved the privacy and you can’t even tell theirs neighbors. We loved the pool, although it wasn’t heated, the area was dope and we enjoyed the ambience of it! Even the little walk to the pool was super rad and felt like we were definitely in a jungle. Not only was the Airbnb beautifully clean and perfect for our group of three, the host had great response time and was super super accommodating. I will definitely be booking again when I’m on Big Island for work!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space.
Always cool(shady).
Great wildlife night sounds.
Allowed me to drop off luggage before actual checkin. Saved my life."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely space. Communication was on point. Heading back in a week, what more can I say?🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan and his family were wonderful hosts! We really enjoyed our stay the places was clean, tidy and a convenient location to explore around the island :) Mahalo"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is gorgeous and serene, and not too far from Hilo or Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. We were celebrating our honeymoon, and Ryan & Gina put up a sweet sign, and set out a bottle of champagne welcoming us, which was a nice touch. They were quick to respond to messages, and suggested wonderful places to visit and eat. The unit itself was clean, nicely decorated, and was just the right size for the two of us. We would stay here again, and highly recommend this place!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan's place was just perfect for us. They took our reservation at the very last minute and accommodated us nicely. The location was convenient. The house was very clean, bright and nicely decorated. Everything we needed was readily available and Ryan was very responsive. I reccomend this listing."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great, clean, and peaceful place."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient, cozy and clean! My friend and I stayed here for a girls’ trip to the big island. It was perfect in every way. The cottage is modern, clean and spacious. Comfortable beds, plenty of amenities and everything you could really need. The hosts were so accommodating and welcoming. It’s located in a peaceful neighborhood, close to everything great on the island’s east side. Highly recommend staying here!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication and very understanding when we needed to cancel early due to personal situations
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Ryan and his family are exceptional hosts. The unit is sweet and spacious with all you need. I highly recommend this Airbnb for a restful getaway. Enjoy your stay. Wini and Tom.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay with Ryan and Gina. They were incredibly hospitable while giving us complete privacy. We don’t mind chatty with our hosts in person, but we didn’t want to intrude on their home life either.
The location is great for exploring the entire east side of the island. We had great adventures every day and a comfortable stay each night. We only took advantage of the pool one afternoon…it was fabulous after a long day to cool off.
We hope to stay again on our next trip down.
We had incredible weather while we visited, so I will warn you, it’s hot and humid on the east side. We left the windows open and got the studio to cool down pretty quickly after the sun went down. I slept better here than in Kona!
Fair warning: there are frogs and chickens singing most of the night, and an occasional feral cat. If you are sensitive to sound, bring ear plugs. I loved it (reminded me of crickets), but my husband slept with ear plugs in."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,AMAZING through and through. Perfect stay for our first trip to the Big Island.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing experience. Listing looks and is just the way it’s presented. I would definitely stay here again coming back to Hawaii! 10/10/10. A big thanks y’all!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a wonderful stay at Ryan’s place. It was so quiet and peaceful. Great communication and very helpful host. Loved using the private pool after a day of adventuring in the Hilo area. Would definitely stay here again!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! Not far from volcano and great to have the full kitchen for cooking if needed. Super clean as well. Ryan communicated well, we’d definitely stay again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet place between Hilo and Pahoa. Perfect home base for adventures on the east side of the island.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful airbnb. Super clean and in good location. Has smart tv, parking, and comfortable bed! Lack of kitchen supplies though like coffee. We didnt get a chance to use the pool because we were afraid we gonna disturb the host because it was behind the main house but I checked it out and it looks great. Host was very accommodating! Overall i would recommend."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina and Ryan were wonderful hosts! We stayed over New Year's and were pleasantly surprised by a bottle of sparkling (non alcoholic) cider in the room to celebrate. The roku TV was great for relaxing, we ended up not using the pool but it was great knowing we had access to it. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen had many amenities! And the onsite parking was very handy!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Close to the National park and away from all the rain in Hilo. Didn’t work out for our long term stay, but a quiet little cottage tucked away in a private neighborhood. Good for couples"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,It was a fantastic stay! Very clean and in a quiet neighborhood. Hosts were very responsive and helpful. Not far from volcano National park and close to a lot of the islands great hikes. Hilo has a lot of waterfalls and great farmers markets to visit.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan and Gina were fabulous hosts! We could not have found a more perfect spot for our Hawaiian Adventure. It was clean, well thought out, had all the essentials and more, and the hosts were very responsive with suggestions on the area. Mahalo until we meet again."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It's a nice clean quiet private cottage I would stay there again
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing! We like to stay further away from the typical touristy areas and this was perfect. We had our privacy but also in a great location for hikes, seeing the volcano, golf, and hot spring beaches! Ryan and Gina were such amazing hosts. They had great food suggestions, that were also close to the house, and even getting amazing massages in our room! They even went as far as letting us borrow a personal back pack for a hike that we needed. Definitely would suggest this place to friends!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were so comfortable there. It was very clean and nicely decorated. We had a wonderful time in Hawaii ( our first time) and would return to this Airbnb again. We had another Airbnb that didn’t work out and Gina and Ryan opened there’s up for us without any notice. Thank you both very much
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome communication once we booked. Great jump off place for exploring especially Volcanoes.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ryan’s place was very clean and comfortable. He also gave amazing food/restaurant suggestions. I’d definitely recommend this place!!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We ended up booking this place very last minute ( on the day of the check in at 8 pm) due to issue with originally booked place, and I was happy. The host- Ryan was very responsive and helpful. He welcomed us even when we reached super late. The place is very clean, modern and has everything you need. The beds are very comfortable and Ryan even provided a Playpen for my little one. The only down side we faced was a heat wave. The ventilation could be improved as the 3/5 nights were super hot and our kids were having having hard time sleeping as well. Ryan responded so well even late nightby providing us an extra fan but it was HOT inside which was hard to manage. Ryan, Gina and kids were wonderful to us and we loved spending time at their cottage"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful. Very clean, tropical rainforest feel. Nice parking. Exceptionally comfortable beds. Very nice and welcoming."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ryan’s place was absolutely the Best. The place was Super CLEAN. Ryan was Very thoughtful, accommodating, patient, and understanding. Quick to respond. The pool was Super Awesome. Probably one of the BEST pools i have ever been in. Even had a Garage to keep the car nice and cool from the sun and away from the rain. I’d absolutely recommend this place to others and I’d definitely stay again. Loved it. No downside about this place at all. Exactly what we needed for a Father’s day weekend. Will be in our memories for a long time :) Thank you Ryan!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay with Ryan. The house was clean and had everything we needed for our trip. The location is ideal, just a short drive to Hilo, and communication around check in and check out was easy. We also enjoyed the pool to cool off on a warm day. Thanks Ryan!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Seriously such a beautiful place! Ryan was incredibly helpful whenever we needed anything. Whether is was restaurant recommendations or letting us borrow a vacuum for our rental car. It was an amazing stay!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fun and comfortable stay. Responsive hosts who were super welcoming and kind. Definitely take advantage of the pool and their cool Bluetooth speakers for a relaxing vibe. You will need a car to get around the area, but there is food/groceries nearby and even a laundry mat. Recommend for anyone looking for a getaway."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cottage with everything you need for a Hawaii vacation. Hosts are amazing, helpful and accommodating."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You'll have the whole place to yourself. It's a great location that's really easy to get to nicely located near Volcanoes National Park and some black sand beaches.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice & quiet neighborhood, very great location overall a beautiful Air bnb . Very comfortable and gave off a nice home vibe. Sweet family and very welcoming. Didn't get to enjoy the pool during our stay due to our busy schedule. 10/10 reccomend"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful extended stay in this beautiful studio. Very comfortable bed. Everything I needed in kitchen to make my meals. Great reliable strong internet and big table to work on . Quiet neighborhood ; typical Hawaiian bird songs during the day and frogs at night, and that’s what I love. Location is wonderful for easy access to Hilo or Pahoa. Hosts were attentive but not intrusive. I will stay again. And there’s a pool for you!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Ryan and his family are amazing hosts. They had loads of recommendations for snorkelling sites both around Hilo and throughout the whole island.
The guest house is lovely, and we were the first people to use all of the fixtures.
The location is great to use as a base to explore the Eastern side of the island."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home in a peaceful setting. Our family of four enjoyed the soaking tub and fire. The home is serene and served as a wonderful respite following days of hiking in the very nearby Volcano National Park.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This little cabin was adorable and perfect for exploring that side of the island. After a day of travel it was so nice to walk in, relax and soak in the hot tub. Our goal was to explore the national park and see the volcanos and you are literally right there so the location was perfect. This cabin is cool aesthetically and very clean. Jeff gave us some local restaurants and places to stop along the way which was very helpful"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were a couple beginning our honeymoon in Hawaii, and this was great home base for exploring Volcanoes National Park! We enjoyed coming home to the hot tub after a long hike each day. The Airbnb was clean and has a modern design with great amenities like a washer/dryer, gas fire pit and the hot tub. Comfortable bed. Would recommend to anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable place to stay when visiting the park. Jeff provided local recommendations and a little welcome pack of snacks and water."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay in Volcano!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our 2-night stay while visiting Volcano National Park. Perfect spot for exploring and relaxing! Felt private and secluded with all the lush rainforest greenery surrounding. It was rainy during our stay so we didn’t get to check out the fire pit but hot tub is nice extra.
There are not tons of dinner options nearby so be prepared for that. Plenty of places for lunch though - check out Tuk Tuk Thai Food Truck for lunch!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jeff was the most responsive and understanding host I’ve worked with. Volcano is such a special place, I’m so happy I found this home to settle into while there making my trip that much more special :)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful and idyllic. Super clean and lovely.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A Scandinavian oasis in Hawaii! The place is gorgeous, just like the photos. The hot tub and fireplace were such a treat after a long day of exploration at volcanoes national park. The kitchen was stocked with snacks, which was a nice touch. Lots of extra plush towels and robes. Highly recommended!"
2024-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"All in all it was a small, perfectly clean cottage. We would have liked a little more cooking utensils.
And what was a bit difficult for us was the shower. The water pressure was hardly present and the hot water was very unreliable and got cold more often in between.
The listing includes Jacuzzi. In fact, it's a bathtub with warm water , which could have been a little hotter for the cooler outside temperature.
In general, we enjoyed the accommodation very much. The heating was really great!
We also had some bad luck with the weather because it rained permanently and was only 18 degrees during the day and only a little over 10 degrees at night.
If you get soaked from the trip to the accommodation, you just need hotter water to warm up again.
So in fine weather it would probably be completely 5 stars, but just one point deduction , as the price was just too high for it.
The rest was perfect! Mahalo"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff's place was ideal for our stay in Volcano. The setting is peaceful, and sufficiently far from the road to be perfectly quiet. The design is excellent and inspiring. Access is easy, and the location is exactly where you want to be to explore the east side of the big island. Definitely recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great place and host!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We are so happy that we decided to stay at the treehouse instead of a resort while on our vacation in Hawai'i! Staying here was a unique and memorable part of our stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place as pictured and described. We had to get creative on cooking, as the kitchen is minimally stocked. There are enough restaurants in the area to skip cooking all together. Be aware that Volcano can be very wet. That said, well worth the visit for the park and hikes."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the private little getaway. Perfect location to go the Volcano National Park. It’s not too far from Hilo to check out the Botanical Gardens.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was one of those rare times when everything was perfect and the place matched the pictures and descriptions as advertised. The host provided delicious snacks, introducing us to some amazing local foods! Our only regret was that we could not stay longer!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is something special and our family was so lucky to experience it. Everything here is immaculate, rarely have we encountered an Airbnb so clean and well kept. The layout of the house takes advantage of every square foot it never felt cramped. We are a family of four and it was perfect for the few days we were in Volcano. The fold out was surprisingly comfortable, no complaints from our teens. Jeff deserves every rave review on here!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have been looking forward to this stay for long and it turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. Location is easy to find - there is a doorplate by the road. We arrived at a cold wet night, the fire warmed up our body and melted our heart, it brightened up the little trees around and also our memories. In the morning, waking up to nothing but sounds of rain and birds was another heeling moment. It is hard to believe someone designed and built such a hidden gem that’s beyond-word. Everything is perfect. Every little pebble is in the right shape, every plant is in the right place: outside the window, under the tub, around the fire pit. Bedding and towel were super comfy. Jeff is nice, welcoming and responsive, and he is now the person I envy most for owning this little gem."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,amazing stay! 10/10
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home tucked back in the trees made it feel secluded. The location was perfect for getting in an early morning hike at Volcanoes National Park.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great private forest retreat in Volcano! I especially appreciated Jeff’s flexibility on checking in to Kuono earlier than the usual check-in time. The place was exactly as described. It was probably the nicest Airbnb that I’ve stayed in! Beautifully constructed, fast Wi-Fi, nice amenities (cedar outdoor hot tub was a nice touch) as well as all the comforts of heat, clean drinkable water, and bath toiletries in the middle of a very rural area. I highly recommend this spot for a very unique experience when visiting the Volcanoes National Park area!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for Volcanoes National Park. Clean. Communicative host.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place-very quiet surroundings and private. The cabin has a lot of trees and vegetation around it. There are mosquitoes in this area and all the windows had great screens to allow fresh air in and keep the insects out. It was a very peaceful stay. I would recommend buying groceries, if you plan to cook at the cabin, before leaving a larger city."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and comfortable home for our stay in Volcano!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice place to stay! The soaking tub was great. Kitchen is small with a mini fridge. Lots of good towels and the bed was lovely.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing home - had absolutely everything we needed & more. Only stayed one night & wished we booked a couple more nights. Will definitely be visiting again & will re-book this airbnb 100%! Would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a relaxing stay in volcano
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The fire pit is nice and tidy
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"It’s exactly like the photo. Very breathtaking view. Though there is a small maintenance issue, Jeff communicated very efficiently and overall the experience was amazing."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved staying here during our visit to the Volcano National Park. It was peaceful and very private. The bed was very comfortable and all of the amenities were wonderful. Highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place! If you’re scared of the dark or being “secluded,” probably not the best place for you haha. There are neighbors but it’s PITCH BLACK outside so a little scary. But nobody bothered us. Place is beautiful."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"For lovers of modern architecture in a place where it's not so common, this place checks the box. Makes you wonder why there isn't more great design and build happening on the Big Island. For it's modest size, it has everything you (or 2 people) would need for a quiet, secluded stay near Volcano National Park. The large outlook to the ohia trees, a firepit, and an ofuro lured me to booking here and these features did not disappoint. If all our homes could be as relaxing as this space, we'd probably never leave home.
Thanks for the respite, I look forward to staying here the next time I visit Volcano."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kūono. Volcano is a magical and peaceful destination, and this cabin just feels like it belongs in the ō’hi’a forest. We especially enjoyed the design of the home, the treats left for us in the kitchen, the fire pit, and the comfortable bed."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home is beautiful, perfect for a stopover in the town of Volcano. Very clean, beautiful hot tub and extremely comfortable bed."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is serene and beautiful. The architecture is well-designed, and the supplies in the house are of good quality. The location is very close to the entrance of the volcano park and several restaurants. Jeff is very informative and responsive regarding anything about the house. Overall I had a wonderful stay here and definitely will come again if Im in Big island."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful gem. A complete stand out in the area. Great design, very well maintained, super clean and a delight to stay at. The outside fire feature was an especially nice touch. Jeff responses were very quick and appreciated. Would definitely stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Such an amazing experience and 100% recommend to anybody hesitant on booking this airbnb. The only downfall is the jacuzzi and fire pit does face towards the road and when the blinds are down you can see inside from the outside when lights are on.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can’t say enough great things about this idyllic getaway. The house was so cool. 10/10 recommend. Jeff was very responsive, and the guidebook gives great recs for nearby restaurants and things to do. Awesome awesome awesome!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful. Right by the Volcano. Cedar hot-tub. Romantic fireplace. What else can i say?
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Immaculate home and location, friendly and kind host, 10/10 recommend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Kuono for 3 nights during our stay on the Big Island. We thoroughly enjoyed the hot tub and fireplace for the cool evenings. The home was super clean and it's proximity to HVNP made it so easy to enjoy the area!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The bathroom is really nice especially with the heater. Attention to detail was much appreciated such as the mosquito repellent coil and snacks being provided. The host was kind and accommodating. The hot tub and the fireplace outside was the highlight of the place. Excellent for guest of two. I had brought two kids with me and they slept on the sofa that turned into a platform; they told me it was not as comfortable as a normal bed so that would be the only downside. It is a bit pricey but the location (close to volcano village and the national park) and the amenities make up for it, not to mention it’s Hawaii after all."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cabin in Volcano! The location is very close to the park entrance and Volcano Village. Love the design details, privacy, surrounded by nature, and a great hot tub. We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"PROS:
-Home is equipped with anything you would need to feel right at home.
-Home is close to Volcano National Park.
-Home was clean.
CONS:
-Difficulty locating the home in the dark because there are no street lights and the wooden house number pole is a little tucked in the driveway with no lights to indicate the sign, driveway, or home. (We did message Jeff for directions and he responded and called us immediately to assist us in finding the home.)
-Across the street are abandoned homes with busted windows, abandoned cars, and trash bags laying out that we discovered from getting lost in the dark upon check-in that made us question the safeness of the neighborhood."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely the best place to stay when you are looking for accommodation near volcanoes, National Park. We really enjoyed it from the first minute that we stepped inside this beautiful tiny house.
Super responsive host, very kind, and he made sure that we arrived to the house, and that check-in was easy and smooth.
The house is very modern and a super romantic place. The fireplace outside was one of our favourites, and of course the view of the forest from the bed.
Recommended 100%! We will be back…"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jeff's modern cabin is perfectly situated in a wooded area. The views out of the windows of ferns and crocosmia are picture perfect, and you have a sense of isolation, even though you're in a neighborhood. The Scandinavian ""feel"" is prevalent in design and furnishings. Great attention to detail; has everything you need without any clutter. Immaculate!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at this beautiful tropical paradise! It’s just like the photos and very clean. Perfect location to enter the volcano park, which is just a few minutes away. The linens, towels etc were high quality, giving this a more “upscale” feel. We recommend Ohelo restaurant (3 minutes drive) great food! and the bowling alley (10 Pin- inside the park!) for a funky place to have a beer and play arcade games."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,LOVED your place!!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time here! Definitely will come back again! Love the design of the house and the fireplace is just amazing!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Kuono. It was the perfect jumping off point to explore Volcano National Park. The house was clean, modern, and had everything we needed. The snacks and water were a lovely touch."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very well designed and unique house. Well equipped with all you need, super comfy bed, functional kitchen, Bluetooth speaker etc. Volcanoes National Park entrance is less than ten minutes down the road. We had an issue with the hot water, but Jeff was super responsive and able to get it fixed very quickly. Fire pit is a great spot to hang out after a day of hiking. Would definitely come back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We would definitely stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a nice stay at this very modern cabin. The space was clean and bright and just like the pictures. It faces the road but there are not too many cars. The police were there for a bit at the house across the street but otherwise no major disruptions.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The facilities were clean and a good spot to heal.
It was nice to relax and feel the sensibility.
However, it was a little cold at night."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at this wonderfully designed cabin. Close to everything Volcano has to offer. Peaceful and private. Lived up to my expectations.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the space! Bit spendy, but that’s Hawaii for ya"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,A really great time. Loved it!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy stay! Beautiful architecture and right by the national park! Very private location (in a neighborhood but surrounded pretty heavily by trees). Was a little hard to find at first since the GPS address was a bit off and we arrived at night, but overall a fantastic stay!"
2023-11-01,3,Stayed one night,"I commend the owners for great marketing and a beautiful house with fluid modern architecture,however it is only a space for overnight not lengthy stays. The bed was comfortable.The kitchen is small with a small refrigerator. The bathroom is efficient. This place looks great on paper and the pamphlets are professional. Unfortunately It faces the street, which leaves no privacy in the hot tub. The neighborhood is lacking with neighbors yelling at 5am. The hot tub breaker kept tripping and it never really got hot during our stay but it is aesthetically beautiful. This rental was modern unfortunately we felt very disappointed with the price."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"As described and seamless check-in/check-out. Great little tiny house a few minutes from Volcanoes National Park entry. We made this place work as a family of 4 (with 2 teens). Kuono, in my opinion, is likely more suitable for parties of 3 or less."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My favorite part was waking in the morning to the morning sun shining through the wall of windows.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time! Definitely recommend staying here if you can. Very close to the park and restaurants!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place! Lots to do nearby and we loved the fire and soaking tub, it made a great ambience! It was the perfect location and such a beautiful design! The perfect combination for a restful and rejuvenating time! Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Close to national park, clean and modern place. Nice experience and highly recommended."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at this little cabin. It had a very home like feel, a great place that is very quiet and away from the city. It was only a couple of miles away from Volcanos, and the place had everything we needed."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the place, very close to Volcano National Park, beautiful architecture integrated in an incredible surroundings. We will keep incredible memories from our trip: not only the beautiful places we visited, but the experiences we lived, and where we stayed."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jeff's place was in a beautiful part of the world, next to Volcanoes National Park and tucked away in the trees, and is beautifully designed and private. We felt very comfortable there and enjoyed the nights on the patio with the fire pit. A great spot to stay if you want to explore Volcanoes as it's not too far a drive from the park entrance. Would stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is a dream. Everything is carefully and intelligently constructed with a great eye for design and detail; both inside the house and on the lanai. Property is landscaped beautifully. Proximity to the park is amazing. Luxurious details but also family friendly. One of my favorite places we have ever stayed; we hope to return!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Modern, simple, elegant and clean. Just an overall spectacular place to stay. Quiet, great location and amazing. The whole process to reserve, check-in, check-out, communication, etc was quick, simple with details that are needed. We will definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unique and stylish tiny house in a residential neighborhood. Very convenient to Volcanoes National Park, about a 10-minute drive to the park entrance station and visitor center. Comfortable bed, clean and functional bathroom, small but fully equipped kitchen. Some of the best features were on the lanai (a roofed, open porch): an elegant, heated wooden soaking tub for two and a gas-fueled firepit that turns on with the flick of a switch."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly as described and a perfect location if you are visiting Volcanoes National Park!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great property, friendly communication, highly recommended!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great proximity to Volcano National Park. Highly recommend stopping here, even for just a night, so you can get an early start for everything the Volcano National Park has to offer."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Very close to the volcano national park so makes it easy to spend more than one day there
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is beautifully designed and situated, with a great forest view and total privacy. The cedar soaking tub overlooking the woods is a highlight. Great finishes throughout the cabin and a perfectly serene setting. We really enjoyed our stay."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing location close to the National Park. My family loved being close to everything and the house is like a little escape into the rainforest with great adorable restaurants nearby. Definitely recommend Jeff’s place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was even better than we expected. It was spotless, had luxurious linens and towels, and stocked everything we needed to rest and enjoy our evening before a full day at a the national park. We were even able to make s’mores! The cabin is very aesthetically pleasing - great attention to every detail, with beautiful finishes and furnishings. Our host, Jeff, was incredibly kind and responsive. Five stars on all fronts. We will definitely look to stay again the next time we visit."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff’s place is fantastic, a tranquil private oasis that is spotlessly clean and every detail has been carefully thought through and designed."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful spot near Volcanoes National Park and surrounding restaurants! Jeff's place is an architectural and design jewel in a quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed mornings on the patio, and listening to the peaceful forest sounds at night. Beautiful floor to ceiling views and a great find. Thank you Jeff for sharing your place!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family vacation at Kuono was a splurge but it was a once in a lifetime location to stay at. The place has been designed with great care and details. It was really peaceful and we enjoyed sleeping to the sound of the rain and nature with our windows slightly opened. Communication with Jeff was very easy and the extra length he went to in welcoming with macadamia chocolates, taro chips, water bottles for the four of us, etc. was a nice surprise. The place has everything you need and even a chess board, a game my family loves. Kuono was spotless ; inside and out! The exterior table and chairs were just as cleaned as everything else inside. The location couldn’t be better. Right next to Volcanoes National Park and the village where several restaurants serve delicious food. Thank you for a lovely stay!
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Kuono. Everything has been designed to make you feel good, in the heart of nature, three steps from a unique site in the world! Thank you Jeff!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay and didn’t want to leave! Super peaceful and enjoyed the fire pit and hot tub each night. We hope to come back soon!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful and perfect place to explore Volcanoes National Park and the surrounding area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, it was better than the pictures! Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an incredible stay, highly recommend to all. It was both peaceful and beautiful, and has everything you need for your stay in Hawaii."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"This a gorgeous one-room cabin, obviously as well-designed as its reputation. The few critiques I have: it is not a cabin in the woods, it's on a neighborhood street and so it's not secluded we'd imagined (you can see the house across the street from the hot tub; hear the house on the right); the constant heat from the dishwasher/dehumidifier was very uncomfortable in the kitchen; and the price. It's high for a kitchenette, but you pay for the location near the national park. The rest was excellent, thanks Jeff."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay while visiting Volcano’s National Park. Just book it! You won’t be disappointed.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice house, very helpful owner."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay and close to the park!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,It was everything it’s pictured on the photos. Very beautiful and peaceful place. There’s nothing but trees around it but I loved the quiet time I had for myself. Would 100% recommend
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful, relaxing stay in Jeff’s cabin. The place is just as described and we had just enough space for two adults and two kids. We cooked simple breakfasts in the kitchen, spent time in the national park, enjoyed the Thai restaurant in Volcano, and relaxed on the patio and in the soaking tub. It was the perfect spot to listen to sounds of the forest."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous design, beautiful tiny house. Very comfortable bed and couch. Very quiet and intimate surroundings."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jeff’s place was awesome! We had a wonderful stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Best Air BnB stay so far! Jeff has designed an amazing experience for anyone who likes to enjoy the beauty and elegance of the nature while staying in the comfort of a masterfully designed space. Soaking in the hot tub looking at the fireplace in the night was my personal favorite of the stay. Me and my family (with two kids - 3 and 8) had an amazing stay all around!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! Gorgeous home. The cedar hot tub and fire pit were magical.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay close to the National Park.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is beautiful and has a sense of design, but it is too small for two people.
The kitchen is too small and not a dishwasher is very inconvenient.
I was wondering if the dishes would be cleaned before checking out and going back to their original places, so I was wondering if the dishes were cleaned again before changing to a guest?
The advantage of the house is that it is very close to the volcano park, there is a campfire, there is a hot tub, it is very clean, and the photos are beautiful."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Elegant, comfortable, impeccably clean and well appointed cabin in a very convenient location near Volcanos National Park. We loved our stay here and would highly recommend it. I've stayed in several rentals in the area and this was by far my favorite. Jeff was responsive and easy to work with."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great private location close to the national park. Very relaxing with huge windows overlooking the trees. Would highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful! Amazing location- soaking tub is wonderful. Easy check in! Thank you again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kūono at Volcano is absolute perfection. This is place to get away from it all and hit the reset button. Thank you Jeff, for a wonderful experience!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay to visit the National park. The place has everything you need and more. Location was ideal. Highly recommend.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We LOVED our stay at this cabin. Close to the crater and all the hikes. Beautifully designed; minimal interior which made for such a peaceful environment. LOVED giant wall of window making this feel like the ultimate glamping stay (:
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jeff’s place was very quiet and serene. At first (as we had arrived at night), it seemed like the house was out in the middle of the woods. However, upon daylight it became clear that the cabin is actually settled in a neighborhood but the ohia trees in the backyard have been left to grow wild. Very nice illusion of privacy. Inside was quite clean and the kitchen was very functional. We stayed with two little kids and two adults and there was ample space. Will definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent cabin just minutes from the volcano! We stayed one night after spending the entire day exploring Volcanos National Park, and the outdoor hot tub was the perfect end to a day of hiking! The house is as advertised and clean. located in a beautiful woods setting. We loved our stay and would definitely recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anybody who wants to explore Volcano national park should definitely stay at this stunning cabin.
The cabin has been built the perfect set of amenities for visitors to"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location if you are visiting Volcano and the national park. Very close to the park entrance, and a comfortable place to stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kūono is one of the best places we have ever stayed through Airbnb. The cabin itself is meticulously designed and finished with all the amenities that you need, including an exceptional outdoor area with a fire pit and two-person hot tub. It’s location is very private and serene—you feel like you are far removed from from everything. In many ways, it was the ultimate glamping experience!
The town of Volcano is a short drive away and there are several good dining options and a small store. If you plan to stock up, best to stop at the Foodland outside Hilo on your way up. The highlight of the local attractions is Volcanoes National Park. And it’s close enough to visit for a short hike or a drink at the Volcano Lodge.
One piece of advice: bring earplugs. The frogs (which are an invasive species on HI) are unbelievably loud at night."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice room with a stove and bathtub.Great living experience.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome spot near Volcano
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jeff space was perfect! Conveniently located near Volcano National Park and great local eateries.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cozy place to stay at while visiting the Volcano National Park. It is modern and spotless. Less than 10 minutes drive to the Volcano National Park visitor centre and 35 minutes away from Hilo.
Our car tire went flat on the day we checked out. The housekeeping lady was very friendly and helped us communicate with the car rental company.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice house, super hot tube, everything you need was there...we would have liked to have stayed longer."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place and the perfect home base for Volcanoes National Park adventures! Jeff was super responsive and you can tell he put a lot of thought into the little things at the cabin. Sitting on the couch watching the sun though the trees and drinking some coffee was an amazing way to start our morning. My tip for fellow travelers, Jeff’s staykuono .com site has an amazing area guide that I didn’t notice until after doing my own research. His area guide had all my ideas and more! Start there with planning and save some time."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place with everything you need, very close to the national park which was ideal.
Very responsive host, thank you so much."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"From the moment we booked Jeff’s place we were excited. The cabin has a modern vibe perfectly mixing with nature. Jeff made sure we were aware all what we need to know before checkin.
QuickTip: Try and checkin before sunset as to get some extra time to enjoy the fireplace and hottub."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a magical spot! I felt relaxed the moment we pulled in the driveway. Came here with husband and two boys and everyone really enjoyed the space and vibe. Jeff was extremely responsive and helpful when we ran into issues (small things - hot tub wasn’t heated when we arrived, couldn’t figure out sofa bed right away). Highly recommend!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was awesome
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jeff’s Airbnb was super cute and he was a very responsive host. There was a very brief outage of power across the area and Jeff was immediately responsive and helpful. The Airbnb was very close to the volcano national park.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, serene, worth the price. So close to Volcanos NP. Felt private even though we were relatively close to neighbors. All of the right amenities tucked into a small space without feeling cluttered or overdone. Loved the fire pit."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff's cabin in Volcano was incredible. The thought and design that went into it is truly incredible. Everything from the simple, modern aesthetic to the Parachute linens on the ridiculously comfortable bed. If you want to enjoy Volcano in style and comfort then book Jeff's place. It's truly one of a kind."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice cottage, the outdoor hot tubs were perfect and the atmosphere of the forest at the end of the day was magical.
Beautiful place to discover"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful cabin in the woods but more luxurious!!! Love the architecture and sitting around the fire. We had a great stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolute gem! One of the best Airbnb experiences so far. We will be coming back again soon!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hard to describe what an amazing place this is. I've had my eye on it for awhile and when the opportunity to island hop became available I jumped on a night at Jeff's place.
Mahalo Jeff! We loved it."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"We had an extraordinary and relaxing time surrounded by wonderful nature.I will be back here for this experience.
It was a starry sky like a planetarim at night."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect space to be close to the national park and still having a quiet and comfortable place to relax when not out exploring.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Probably the most gorgeous spot to stay in all of Volcano. Beautifully designed, clean and coziest. Very Hygge. Cozy blankets, hottub, fire. Perfection rain or shine. It will be our go to spot anytime we are on Hilo side. Thanks Jeff!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extraordinary place. Magical. The fire with the backdrop and the tub is not to be missed. Serene, comfortable, private. Amazing bed and the design is special. It's an A++."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay here! Very minimalist and serene. Great to be so close to the volcano. Would absolutely recommend for anyone looking for a peaceful getaway!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at Jeff’s beautiful property. It’s a truly unique, gorgeous space and we loved having a modern place to stay in such close proximity to the park. Jeff was a great host and left a little care package for us with a guidebook for the surrounding areas. Our only regret is that we didn’t get to stay longer! Highly recommend."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Special little house in volcanos park!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning comfortable tiny house, including the amazing hot tub."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The location is incredibly convenient for accessing Volcanoes National Park. The amenities are as described in the listing and the host is very responsive. I would definitely stay again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff has built a beautiful place in Volcano. Serene, peaceful, sustainable. The soaking tub and fire pit were exactly what we needed after a long hike in Volcano National Park (mere minutes away from the house). Jeff also included some great chips/chocolates, which was a lovely treat to arrive to after the drive down. We look forward to visiting again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Such an amazing place with amazing features. Great location when wanting to visit Volcano National Park especially at night. Well worth it!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Very close to volcanoes national park
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are a person of quality over quantity, this place is for you. We enjoyed every minute of our stay here. Very fine architecture, great quality material, functional spaces and just amazing experience all in all. Highly recommend, if you want to elevate your experience to next level!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful clean house. Felt like we were one with nature. The location is perfect if visiting the park.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I lived in this house about a year ago. I liked it very much. So this year I came back here again. This is a wonderful house. I recommend
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular, modern cabin in Volcano!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved every minute of our stay here 🤍
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kūona is the perfect spot to rent if you are looking for a well designed space close to Volcanoes National Park. The cabin was a beautiful and clean space with little luxuries that we appreciated—high quality sheets, a cedar soaking tub, welcome snacks, and adjustable lighting. You can’t tell as much about the property from the photos, it is a fairly small lot that is close to a non-busy road and neighbors. However, there is plenty of foliage and it still felt very private. Our 2 night stay was excellent!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time. Close to the national park.what a great space!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place Jeff-
Very memorable. Great blend of nature and architecture. House was warm and inviting, clean and modern."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved every moment of our stay here!
Such a beautiful, tranquil spot nestled amongst the trees.
Only a 5 min drive to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park which was incredible and would have gone on many more visits if we had more time! Perfect spot if that is the main thing you are hoping to see."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tucked away in the heart of Volcano, this cabin is perfect for couples wanting to relax and unwind but can accommodate up to 4 people. The futon folds down into a full sized bed and is actually extremely comfortable! Please note the cabin is set up studio style, so privacy between 4 people would be limited however the vaulted ceiling makes the space feel very open and comfortable. There are many nice touches around the cabin including the bathroom equipped with a heater, and fully functional kitchen! The soaking tub is incredibly relaxing and the cabin has everything one would want or need! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The host is super responsive, easy to communicate, has great recommendations, and even gives a local welcoming gift!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What can I say? This place is fantastic! The place itself is beautifully designed, the bed if comfy, nice bathroom and has all amenities. I like the patio with the outdoor fireplace and soaking hot tube. But the location is perfect to visit the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, in particular when there is lava flowing at the Kīlauea crater (like when we visited), so is easy to wake up at 5AM and after a shirt drive park and walk to the viewing area ahead of sunrise. Amazing to see the lava during darkness! I will go back to this place!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 2 adults, and 2 kids stayed 4 nights at Kuono. We‘ve stayed in Volcano many times, and this cabin is definitely a rare gem. It’s a little snug for 4, I’d say best suited for 2 people. With kids it would nice to have a dining table for proper seating at meal time, especially for longer stays.
Naturally the hot tub, and fire pit were huge hits. The all in one washer/dryer is also super convenient if you plan to be out all day. Gorgeous Ohia Lehua trees surround the property, which just add to the beauty of the stay.
Can’t imagine this cabin would truly disappoint anyone."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The architecture and property were stunning, but it was not as secluded as the photos made it seem. The inside was fine, but nothing special. We had a nice time and appreciated the thoughtful touches like welcome snacks and guidebook, but overall didn’t feel like the space warranted the price."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay. We found the cabin to be as beautiful as the pictures. It was a great spot to stay while exploring the national park. Jeff was very helpful. We would stay here again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could build a cabin in the woods, it would be just like this one! The quality, thoughtful design, harmony with nature and modern elements provided an absolute enjoyable stay. The built-in dehumidifier, awnings over the windows and even the design of the windows (no water intrusion when raining) for an area that rains as much as it does was much appreciated. A comfy bed, high output BTU firepit (you could actually feel the heat!) and outdoor/covered soaking tub for two ... we wished we could have stayed a few more nights!
Thanks to Jeff for opening up his cabin for others to enjoy. We certainly did!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and cozy! We stayed here for 3 nights while exploring Volcano and the nearby beaches. The cedar hot tub, outdoor fireplace, and large windows provided a memorable “wow” factor that made our stay extra special. Jeff is a excellent host! He was very friendly and answered all of our questions within minutes. Thank you for the great experience!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Wish we could stayed more than one night. Very cute AFrame with high ceilings and a quiet serene setting.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a magical escape in the hills of Hawaii! The photos match the reality. If you're looking for an escape away from the hubbub (but close to Kilauea), you're in luck! Soaking it that tub was pure serenity."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredibly amazing space that brings the outside inside! The night sky from the fire pit and hot tub . Is just perfect! I’ll be back next year for sure!!! Awesome host too
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We booked this modern cabin for one night in Volcano and it was very special. The design is impressive, the owners/builders are professional design people and it shows. We loved waking up to the view outside the huge window. Snacks and coffee pods/K-cup machine were provided. The fire pit at night lent an intimate feeling, we enjoyed whiskey and hot tea while watching the stars. A few restaurants were a short drive away. I recommend this for anyone looking for a quiet, private place to stay near the volcano national park."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is truly the best airbnb we’ve booked. Host is responsive. Nice place. Love the washer & dryer 2in1, that’s very important for travelers. And the sunscreen, aloe vera gel, etc. Very sweet and considerate."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful spot for easy access to the National Park! Highly recommend a couple nights here to experience the park at night and see the volcano in action. Thanks for the awesome stay!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic spot to stay and the perfect place to retreat to after daytime hikes and adventures. Every detail is thought through so you have exactly what you need from kitchen items to cozy robes. The view of the trees and simple space layout allowed us to relax and enjoy this beautiful spot on Big Island! Definitely on our list to return again soon.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything has been said in the comments, this place is so great and well situated. We really enjoyed our 3 nights ! Perfect for a romantic stay 👌🏻"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The photos of this space are spot on, it’s really beautiful. Super convenient location to the nearby park, we were able to leave midday and come home for lunch and easily zip back to the park in the afternoon. Quiet, private, and super comfortable bed and linens.
Some things to note, many of the dining options in volcano close early. If you’re coming from hilo, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to eat there or grab takeout before you head to volcano at least until you get the lay of the land. The kitchen is really small as noted, so I wouldnt plan on cooking meals if you can help it, but it was fine for heating up breakfast or leftovers."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,loved it. original. unique. simple yet luxury .
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a truly stunning property and made me wish we had longer to spend in the area. Everything about the house, communications, and interactions with Jeff was perfect! This set the bar extremely high for any other short-term rental property."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! The Airbnb was very clean and decorated nicely, the amenities were nice and the extra touches like snacks and toiletries were thoughtful. This was very convenient to the park, I would recommend doing a night hike to see the Kilauea lava. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend staying here if you’re visiting the park."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Listing is just as perfect as described, very clean and comfortable with everything you need. I wish the cabin offered a/c but with the windows open at night it was tolerable. Would definitely book again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have had a most wonderful time ! What an elegant space that is well designed and connected with nature. Everything that we needed was available and we were able relax and explore the area. Jeff was very helpful and easy to communicate with. We enjoyed the nightly frog serenades and varieties of beautiful birds.The convenient access to Volcanoes National Park and dining at the rim was certainly a hit ! We are looking forward to another visit !
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lives up to the hype. Beautiful design, great host, very clean and comfortable, well located to get after it in the park and to enjoy the small town of volcano. Hot tub and fire pit were next level."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to stay in Volcano, you can’t be this place. Looks just like the posting, everything was clean and very comfortable. A must stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a calming wonderful place. The informational booklet of local attractions was Super helpful. We also really appreciated the yummy unique snacks and water they provided. It was a welcome treat after a long day of driving.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is truly fantastic! From the start, we had great support leading up to and for checking in. We had a wonderful time unwinding and spending time in Volcanoes. What Jeff has done with the quality of the amenities as well as the styling is great!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing rental. You feel like you are in your own private oasis. Place is exactly as it look, amazing!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of my all time favorite stays. Relaxing, tranquil, well designed. Would love to stay here again! Very conveniently located close to the park.
We had trouble finding the control panel to turn on the hot tub when we first got there. It’s by the front door of the house in the kitchen area. Turn on the switch at the panel if hot tub isn’t on when you arrive! Other than that, it was awesome!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay for a romantic getaway by Volcano National Park!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really fell in love with the place. The cabin is just perfect, the location is minutes away from the Volcanos park and Jeff was very responsive whenever we had questions. I'd recommend this to anyone visiting the area."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jeff's place is wonderful! We enjoyed listening to the tree frogs singing every night. The national park is also super close!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely gorgeous details in the design. It feels very secluded and private. Incredibly convenient as it is located just a short drive to the entrance of Volcanoes National Park and the town of Volcano. Loved sitting by the fire pit at night listening to the frogs.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Kuono is a gorgeous cabin!
A wonderful place to escape, with luxury touches like plenty of soft towels, premium linens, USB port bedside chargers, and labeled light switches w/ dimmers. It is exactly as pictured in the posting.
Easy check-in and great communication.
A few elements of the cabin made it a bit less comfortable: very thick oversized pillows made for a challenging night’s sleep, the shower door makes the bathroom floor very wet, and the bathroom sink was a bit clogged during our stay.
I’ll also note that it’s only semi-private, as it’s in a neighborhood with closely situated homes.
Otherwise, a lovely experience for those visiting the national park!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic! Everything that it seems on the listing and more.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Volcano house hosted by Jeff is a absolutely amazing. It is so close the Volcano national park you can easily wake up early to go see the sunrise. The fire pit, hot tub and outside area at the house is where we hung out almost 100% of the time while we were there. The kitchen, bathroom and living area were extremely clean, new and everything worked properly. Do not miss this rental if you are looking for a cool spot!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely amazing! Loved every bit - perfect jump off point for volcanoes national park and Hilo
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location to explore Volcano National Park.Very clean,great architecture.The sound of the birds at night is amazons."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is one of a kind. Loved the details of the house. A very unique experience! Clean, had all the amenities and beautiful mornings. If you want to have a wilderness experience and yet luxury this is the place. Jeff was very responsive and kind.
The only thing we struggled is getting there at night. But that’s on the Volcano road.
There are no street lights and it was raining so it was difficult to find the place. Drive slow at night and you’re good :) Drive is easy in the day!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a fun and special place to stay very close to Volcano National park.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an awesome time during our stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful little spot. Super quiet and on the more interesting side of the island imo. Less than 10min away from Volcano park which has spectacular hikes and views.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing modern cabin & so close to Volcano National Park! We loved the hot tub and listening to the birds at night.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I had a terrific 2-night stay at Jeff’s place. The location is immensely convenient for visiting Volcanoes National Park and the house is well-equipped, masterfully designed, and delightfully secluded."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an incredible place!! It is exactly as it appears in the photos, maybe even better. Extremely convenient to get to Volcano National Park, yet still feels remote enough to enjoy peace and quiet. Loved staying here and would absolutely stay again next time we visit the area! I could not recommend this place more highly."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This modern cabin was perfect for our stay. It is very close to Volcano national park and 30-40 minutes away from Hilo and black sand beaches. There are limited options to eat so we preferred to go to Hilo for that. The house was stocked with a welcome basket (some snacks and water) which a nice surprise. Jeff was very responsive when we had any questions. when back on the big island this would be our choice to stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family really enjoyed our time at Jeff’s Airbnb. The house is amazing, and it accommodated 2 adults + 2 kids (but we only ate breakfast here). We’ve never see so many stars on a clear night. Highly recommended if you’re visiting the nearby national park."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous house, probably the most beautiful house on the island. :) We were super comfortable here and wished we could’ve stayed longer.
Kitchen was equipped with everything you need to cook. LOVE the combo washer dryer, we just throw in a load and go out and come home to clean dry clothes!!! Bathroom was beautiful and clean with very good water pressure.
Super close to Volcano National Park & a really good Thai food truck (Tuk Tuk) and a market. We loved staying here. Thanks for hosting us!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This little cabin was amazing! Everything about it was perfect, we are a family of 4 and didn’t feel cramped at all! We love the proximity to Volcano National park, it was so convenient to back and forth to the park and to get over there at night to see the lava! We can’t wait to stay again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home! It was a great location for seeing Volcanos National Park and the Hilo side of the island. Would stay here again as Jeff is a great host and the home is so well done. Very romantic for our honeymoon!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hands down one of my favourite places I have ever stayed at. Everything about Kuono was perfect. So incredibly comfortable, clean, and beautiful. How special to be able to look out at the forest, sit by the fire or in the hot tub and look at the stars. Such a quick drive to the Volcano Park entrance too - we missed the rush of people and were able to get a calm, early start to the day. If you are on the fence about staying here, just do it! You won't regret it."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Jeff’s place was just magical! The house itself is a perfect size and we enjoyed sitting in the hot tub with the fire going (even in the rain it was perfect). We even went in an out of Volcanos National Park a few times as it was so close in proximity. Could not recommend this spot more on your time during the big island!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was the perfect lodging after a long day of hiking at the park & exploring the Big Island. We loved the attention to detail and the fire pit & hot tub on the lanai was romantic.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic find, very unique option for lodging and incredibly convenient to get to Volcano and the national park for early morning hikes before the crowds become a factor. highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend. Jeff is a great host and the place is a wonderful quiet oasis. The perfect place for a relaxing vacation.
