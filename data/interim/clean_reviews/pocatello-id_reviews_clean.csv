2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"very nice, they left us snacks and tooth paste,mouth wash and soap. all the amenities of home"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,üëçüèΩ
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay at the house.
Quiet and a lot of good food to be found around the location.
Can‚Äôt wait to go back"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place for a short-term stay with dogs. Having the fenced in yard was great.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great little place to stay for a weekend trip to a tiny scenic Idaho town. So many amazing things to do so close to the place! Comfortable bed and get amenities
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed at Mike‚Äôs before and was just as wonderful this time as the last. Great place for work or play in the area. 100% recommendations from me.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy stay, and we really liked how many places were in walking distance!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Mike is fast to respond to all communication with him. The place was very private and you feel cozy and secure in this peaceful space. Easy gated access and the amenities were exactly as stated. I will definitely stay here again if available for my next trip here.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Mike's place had everything needed for a night's stay. The electric firepit was really nice to use and easy. The place was clean and easy to find. It was nice to have the whole place to ourselves. It was private and quiet which I enjoyed.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"During my lengthy stay of 10 weeks, I gained a deep understanding of what it's like to live here for an extended period, which might differ from the experience of staying just a few days.
Pros:
It‚Äôs a budget-friendly option for pet owners, featuring in-unit laundry, a parking garage, and negotiable terms.
Cons:
Uneven floors, misaligned doors, faulty wiring, and a moldy, leaking garage.
The shared address led to frequent delivery mix-ups due to poor signage, that need to be fixed by the owner.
As a tall(6.2) individual, the bathroom's cramped conditions, with a tiny toilet and rusted shower rod cause lots of trouble and disappointment.
Lastly, the waste disposal process was notably inconvenient, requiring a lengthy walk to transport bins across the the other side of block.
Overall, 4 start for the budgetting, and can be 5 star if you only stay short term"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful place, perfect for a couple. Will definitely be staying again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great short stay. Mikes place is awesome.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Mike was an exceptional host. Life has been stressful with a big move right around the holidays and without my husband at this time to help. It was a wonderful mini vacation before I had to go back to reality. Thank you!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great for a couple. Quiet neighborhood. Super comfortable bed and we LOVED Bigfoot Pizza! Would stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is AMAZING!!! It gave a sense of camping but also having a comfy place to stay. I would 100% come back here and spend more than one night. Very private but also felt safe. Only thing is that there are some steep hills and my car barely made it up, but I know I would ask them for help if I needed. I recommend this place 100%!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location. The bathroom was better than I expected. The wood chips helped too. There‚Äôs log stumps we sat on around the fire which was convenient. Next time I would bring one thing of wood for the fire as they requested the large wood be used for the inside fire only. They had kindling but some was wet. But we made it work, no problem! We would come again! They had fun games to play too. Thank you for some happy memories."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Yurt was a beautiful place to stay! It was as so cozy, and loved the wood stove and the dome so you can see the stars! I‚Äôve definitely have been telling everyone about my trip, and that it makes the most perfect staycation üíõ"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic viewsÔºÅ
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing yurt and wonderful host! 10/10 would stay here again.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to get away for the weekend. I loved waking up and enjoying the view. It‚Äôs so peaceful and quiet. The host gives you good movie options and fun games to play. Everything is clean and well taken care of. Over all it‚Äôs a great place to visit.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I wanted to do something special for our 5-year anniversary, and we came upon this yurt! It was a great price, beautiful location, and nice and clean and cozy. We had a great time playing board games together, snuggling and drinking hot cocoa during a movie, and gazing at the moon and stars through the clear dome in ths ceiling. The bed was very comfy and warm, and we slept well. We definitely want to come back to Caribou Yurt and bring our girls and have some fun with them!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This is definitely a nice little getaway the hosts have made everything convenient and easy to understand I thoroughly my one night for ME as a single mother of four kids this was exactly what I needed for a reset
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the yurt was so cool! i‚Äôve never stayed in a place like that! we did go in the winter and the only source of heat is from the wood stove and i have never used one of those before so it was a bit of a rough start but after i got it down, it was all warm and cozy from there on! i would recommend either bringing your own or the host providing a small space heater so you‚Äôre not freezing while trying to get the wood stove going but other than that, i loved it!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"beautiful spot, great view, privacy yet close access to town."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved this place will definitely go again and lance was extremely nice and helpful great people
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This stay was wonderful. They have the cutest dogs all around the property, made us feel very safe! The yurt location is unbeatable with gorgeous views, we felt so peaceful. They truly went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. Very quick response times. They have everything you would need in the little yurt and we personally loved the board games and movies. We brought up some microwave meals and it was great. We only stayed one night but hopefully will be back again soon.
Had a little hiccup getting in as our car was not well equipped for snow, if you head up I 100% recommend bring a car that can handle snow if you‚Äôre going in the winter months. It was just about a half mile walk in and they were amazing at helping us out despite the difficulty. They brought us sleds for us stuff, extra snow gear to keep us warm, and plowed the road for us!
Great people, great location, great stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,So fun! The yurt was nice and warm through the snowy night!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cami and Lance plowed out the driveway for us and even helped pull one of our cars up the hill with their tractor after a serious snow storm
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Camis yurt was such a pleasure to stay at!! We loved our moms getaway for a night to this peaceful beautiful, snow-filled area!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,place is awesome. I love the secluded spot

Was 5¬∞ outside and plenty warm in the inside. Loved playing games, watching DVDs, and doing puzzles."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cami was kind, gave notice of wether conditions for the road to the yurt, and even went above and beyond providing other suggestions/tips to ensure we had a great experience. I feel as though she did things most people wouldn‚Äôt care to do. I highly recommend anyone to use Airbnb through her. My boyfriend and I had an amazing night in this yurt. Highly recommend for a quick romantic getaway ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Such a fun place.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly what we were hoping for- a cozy getaway with beautiful scenery. Such a charming place to stay.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice cute and cozy place. Bed was comfy. Place was clean and hosts were easy to communicate with. However if going in winter months 4 wheel drive is a must as they do tell you that but definitely glad we had 4 wheeldrive. Not far from town so you can grab things but still out far enough to be peaceful and relaxing. Would definitely go back.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The yurt was wonderful for our weekend getaway! Cozy and toasty with the fire and the bed was very comfortable- don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever left an Airbnb review for good bedding, but that bedding and duvet were cozy perfection"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had such an amazing night at the Yurt for our anniversary! It was a great getaway that wasn't too far from town.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, had a nice fire, a hike on the trails and and overalls relaxing stay. The wood burner really works had the whole place warm."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cami was extremely kind and responsive. The yurt is beautiful and it was a great get away. There were so many things to do that were provided- games, movies, tea/apple cider/hot chocolate, a trampoline, and fire pit!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is was such a wonderful get-away! We had a 4 month old, 2 year old, and 9 year old and we all stayed comfortably in Caribou Yurt. We wanted to have as close of an experience to camping with our little kids without actually staying in a tent. The yurt was clean and cozy and had room to play lots of games. The kids tired themselves out on the surrounding hikes and trampoline. And our hosts could not have been nicer! They have literally thought of everything! We would love to stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,cute
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cami was a wonderful host and even gifted us with treats! The yurt is in a beautiful location and it was a fun experience for our kids.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at Cami‚Äôs! We booked the Caribou Yurt for the last night of our road-trip, and it was exactly the relaxing, beautiful setting we were looking for. Would definitely love to stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This yurt stay was adorable and our kids loved the experience!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I would have paid double the price to stay here, it was a bargain, and far more than I could have hoped for. even with some inclement weather, my guests were still able to visit comfortably inside. this place far exceeded my expectations, and I will be back. I'm looking forward to a winter visit next time!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A gem in the mountains, beautiful and serene."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at the Yurt! The trampoline really makes it so much fun for the kids. We did a fire at sunset and watched the stars every night of our stay. It was a great in between of camping and glamping! There is no running water, which I didn‚Äôt realize but otherwise it was a great place to stay.
The surroundings are beautiful and we will definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The yurt was adorable and in a beautiful location. Very cozy! I loved all of the little details and notes from previous guests. There is so much history in the area. Cami, our sweet host, also saved our day! Our car battery died in the night and she helped get us get jump started and on our way! 10/10 would recommend <3"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Yurt was incredibly spacious and welcoming. Each morning I sat on the bench outside with my tea and couldn't have felt more at peace.
The mattress was unbelievably comfortable - I slept 10 hours every night. The added extras were great - small AC and DVD player for watching movies.
Cami and Felicia (co-host) were very responsive and gracious.
Three wonderful days."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the comfiest beds i‚Äôve ever slept in! Very beautiful place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely sunsets and moonrises! A unique and cozy yurt. We visited in July, there was a small window AC unit, but good to find other things to do during the day to escape the heat. Seems best suited for cooler visits. The host was very communicative and accommodating!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the yurt! It was a really unique place to take the family to. We are not big campers, so staying at a place like this was a happy medium between a tent in a hotel. Beautiful sunset and we had a great time!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed our night at the yurt. It was quiet, peaceful, and exactly what we were looking for. There was initially a miscommunication upon check in, but the host was incredibly responsive and it was resolved quickly."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sweet yurt setup, kids couldn‚Äôt stop bouncing on the trampoline‚Äîso lovely!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you like the outdoors, you will like this place. It was private and comfortable, and exactly as described."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful, peaceful, picturesque spot. Gorgeous views, and you feel like you're in the middle of nowhere. The highlight would have to be the wonderful pup that came to visit me while I was watching the sunset."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at Caribou Yurt. This is a gorgeous property and I‚Äôm sure that statement holds true through all four seasons. It was the perfect first family trip for our 6 month old daughter and a precious getaway for those who are looking to spend some quality time in a beautiful location. Cami was more than kind and helpful from the moment we booked. We certainly plan on returning.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Cami's place was AMAZING!!! I mean....have you ever slept in a YURT?! We did and it was a must have experience! Such a pretty land too! Thank you thank you! It was exactly what we needed after a long trip to the wild Yellowstone.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our third year coming out to Caribou Yurt and may be our best stay yet. Sparing running water this place has all the conveniences of home with beautiful views and a peaceful setting. Truly the perfect compromise between camping and a hotel stay. We loved the cooler days and beautiful wildflowers that came with coming out before the summer heat hit and our son loved the trampoline, boardgames, and movie selection."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved every minute!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place!
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely time. It was perfect for my sons special needs birthday. The only struggle being trying to get the kids not to put toilet paper in the out house toilet. We failed at that, too many years trying to get them to do it could not be undone. Overall an excellent place to be a loud, energetic, kid."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time and celebrated our 18th anniversary. The sky was clear so we were able to get some star gazing in away from light pollution. Overall a great little getaway.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Seriously the coziest little place ever üòä so happy we booked this place. Cami was amazing and even mailed me my credit card after I left it behind! Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay! A beautifully location and space! Cami was so helpful!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"our stay was nice. it was clean, quite and comfortable."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is super cute! Also, I‚Äôm a very girly girl and was nervous about using the outhouse but it was so well set up and took all of my worry away! The fire made the night so nice and cozy. Will definitely visit again in the future!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cami‚Äôs yurt was amazing. I booked this place for my friend‚Äôs birthday and we had a great stay !
Cami kept give us updates about the snow situation and did her best to get the way plowed for our check in.
Thanks to her we had a relaxing time together !
Thank you !"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a beautiful place! We showed up right after a blizzard. It was a winter wonderland. Lance spent all day plowing the roads. He and Cami made sure we made it in and that we were totally comfortable. We highly recommend staying here. Thanks guys for an amazing mini break!
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Recemondadion: Bring slippers. The hoast request no shoes on the carpet and the nights get cold. The yurt is positioned in a scenic crevis within a beautiful canyon. Plenty of water is provided via refilled bottled water provided by the hosts. local history can be found in the handy instruction booklet provided. I would recommend this place to those wanting a happy middle ground between ""roughing it"" and home comforts."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Cami was amazingly helpful!! The yurt was such a fun adventure! We‚Äôll be back!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The yurt was beautiful and exactly what we were hoping for, definitely coming back when the weather is warmer but the snow was beautiful üòç"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at Caribou Yurt! Cami and Lance were excellent and responsive hosts. The location is gorgeous and peaceful. We only stayed for one night- but we definitely plan to be back for a longer stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying in the Yurt and the second time did not disappoint. We love doing quick weekend trips where we can unplug and just be a family. Plenty of games to play, movies to watch, and time to be had as a family."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This stay was absolutely so memorable. I‚Äôve been to a lot of Airbnb‚Äôs but the best part about this was how thoughtful the hosts are on top of how desolate the location was. I felt like it was a comfortable glamping experience. We forgot to bring a cork for wine and of course they had one. Need extra blankets? Snacks? Entertainment? All of it was there. Every detail was so thought out which made the trip a lot less stressful. The view was perfect for a sunset, and I loved how cozy the yurt was at night. It made me feel really connected to nature and a wonderful place to plug out. Cami was one of the most professional hosts I‚Äôve ever dealt with and the replies were so fast. Thanks again for letting us stay and enjoy such a sanctuary! It was so simple yet so enjoyable."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great and amazing experience for our spring break with the kiddos. Cami was extremely communicative and helpful with the weather and snow situation. The Yurt was fully equipped with everything we needed. kids described it as ‚Äúcozy and homie, and a memorable experience they would never forget.‚Äù Thanks a ton, we‚Äôre planning on being back during warmer days to experience a different scenery next time."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. we had everything we needed at this yurt and were warm enough even in the midst of a blizzard! the hot drink bar was awesome. we will be back!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome little yurt getaway! Host was really responsive and helpful. Even had a fire started and going before I arrived. Very cozy, close enough to town but also far enough away it felt private and remote. Was exactly what I was looking for!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cami was great with communication. The yurt was exactly as pictured in a beautiful, peaceful setting. We walked the road down to the yurt and it was slick, but there were sleds for us to take our gear down. Overall great experience, will be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,A fun adventure!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was so dreamy and such a great getaway. The place was clean and everything was there that we needed. We had a big snowstorm and we were more than happy to hang out in the yurt as it was cozy and felt like a nice little home. We went snowshoeing and it was so fun. The area was so beautiful and this was a perfect place to getaway in nature. Cami was super responsive and helpful. They even checked on us during the snow storm to make sure we were ok. We definitely want to go back and will soon!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time up to the yurt to celebrate my girlfriends birthday, and it was just as amazing as the first time we were here. It was snowy and blustery outside during our stay, but with the fire going it was cozy and perfect inside! We enjoyed watching movies, playing games, doing puzzles, and overall just disconnecting from the world for a few nights. It was the perfect long weekend! We will for sure be back again at some point :)"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Been coming for years. My kids love the sledding - my wife and I love the time spent together as a family.
Cami was awesome."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second time staying at Caribou Yurt and it was a wonderful experience! The first time there wasn't nearly as much snow so we were able to park right next to the yurt. This time there was FAR too much snow to drive to the yurt, so we parked at the time of the hill and walked down. Cami had a sled waiting for us so we could easily get our belongings to the yurt. We were thrilled we parked at the top of the hill when we woke up to nearly 7"" of fresh powder. The yurt was beautiful and cozy and Cami was incredibly responsive. This is such a good way to spend the night ""camping"" without a tent or sleeping bag. We absolutely loved our time there!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cami was an exceptional host and made sure we were able to
get into the yurt without any issues. She‚Äôs super responsive and have clear feedback when we had questions. The yurt is amazing, and the view is equally as great. If you‚Äôre traveling here during the winter make sure you‚Äôre aware of the weather. Not every car or truck can make it down to the bottom of the drive way."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place! If going during the winter even if you have 4wd I definitely would still recommend parking at the top of the entrance of the yurt and not going right up to the yurt. We had 4wd and thought we could go all the way down but ended up getting stuck for two hours trying to get back up the hill but user error on our end but other than that this is a amazing beautiful place to stay
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The yurt was great. We wanted to get a yurt of our own after staying here.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place! The best host ever! Must do!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful little place!! Amazing views in every direction, the yurt is very cozy and the fire stove keeps it perfectly warm. Loved it!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful vacation. Yurt is perfect if you wish to have a relaxing and peaceful stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful , such quick response when we asked questions!! Kind helpful and incredible experience!! Even got a ride up the hill in the snow!! Highly recommend!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Located in a beautiful place, Caribou Yurt is a breath of fresh air. The hosts are so kind and attentive, I'm so glad we stayed here"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was perfect. We love this Yurt!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,What a nice place to stay off the beaten path. Beautiful views and just a short drive back into town. Bed was comfortable especially with a fire going. The trampoline was our favorite. Awesome place to stay for a small family.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This yurt is definitely an experience to remember. The host has everything set up for you when you get there to have a great time. There is a book detailing how to start the furnace and any other questions you may have about the yurt. The views were unforgettable as we were there during the start of all the colors changing on the trees. it's only 15 minutes from Pocatello so we were able to grab food and everything else we needed without driving super far. There is service at the yurt which enabled us to still be in communication with Cami if needed. We are definitely looking forward to making our next reservation here again
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here as we visited Craters of the moon and the Tetons, and absolutely loved the Yurt!! It was our first time trying out a yurt and it was fantastic!! Would definitely recommend staying here :) 10/10 place!! Thanks Cami !!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location! Super cozy and comfortable! We will be back to stay in the winter to try out the fireplace!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,we had a wonderful stay in the yurt! The area was gorgeous with the fall leaves just turning. The yurt was warm and cozy and the bed was so soft. kami was a great hostess and communicated well with us. She had the yurt unlocked when we arrived and there were selection of drinks and candies for us to use. there was water provided and a very clean outhouse. I will definitely stay here again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great, unique, and FUN stay! The stars were incredible, the bed was very comfy and we loved staying here! Thanks for this opportunity to have such a memorable start to our 30th anniversary trip!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is our second time staying here and as before we are nothing but impressed. Excellent communication re: changes and accomodations (advised of burn ban and provided a gas grill so we could still cook outdoors). The movie and boardgame selection has been updated since our last stay helping to keep the options fresh. We explored some of the nearby trails and overall had a wonderfully relaxing time.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The yurt was exactly as described - private, remote, beautiful and fun! Amazing views of the sunset and perfect for a retreat getaway from city life. Cami was an excellent host and even mailed me my headlamp and bandanna after I forgot it at the yurt. Will definitely be back!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a fun place to stay! The view was gorgeous. It really is a great stop on your way to hot springs or Yellowstone. All directions made sense and it was super clean. We encountered one minor issue that was actually no one‚Äôs fault but I want to point out that cami and her husband helped us resolve what happened very quickly. And they truly made us feel welcomed and like they cared about us having a good time. They went the extra mile and we appreciate that a lot! Such such a good deal, and worth every penny. Also SO fun!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Caribou Yurt is such a cozy, comfortable place to stay in a gorgeous location!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"incredible view
magnificent yurt
very welcoming place"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful time! The Yurt was quite, clean, and have everything you would need. We will be back for sure!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Have stayed multiple times, and as always, this is a great little yurt and great location. Even better than all of that is the host, Cami. She's real Gem! Thanks for another great stay, we'll be back again, and again, and..."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot, natural beauty, responsive hosts. highly recommend!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Cami's yurt is fabulous! What a perfect getaway. We were passing through Pocatello for just one night and were so glad to have a wonderful view of the stars just a few minutes from town. Highly recommend!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Sunsets are unforgettable at the yurt! Rustic getaway with lots of privacy 1200 feet above Pocatello. 20 minutes from historic downtown and one-of-a-kind Museum of Clean! Check it out!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Caribou Yurt is a wonderful place to get away. Cami thought of everything from the hot beverages and snacks to the comfortable and cozy interior and bed. You feel like you are a million miles away from everything and yet your just a few minutes from town. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a private cozy get away.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a fun place to visit! The host has hit the ball out of the park with their yurt. The yurt is so clean, well-stocked, and decorated. We appreciate all the info the host provided on hiking, fishing and things to do nearby. The beds were all comfortable, plenty of extra sheets, pillows, and the trampoline, movies, and games were a hit with our kids (and all of us). Plenty for us to do and we enjoyed connecting as a family and learning a new game (which we had to go purchase after our trip) on our one rainy afternoon during our visit, too. We loved cooking our meals over the campfire in the evening and the BEAUTIFUL sunsets and views. Such a peaceful, fun place to visit. We hope to return!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My son, my father and I spent a few nights here and created lasting memories. Cozy yet spacious. The trampoline and fire pit were a hit! You feel tucked away in the hills but are still very close to town. We will definitely be coming back!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"it was a stunning experience and we enjoyed the prace and quiet surrounding. the yurt is super comfortable and has everything you need.
thanks Cami"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutly wondefull 11 out of 10.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Fun getaway. Tramp with kids makes for a very nice amenity.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a blast. Great views!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful wild located, excellent communication. There was a good amount of entertainment provided for the kids, such as a trampoline and a lot of dvds."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed staying in this cozy yurt! Cami was super responsive and we absolutely loved all the personal touches.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We never stayed in a yurt before so when I saw this listing I knew we had to book it. The directions were easy to follow and led us right to the yurt. It is tucked away on a hill side away from other homes and people which led to much needed solitude. The inside of the yurt was very clean and inviting. Many reviewing this destination have already commented on the comfort of the bed which I‚Äôm happy to report that I agree whole heartedly. Being the middle of July the temp outside was 100 degrees. Luckily there was a window AC unit in the yurt to cool things down. My wife and I made foil dinners on the fire and ate them in the shade at the nearby picnic table. The highlight of the evening was star gazing in the evening. We brought our pillows and small blanket from home and laid on the nearby trampoline and watched shooting stars till almost midnight. Overall it was highly enjoyable and clean and I would enthusiastically recommend staying at this truly unique yurt! Thanks for a great stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very secluded spot- stars at night, every now and then a car would go by on the dirt road, but otherwise it was as if we were in the middle of nowhere. Charming place to stay during our 1 night stop over. Good attention to detail, like a nice tea/cocoa selection. No running water but jug water was provided. Nice adventure."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cami and Lance are amazing. Their yurt is adorable, very comfortable, and super welcoming. The drive in with a travel trailer was a little sketchy, but with Lance‚Äôs assistance we were able to enter and exit safely. We love that they came and introduced themselves - it didn‚Äôt feel like staying at a hotel, but rather at a friends guest house. We felt very safe and taken care of, which was even more important to us being that we were traveling with our toddler. Cannot recommend their yurt enough!!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A place to just get away and enjoy the calming sounds around you and reconnect with family. It was such a delight to fall asleep looking up at the stars. Everything was provided and the added stuffed moose and bear was cute.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was an amazing destination and yurt.. Everything was extremely neat and very well taken care of.. Everything provided was super handy and the view is amzing especially sunset.. close to old historic Pocatello and even Lava.. definitely made a lifetime of memories.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This Yurt is located up on an amazing hilltop area overlooking hills and mountains. We saw a perfect sunset here and took in the breezes and beauty. The bed was very comfortable and communication with Cami was great. She helped orient us to some hiking nearby. We even took advantage of the trampoline outside which was pretty fun. I would definitely return here and suggest it as a great place for others.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice cozy and cute! Amazing view!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay here with our preteen daughters. Beautiful scenery and got directions to a trail lined with wildflowers and beautiful views. Cozy beds, good movie choices with popcorn provided and trampoline was fun for the kids. Hope to return sometime!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"When we first made the reservation to stay at Cami and Lance's yurt, we didn't know what to expect (Was it going to be like camping? Did it have room for all of us? Would the outhouse smell?) but we were cautiously excited about the opportunity. (My wife Kathy is naturally cautious about trying new things so she was definitely more anxious than me!) We arrived around sunset and were greeted by the cutest little round building, with a trampoline out front, stacks of wood, and the prettiest view of the nearby mountain ranges and the city of Pocatello in the valley below. It immediately put us at ease (and the kids spent the next hour playing on the trampoline instead of helping out with unloading the car!) :)
The outhouse was a composting toilet - very clean, and a couple handfuls of sawdust on your ""business"" kept it smelling fresh. As for the wood-burning stove, it took us a little bit of time to learn how to use it, but once we did, it was very easy to maintain and keep the temperature straight. We slept very comfortably - they have a large, queen bed; a sofa sleeper; a lie-flat recliner; and plenty of floor space for sleeping bags/pallets/etc. Not to mention two very LARGE stuffed animals that were bigger than one of our kids!!
Kathy and the boys loved the various choices of cocoa, and once we got the kettle going on the stove, many cups were had by all. Their kitchen area has a microwave and a mini fridge, as well as all plates, utensils, napkins, etc. Any additional cooking items (pots, pans, etc) are not provided so you will need to bring your own, but Cami volunteered her Dutch oven to us and it was greatly appreciated! Also, there is a firepit outside if you want to do s'mores under the stars.
And, speaking of the stars... WOW! On a clear night, it is an absolute tapestry of God's majesty - you can see it clearly through the circular dome of the yurt's roof, but to get the full picture, you simply have to go outside. We got clear views of several planets, as well as the Milky Way, right outside our yurt. During the day, Lance let us know about a hiking trail that would take us to the top of one of the large hills in the area that used to be a ski resort run at one time. The view from the top is breathtaking - we would strongly recommend that hike to anyone!
Finally, the kids spent so much time on the trampoline that they were literally sore for the next few days. :) We would jump at the chance (see what I did there?) to stay here again. Thanks so much for opening your yurt to us, Cami and Lance! It was the experience of a lifetime."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at the Yurt during our trip from Yellowstone to SLC. I was a little worried about the lack of air conditioning and limited water supplies in the midst of hot summer weather with two young children when I initially made the reservation. I was pleasantly surprised how much thoughts Cami and Lance put in the Yurt to overcome the challenges that come with trying to live in an isolated Yurt away from our normal industrial life. From bottled water to newspapers/matches to sawdust for the toilet, there is a solution in place for every concern I had before checking in. And don't worry, you still have electricity and cell signals. If you are visiting in a hot summer day with temp above 80F, I would recommend checking in a little late because it will be hot inside the Yurt no matter what you do but it cools down really quickly when the sun is no longer shining directly down through the ceiling. Overall, I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting or passing by Pocatello."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was place was beyond perfect !!! Wonderful views ! The detail and design was amazing ! I feel so lucky to have stayed here ! Thank you
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Truly fantastic experience. Within 30 minutes of arrival we had a roaring campfire and hotdogs cooking while watching the sunset in what seemed like our own private range of hills. We were a family of four with two kids; the sofa bed was perfect for them. Would recommend to anyone as a weekend getaway or a memorable day stop on the way to/from yellowstone.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a little slice of heaven! Nestled at the top of a hill, the views are absolutely incredible. Everything was perfect, and we slept amazing. Camis yurt has inspired us to want one!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This yurt was so fun! Quick little get away. Cami was great at communicating and even offered to bring some stuff up to the yurt that we were needing to prepare dinner. Great host and great place! We will be back soon!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The yurt is amazing! As an inner Mongolian, I can say I feel so homesick when I saw the yurt. We had a pleasant night in the yurt. The location is perfect. It is on the way from Salt lake city to Yellowstone national park. So if you want to have a rest and get rid of a long drive with 5 hours, it is a great place to relax. I will definitely come to visit again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to stay. Comfy, fun and beautiful views. Lots of extras offered like snacks, trampoline and fun dvds that will bring you back to your childhood. Highly recommended. Worth the price and drive. Close to local trails. We will be back."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was so wonderful staying at this little Yurt getaway. Really encouraged the space for my wife and I to slow down and just enjoy each other embrace our surroundings with minimum distractions. It was an absolutely joy staying here and I would absolutely recommend to anyone.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The yurt is so cute and cozy! Very comfortable bed and with the stove we stayed plenty warm even with it being 30 outside. Would definitely stay here again
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"absolutely beautiful. no running water or plumbing though, so pack accordingly"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,thank you very much we love this place we will come back
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Yurt was one of a kind! It was clean and quiet with a cozy ‚Äúglamping‚Äù feel to it (all the necessities with all of the aesthetics). The skylight was really nice in the morning and wood stove kept us cozy all night (wood perfect for starting a fire). The hosts did a great job of making sure we were well accommodated, they were detailed and even went above and beyond and put a lot of effort into their book detailing history of yurts, their sustainable practices, firewood, etc. All in all we loved every minute and can‚Äôt wait for our next trip to Pocatello and The Caribou Yurt."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend staying at Caribou Yurt!!! Not only is it the perfect location from town, it is so cute and cozy inside with an amazing view right outside your door! You will not be disappointed! Also try a horse ride with Tammy (brochure is in the yurt) we had a great time here fishing and exploring Pocatello and hope to come back in the future! Thank you Cami and Lance for a beautiful stay :)"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful & private cozy yurt with an incredible view!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is simple wonderful!
If you are looking to just relax and disconnect this is the perfect stay!
Close enough to go get a bite to eat, but far enough to feel secluded!
Highly recommend!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We have stayed here multiple times & love it. It‚Äôs a great little spot to get away from the hustle & bustle of city life.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing view and location. Great place to ‚Äúget away‚Äù from it all and so close to many amazing
natural scenic places to see as well."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fun stay for us and our kids!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The yurt was amazing! It was welcoming and cozy, and the perfect small getaway for our family!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was good little get away, but if your a light sleeper maybe reconsider. The night we stayed it was super windy all night and you could hear the trains and cars driving near so I didn‚Äôt get much sleep. Everything else was as advertised, and the host did everything possible to make it a good stay."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a gem a great view such a fun spot!! We will deffinatly be renting again!!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have attempted to stay in serval yurts in years past, but haven‚Äôt had luck finding the ones that were so remote. Cami‚Äôs yurt allowed us to finally experience it. It was easy to find & close to Pocatello which ended up being very nice to pop down for dinner one night. We would love to come back & stay here again sometime."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Cami's place was a grest getaway. I think she ordered a dust if snow for me to watch the beautiful sunset. Almost got stuck in the Subaru going up the snowy slope. I really enjoyed this place and you should book here soon
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is awesome!
Secluded, yet close to town.
We absolutely loved our stay!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,So awesome! Want to come back in the summer for some tubing!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved our stay at the yurt! She's not lying when she says you need a four wheel drive however, especially in the snow! We got there past dark and it was a little difficult to locate due to the lack of lights, but the place itself is beautiful and she lays everything out for you nicely. It was a great little getaway!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Our host were so amazing! We drove about 2.5 hours and they got a lovely fire going for us so the Yurt was warm and cozy when we got there. Plenty of fire wood stocked to keep us warm the two days we stayed! The location was amazing and beautiful, the communication/info from Host was fast and very helpful! Already planning a trip for the summer, can‚Äôt wait to be back ! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Me and my husband had fun ‚Äúglamping‚Äù at the Caribou Yurt! The hosts were great! The yurt was so charming and we loved our weekend getaway!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The yurt is a great experience! We loved being away from it all! If you don‚Äôt have a 4 wheel drive you might not be able to get in and out.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This yurt is very plush, comfortable and ideally located near the top of a mountain, offering beautiful views. The wood stove quickly warms the place up when it's cold. We definitely plan on returning"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This yurt was incredible! The view was breathtaking, the place was clean and felt like home. I loved all of the games and movies and snacks provided. Will recommend to all of my friends!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay. 10/10 recommend.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lance and Cami provided excellent accommodations. The yurt was a great getaway and we appreciated snowshoeing in the beautiful mountains. Cami was responsive and very accommodating.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great cozy stay. Fun unique getaway with delicious well water, popcorn , tea and hot cocoa. We visited lava hot springs while in the area."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location of the yurt is stunning! It is so peaceful there. And the bed!!! It was my favorite part! It was chilly in the morning, but the bed was so cozy and comfortable! We had great cell reception, which was a bonus we hadn't expected in the mountains. Cami was a great host and quick to respond to anything that came up, even showing us a beautiful place to snowshoe for the afternoon right from the yurt. It was a perfect stay!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot for a getaway!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at the yurt. My family, especially my kids, loved it - movies, popcorn, hot chocolate, star gazing and sledding.
Was cold outside but was provided plenty of firewood for our stay. The wood stove does an amazing job at keeping the yurt warm.
Cami is great. We talked a week or so before my arrival. She made sure we had everything we needed"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great views in a quaint yurt. Awesome spot to get cozy by a fire amd play some jenga.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,had an awesome and beautiful time
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,A great way to have a Yurt Experience without having to have a rough camping experience.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this yurt is as described. The wood stove keeps you plenty warm. Just open the window if you get too hot to find the right temperature. I would recommend bringing some earplugs if you are a light sleeper. Idaho trends to be windy and the canvas creeks/squeaks against the wood. Not a big deal, but I was glad I always have earplugs. I'd never stayed in a yurt before, but is was a fun and unique experience."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Just as described. It‚Äôs the perfect spot for glamping. Beautiful area and the yurt has great instructions and everything you‚Äôll need. It‚Äôs close to town but far enough away to feel like you are secluded and private.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect experience for glamping! Love the wood burning stove and the instructions were easy to follow. During the winter you will feel warm (maybe even too warm) with the fire and the blankets provided. Cami and Lance were very responsive and helpful.
You might find some small boxelder bugs from the firewood but they are harmless and easy to get rid of. They have a lot of the essentials in the yurt such as paper towels, tissues, toilet paper, foil, paper products/utensils, water kettle, ect.
You might also meet some of Camy and Lance's friendly dogs they have if you're lucky! Also a neighbor's dog might come and visit in the morning too! Lots of fun surprises and overall a must try experience! I would love to visit there again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend staying here any time of the year! The furnace keeps you warm even if it's freezing outside, and the bed is amazingly comfortable! The view of the mountains is beautiful and at night the stars are great too on a clear night. Lots of entertainment in the yurt as well. Easy access, perfect distance from the city, and hosts are very welcoming!"
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,Love this yurt! very hard to get to in the snow
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a great time! Cami is super easy to deal with. Stayed here to go to Lava Hot Springs and do some hiking. It was our second time here and we will be back again!

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This yurt is the perfect getaway! It has a great view of the sunset and is very cozy in the night time. We will come back!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The yurt was cozy and cute! Make sure to dress warm or pack extra blankets even with the wood burning stove we were a little chilly. Was a great experience and place to stay!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a cute little yurt to stay in! The views were awesome! The trampoline was so much fun. 45 min drive from lava hot springs, perfect little getaway!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the Yurt! Cami was great to communicate with. We loved the privacy of the location and the amazing views. The Lou was right outside the Yurt which was so convenient. It was also super clean and cute which we all appreciated :)
We‚Äôll definitely be back!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the perfect getaway! It‚Äôs close to town if you want to visit some antique shops or grab a bite to eat. At night the sunset and stargazing is magical.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jenny‚Äôs place was clean and cozy. She was responsive over text, providing me with local restaurant recommendations and giving me the directions to a nearby dog park that my dog (and I) loved. Jenny‚Äôs space was just what I needed. There were plenty of toiletries available and any basic kitchen item one might need. I knew I could knock on there door if I needed anything but also felt like I had plenty of space. I slept very well and woke up refreshed :)"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very cute, comfortable and efficient stay. It is below a family‚Äôs home, so we did hear them moving about, but it was very quiet when we slept. We loved having a kitchen. Would definitely stay again our next time through Pocatello. Also, appreciated the easy check out. Thank you"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a great time staying at Jenny's place once again! Places with a kitchen are always a plus to save money on making meals, and having all amenities in one space is super convenient. Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again!"

I was able to bring her dog too which was a HUGE bonus both for me (not having to drive solo) and for Hannah (getting to see her best friend). The room had everything I needed for an overnight stay‚Ä¶a comfy bed, a bathroom and access to stream a movie for girls night with my kiddo. We grabbed a sandwich at Chubby-Z‚Äôs, a cookie from Crumbl and cuddled up in bed. I loved that I had everything I needed! I forgot doggy bags and asked Hannah for grocery sacks but one of the first things I found were doggy bags! I was super thirsty having forgotten my water bottle at home and was excited to find a cold bottle of water in the fridge! Jenny didn‚Äôt miss a thing!!!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed with Jenny for a night as I was passing through. The studio is as pictured. It‚Äôs a little smaller than expected but it is spacious for one person, maybe two. I had two dogs with me and we seemed quite fine. The neighborhood is quiet. Idaho state university is nearby so it was cool to walk through that campus, which is beautiful. The bed was squeaky but comfortable for one night. As for noise, it was quiet overall. I could hear the kiddos upstairs in the morning but it didn‚Äôt bother me.
If I had to add a critique it would be that the basement was hot. It was really hot that day so that could have contributed to it. I didn‚Äôt find the fan until right before I was checking out. That‚Äôs totally my fault, but if I would have found it, I would‚Äôve slept a lot better. I would stay here again"

Your hosts are just a half staircase up behind a door and responded very quickly to my questions and needs. Great bed. Everything one would need to be comfortable for a longer stay. Especially appreciated the organic Keurig coffee, and a nice herbal tea selection.
Caution: the modem is behind the bed on the bathroom side and one of the wifi options is 5G, in case you are emf sensitive or have concerns about 5G. I chose the non-5G option for wifi.
The place felt good, in spite of emf concerns."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was as advertised. The bed is right on the other side of the entrance. It was clean. Bed was ""bouncy"" when one of us rolled over. Was a bit chilly. Could hear the TV and noises above us. Is very close to the airport, which was why we stayed here."

The yard was so pretty, especially at night. The home was beautifully decorated, cozy, warm, and very clean. It had everything we could have possibly needed for our stay, including some very thoughtful treats and special touches. It felt more like a home, than a rental. We hope to return very soon. Thank you, James!"

This unit was less than a 5-10 min drive to anything we needed. Although we didn‚Äôt use the washer & dryer, we appreciated that they were there just in case. It is a downstair apartment, so you can hear some noise upstairs, but nothing unreasonable. The kitchen had the basic amenities to cook; theres some spices, pans, dishes & utensils. Overall, we enjoyed this place."

It was easy to find off the freeway yet far enough away in a quiet safe neighborhood. Plenty of kitchen and bathroom supplies, comfortable bed with lots of extra linens. It was nice to see extras I don't always find like a full size washer and dryer (came in very handy after 2 weeks of traveling!), full size fridge and stove, snacks, bottled water....plus even a couple beer if I had been so inclined! James was very easy to communicate with, quick to respond plus I appreciated being able to park in the driveway. I would definitely stay again when visiting my family in Canada. Thank you!"

You get an entire driveway for parking. Fourty Winks was a great value and recommended to all. Thanks!"

Using an USB-C to HDMI cord, we were able to connect our Android phones to the TV and watch from our streaming apps. The neighborhood was quiet and we loved having hiking trails into the mountains just down the street. Thank you for a wonderful place to stay Chellee! We will choose you again on our next trip to Pocatello. :)"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"(Please also see my previous reviews.) This time I discovered that the house is only 2 blocks from the City Creek Trailhead. This is the start of many different hiking trails in the foothills. It is also just 20 minutes to the East Mink Creek Nordic Center, which has many routes groomed for cross-country skiing.
Also, the WIFI went down. I let Chellee know and she had someone come to reset it. The person was there IMMEDIATELY -- in less than 2 minutes. Very responsive!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,As always a great stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the second time I've stayed here.

I also liked watching the birds at the neighbor's bird feeder (out the kitchen window). I will be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was adorable! All the art that was done by the host beautifully decorated the place. It was also super cool to be able to have cards and magnets that you can purchase with her art to serve as a cool token of the stay. Would highly recommend this place to stay
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"we were very comfortable here. It matched the description and look like the photos, which is rare! I liked having the little stove in the living room, it made it cozy. Chellee‚Äôs art is excellent, and added a lot of local character to the place. Beds were very comfortable. The kitchen is fully updated and the shower is excellent. Everything was very clean. There also were a lot of hooks around, which I found really practical and useful for coats, towels, etc. High-quality towels and sheets. Good local restaurant recommendations through the app. Chellee was very responsive to all of my questions. Really the only thing I would change is that I could hear the downstairs neighbors through the floor and it made it hard to fall asleep. Ôøº"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, look forward to staying there again in the future. It is certainly not a big place but had plenty of room for just me and is in a great quiet part of town. Would work well for a couple and a little kid or two.
Watch your head on the bathroom doors haha!

Beds were comfortable, bathroom was spacious and the shower was awesome. Everything was in good working order. Clean and well-appointed.
Minor issue of the folk‚Äôs voices in the basement unit being heard quite loudly through the vents. We turned up the TV so we didn‚Äôt eavesdrop on them too much.
Overall an excellent stay and would definitely stay again if we are up that way."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chellee‚Äôs cottage is in a nice quiet neighborhood. It is clean and nicely decorated with her own art work. Her instructions were well posted and easy to follow.
As I am in a wheelchair I had concerns about getting into the home. As it turned out getting in was fine; there are three steps with a very solid railing. My problem was on the inside. Chellee had told me that the door ways were narrow due to the house‚Äôs age. As my chair is 24 inches wide I dismissed the warning and rented the house anyway. I should have listened. My chair did not fit through the inner doors. I did fine using a walker in the bedroom and bathroom. That said, the house was comfortable and quiet."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean, simple place."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Don‚Äôt let the outside of the home fool you. Inside the home and decor are beautiful, comfortable and quiet. The location is perfect if you are into hiking, biking or spending time at ISU or downtown. A very convenient location. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book again."

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Comfy and eclectic!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chellee, your home was just what we needed for our family. Having to take care of our parent's estate and personal belongings it was nice to come home to a comfortable, clean home. A couple nights we just sat around the table and talked about mom and dad. Your artwork was absolutely gorgeous and much appreciated since we were raised on a cattle ranch. Our family grew up in the Pocatello/Aberdeen area and it was nice to be close to downtown. We all were very comfortable and sleep well and had everything that we needed throughout the day. The area was quiet at night and the neighbors were very friendly. Thank you for sharing your home."

We felt right at home. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This is the 2nd time and 2nd location I've stayed in of Chellee's. My experience is always positive. I love both locations.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Chellee's place was great! The place was just like the pics and was a very comfortable place to stay. We only stayed 1 night but would have been perfectly fine staying for an extended time. As a matter of fact, my wife and I talked about how we wished we were staying at Chellee's place multiple nights instead of the very sterile place we stayed in Salt Lake for the rest of our trip. I would definitely stay here again!
Also, Chellee was very responsive in helping me get checked in after I had unsuccessfully attempted to check in to her other unit that is attached. This was totally my mistake and NOTHING to blame on Chellee's part whatsoever. I simply was not paying attention! She called me within 2 minutes to redirect me to the correct unit! Thanks Chellee!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quaint, and cute place! Chellee was very responsive and helpful, even with our need to reschedule dates.

Thanks, Chellee!!"

I highly recommend this Airbnb, and Chellee has always been available for help. I have stayed here several times and have enjoyed the facilities. Terry Moore"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was perfect. Chellee's house is beautiful and cozy, and the beds are so comfy. We came in from a ten hour drive and were able to get a great night's sleep in this lovely little quiet neighborhood. Highly recommend staying here."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Chellee's place for three nights. It was cozy and comfortable, and we loved the quirky, artsy decor + design. The location was awesome: we went hiking just five minutes away on a huge trail system, were able to walk to the grocery story in 15 minutes, and a cool local brewpub is walkable, as well. The neighborhood is quiet and modest, with several little parks nearby. The very modest outside of the house is a bit misleading, as the space inside, while small, is really funky and was totally functional for all our needs. I'm not sure I would call the little electric heater an ""indoor fireplace,"" it is more of a decorative space heater - but it does do a good job warming the place up. I couldn't believe how well-stocked the kitchen was for a small place! We found everything that we needed to cook for ourselves. A little bit of noise from the folks downstairs, but nothing that created problems for us. Beds are super comfy. We were able to access our Apple TV account on the TV and watch some streaming shows. Overall, we really enjoyed staying here, and would definitely recommend to other couples, or small families with one or two kids."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have been to many Airbnbs and Chellee‚Äôs place is probably one of the best I have ever had.
The location is a short drive to town in a quiet, safe neighborhood next to a church.
What impressed me most was that everything in the home had a thoughtful touch, it truly had all the little things one could want‚Äîcoffee, hair dryer, ice cubes, etc.
It is a beautiful and comfortable home with very clear directions written throughout the household.
Also, the bathroom is gorgeous with a walk-in shower."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute and cozy as described! It had everything we needed for a weekend in the Pocatello area. We especially loved the host‚Äôs artwork on display in the home! Just be mindful that some of the doorways in this older home are low (my 6‚Äô3‚Äù husband had to duck to enter the bathroom). We would definitely stay here again!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic home, clean and great location. Chellee recommended eating at the Yellowstone and it was great-awesome whiskey bar also."
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It‚Äôs a great looking space with fantastic amenities. There were some kitchen items that we needed that came in handy. The shower is also great. One thing I‚Äôd suggest is if you‚Äôre wanting to have visitors over, ask the host before you book to make sure they are approved."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chellee‚Äôs place is so fabulous! It was clean, check-in was super easy, and the rules/expectations were clear - which I always love. As advertised, this place is cozy and comforting. My husband and I needed a little getaway and the location was perfect for us. The town is quiet but has plenty of stores and food available as well as close enough to Lava Hot Springs for a fun day trip activity. 5/5 would recommend staying here!"

Showering in that outdoor shower at night when it‚Äôs 60 degrees out is a beautiful peaceful time I‚Äôm thankful I was able to experience. The bed was comfortable and cozy!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Some places you stay in, it's a roof and a bed, when you're done you pack up and leave. It gets the job done. This isn't like those places. Chellee is an amazing host with an incredible space. There are few things as delightful as taking a shower outside. crisp night air and warm water, it's cathartic. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. You have to be here to understand. Would 100% recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a dog show over the weekend and this was the perfect peaceful place to stay. Cosey, comfortable and fit us and the dogs well during our stay. we definitely recommend!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pocatello was the perfect mid point for my drive from western Colorado to Northern Montana and Chellee‚Äôs cabin was a perfect spot to spend a nights rest away from driving, comfortable, creative and quiet. I look forward to staying here again on my return drive."

I arrived super late and was able to find my way in the dark to the door. Plenty street parking was perfect for my car towing a trailer. Bed and blankets were really comfortable."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"We loved the place! Very cozy and cute! decor was fun! One issue is that the ceiling is quite low; my husband is 6'2"" and was super close to hitting his head. Other than that, it was fun for a short stay! I loved the outdoor open air bathroom and shower. The setting was super cute! We will visit again!"

It's in a great location being about 30 min away from Lava Hot springs and 45 min away from Idaho Falls. It was cheaper than a lot of the other places around and for a short stay for 2 people it was really all we needed. pictures make it look larger than it was but it was still comfy and the outside shower and toilet didn't cause us any problems. Host was very responsive. Was a little difficult to find as I did not ever see the sign but other than that it was great!"

Highly recommended!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place. Quiet neighborhood. Great place to relax. Way better than a hotel.
If you are a biker it is right next to the city creek trails. Over the top loop!"

Good value for sure:)"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wife and I really liked this place. If you‚Äôre reading about the bathroom being detached or outside...don‚Äôt worry! There is something that works about it and We found it a neat trait and not an issue. Even with my wife waking 3-4 times in the night for the bathroom...she still liked this place. I enjoyed a outside shower in the morning and the hot water lasted longer than my shower! Easy check in, and great communication from owner. We arrived late and left early...never saw anyone. Cool ‚ÄòShack‚Äô with a lot of character!!!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"We weren't there for long and only there in the dark, so we didn't really get a feel for the spot, but everything was as advertised. Chellee was responsive and kind when we reached out for local recommendations."

My daughter, her dog and I were driving from Spokane to Phoenix, and this was a great place to rest and get ready for the next day of travel. Very unique place, and that's a good thing. My daughter is still raving about the outdoor shower under the stars! Super comfy bed, and very accommodating for dogs!"

There is privacy but know there will be people working around the building like it says in the description!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic spot for a solid night‚Äôs rest in a lovely area.

Super clean and a wonderful bed. Kitchen setup is so thoughtfully done, and I loved shopping for magnets on the mini fridge. Gorgeous views of the hills, and wonderful looking at the stars while I showered at night! No bug concerns at all - a single moth was all I saw the whole evening and morning in the bath area. The host even brought me some fresh cantaloupe in the morning. Highly recommended!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great value. Read the listing fully - Chellee is very honest about the set up. I loved the outdoor shower covered by a big huge juniper tree - but I‚Äôm sure when it‚Äôs colder that wind might not be as much fun. I‚Äôm very glad I chose this AirBnb and would happily stay here again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice hidden gem, everything was perfect and the outdoor shower is a great bonus too. Definitely recommend if you‚Äôre passing through idaho."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AMAZING. We stayed here to make the trip to Yellowstone and it was totally worth it. As other reviews have likely said, the bed is sooooo comfortable BUT the vibe was our favorite part. The tiny house is right on Chellee‚Äôs property but there‚Äôs far more privacy than you might expect. Showering outside is no big deal and in fact, one of the cool parts of this place as well! If you‚Äôre even considering staying here, I say go for it. You won‚Äôt regret it! We are 100% staying here again when we come back west in the future!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Charming little house. Really cool spot on the outskirts of town. Next to some really sweet trails with a river. Definitely recommend staying at Chellee‚Äôs property.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chellee's place is as listed. It is close to all activities I wanted to do in Pocatello and although she was not around during my stay, she regularly checked in to ensure all was going well. The water is great, the shower was excellent with a view of the sky. Would highly recommend as a retreat from the norm. Thanks Chellee!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed at this bunkhouse overnight while road tripping down to Utah. We traveled for 10 hours and we're so happy that this place was very comfortable and easy to relax and get a good night's sleep. The outdoor shower I was concerned about until I used it and now I wish all of the showers were like this. We wish I could have stayed for a few more days! I think you'll be happy if you book this place.
2021-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"Awesome place! I my out four stars for 2 reasons:
- If you go earlier in the year, getting to the shower or toilet is cold. With hotter temps this would have been awesome! :)
- the ceiling you‚Äôll have to crouch a little if your greater than 6‚Äô2‚Äù (I am 6‚Äô2‚Äù so I was okay but don‚Äôt come here if your tall unless your okay with crouching while inside.
Other than that great place!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The ceiling is low, As a guy that is 6'-1"" and only staying there one night we had fun with it, but make sure you're ok with that. The outdoor shower is also super fun. Sadly, it was cloudy the night we were there, but imagine it would be breathtaking on a clear night."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chellee and her husband are absolutely fantastic hosts and people in general! They have phenomenal places and are very easy going! I recommend 12/10 and will always choose their places if i ever need to stay in Pocatello again!! Thanks so much!

2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this stay! I had no idea what to expect from the outdoor bathroom. The toilet, vanity and shower were all divided. The walls were quite tall providing lots of privacy and comfort. The ceiling in the bunkhouse was 6ish ft. tall so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this for the taller folks. Would stay again."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place to stay! They were super accomodating of all my needs and the place is adorable! Right in town, but feels like you're out on a ranch. Not to mention, the outside shower is to die for!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This cozy little spot was absolutely adorable. The bed is big and comfortable. Tv and internet with all sorts of channels and apps. The outdoor shower in the cool morning was my favorite part of my stay!! Also I would recommend bringing a little cash!! She sells postcards and magnets with her very own art on them and they are amazing!!! Definitely would stay again.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed at Chellee‚Äôs place while passing through on our anniversary trip. We had a nice time drinking wine in the treehouse, the bed and pillows were very comfy and we especially liked that the tv was hooked up to Netflix so we could catch up with our shows! The outdoor bathroom was a little hard to adjust to, mostly because it‚Äôs cooling down at night, but I minded more than my easygoing husband. The outdoor shower got nice and hot and the robes kept us warm while we ran back to the warm room heated up by an awesome electric fireplace. Overall we had a nice stay."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was sparkling clean! The outdoor shower was so fun and so clean. The room was very cozy and the bed was extremely comfortable! I‚Äôd give this place 6 stars if I could.

The bunkhouse was super comfy!! We had no problem with the outdoor bath room and shower. It felt soooo nice to shower outside actually. We also loved the treehouse and all the DIYness about this place.

2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am so glad i chose to stay here for the night. Such a cute and cozy space. The bed was huge and oh so comfy. Theres a small treehouse outside that you can sit in and below it is the rabbit's pen. Theres a very cute fluffy fellow that plays out there during the day. When you're parking, do your best to back into the spot! It's not all that difficult and makes life much easier. My favorite part of the stay was absolutely the outdoor shower. Yes outdoor. I had a night shower and it was amaaaaaazing to look up, see the stars, and listen to all the night time sounds. And the water was wonderfully hot. It does get chilly after of course but they provide robes if you need them. I would 100% stay here again just for that shower. Thank you so much for this beautiful space!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute and unique space! We appreciated having the chance to stop here to get some rest in the middle of a long road trip - including a nice picnic up in the treehouse :)
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I spent one night at the bunkhouse on my way from Oregon to Colorado. Stayed in four Airbnbs and this was the most relaxing and peaceful setting of all. It‚Äôs a funky, folky property with beautiful views, lovely breezes, and a fabulous view private outdoor bathroom. Chellee left some peaches from her orchard in my room. Very thoughtful."

This was our first time passing through Pocatello, and this quaint little bunkhouse was just what we were hoping for and more.

Also, Chellee and her family are extremely accommodating and gave us all of the best local recommendations around Pocatello."

The bunkhouse was amazing, very comfortable and clean. We had fun using the outdoor bathroom and shower, and the water was nice and hot!

We will definitely be staying there again!"

2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Love this place! Probably my favorite Airbnb experience and I feel like we got really lucky to book it last-minute on a weekend because Chellee had literally just listed it. Super cool property and super cool space that Chellee built herself. Loved all the thoughtful touches, like the bowl of cherries and ceramic cream pitcher in the fridge, plus the host‚Äôs artwork on the wall and fridge. You can definitely tell the space was designed and decorated by an artist - so well thought out and stylish. The outdoor shower was heaven - there‚Äôs something so magical about standing under steaming hot water with the open sky and trees above you, especially on a cool, rainy day like the morning we were there. Chellee was super friendly and welcoming. Easy to book and check in and out. Also, think it‚Äôs really cool that there‚Äôs space to bring your older kids and pets, as well. I would say that, if you are over six feet tall, this might not be the best place to stay, as the ceilings are not very high. It was great for my partner and I, who are not that tall, but got to feel a bit taller than we are! Otherwise, the space is extremely spacious with a king-size bed and has everything you could possibly need. Definitely recommend!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fun experience, we felt very adventuress when going outside to use the bathroom and shower. Loved it. The room is very comfortable and homey. Beautiful setting and enjoyed sitting outside and drinking our wine in the evening and coffee in the morning. Chellee is a wonderful hostess, very warm and friendly."
