2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I almost hate to say how much we loved Brian's place, because we know the secret is going to get out and this place will stay booked! This is the absolute best airbnb we have stayed. So clean. spacious, inviting. We didn't want to leave. Brian left a wonderful treat from a local shop, with a handwritten note. It's those small touches that make a huge impact.
The neighborhood is friendly. Great food. Safe for walking. The people were all so kind. We cannot wait to come back. We we're in for Railbird, we want the next trip to just relax at Brian's place more. It's made just for that.
The bed is comfy. The HUGE shower with rainfall feature was my favorite. The sofa was even super comfortable. This is a home and it shows."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brian and Liz‚Äôs place was absolutely worth the price. We stayed there to celebrate my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday, and they truly went above and beyond. They left a card and a cake from a local bakery in the fridge, which was such a thoughtful touch. These little details are why we highly recommend this location. Additionally, it‚Äôs within walking distance of restaurants, shops, and retail stores."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great palace and wonderful host. Best AirBnb we have stayed at and this was our 9th stay. Close to a bunch of restaurants, museums and live music. We walked to almost everything and when we went to Buffalo Trace but we got a free Trolley ride with a very knowledgeable driver Mike. I would highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cool place with great food in area
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Brian‚Äôs place. It‚Äôs very modern, spacious, and luxurious. The perfect balance of technology and taste. The bed is extremely comfortable, the bathroom is super large and perfect for couples with three shower heads and his and her sinks and mirrors. We loved the living space and kitchen area which were more than perfect for Derby weekend. He had all the streaming sites set up, and had satellite tv so we wouldn‚Äôt miss any of the action. It felt more like having your own theatre than just a living room. It‚Äôs the type of hidden gem that we‚Äôre always searching for on Airbnb. Location is walkable to downtown and drivable to many of the best distilleries on the bourbon trail. Brian was a great host / communicator throughout our entire stay. Would love to return. Thanks for having us."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brians place is stunning, truly a living picture right out of Architectural Digest and HGTV. High end renovation, state of the art amenities, beautiful furnishings and decor.
The shower is stunning, 3 shower heads in a large walk in shower for two, heated tiles, a large office space with desk and printer.
Brian was very responsive and helpful. I travel a lot for my consulting practice and this is by far the most beautiful, large and functional space i have stayed in . Big plus for me no stairs and centrally located.
Walkable to great restaurants, don‚Äôt miss eating at Goodwood on the same block.
My only complaint is that i went to book my next trip and the place is booked until July. I cant wait to get back to Brians place."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great stay at Brian‚Äôs! This beautiful home is immaculate, fully stocked with anything you might need, and it‚Äôs right in the middle of downtown. It‚Äôs walkable to dining/shopping, and a short drive to local distilleries/attractions. Love this place, will absolutely be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazing time at Brian‚Äôs home; it was beautiful, clean, well stocked, and nicely located downtown, which made it super easy to access all the restaurants and shops. Highly recommend Serafini for a nice dinner and Goodwood (which is literally a few doors down) for a delicious lunch and beer.
The place was very clean and tidy, the bed was very comfortable, and the living room was the perfect set up to enjoy a night in and watch movies/the football game on the big screen. We had so much fun.
Brian was a responsive and friendly host who made sure we had everything we needed. We will surely stay here again when in Frankfort!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at Brian's place! Walkable to restaurants and shopping. The space is beautiful, very high-end and cozy! So many little touches that add to the experience, this will definitely be my go-to place in Frankfort, can't wait to come back!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This tiny cabin was the cutest!!! It was super clean and for a one-night stay as we passed through Kentucky, it was perfect!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt & The Tiny House are worth it‚Äôs weight in gold! Matt is the neighbor everyone wants! We met in the yard, we talked without awkwardness. He checked on us in the evening to make sure everything was okay.
The house will greet you like a cozy blanket! It has everything you need for a peaceful & relaxing stay!
The home is outside the city limits, but you feel like you are in the middle of nowhere with a few neighbors.
The town of Frankfort is an amazing town rich with its historic setting. The people are very nice & you don‚Äôt meet a stranger.
We definitely recommend Matt‚Äôs home when visiting the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just what we needed for our short stay to visit Buffalo Trace!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,What a treasure! Everything was so perfect. The location is so easy to get to but yet feels so private and intimate. The area is just beautiful. Every detail was thought of when crafting this tiny house. You can see and feel the love that went into the creation of this house and in all the intimate touches that Matt and Lilly leave for the guests. They think of everything. Our only regret is that we didn't get to stay longer.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was beautiful! If you love beautiful wood craftsmanship‚Ä¶ this is your huckleberry! Matt thought of EVERYTHING! For a ‚Äú tiny‚Äù cabin‚Ä¶ he had everything you could possibly need. We loved sitting out on the front porch swing drinking our morning coffee‚Ä¶ which was provided by Matt and absolutely delicious! I would definitely stay here again!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,All was great üòä

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This tiny house‚Äôs heart and soul are anything but tiny!! So much attention to detail in this handcrafted gem of a place that is just perfect for a getaway!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome little place! Matt is a great guy, hung out one afternoon and did a little fishing together! Doesn‚Äôt get much better for hospitality!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for a couple to stay right outside of Frankfort. We enjoyed 2 nights at Matt's place and the only thing missing was meeting Matt and sharing a bourbon. Easy to find and super close to Buffalo Trace distillery which was our main goal. We also drove to many other distilleries in the area. Matt's cabin was spotless and comfortable for 2, but can't say enough about the aesthetic and fun of staying in the cabin. The upstairs bedroom and bathroom aren't the size of suites at the Ritz but everything was accessible and made it feel cozy. Would definitely come back and stay here and highly recommend for 1-2 people looking for a great place to stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This tiny Cabin is really cute , have to see quite a gem and so peaceful and cozy , Definitely will be back"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"He was willing to help with anything you needed and communicated with you during your stay on the app, but he let's you have your privacy and doesn't intrude. It looks exactly what you think it would with the pictures and is a great central location between Frankfort, Lexington, and Louisville. Really good value..."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute and comfortable place for our stay; close to friends at the campground across the street. Great outdoor space!
Everything we needed! Matt checked in with us several times to make sure we didn't need anything."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow
This place was so unique.
When we first drove up to it, I was like, ""What did we get here"". BUT stay with me, the outside is so cool with the little front porch, it even has a porch swing. A great stone firepit and bench in the front yard and out back a table and grill. Once you are inside, you will find so many cool things. The kitchen had everything you could ever need. Matt has thought of everything and many extras. The work he did in this place was great.
We only stay in Arbnb, no hotels for us, and this one is nice."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt‚Äôs place was well priced and provided exactly what I needed for a quick overnight stay on my way back home. Would definitely recommend this to an individual or couple looking for an inexpensive, cool place to stay for a couple of nights. Looking forward to staying here again in the future and checking out the bourbon trail"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin is so cute, clean, and comfortable. The detail he put into the place is really incredible. We were looking for a place for the night on our bourbon trail trip and really enjoyed the night we spent. Would totally go back there again on another trail trip!"

We will see you again very soon!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Situated right on the Elkhorn Creek, Matt's place was just perfect for us, travelling from the UK we'd always wanted to stay in a cabin like this and it certainly lived up to the billing. Although small everything inside has been thought about and built to maximise the available space in a modern way. Sitting on the swing seat on the front porch reading a book was a little joy. We met Matt, he's a great guy and available to help with anything. Highly recommended for the slightly more adventurous type."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt was a great host. Very friendly and loved meeting Aspen. The house was everything that we expected and more. Very close to a lot of Bourbon Distilleries. And great local restaurants. House was as clean as a whistle. Looking forward to staying here again. Nothing but good memories were made here. Only negative was the internet was a bit spotty, that was the least of this property. Loved the custom work Matt put into this tiny house. Words don‚Äôt do this place justice. If you‚Äôre considering staying here do it! Couldn‚Äôt have picked a better place to stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is such a precious little house! It‚Äôs peaceful, private and cozy. There are lots of special touches everywhere in the little cabin and on the spacious property around it. It‚Äôs super tiny but it‚Äôs full of magic.
Matt is a great host, caring and thoughtful. We felt welcome and right at home as soon as we arrived. This little gem gets five stars from me!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This tiny home was perfect for our weekend exploring the Bourbon Trail! Comfy bed & just enough room to come back and relax. We even had a bonfire & drank some bourbon with Matt to finish up the day one night.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay. Will definitely be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very beautifully crafted. Very clean and cozy. Lots of wildlife, pets, and beautiful plants. A wonderful place to sit on the porch and listen to the crickets."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I loved Matt's place. Matt was a great host. He answered all of our questions and checked on us to make sure there was nothing needed. He sacrificed his own personal time to ensure that everything was taken care of for us! The home was very clean. We will stay again when we return to Kentucky.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Matt's place is quirky. we loved it. we stayed one night it had everything we needed and expected. we had never stayed in a tiny house before the craftsmanship makes this one worthwhile.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved this little cabin! Would definitely book again!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The tiny house was perfect for a night away from my campervan and put me close to Coolmore at Ashmont Stud where I had a scheduled tour the following afternoon.
Matt is a great host as well.
This was my first time staying in an Airbnb. This was an expensive treat for myself. Hope I was a good guest in kind- all my future Airbnb stays are this nice with friendly hosts."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute little place to stay! Super cozy!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just needed a place to sleep a few nights. Safe. Quiet. It is fine for 1-2 people‚Ä¶ Any more than that I would consider it to be crowded.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is SO cute! Matt was super nice and helpful! Will definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our choice for the week couldn‚Äôt have been better! Peaceful and tranquil surroundings coupled with this unique cabin made for a perfect week.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for trips on the Bourbon trail or to learn about KYs history in Frankfort. This is truly a tiny house/cabin. The bathroom is so cute, and quite small on the upstairs level next to the bedroom. It has everything you need. The kitchen was completely outfitted and there were snack + breakfast options. The front porch is fantastic - great for morning coffee or evening drink. You can also take a short walk to see the Elkhorn River. Tami‚Äôs Diner is a quick trip up the road for breakfast or lunch on the cheap."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place no complaints here!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Matt is a great host who lives next door. He even let me borrow his golf cart for a quick visit to the RV park next door. The tiny home is exquisite and, even though it looks like it's been there for 100 years, it's up to date and modern inside. Only know that the bathroom is upstairs. We had a great experience."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Matt is a fabulous host and this little cabin is a gem! He made us feel right at home and even stocked us up with firewood. The surroundings are beautiful and within a short walk of Elkhorn Creek. The outdoor space is wonderful. We grilled out and sat around the outdoor fireplace every night. The craftsmanship of the cabin is amazing; from the live edge wood spiral staircase to the copper shower and kitchen sink. It was so convenient too. It is located about 10 minutes drive from I64 exit 58. We went canoeing during our stay and were only 15 minutes away. We would love to go back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a good place to unwind. We like Elkhorn Creek, it was very convenient! Matt was very reachable if we had any questions or needs."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt and Lily made us feel right at home in the tiny house. The tiny house is perfect in size, shape, and accommodation. We have stayed at the tiny house for an event in Georgetown Kentucky several years in a row and plan to come back Memorial weekend in 2024 to ride in the Horsey Hundred. A Trifecta all its own: Bourbon, bikes, and horses. I can't think of a better way to spend the Memorial weekend: AWESOME HOST, excellent accommodations, and beautiful and majestic surroundings (did I mention mountains and horses?) all wrapped up in one location. PARADISE!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Matt was the best host we have met so far. He went above and beyond. We will be staying here again go to go play the courses in the area! Definitely will recommend to others!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Matt was an amazing host! This charming tiny cabin was exactly what my husband and I needed while travelling the bourbon trail! We luckily got to meet Matt in the evening and had a hood chat. His sweet dog, Aspen, was the most welcoming and friendly pup, he was a highlight for sure!
I would recommend this air b&b to anyone looking for a quick get away, or a serene spot to recharge. Thanks again!"

Great place to stay for adventurous people who are in the area for the Bourbon trail. We had a good dinner and music at Goodwood downtown. We also like Melissa‚Äôs family diner for breakfast.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my first stay as a part of a solo trip.
Just what I needed to get centered, and get in the right mind as I got away from my day to day.
It was peaceful, little cabin, perfect for just one person. Matt was responsive. His golden retriever was very friendly.
This was my first experience using Airbnb, and I loved it."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Matt's place made the Kentucky bourbon trail trip so much more memorable! Matt's and his golden were beyond helpful and friendly. I don't write reviews but felt the need to support such a great guy and great stay. He built that place with love. Stay here, you won't regret it!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came across this property searching for a place to stay in Frankfort. This was our first Airbnb stay and Matt made it a memorable one! Check in was slick, the space is exactly as described. Such a quaint and cool space for our two night stay. Thankfully met Matt after our day two adventures and he is a great host. He wanted to know how not only his space was treating us, but all of Kentucky. We got lucky and his Golden Retriever Aspen stopped by a couple times to say hi. The tiny home had everything we needed; be sure to check out the check in journal entries!! Thanks again Matt and Lily for a great experience; we will be back!!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Matt's place is adorable and unique. We were very comfortable. Wish we had gone during warmer weather to enjoy the front porch swing. Getting in was easy. Clean. Quiet.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin is well built and the craftsmanship is very impressive!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Not only was the Tiny Cabin well maintained and very quaint, but so relaxing! We didn't need much but if we did Matt was ready to assist in any way he could.
Stayed 1 night but I wish it could have been a week as we would have loved to utilized the amenities on the river which was 20 steps away.
Warning, WONDERFUL Aspen, the golden retrieve is a pro level begger! That boy has refined his game and we loved it!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and host
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Matt and Lily have created such a thoughtful and intentional little cabin.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect stay for me! I came in town to do some distillery tours and just have some time away from work. Matt was fantastic with instructions for check in and the tiny house was awesome! Loved the character and charm. The bed was so comfortable, all linens and extras available. There is WiFi available, but I left it off my phone so I could tune out. He also has a dvd player for those of you who know what that is! I even went to Walmart and bought a dvd for the first time in 10 years! Overall 10/10, my wife and I are already planning a trip for the spring to come back."

We highly recommend this rental!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great little place not to far from everything but still has that rural feel. I‚Äôve been working in hospitality my entire life and Matt really pays attention to the details of his property.
Also, the dog and little cat were so friendly, they brought a lot of joy to my 2 year old daughter. We really enjoyed our stay there and would love to come back in the future!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Matt was extremely kind and responsive. The inside of the tiny home was adorable and stocked with anything we could need for a quick long weekend.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Matt & Lily's tiny house is definitely worth a detour. We greatly enjoyed the short stay. Also the tip with the fire from previous guests was one of our highlights.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at this place and conversing with Matt! We also appreciated Aspen for checking up on us.
The place provides an area away from everything where you feel one with nature."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is so cozy! It had everything we needed and more. Check out the creek at the end of the road. Definitely use the fire pit if you have time. The house is about 10 min away from Buffalo Trace, as well. Matt and his daughter, Lily, are so friendly and accommodating. Aspen, the golden retriever was also awesome! Pepper, the kitty, is super cute and playful! You will not be disappointed!!!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the Tiny House for 3 nights and it was wonderful. Make no mistake it is a tiny house, bathroom and stairs are small but totally livable. The wood details of the house are beautiful. We had a fire outside at night, enjoyed the outdoors and got a visit from Matt's dog Aspen and his kitty cats.
It is perfectly placed to visit one or all of the surrounding bourdon distilleries or the
history and parks of the surrounding area. It is in a neighborhood that we walked in, felt safe and people were friendly.
Matt really makes sure you feel welcomed, have what you need in the house and communicating with him is great. The kitchen is set up to prepare meals and eat in. The bathroom has everything you need, including shampoo, conditioner and soap. The bed is comfortable, a bit on the firm side but not bad, we slept well. All in all a wonderful stay."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very adorable, artful, comfortable, and well-appointed tiny cabin. Low-key, relaxed, and safe setting.

Matt is good people üòÑ. Thanks for a fantastic stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This tiny house is the best ever tiny house we stayed in. Matt is very kind and was very helpful with our late check in. There are so many thoughtful touches to the space. We only stayed for one night but we wish we had stayed longer. The surroundings are peaceful.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Simple, clean, value, easy to access. Matt+Lily ROCK!!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stop for a night. Was clean and comfortable, and had more than I expected for a tiny house. Met my needs for a place to sleep for a night, but if you‚Äôre planning on spending more time note that there wasn‚Äôt really wifi inside the house."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This was my 3rd time staying at Matt's cabin. The cabin and hospitality is consistently great. Highly recommended if you're in the Frankfort area.

We loved the fire pit and porch sitting during our stay. I highly recommend this location and would love to visit again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Stayed 11 days at Matt's tiny house, which is so much more than that. Creative, thoughtful and interesting, comfortable, well sized and great use of space, it is, as everyone else says, a hand-crafted marvel. You will love your time here. The Elkhorn Creek is a Kentucky treasure and a stones throw away. The setting is quiet and comfortable and the private tiny house is nestled in plenty of green space. Matt is super responsive and available, a truly nice guy and lives close by with his daughter and sweet dog. Easy access to the remarkably overlooked small city of Frankfort, a quick 25 minutes to Lexington and 45 to Louisville, the location is great. Don't miss the Buffalo Trace and Castle and Key distilleries just up the road. Not on the traditional Bourbon trail, they are still at the top of the list to visit. Heirloom restaurant, in the historic town of Midway, 15 minutes away, is an exceptional restaurant. You're going to love Matt's place and your experience in Frankfort."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,It's amazing!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little house in nice area. There is a swing on the front porch to sit on, and a private back yard with a table and chairs. There is a little bird house by the front door and the finch that lives there sang to my delight. Matt built the house himself and the craftmanship and design is spectacular."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tiny cabin is great. We loved the porch swing.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny cabin was a marvel to view. Really cool place that my wife and I enjoyed staying in. I‚Äôm a larger man and I have to admit, I had trouble negotiating the stairs and shower, but I managed. My wife is smaller and she kept making fun of me!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time staying in this tiny house! Our trip was centered around the Ark Encounter in Williamstown, KY. However, when our 12-year-old daughter saw this listed and was really excited to stay in it we knew that this would add to our trip. Even though we stayed during a few of the coldest days in Kentucky there were heaters to keep us warm. Also, there are hot plates for cooking-so nice! Would definitely stay there again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this adorable little rustic spot! We were looking for a place to camp but it was a little too cold so this spot was perfect. Had a nice bonfire in the private backyard. Ton of amenities, quiet spot and great hosts. I'd come back and stay for longer!"

We were grateful for the good coffee and the firewood he left near the firepit.. It was nice to be able to walk down to the creek at the end of the road. Highly recommend this place if your travels take you to Frankfort.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying in Matt's tiny house was like camping out with all the luxury's of home. He had everything at the house that anyone could need. Elkhorn Creek is only a few minute's walk from the house, and many activities are available within easy driving distance. Spending the weekend in the tiny house was pleasant, restful and relaxing.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Oh my goodness absolutely loved this tiny cabin. The attention to detail was not overlooked. Pictures and information do not do it justice! Was worried my husband would be to tall (6‚Äô3‚Äù) but no problems. Left wanting to build one of my own!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My two best airbnb experiences have both been at Matt's tiny cabin. We'll be back again, and if you're thinking about a stay here, I can't recommend it highly enough. Just a great place, amazing people, and an overall incredibly positive experience, both times!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome little place and a great location if you are doing anything in the general area. Really, this place is just as nice (probably even nicer) than the tiny homes you see on the TV shows. Super clean, very private. 1 minute walk to a beautiful scenic waterway.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Matt's tiny cabin was fabulous! My husband and I were so impressed at Matt's craftsmanship and attention to detail. I was afraid that the bathroom would feel really cramped, but Matt's thoughtful design made it really comfortable. I especially appreciated the skylight in the bathroom and the shower seat/ledge, which made the small space feel bigger and really functional. The outdoor space is gorgeous - both the front porch with the swing and the back dining area! We just didn't want to leave. If you appreciate natural beauty, craftsmanship, a bit of quirk, and you aren't a giant, I would highly recommend staying in this beautiful and cozy little home. We hope to be back for a longer stay in the future."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt goes above and beyond to make sure you feel welcomed, comfortable, and taken care of in this precious tiny cabin tucked away in the heart of Kentucky. It‚Äôs close to everything, but out of the way enough to make a peaceful and quiet getaway. I had a great time exploring Frankfort and would love to plan another visit!"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Peaceful setting and quiet place to run away to from the busy world.. the upstairs is made for people under 5""5. My husband and I are tall, didn't go without bumping our head. LOL. Very romantic getaway to spend quality though."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a couple...small but had everything we needed. Close to river for canoeing or kayaking
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have always wanted to stay in a tiny home but my husband wasn‚Äôt sure. When he saw Matt‚Äôs place, he said if he stayed in a tiny house, this is the one. When there, he raved as much as me! It was perfect! We had a drink on the patio under the lights and took a walk to see the swan. We got to meet Matt and one of his dogs. He was so welcoming! We loved our stay!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was beautiful. Just as advertised.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great place! Exceptionally clean, well-appointed to staying in to grill or cook, convenient location, beautiful space inside and out. Matt was a great communicator and very attentive without being intrusive. A lovely section of Elkhorn Creek is steps away and seems to have its very own swan! Perfect place to disengage from your technology and slow down. This was our first trip to Frankfort and staying here will certainly inspire a return visit."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is great spot close to everything !

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this tiny cabin! Pictures look good but don't do the place justice. Matt has done a great job with the place and is a thoughtful and attentive host. If it was secluded out in the woods it would be close to perfect, but in spite of having neighbors around it was quiet and peaceful and had some landscape design that made it feel more secluded. The water just down the lane is a real nice treat!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed staying in Matt and Lily‚Äôs tiny house. The three of us fit nicely in the house. The place is beautiful inside and out. They have thought of everything.

It‚Äôs on a quiet country road that dead ends into a beautiful Kentucky creek. It‚Äôs close to everything fun in Frankfort‚Ä¶we kayaked, went hiking, visited Buffalo Trace distillery and drank plenty of Kentucky bourbon. Matt is a top notch host, commutation was excellent and he made us feel right at home. We will definitely stay again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you want a truelly wonderful relaxing place to stay book this tiny home. Matt the owner is very hospitable and attentive to your needs.

Very user friendly."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was such a lovely stay! My two kids (6&8yrs) and I stayed overnight at the tiny house and it really delivered all the charm it promises! Perfectly private and cleverly built. Has all amenities needed and super comfortable. Back patio has a privacy fence and is set up for small bonfires for a relaxing evening.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hands down one of my favorite Airbnb experiences. The tiny house had everything we needed/wanted- plenty of amenities and a nice secluded stay.
We especially enjoyed the fire-pit. But the real star of the show was the tiny house itself. It was one of the coolest and functional places I've ever stayed at. Convenient lighting, plenty of outdoor space; it really was a joy to stay here!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"So cool! This tiny house has everything you need and it is wonderful, and has so many fun touches. Matt is a gracious host, we would definitely stay here again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"this is a ""tiny"" house, uniquely built and decorated by the owner. everything is small size, but easily accessed. great patio and barbecue area behind house. just down the road is the entrance to the river for kayaking, canoeing or fishing. lovely front deck with swing for relaxing. comfortable, clean and cute ! close to many distilleries by the way."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,if you want the experience of staying at a Tiny House then this is a wonderful place to experience.We wanted a place that was out of town and it is. there are neighbors and Matt lives next door but we acually felt secluded as there was no one on the one side. The house has so much charm and really cool features. loved the front porch and the closed off back area. Home had everything we needed. Had a an issue with the wifi but it wasn't a game changer. I would stay again if we lived closer. Such a cute adorable place!!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved The Long Pour! We were in town exploring bourbon country and Lauren‚Äôs place made us feel like we were living in bourbon country! Super clean, had everything we needed and more. The home felt very high end and luxurious! Couldn‚Äôt have asked for anything more!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in Frankfort! Walking distance to coffee shops, downtown / Main Street, and nearby restaurants. Airbnb was SUPER clean, interior very nice, with extremely comfortable beds! We really enjoyed our stay here, highly recommend."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren's place is absolute perfection! We used her immaculate and tasteful Airbnb as a home base while exploring the bourbon distilleries of Kentucky. Frankfort is an easy drive to Louisville, Bardstown and Lexington and all the distilleries in between. Coming back to Long Pour each evening was like coming home. It is in a peaceful and quiet location yet still close to downtown with bars and restaurants within easy walking distance. Lauren's attention to detail is second to none. She has thought of everything! Seriously, just pack your clothes and show up. Her thoughtful touches truly set her place apart from other Airbnb experiences we have had. We walked in to find a thoughtful hand-written note wishing us a happy anniversary and some local bourbon candies waiting for us in the fridge. She made numerous local recommendations that we took advantage of and she is immediate to respond to any messages. I would not hesitate to stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This is an inviting and comfortable space. It was a nice place to relax and recharge while in town for an event at Buffalo Trace. Lauren has thought of everything an overnight guest could want.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved out stay at the Long Pour! My husband and I spent several days going to local distilleries and loved coming back to Lauren's space to end the day. She gave us lots of recommendations for local restaurants within walking distance to the house. The space was quiet, clean, and welcoming. Would definitely recommend this place if you are traveling the Bourbon Trail. The house is centrally located to so many great distilleries within no more than a 20 mile drive."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Stayed with a friend and she commented how Lauren had anticipated everything a guest might need. Even had a spotify playlist ready in the bathroom which added to the vibe of the experience. The kitchen and master bedroom felt luxurious and every detail was considered.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay at Long Pour. The house was extremely clean and had a lot of small touches that made it feel so special. We enjoyed all of the bourbon themed decor. The shower was awesome! Lauren was very responsive and our stay was free of hassle. If we make another trip to Frankfort we will definitely stay here again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Long Pour was the perfect spot to crash after some distillery tours. It had a beautiful kitchen and bathroom (awesome shower!), comfortable beds/pillows and great location close to lots of great spots. The design of it was stylish and classy and we would recommend this spot for any small family traveling to the Frankfort area."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Long Pour exudes charm and classiness. Stylish, clean and had everything we needed for an overnight stay. Lauren was a fantastic host who accommodated our need for an early check-in and had thoughtful recommendations. Easy walk just a few blocks to some of Frankfort downtown businesses and restaurants. Would come back again. Note: Driveway fits two cars but backing out could prove challenging due to nearby retaining wall."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was by far one of our best Airbnb stays. It was short on our way to see family for the holidays but it was exactly what we needed for our family.
Everything was perfectly clean and exactly as described. The little details Lauren leaves are just the nicest touch.
The description about the shower is no joke and the beds were so comfortable!!
When we forgot all of our hanging clothes in the closet (oops), Lauren was quick to pick up the phone and call to let me know.
We would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed for the weekend and we felt very comfortable. Not only is Lauren a great host & communicates timely, but she also has a great aesthetic and taste in interior design & attention to little details that made this a luxury stay for the weekend for us. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was great with an amazing attention to detail. Quick walk to any bar or restaurant & great location to drive to the distillery‚Äôs. Will definitely stay there again when we come back to explore more of the bourbon trial!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,The house was perfect for our group. Would be tough for 5 couples as one bedroom has a bed too small for two people but we had 4 couples and a single. Worked great. Kitchen and all the amenities were fantastic. Game room with the pool table was our evening gathering place and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Check in and check out are a breeze. 100% recommend for couples or a family.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife used this as her getting ready location for her and her bridesmaids prior to our wedding. The uniqueness of this house is second to none and has amazing character. Everyone had amazing feedback. We will definitely be making a trip back!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,This home is beautiful and comfy! Everything was prestigious! Absolutely no complaints !
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was stunning. We had everything we needed for our large group. Only issue we had was all the lights are extremely dim. We wanted to play games on the dining table but the lighting was too low. Small price to pay for this gorgeous home.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Really enjoyed the property ‚Äî beautiful setting and house!
Convenient location to many bourbon distilleries and restaurants. Worked really out for our vacation. Highly recommended."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here for two nights with our five children and it was fantastic. Felt like an airbnb meets five star hotel. Beautiful private home but with hotel-quality touches like fully stocked bathrooms, cozy robes and slippers, and especially the high end concierge-level service from the management company. They could not have been more helpful and accommodating and responsive throughout our entire stay, even providing last-minute recommendations when some weather change some of our plans. The home itself is stunning and oozes Kentucky charm. You‚Äôre surrounded by tasteful, curated bourbon and horse themed decor. We had more than enough room with bedrooms to spare. The grounds are gorgeous and our kids loved running around outside and playing on the swing set. If you‚Äôre like me and obsess over picking the perfect airbnb for your trip, stop searching and book this one."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing house! Totally worth the money. Perfect for family/couple getaways, or bachelor party!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"The house is beautifully decorated, comfortable, and in a great location."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the best Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed at. We stayed here the weekend we got married at castle and key and we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to spend our first weekend as a married couple. Also a perfect place for me and the bridesmaids to get ready. Serene, impeccably decorated. We couldn‚Äôt ask for anything more!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Spectacular stay at Castle & Key. This property exceeded our expeditions. Every little detail has been thought of. The kitchen was fully stocked to prepare meals and the gathering space for playing pool was perfect. The beds were comfortable and the house is so spacious, our group of 8 fit comfortably. The host went above and beyond to make our stay special. They were very communicative and helped us with recommendations. We also highly recommend the Castle & Key tour. Our tour guide was so informative and the grounds are historic & absolutely beautiful.The best tour on our trip by far!! Thank you so much Kentucky Life and Castle and Key for a great first trip to Kentucky!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,We ran out of propane but within 1 hour we had 2 tanks delivered! TY!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the best time at The Field House! We spent the weekend playing pool, playing games and enjoying time together with our friends. The house was spacious and absolutely beautiful! We had everything we needed while we were there and the host was great with answering any questions we had. The kids loved playing outside and enjoyed the swing set. We can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"The Field House by Castle and Key exceeds expectations.The surrounding fields, pond and rolling hills give you a sense of tranquility...Look for geese and deer.
The home is beautifully decorated in a somewhat eclectic yet stately decor.There are numerous areas to relax and unwind individually or gather as a group.We spent hours on the back patio talking, laughing and sharing the day's selection of local bourbons as the sun set.
The kitchen is stocked with dishes and cookware needed to prepare and serve meals at the large gathering table in the dining area.The gas grill is helpfull in spreading out the duties.And the coffee bar area has a wonderful selection for carafe and K-cup prep.
The bedrooms are beautifully decorated and very comfortable.The baths are very clean... a full line of nice soaps and toiletries are provided.We recommend spacing out shower times to maintain water pressure and temp.
We loved our stay at the Field House and would definitely return for a visit."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Field House was great. The space was great and the furnishings were very nice and comfortable. However, upon arrival the floors had not been cleaned. There was lots of debris as well as dead bugs. However, the host was very responsive and sent out a cleaning person the next morning."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great time at the Field House. The home was beautiful and was perfectly placed between restaurants, golf, and Distilleries.
I wouldn't change anything about how our trip went, and it wouldn't have been the same without this booking."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We spent three days / nights at The Field House, and wanted to stay longer! The house was beautiful in all ways - the house and grounds are spectacular, and the furnishings and decorations inside made us feel right at home. It was the perfect place for hosting friends and business colleagues. We hired a local husband and wife chef team who prepared and served an amazing four course dinner for 12, and everyone raved about what an amazing evening they had."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and historic. Incredible renovation.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect property for our wedding weekend at Castle & Key Distillery! The Field House is a beautiful property, exquisitely decorated, and ideal for large groups or big families.

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place to spend a weekend! So charming and the views are so worth it! The creaks pop of such an old home just added to the charm.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"The house was perfect for the needs of our group. Perfect size, nice property, and excellent communication. I would certainly recommend to others when staying in the Frankfort area."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,We absolutely loved our stay at this house. It was a beautiful home with local decor and info throughout the home. Our group decided to get together in the Frankfurt area and everyone talked about making future trips back to this area and staying at this home anytime we do. Could not have asked for a better experience!! The hosts steered us in the right direction with their recommendations as well.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! It was clean, smelled fresh, and had all the space we needed for our stay. Would highly recommend! Thank you!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Will definitely stay again! Extremely nice home, very spacious and open, rooms were great for everyone. Easy drive to many of the distilleries in the area.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very accommodating and quick to respond to messages. The house was very nice and clean!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,very nice place. peaceful and private yet not far from what Frankfort has to offer
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"This was the BESTEST Airbnb that I have been to. This was the cleanest home and had that home away from home feel.
The home was very prepared with all the little extras (ie blankets, pillows, etc). The Keriug was a hit and the coffee was plentiful for our group.
I did not spend time in Franfort because I had a UK grad event in Lexington. However, even with the 35-40 minute drive, it is worth it.
The hosts were very responsive and easy to communicate with.
I highly recommend this home."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best experience we have ever had in an Air BNB. It was beautifully remodeled and had plenty of room for our family. Jason reached out to us before we traveled to answer any questions and he was extremely responsive. The property was beautiful and easy to find. It was definitely safe and private but not far from the interstate and restaurants. If we ever have to come back to this area, we hope to stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The Capital City Carriage House is THE place to stay Kentucky!
Our host Zachary, was very responsive and personable. The house was extremely clean and provided all necessary amenities. He truly has something special with this home, and we couldn‚Äôt be happier with our stay.
It is truly hard to find the words to explain the beauty and feeling you will experience when pulling up and seeing it for the first time and again when walking through the front door.
If you want to experience the feeling of being at the derby, touring a rickhouse, while being present in the nostalgia of historic Kentucky then you have found the place to stay. This house combines history with beautiful modern day amenities and comfort that will leave you wishing you could stay longer.
Thanks for having us,
Caleb"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Over the last 5 years we have had the pleasure of staying in many airbnb rentals, both domestic and international. The Capital City Carriage House was one of the best we've ever rented. It checked every box. Beautifully decorated and well appointed. You will not find a better airbnb rental in Frankfort or the surrounding area."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home! We had a great stay. Enjoyed the porch with music every night. Look forward to coming back again.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Our family enjoyed Zachary's place so much. All of the furnishings and textiles were very cozy and inviting. We will definitely stay in this place again!

We appreciated all he did to make our stay great!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Zachary was a great host and responded promptly to any questions. The house was beautiful and in a great location! This is the place to stay in Frankfort!!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Capitol Carriage House is enough of a reason to spend time in Frankfort! This was a perfect location for us while we were attending all of the Inaugural festivities. Couldnt have been any more convenient, spacious and quiet. The home is very well appointed and had everything we needed.
Wish we'd had enough time to spend time on the back deck! Zachary provided great communication and access very easy. Also, plenty of parking! We'll be back!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect location! We had a reservation to tour Woodford reserve at 3 and was able to check in before our tour. Walked to lunch and dinner. Would definitely recommend to others.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a charming space! We loved this beautiful place. Everything was as advertised. We felt right at home. Everything had a very intuitive layout. We enjoyed being able to walk to several restaurants and hangouts right on Main Street.
Craig was a very responsive host. We will certainly return!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place for downtown Frankfort. We enjoyed it.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing and cozy little get away in the heart of downtown. Our group took full advantage of the walkability and made sure to try all the stops. From the coffee shop down the street, the Bourbon Library (essentially downstairs and on the corner) and the diner we had for breakfast. Wished we stayed longer to fully enjoy the kitchen of the rental. Also within an Uber or short drive of some local distilleries as well. Great place, highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Craig and Amy were wonderful hosts! Beautiful space and amazing location. We will stay again the next time we are in town.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are an active adult this is your Frankfort accommodation! In the quiet end of downtown and an easy walk anywhere. Should you need anything, which is unlikely because Bing‚Äôs Downtown Guest Suite on Main has it all, Craig is lighting fast to respond!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location, responsive host. Walkable area full of history. Very close to amazing bourbon distillery!"
2023-12-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was beautiful, but the location is horrible. Maybe it was just a bad time to be there, but the endless noise from the street construction which should have been mentioned in the listing description and being constantly harassed for money when walking through the historic district by several of the local homeless people didn‚Äôt leave a very good impression. There was also an issue of an overwhelming sewer smell coming from the laundry room at the foot of the stairs as you enter the unit. Would love to give this place 5 stars and rave reviews, but just not able to based on this experience."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks for another great stay, Craig!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great home base centrally located on part of the bourbon trail. There are a number of distilleries that are with a 30 minute drive. Upon arriving to your ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù, you have a ton of shops and restaurants completely walkable to this location. It was bright, airy, clean and beautiful. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Extremely clean and neat. Very unique. Loved the location downtown. Would highly recommend this place.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, great location! Just a couple min from Buffalo Trace. Wonderful diner next for with awesome people and great food for breakfast! 1/2 block from a nice cigar/bourbon bar.. 1 block from great Italian dinner! Can‚Äôt wait for our next visit!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great central location for touring bourbon country! Very comfortable and spacious loft suite.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came in for a wedding. Craig's Place is a great downtown location! Several restaurants and shops are in walking distance. The apartment was just the right size for the 2 of us. The only complaint was that the mattress was too firm for our liking, but you can't please everyone on that! As others said if you have issues with stairs you may want to choose differently. It was Candlelight Weekend, which was a nice surprise that we enjoyed being in the middle of! If we're in the area in the future, we will definitely stay again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed our stay! We're in the area a couple times a year and will definitely stay here again!! Great communication!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apt was very clean and bigger than we thought. Host is quick to respond and accommodating. We have stayed at another property Craig has just around the corner which made us want to use the same host when visiting. Every time we return, we will continue to book with Craig. No complaints at all!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb was very clean and nice. It had everything we needed and restaurants were in walking distance. Would put this one in my top 5 out of all the places I‚Äôve stayed!! Definitely would recommend and would stay again if I‚Äôm in the area.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Was a random town to stay in - and was a lovely pick - and this apartment was a perfect stand-out location right in the middle of town!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our experience was excellent. The little communication we had was perfect, but everything was so smooth that really none was needed. There was normal city noise (a few times; not even much of the time) but I only noticed because we live in the country - and it was not a problem for us. Really convenient and a beautiful place. Thank goodness there was an iron and ironing board! Well stocked‚Ä¶ and really nice sheets ;)! Frankfort is a friendly, lovely small city and this apartment was perfect for our stay. Thank you!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location!! Plenty of great places to walk to. Loved the charm of the place.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Craig,
Thank you for hosting us at your place!!!Amazing Frankfort condo! In the heart of this adorable town filled with history, coffee shops, book stores, art shops, ice cream, great restaurants ( 50s Diner and Serafini Italian - exceptional cuisine‚Ä¶ a MUST) and of course Buffalo trace distillery!!! The home is impeccably clean and beautifully decorated. Comfortable furnishings. Responsive hosts and super easy check in and out.
We will be back!!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place! This was our 3rd trip to Frankfort to explore the Bourbon trail. We've stayed at other places in this same area of Frankfort and this one is our favorite. A couple min away from Buffalo Trace, and a short drive to Woodford Reserve, Castle and Key, and others. Once we were done with the distilleries for the day it's centrally located and within walking distance to a coffee shop, restaurants, an ice cream shop, and bars. Definitely will be looking for this place again when we come back to see more of the Bourbon Trail."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A perfect location in central Kentucky, close to so many great bourbon and other fun activities. The apartment is beautiful- even nicer than the photos, and is perfectly situated near walkable restaurants, but yet peaceful and quiet when it was time to sleep. And there is a free EV charger only about a block away! Wish we stayed longer, and used the space to explore all the central KY bourbon experiences- it was by far the nicest AirBnB we stayed at in the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was an ideal location for almost everything there is to do in Frankfort. Even though it's downtime, the city is calm at night. The place was well-equipped and the hosts were super responsive."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot, everything‚Äôs walkable"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a great time. The unit was right in the center of town giving us many walkable dining and bar options. Spotless place with a modern update. We‚Äôll definitely be back.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We love renovated, historic buildings; this apartment was beautifully updated while retaining it's original details. This location is just around the corner from the St. Clair shopping and entertaining district. On this Thursday evening the area was full of activity - people enjoying alfresco dining or gathered outside of the numerous pubs enjoying beverages and conversation. While preparing our dinner in our well-appointed kitchen, I enjoyed the view of the street activity from the huge, beautiful windows. I noticed single joggers going by as well. The area felt very safe. We spent the earlier part of the day hiking in Cove Spring Park, a late lunch at Wallace Station and a walk thru the Midway shopping area. As advertised, parking right in front of the unit was available. We recommend spending an hour or two walking this great area and we were happy to be able to stay in this comfortable apartment in the middle of it. Grab a coffee at
Engine House Coffee, & pastry at B's Bakery."

There was a small issue with the coffee maker, through no fault of his own, that Craig took care of within an hour! Place was clean, and exactly as advertised. Bed was very comfortable and the plentiful towels were thick and fluffy. It was great being able to do laundry so we had all clean clothes for the next leg of our vacation. Especially want to say thank you for the laundry detergent, coffee supplies and water bottles in the refrigerator. Very happy with this Airbnb. Thank you Craig! Will be sure to book again if we are ever back in the area and will be sure to tell any friends traveling to Frankfort to stay at your place!"

It felt both cozy and nostalgic. Comfy furniture and high ceilings and windows are a great combo.

So many places to eat in downtown Frankfort - I look forward to staying again to try more of the places within walking distance!"

We had a quick trip to Frankfort stock up our cellar and tour a couple distilleries. We planned on going out for drinks and dinner later, but the apartment was so comfortable and relaxing we got takeout and stayed in. Street is lively on Friday nights and neighborhood is friendly. 100% would recommend and would stay again.

There were many places to walk to, and Craig helped us with the parking. If you‚Äôre concerned about the noise from being on Main Street, it died down at night and was not an issue for us. Neither were the stairs to get up to our little abode.
This was the perfect place for hubby and I. Yep, we‚Äôll stay again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We are local residents of Frankfort but wanted to stay downtown during the Christmas parade and enjoy a quick weekend getaway with our twin boys. The downtown area has a cozy Hallmark feel and this 2nd story apartment had a wonderful view over Main Street. The apartment was clean and equipped with everything we needed. It was well-decorated while maintaining it's historic feel and charm. All of us felt right at home and loved the ambience at night.
We enjoyed several of the museums and we were within walking distance of two of the boys' favorite destinations: the children's area at the library and the playground at 2nd St. Elementary. It was a wonderful lazy weekend getaway.
The host was great with communication and outreach, exceptional value and experience for the price, we'll be back to enjoy other downtown events."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed stating at this location in a historical town. It fits right into a storybook kind of feel. Yet Friday night outside there's a but of livelihood, so just close the bedroom door and you'll be in a peaceful sleep. The kitchen was set up perfectly as an in-between hallway/bedroom and open living room. The modern amenities fit in well with the colonial style!"

There is a popular diner, a bakery and and amazing ice cream shop just a few doors down. Super clean and well stocked. We parked right in front overnight but if we were around during the day, we got free parking on the side of the Old Capital which was not far. Kitchen is outfitted well with all you need for cooking. Kroger is about 10 minutes drive away. Lots of stairs to get up to the apartment but was not a problem for us but you should be aware in case stairs are an issue. Hidden tough hiking trail to Fort Hill is behind the colorful apartment buildings at the end of the riverside park. Take stairs up and behind the complex. Another hidden trail is a ""rails-to-trails"" 0.8 mile walk that starts at the end of the street in front of the City Office Building. It goes to the university and back. Looks new. Free trolley takes you to the new capitol and around town and you get a free history lesson. Have fun!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet and comfortable, just what we were looking for"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another amazing stay. Craig and Amy are super hosts. We stayed at one of their other offerings a few months back and had the best time. As in my previous reviews, these locations are Gems, and I wish I could keep them a secret.
This unit is in the heart of downtown Frankfort. Plenty of cute shops and eateries line the streets below‚Äîa quick drive to many everyday conveniences such as Walmart and Kroger.
This suite is clean, comfortable, and quiet. Also, it is very relaxing and very private. Everything we could have needed was provided for above and beyond.
Excellent communication and excellent host, as always! When we are in town, Craig and Amy will always be our go-to super hosts for our lodging needs. Wow! Thanks again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay with Craig!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was great and very clean. Great location and bed was comfortable. Parking situation is not great but there is a parking garage a couple of blocks down that‚Äôs $1 an hour which isn‚Äôt bad if you just park there between the hours of limited parking.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an excellent air bnb option if you're in the downtown/Capitol Frankfort area. Very clean, extra clean even. Comfortable bed and plenty of pillows. They even provided some bottled water, breakfsst bars, and coffee pods. The kitchen is well stocked. And Craig is easy to communicate with - gets back with responses right away. One thing to remember - its a very old building and they've taken great care with the restoration. But its located on Main St. Theres a little traffic noise from time to time and M-F 8-4 cars need to be moved every 2 hrs. This was not a big deal for us. No inconvenience at all. I've just found managing expectations helps with the enjoyment factor 100%. Highly recommend Local Food Hub and Pizza (excellent Gluten Free cauliflower crust) Good Wood, and Kentucky Coffeetree Cafe. The last 2 are walking distance and all are so delicious!! You won't be disappointed. It was a great stay! Thanks again Craig!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfectly situated in charming downtown Frankfort. Craig has nicely preserved this piece of history. We have a newborn and the apartment was arranged so we could close off the baby in the bedroom and have the rest of the space to ourselves to watch TV or use the kitchen. It is a hefty flight of stairs to access the unit. note: the W/D is downstairs just inside the entry door. We had an issue with a slow drain and Craig was there within a couple hours to address it. We'll strongly consider staying here again if we are ever back in the area. Thanks again!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at ""On the Rocks."" Such a beautiful home and was very peaceful and quiet with no one around. We defiantly didn't want to leave we felt like we were at home. The cabin had everything that you needed and was very close to all the attractions. Pat was very friendly and very responsive when we needed help! We would defiantly stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can't wait to go back. Great house, great location. Loved the nice little extra touches. Six stars."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place! Very clean and comfortable. Excellent host with recommendations on food and things to do. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better host and place to stay!!! 5+ if that was an option!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"On the Rocks is a perfect location for taking in the Bourbon tours. The house is impeccable, very clean with lots to do. We will definitely stay here again. Pat was a great host and we recommend very highly."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"On The Rocks far exceeded our expectations! It is warm and inviting from the minute you walk in door. The house is very clean and Pat has included some really nice touches‚Ä¶.a coffee bar, snacks, fresh fruit, water and even frozen pizza for late night snacking! The location can‚Äôt be beat, especially if you are looking to be close to Buffalo Trace.
It was the perfect retreat after a long day. The gas fire place was so cozy, and the outside fire pit was perfect for enjoying an evening cocktail and watching a Kentucky sunset! The property is very private, our only visitors were a flock of wild turkeys. We will most definitely be booking Pat‚Äôs place again! Thank you for sharing your home with us!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for a few nights while visiting Kentucky and exploring the bourbon trail. The location was super convenient! It was just about 5 minutes from Buffalo Trace and fairly central to the other distilleries we wanted to visit. There was a decent amount of food close and the historic downtown of Frankfort was really beautiful. The home was easy to find, easy to check-in, and very clean. We enjoyed using the fireplace at night and the king-sized bed was a bonus! Pat was super friendly and very proactive in his communication. He even got the house ready for us for an early check-in without our requesting which was so nice! We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend this home for anyone looking for a place to stay for the Bourbon Trail!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot, amazing home. Little gestures around the house they didn‚Äôt have to do. Would recommend to anyone looking in that area. Best host I‚Äôve had for a place and will definitely use them again in the future. Thanks guys!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My crew came to Kentucky for the Bourbon Trail, but what we found was a new home away from our homes. The photos shown don't do it justice, this cabin is gorgeous and there's so much space throughout the entire cabin. Being 6 minutes from Buffalo Trace was one of the many perks of the location. I cannot wait to visit 'On The Rocks' again, in the near future."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Albert & Pat‚Äôs cabin was notably one of my best airbnb stays. My mom and I spent Christmas here and had an unforgettable time. The home is very cozy, was beautifully decorated with holiday decor (including a tree!) and incredibly immaculate. The kitchen has everything you need to cook a variety of dishes. The large size washer and dryer were so convenient.
I cannot say enough kind things about the thoughtfulness of Albert. He knew I was flying in from out of state and not only allowed me to have gifts delivered to him directly, but he wrapped them impeccably. He definitely went above & beyond and it was greatly appreciated.
I felt very welcomed during my stay and would recommend it to anyone wanting a slightly excluded getaway."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful, peaceful home! I was in town for work, and couldn't have asked for a more relaxing, homey, quiet place to return to at the end of the day. The fireplace was especially nice to relax by with a book after a long day working out in the cold. The kitchen is fully-equipped, allowing me to prepare my own meals right at home.
I will certainly add Pat's place to my personal favorites, and hope to return one day when I'm not working, just to relax! I highly recommend reserving your next stay in the Frankfort area here!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quite a remarkable set up for this wonderful Airbnb. The hosts have thoughtful touches all throughout. The coffee set up was appreciated! This home was spotless. The surroundings were peaceful. The host was attentive and proactive with instructions, even gave a recommendation for dinner which we gladly followed! I have never quite felt more ‚Äúat home‚Äù away from home than I did here. I would highly recommend and look forward to staying again in the future."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great property for a Bourdon tour weekend! There is a reason the owners are super hosts. They went above & beyond with extras to make us feel welcome and comfortable even when presented with an unexpected tornado warning. I would highly recommend this property and the hosts!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was so wonderful to arrive in the evening (almost 9:30pm) and find the home beautifully decorated for Christmas. So delightful!!

So convenient to Frankfort. We will definitely be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place and hosts. We actually cut our excursions short so we could take advantage of the great house, setting, and amenities. Would definitely go back and recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this house! It was beautiful, immaculate, and very comfortable (including the beds). Extremely convenient to anything in or around Frankfort, reasonable drive to go to Lexington or Louisville. Many nice amenities, big and small... nice deck, porch furniture, grill, fire pit with chairs, nice thick bath towels, bottled water in the fridge, to name a few. We weren't really there long enough to do any real cooking beyond morning coffee, but there seemed to be plenty of utensils/ cookware, should anyone want/ need to cook."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"""On the Rocks"" was the best airbnb we have stayed in! The house was so homey and comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked with cookware and utensils. The hosts even provided little snacks and coffee pods. The bathrooms were clean and spacious. The bedrooms were cozy, especially the one with the electric fireplace. The fire pit and provided firewood made it easy for us to relax with some great conversations and drinks after a long day of exploring Frankfort and the surrounding cities and distilleries. If you don't stay here you truly are missing out! The hosts are very responsive and accommodating. We are definitely coming back for another stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Two couples shared this lovely home. Wow, it was so perfect for touring around the Bourbon trail. We were going to stay closer to Louisville, so glad we didn't. The setting is quiet, & peaceful. You can enjoy the views from the oversized porch. The owner was very responsive. The home is well decorated, and clean. Chilly night, just flick the fireplace on. We really enjoyed this rental."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely love this place. It‚Äôs so close to everything Buffalo Trace,Woodford,Castle and Key . The inside and outside are beautiful.

Our host was extremely helpful with communicating events and recommendations during our stay. We had a lovely time. The house was perfect and next time we are in the area, we would love to stay here again"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is difficult to put into words just how nice this Airbnb was, from the moment we walked in the front door! The house smelled so fresh and clean and inviting!
Albert and Pat replied very quickly and patiently to every question I asked. They gave great recommendations for restaurants and things to do.
The beds were very comfy and the house was stocked with soooo many ‚Äúextras‚Äù that are not listed.
We had a wonderful time drinking coffee on the front porch, playing games on the screened porch and grilling out on the side porch. We WILL be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect. Stayed there while we toured buffalo trace, woodford, and Angels Envy distillery. Well maintained, clean, and peaceful home. Would definitely come back here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay worked so well with our travel plans. And what a great find! The attention to detail and the comfort made our stay delightful.

We would highly recommend and would love to return!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic attention to detail!
Beautiful and peaceful property.
This is such a warm and comfortable home.
The next time we‚Äôre in the Frankfort area there is no doubt where we will stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,They have thought of everything. If you need it - the house has it. Great value. Great hosts. House is perfect for a mini getaway or longer. We enjoyed our stay and the hosts were super responsive.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was awesome. It has everything you could possibly ask for to have a great experience. Peaceful location with wrap around deck for relaxation, grilling etc. Completely comfortable, clean and stocked with all that you may need in the interior. Just a few minutes drive to Buffalo Trace Distillery. look forward to staying here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Pats house. It was very quiet even though not far away are restaurants, stores etc
The house was very welcoming and had everything you could possibly need including coffee and everything you need for your coffee. Granola bars and oatmeal, fresh fruit and honey buns. Plenty of towels. Toilet paper and paper towels, detergent to wash clothes
The beds were comfortable with plenty of pillows extra blankets etc"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,An amazing getaway spot located in historic frankfort ky. The cabin pictures dont do it enough justice. The cozyness alone has us wanting to come stay the weekend again asap.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location with a remote feel but quick access to town. The home is extremely clean and well stocked with plenty of nice touches. The hosts were all quick to respond and were very flexible with check in/out. A 5-star rental experience!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great gem for a fun weekend getaway with some friends. Has all the little things you would find in your own home. Close to many Bourbon distilleries and fun attractions. Pat and Albert are incredibly helpful and great hosts.
Would return and recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at ‚ÄúOn The Rocks ‚Äú! The setting was private and quiet. The house is comfortable and lovely with everything we needed. Great AC so that temps were comfortable in the summer. The bedrooms were spacious and comfortable. Very clean and all light/fan switches were labeled which added to the ease of being in the space. Lots of little touches to make guests comfortable.
I enjoyed the porch settings the most and they were a big part of why I chose this location. Sitting on any of the porches and watching a storm or listening to the birds was my favorite thing.
Great location with easy access to Frankfort and Buffalo Trace was 5 minutes away.
Pat was very friendly and helpful. His communication was very proactive and everything was easy.
We wish we could have stayed longer and highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you are looking for a place close to Buffalo Trace look no further! Highly recommend! The hosts have thought of everything. You can tell that they have thought about what would be helpful if they were traveling and staying there. Cannot say enough about this place. Great for a couples trip! Thank you so much! We will be back!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This home and location are lovely! We enjoyed our time here‚Äîcomfortable beds and furniture, very clean and updated. We used the porch a lot, even had 3 deer visit in the back on both mornings. The host had snacks (including fresh fruit!) when we arrived late in the evening, which was so nice and thoughtful! I highly recommend staying here, can‚Äôt say enough good things about it."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family fell in love with this place. Great scenery and plenty of deer walking around. Highly recommend! Can‚Äôt wait to come back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down one of the best Airbnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever stayed in. The location is great, just a few minutes from Buffalo Trace distillery and downtown Frankfort. The place was clean, beautiful and incredibly peaceful. We had deer walking just outside the porch morning and evening. The hosts were easy to get a hold of, very friendly, and gave us lots of helpful info about the surrounding area. Plus all the amenities you could need inside and then some. Will definitely be back for our next trip on the Bourbon Trail!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,On The Rocks is the best AriBNB we have ever stayed at! Clean and has everything you may need during your stay. Such a beautiful & peaceful location! We will definitely be back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This oasis in KY was perfect for unwinding and enjoying horse/bourbon country. The home feels like it is in the country, but only a few minutes to downtown Frankfort and the KY River. The owners thought of all the small creature comforts like coffee, popcorn, ramen, fruit, chocolates, and even a few frozen pizzas. Our 10-hour drive from DC left us tired and really not wanting to venture out to a restaurant for dinner. Ramen, fruit, and a few snacks we had on-hand was the perfect dinner. The porches on 3 sides of the home were fabulous to relax and soak up some nature. All the communications and instructions were spot-on. For a new rental, the owners got everything right. We will be back. Thanks for giving us a home away from home. 5-Star."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing. Pat and the other host are super responsive and host an amazing place. Clean, organized, and they provide all the necessities. Great location, less than 2 miles from Buffalo Trace. We WILL be back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful place. We were excited to be the first. The scenes from the patios were amazing. The house was decorated beautifully.This was the first time Pat and Albert have done an Airbnb. Everything was perfect. With the snacks and quick response to me asking for restaurant recommendations. Sitting on the patio at night was awesome. Loved talking with Albert and Amy hearing stories about this place. Definitely would stay again and already booked a next time Thank you The Mcmillins and Leonti
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,The bed was super comfy and this is a very cute place convenient to a quaint town and a few good diners.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little place, very clean & close to the capital. The hall way can be loud if there are a lot of people going in an out, but everyone else in the building was very respectful. I would definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,good
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"stayed here a few times in the last couple of weeks, always a nice stay, easy to get in and out, clean, comfortable and responsive hosts"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The apartment at the historic distillery was light‚Äô-filled and well appointed. Perfect location within walking distance to historic Frankfort, the river, museums and restaurants."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I was totally comfortable and so relaxed. It's a beautiful location. I love how the light was coming in thru the windows, with a cup of coffee. The view was a tree with fall colors, which was amazing to see. There was no noise from others or outside. Frankfort downtown has so many stores like coffee shops, books (new and old) stores, crafts, wine shops, restaurants, architecture like the Capital, parks, etc. Outside has more commercial stuff like Cracker Barrel. a sweet little town. I differently recommend coming to this Air B&B and town for a relaxing time."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,2nd time staying!! Obviously a great place to come back time and time again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great communications in the beginning. Joseph even held a room for me. The room was fresh and clean with all the things I needed during my stay. I was there almost three weeks though. and it would have been nice to have fresh towels and to replenish supplies like trash bags or toilet paper. Instead those became extra expenses for me.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Our favorite place to stay in Frankfurt.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Me and my partner had a great stay. Joseph was very flexible about check in times. Right near the capitol and a short drive or walk to downtown!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I've seen a few reviews complaining about the kitchens... I only stayed in one unit, but it had absolutely everything I needed and was quite nice. I suppose if you were cooking for a family of 4 it may be a little small. It get's a little warm in the summertime for the one AC unit, but that's the flip side of all the window and wonderful natural light. If you close the doors at night you will be quite comfortable. The mattress was lovely too! And though it is an older building, you're be surprised at the noise level... you really can't hear others too much while you're in your place. Out in the hall you can, but just fine inside."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a little snafu upon check in where the front door was being painted and to go around the back but the host was extremely responsive and made everything work out wonderfully. The location is perfect and ideal for Downtown Frankfort. It‚Äôs much closer than any of the hotels. The area is very safe and there is lots of parking. Some other folks in reviews said there was noise because it‚Äôs essentially an apartment but I didn‚Äôt find that to be the case at all. Everyone was quiet and respectful and the host was such a pleasure to deal with. The room is spacious and bright with every amenity you could want. I cannot recommend this place highly enough!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice neighborhood, good launch point for the bourbon trail. Host was prompt at responding to questions and comments. I‚Äôd definitely consider returning."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little apartment with a large bedroom area, a well-appointed kitchen and a decent bathroom. The host was accessible but we only needed to reach out when our lock codes had not come through before check in. Be aware that there are two floors and steps are involved getting from the entrance to both floors. All in all a top notch stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was comfortable and relaxing. The apartment was spotless, charming, cozy and restful. I will stay again. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great modern space in a quiet part of town! Close to historic downtown and Buffalo Trace. Highly recommend this rental.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing! My wife and I stayed here while selling our home and buying a new one that's awkward homeless time. Georgeanne was amazing! so helpful while we stayed. the space is just perfect. kitchen has everything you need for a good meal, and you're within minutes of any store you could want. I would highly recommend staying here if you're visiting Frankfort! Thank you for the wonderful stay. We felt home away from home!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This airbnb was exactly what we needed! We were able to book for just 1 night. It was clean and tidy. Perfect for 2 people.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"A cute and very well-maintained place to stay in Frankfort! The kitchenette was adorable. Great location for walking to downtown or driving to visit distilleries. For those who are light sleepers, note that it's fairly easy to hear renters in the other units (it's an old building, so this wasn't terribly surprising)."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The host was great
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place in a quiet neighborhood ! Would definitely stay again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of our best airbnb experiences yet! Top notch host. Place was comfortable and clean in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood within walking distance to downtown, the capital and other Frankfort sites. Definitely recommend!!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice base from which to launch visits to visit local distilleries and horse country. Walkable neighborhood with beautiful homes and historic sites. (Also a candy factory tour.) Easy walk to downtown restaurants and museums. For those who don‚Äôt want to walk there‚Äôs a trolley route in certain months.

From the Speakeasy room to the comfortable beds, big TV, and furniture, to the great Bourbon Trail location, this spot was ideal for my bourbon-focused bachelor party weekend with my groomsmen! It is the perfect place to drink great whiskey and be with great people. I‚Äôd love to stay again in the future! Cheers."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful stay for our party of 3 couples. The fire ring in the backyard was great (pickup a bundle at Lowe‚Äôs for each night) with the beautiful weather. We also thought the speakeasy was really awesome. We spent many evenings sipping bourbon from our days discoveries. Would definitely recommend as a home base for your bourbon hunting adventures. Thanks Chase for letting us use your home to build memories with our lifelong friends!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great property including amazing backyard. Would definitely book again

Spacious home, great floor plan, lots of bathrooms so getting ready in the mornings was a breeze. We enjoyed our morning coffee in the backyard. Very quiet neighborhood. The speakeasy was over-the-top great! The furnishings and attention to details in this home are what makes us want to return. All of us would stay again.

The house was nicely appointed and had many cool touches. The secret room was definitely the highlight. We spent most of our time in there hanging out. It was inviting, cozy and cool."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chase‚Äôs place: Van Winkle‚Äôs Secret/Speakeasy was a very nice place to stay. A small group of us traveled to Frankfort, KY to do some of the bourbon trail. Chase‚Äôs place was the perfect location and had all that we needed. Chase communicated quickly and will give you solid recommendations on food or whatever else you need. The hidden room and the outdoor area were or favorite spots."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Van Winkle‚Äôs was great. Just down the street from the capital. Friendly neighborhood. Large relaxing backyard. The home is nicely decorated. Bedrooms are decorated with a theme. Beds are comfortable. You are close to everything in Frankfort. New kitchen appliances. The Speakeasy room is fantastic. We relaxed with a drink every night. We went to buffalo trace distillery for a tour and some good bourbon. Your was free. Keeneland race track is close by. Castle key distillery is a must. Jeptha Creed distillery is fun ( kid friendly) and has good food. Ricardo‚Äôs restaurant in Versailles is good. Hoggy‚Äôs ice cream is delicious. We visited bardstown, Georgetown, Louisville and the backroads are beautiful. Kroger‚Äôs grocery is within 4 miles. Visit The farm kitchen in Shelbyville for breakfast or a burger at lunch. We bought great steaks there and grilled out on night. We highly recommended this place for a trip to remember."

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"In short... book it!
I have stayed in many AirBnBs over the years... Chase's house is one of the very best. First, as every other review states... the hidden speakeasy is worth staying here. The late nights when we arrived back from the inauguration, we found ourselves laughing and hanging out there.
The decor throughout the house was fantastic. I loved the living room furniture and would buy it myself for my home! The beds were temperpedic with plenty of towels and extra blankets. This is something you often don't find in rentals.
I must add, Chase worked to get us an early check-in, making it so much more convenient for our group. The check out process - basically you can just leave. We worked to clean up but it was nice that it was not a stressor
We were there in December and were unable to enjoy the outdoor space...nevertheless it looked fantastic!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Chase was an excellent host. Not only was Chase responsive but provided great recommendations on places to go and things to do. The house was a perfect for our family of six. It had everything we needed. The speakeasy room was a treat.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our time at Van Winkle‚Äôs Secret. Spent a lot of down time in the secret room. With this being a bourbon tour trip the house just went along with our theme. Great location. Walking distance to Rebecca Ruth‚Äôs chocolate, I highly recommend going there. Short drive to Buffalo Trace along with Castle and Key."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great central location for the Bourbon Trail. Just 7 minutes from Buffalo Trace. Kentucky Bourbon Boys tour company picked us up right from the house- highly recommended. The river cruise was relaxing and informative. Great experience all around! The house was a good resting spot with a fire pit in the back for a relaxing evening after exploring all day.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,We just returned from a stay at Chases Van Winkle Speakeasy. What a great location between Lexington and Louisville. On trend furnishings and a secret speakeasy in the back that leads to a park like backyard with fire pit. The linens and beds were super comfy.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Chase was one of the absolute best hosts I have worked with! And we have stayed at ALOT of air b and B‚Äôs! He was quick with his responses, offering recommendations for local places, he was SUPER friendly, and the house was even better than we imagined!!!! I can not recommend this house enough! It was everything we wanted and more!!! We will be back!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location! The speakeasy room was as awesome as you can imagine! Highly recommend this to anyone!

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"A Hidden Gem: The Ultimate Bourbon Experience!
If you're a fan of both exceptional accommodation and fine bourbon, look no further than this listing. This place is an absolute treasure trove for anyone seeking a unique and unforgettable experience.
The rooms are beautifully furnished, with attention to every detail (golf themed room, music/record themed room, and a horse racing room). But what truly sets this Airbnb apart is the hidden bourbon speakeasy. Tucked away behind an unassuming door, you'll find yourself transported back in time to the era of Prohibition. We spent most of our free time in this room, sipping on whiskey from the local distilleries and playing games.
We also loved the HUGE backyard and the walkability into downtown Frankfort. There is an adorable bakery and coffee shop a few blocks away that we visited each morning."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We were extremely pleased with the home as it was comfortable and clean. We did have 7 people, though only 6 dining chairs. Definitely not a deal breaker as we could use a stool. Loved the secret room. The backyard is so spacious. We played cornhole and enjoyed the patio. A nice neighborhood to take a walk in. All our venues were close by!!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We had an awesome stay! Highly recommend. Our group loved hanging out in the bourbon room and outside. Close to lots of great restaurants and distilleries.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay. The location was ideal for exploring the Bourbon Trail. The house was beautifully decorated and the kitchen was well stocked. We enjoyed sitting outside on the patio and around the fire pit in the evenings.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend Chase‚Äôs place and look forward to staying there again! We loved the house, especially the speakeasy room! We traveled with another couple and spent evenings having cocktails in the speakeasy room and by the firepit. The neighborhood is quiet and the location is very convenient (within a mile of downtown) especially if you‚Äôre doing the bourbon trail. Chase was very responsive and provided lots of information about the area and recommendations for dining and distilleries to visit. If you enjoy cigars don‚Äôt miss the Cap City Cigar Bar (downtown) and try the locally made cigars by Kentucky Gentlemen Cigar Co. We‚Äôll definitely be returning!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Chase‚Äôs house was fantastic. It was perfect for our group of five. Within an drive hour of several bourbon distilleries. The house is nicely updated and well appointed. The furniture and beds are comfortable and clean. The kitchen has new appliances and all the glassware and utensils we needed. This house definitely lived up to our expectations. The house actually matches what you see in the listing photos. I can‚Äôt say that about every Airbnb I‚Äôve stayed in, but Chase‚Äôs house is the real deal. The backyard was huge and perfect for our group to hang out and relax in after a long day of touring bourbon distilleries. The speakeasy room is a cool touch and was a nice place for kicking back with some drinks and chatting. This house is a real gem. I would gladly stay at Chase‚Äôs house again. If you‚Äôre looking to stay in the Frankfort area, this house is a great choice."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent home, great host! Perfect location for us since it is so close to distilleries. Had everything we needed, and we loved the outdoor space.

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,We all fell in love with this house. We built a fire out back and listened to music the first night. The backyard is wonderful. Part of our group went to the Kentucky Horse Park and part went to the Ark - it was a great location for both - we didn‚Äôt have enough time to see and do everything we wanted to so we will be back!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,The backyard is a real bonus. Perfect group house with plenty of bathrooms.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Chase's pad and spent entirely too much time in the Van Winkle secret bourbon room! Definitely gave me some inspiration for a future room in my next house! We would definitely stay there again and this was a good home base for us during our our trip to Kentucky for a distillery tour and bourbon hunting adventure. One of the things that also stood out for us was the fact that every room had a king size bed, so the comfort level was at maximum for everyone staying in the house. Thanks again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, central and private. Tremendously helpful and responsive host. Highly recommended."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I took a trip down to visit some of the local distilleries, and I must say this place was perfect. Upon arrival, Chase was very clear with his communication, and it was easy to find. Our entire stay was very peaceful and we enjoyed a nice fire with a few glasses of bourbon. The pictures for the speakeasy don‚Äôt do it justice. That was one of the best parts of the trip for us. Thanks for hosting Chase!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Immersed in Kentucky's history, this house was part of our experience and every corner invited discovery. We are already planning to return with new friends! From location to important details, this property knocked our socks off! The house is perfect for groups with spacious areas to gather and cozy spaces for intimate conversation. When enjoying the comfy living room it's easy to hear who's winning euchre at the table and when dessert (because vacation) is ready in the kitchen. The 3 king bedrooms (with super comfortable bedding) mean every room is an owner's suite! The backyard is awesome- private and lovely, we lucked out with the weather. AND THEN...you find a secret door, and step into grown-up Narnia! The host is very knowledgable and helped us curate our experience.
When traveling, we always look for a home away from home. This place felt like home and writing my name on the wall (at host's request) solidified that feeling. Can't wait to return ""home""!"

Right in the heart of downtown Frankfort. Walking distance to all the cool restaurant's and bars (Serafini, Bourbon on Main, Goodwood, Capital Cellars, Hoggys, ETC). Just down the way from the Riverwalk Trail and Capital buildings. Even had a garage spot for our car. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in Frankfort. Great rental for a great price in a great spot! Wish I could give this place 6 stars!
Thank you again Aaron!"

There were a variety of restaurants within walking distance (we did not walk anywhere due to rainy weather and a busy schedule, but I would have been comfortable walking in the area).
This house is more than 100 years old. Probably closer to 200 years, actually! It is updated with every modern convenience and still maintains its historical charm. It was perfect for our group of four adults.
We loved it and would absolutely stay again!"

Beds were comfortable with quality linens.
Lovely walks along the river or in town."

We had a busy few days so did not stay in the house much but for the limited time we were there it was lovely, very clean, and beautiful decor. The beds were extremely comfy. We highly recommend Kentucky Life.
House location was outstanding! Very close to Buffalo Trace. We did drive to Limewater (quick drive) for dinner which was absolutely amazing!
Downtown Frankfort is cute, however, it is very small and only has a few places to eat. I only mention this for individuals who might not have a car - the town is walkable and completely doable from the house, however, if you are looking for more dinner options you will need to Uber. Most eateries and bars close fairly early. We stayed during the week so that may have something to do with the hours."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful property! Well stocked kitchen with all the basics for meal prep! Decor was lovely, the entire place spotless, and the entire property was delightful! So much within walking distance! I would love to stay again if I'm ever in the area again!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was wonderful. Great location for doing some distillery tours. And we really enjoyed walking around the city checking out coffee shops, restaurants, and bars. The house was immaculate and made us feel at home.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures and proximity to Buffalo Trace and shops/restaurants are what sold my husband and I, but this property is so much better in person! Beyond the aesthetics was the attention to detail geared towards our comfort which was very much appreciated - comfortable beds and pillows, good quality hangers in closets, and super soft face cloths in the bathroom that I will be ordering for myself.

2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"This place is absolutely darling! The owner worked hard to renovate this house into a warm, inviting, safe environment with everything you could possibly need in a home away from home. We were highly impressed with the responsiveness of the owner of the home for a situation that occurred when we first checked in. It's within walking distance to a beautiful park that runs along the Kentucky River, and within walking distance to bars and restaurants. I only wish we had been able to spend more time there, but if we're back this way again, we will certainly try to stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay. Mattresses were super comfortable. Nice quiet neighborhood.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don‚Äôt be fooled by the picture - there‚Äôs lots of room in this seemingly small house. It‚Äôs a shotgun design, with a long corridor, closets and bathrooms on one side and living room, bedrooms and kitchen on the other. Nice hardwood (original?) floors, but otherwise everything looks new and in pristine condition. Rare in our experience to find a two bedroom house with two bathrooms - worked perfectly for us. The bedrooms are spacious and comfortable, as is the living room that has a big flat screen TV for streaming. Kitchen is on the smaller side, but everything you need is there. The neighborhood is very quiet (on the edge of an industrial area, so a little concerning on initial approach), with interesting older houses. We had a pleasant, restful stay here, and would choose this house again if available on our next trip through Frankfort."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect location in Frankfort! The home is beautifully appointed and private. It‚Äôs close to everything. Definitely walkable to everything. We will be back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the cutest and most convenient place that I have ever stayed!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great little place near the Buffalo trace distillery and right in downtown Frankfort. The house was in a very historic area and was well worth it in every way. The management was quick to respond for any questions we had.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great quiet getaway in secluded location, well appointed cabin for those who want to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life and recharge in the comfort nature provides. Morning coffee on the back porch is a must at this cabin. Responsive and gracious hosts, we felt welcome on the farm. Thanks!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As someone who lives in a big city, staying at The Highgrounds was exactly what I was looking for to get away for awhile The cabins are located on a beautiful sprawling farm located 15 minutes outside Frankfort. The Ironwood cabin was cozy, fitted with a kitchen, full bath, hot water, WiFi and giant windows so you can take in all of the beautiful scenery the farm offers. Favorite part was fire pit at sunset watching the lightning bugs roll in. Also, Buffalo Trace is a short drive down the road."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Highgrounds cabin was a remarkable stay. The pictures do not do this place justice!
The farm/location was easy to find and get to. The cabin is new and modern and very relaxing. We had dinner on the deck overlooking the ridge and with other beautiful views of the farm.
Another bonus is that it‚Äôs located very close to west 6 farm and brewery where there were alot of outdoor activities that were really family friendly.
Our stay felt like a wonderful way to get away from the busyness of life but close enough that we did not have to drive hours to have the experience. We can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot recommend Highgrounds enough. The property is gorgeous: ponds, bluffs overlooking the Kentucky River, cute cows, stellar sunsets. Everything was easy to find and use, and the cabins are next door to West 6th Farm. Our family of four enjoyed the beautiful cabin and the many activities and restaurants nearby."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"William‚Äôs property in Frankfort was amazing! When we arrived on the property we were greeted by an incredibly serene landscape and perfect view - as well as the cutest farm doggie üê∂
The cabin itself was cozy, charming, and impeccably clean, offering everything we needed for a comfortable stay.
William went above and beyond to ensure we felt welcome and provided us with helpful local tips.
This property is truly breathtaking and we really enjoyed waking up and having our coffee out on the front deck each morning.
Highly recommend this Frankfort retreat!"

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Excellent place to stay! Loved the open kitchen and living. Nice space to prepare meals and relax with family. Close to some of the distilleries if you‚Äôre interested in the bourbon tour.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed the space and location of bnb. It fit our needs with the amount of restrooms to keep us all (8 guests) relieved üòå There were clear instructions and easy to follow rules.

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay in this really nice home in a peaceful, safe neighborhood. Our top priority at the home was to cook dinner and enjoy a few cocktails while playing family games. The home‚Äôs kitchen/living area was great for this purpose (though the high top table/stools were not at all comfortable so we moved to the smaller round table). The fireplace added a nice, cozy ambiance!
Our rooms were clean, nicely furnished, and comfortable. The bathrooms were also very nice.
We would stay here again and hope to make it back to the area again."

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Our group of 4 couples thoroughly enjoyed our 4 night stay! We each had our own bedroom, but had a nice living area and kitchen to share. We picked this October weekend for the MIZZOU/Kentucky Football Game (Mizzou won üòä).
With this central location we were able to stop at numerous Bourbon Distilleries. A special highlight was being able to hit Buffalo Trace every morning for their featured daily Bourbon. We scored all 4 during our stay. It is less than a 10 minute drive.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute older home on the river with a nice back patio area. We enjoyed the view from the house. The house was cozy and really interestingly decorated with period antiques which felt really authentic.
It had starter detergent and toiletries as well as a very well stocked kitchen. Appliances appeared new and clean.
I would recommend this house to families, couples or younger people, but not necessarily elderly people unless very fit because the floors have settled in places (as is customary in old houses) and this may be a tripping hazard.
We appreciated the fans in every room and the street was very quiet and never heard or saw another person.
Convenient to Lawrenceburg, Versailles (we went to brunch at the KY Castle), Lousiville/Churchill Downs (we went to see the KY Derby). Or Lexington.
Also 1 hr from The Ark Encounter.
Comfortable beds and pillows.
The whole place was a nice mix of old and modern :)"

The location is perfect if you're looking to walk to downtown Frankfort or go out exploring the distilleries. We absolutely will stay here again when we come back to Frankfort. Just a great place.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the cutest little place! It was very clean and decorated perfectly. It was the perfect location. A short drive to many restaurants but still tucked away to provide that disconnect from your busy life! We were less than 10 minutes from Buffalo Trace and able to stop in for their daily releases. Will definitely be going back and recommending to friends!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I very much enjoyed staying at Jason & Toni's loft...so much in fact that this is my second visit in a month! Great attention has been taken with the decor and without a doubt, the place feels cozy as soon as you walk inside. The sofa is ultra comfortable and a great place to relax while listening to music on the record player. The kitchen has about anything you would need including dish/laundry/dishwashing soap, paper towels, aluminum foil/ziplock bags, vinegar/spices etc. There is a lot of light and it was fantastic having a full size washer/dryer. The linens are good quality-thick towels and cotton sheets. Someone commented that the toilet paper is thin but there was a high quality version during my stays. The bedroom has blackout curtains and it would be easy to sleep in for those coming from another time zone. Wifi works well and there was never a disruption. Toni & Jason have always been quick to respond and it is obvious they have put much time into making the stay a great one."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5 star experience all around! Great location, beautiful place, easy parking and Jason and Toni are great. Look forward to visiting again soon."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I loved the space. It is one of our favorites. We felt right at home and would certainly stay here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay! The place was very clean and cozy! We would stay again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great stay! The accommodations were wonderful.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An excellent place to stay if you‚Äôre in the Frankfort area. Extremely nice and well kept place has everything a couple needs. Highly recommended!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jason and Toni‚Äôs unit and Jason‚Äôs effort as host deserve more than the allowable 5-star score. The welcome basket with popcorn, Ale8 sodas, and more was a great introduction to our stay. We loved the brightness of the apartment and the spaciousness of each room. Jason works hard to ensure his guests‚Äô comfort, from the large living room sofas to the sleep-inducing bed to the excellent shower with thick, cushy towels. Jason was very responsive to our questions about the area and steered us to an interesting restaurant. If you‚Äôre visiting the Frankfort, this is the place to stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We were only here for one night but this place was absolutely perfect. Very easy to find and to come and go from. Frankfort is an adorable city and the proximity to Buffalo trace was awesome. The place was very clean and comfortable with everything we needed. Definitely recommend staying here if you are coming to Frankfort!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures look nice but do not do this space justice. Talked to the owners multiple times in person. Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better space or better people. Frankfort is split by a river/bridge. All things good in town are walkable. Buffalo Trace and many other Distilleries are just a short drive away. Just in case whiskey town USA gets the best of you the ‚Äúcity cab‚Äù folk were amazingly attentive. The street was low traffic for the capitol building being only a few hundred yards away. Go discover Frankfort, it‚Äôs full of secrets and cool stuff. We toured all three spaces on the property. These owners are fantastic at making a space a home away from home. We will be back."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great experience and a great place to stay. Just a few steps to the state capital in one direction and about a mile from the downtown area in the other direction. The Airbnb felt very welcoming and relaxing. It was also a great getaway location and was in a very quiet neighborhood. Toni and Jason recommended Andy‚Äôs bakery right around the corner and it was phenomenal. Everyone in the area was very friendly.
I would also recommend Bourbon on Main, the stave, and good wood for a place to grab a bite or drink. And for a great cocktail check out House of Commons. The bartenders there are very knowledgeable and know their bourbon. You can find some rare bourbons to try there. We will definitely revisit and stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a last minute booking when we decided to start our vacation early and this was the perfect first stop! Walkable to restaurants and a brewery. Super convenient to navigate to and from and extremely close to some of the best distilleries in Bourbon Country! On top of that the furnishings in the place were beautiful, well thought out and comfortable. It made it feel more like home than someone else‚Äôs rental! Thank you Jason and Toni!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect experience for me: calm, beautiful, felt at home."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best airbnbs I have stayed in. Beautiful and spacious and walkable to downtown. Can't wait to go back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the most luxurious Airbnb I've ever stayed at! They took their time designing, not only the home, but the whole guest experience. They had everything I needed, from snacks to a shaving razor and cream, to slippers and a sowing kit. Most definitely the best place you can stay in Frankfort!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great location and stay. well maintained, clean and comfortable. highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed here for our trip on the Longest Yard sale.
What a beautiful place! It was so close to downtown. The apartment was well decorated and the bed was so comfortable! We will certainly try to stay there again next year"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing! We had a great couple night stay. So clean, cute, and tons of old house charm! The location was great and within walking distance of lots of restaurants! Would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, beautifully decorated, absolutely stunning light. Quiet and close to all of the best amenities. Next time we‚Äôre in the area, we will definitely stay here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect space for our stay in Frankfort. The place is designed beautifully, with everything you need at your fingertips. Bed is comfy, bathroom is gorgeous, living area and kitchen are huge, bright and welcoming. We were so comfortable we didn't want to leave, and will surely book again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was absolutely beautiful and a delight to stay in. My husband and I did a distillery tour and just spent one night in this cozy place. The place was clean and so bright and inviting. The bathtub was a great amenity! The kitchen was so light and airy. There was a small deck with a little table outside where we had a pleasant breakfast. We walked to Andy‚Äôs - and this is a must-visit if you stay here! Coffee and pastries were delicious. Super convenient and close to everything in Frankfort. Totally walkable for this side of town and an easy drive to the rest of downtown Frankfort. Plenty of parking and just all around a great location inside and out.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was spotless, with great amenities and comfort. It was a perfect place for our stay while visiting family."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very interesting property in a cool neighborhood. Photos show the property exactly as it is. It‚Äôs a crooked old house but that juts adds to the charm! Very bright, airy, clean and well appointed inside. You can see the Capitol dome from the street in front of the house. Highly recommend the home for a bourbon country stay (literally ten minutes from Buffalo Trace). Note that if you struggle with stairs, this property isn‚Äôt for you as the entry is a steep narrow staircase to the second floor apartment. ."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, a great place to stay & experience. It's upstairs in an older home so there are some low ceilings in spots & sloped floors (certainly something to be expected & doesn't take away from the experience). Just watch your head in spots. It's been nicely renovated, is decorated well with good furniture, appliances, etc., & very clean. It was quiet at night & we never felt unsafe being there. We weren't really told where to park & had an issue with the wrong code for the door but the hosts were always very responsive to messages & very friendly. The goodie bag they left was a very nice touch.
While it was mostly comfortable and nice, there are two things I'd suggest. 1) There really should be better quality towels/dish towels. Towels were small and thin - they felt cheap for a place that seemed nicer than that. 2) The toilet paper & paper towels were also thin & cheap. None of those things are expensive & would make for a better stay for guests and fit the ambience of the home."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I want to live in this little oasis! The listing is even more spacious than it appears, and served as a landing spot for our needs perfectly with toddler naps and lots of space for playtime. The space is light and airy, and has been tastefully decorated. The elevated finishings and appliances are what I would choose for my own home. Much more than a builder flipping an old home for income. The location in downtown Frankfort is ideal for a morning walk to Andy's bakery. Next year when we return to visit family, I will prioritize my trip around availability so that we can stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Great experience!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful loft style apartment in downtown. Everything was sleek and modernized. Bed was super comfortable. Owner was very responsive. Nice touch was giving us two local ginger sodas that my little son loved. Wife also loved the tub.

Highly recommended to anyone coming to the area."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely lovely. Clean space, great location. Although it is only a one bedroom, it is quite a large space. Decor is perfect!!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The loft was fine and accurately portrayed. Entry communications were off and the homeowner helped me out there. All in all a good stay. However beware of the fees and cleaning fees associated w this rental. They resulted in almost doubling the quoted nightly (one night) stay. The house sits on a street w only street parking available. Nice area to walk to town or the State Capital building.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent stay. Everything was exactly as described. Great location!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such an adorable place. The bathroom and kitchen are so charming, the bed was super comfy and the house is within walking distance of downtown restaurants. We‚Äôd definitely stay again!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We rented the unit for an extended stay and felt right at home. The space was furnished and equipped with everything we needed the the washer and dryer made it very easy and convenient for the long stay. The bed was comfortable, so was the couch and the fireplace was a nice touch. Tasteful setting with nice amenities. The hosts reached out when there was bad weather or anything to know about the area happening. Will stay again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cozy and clean. Had everything that you need when you are away from home! Super cute decor. I'd definitely recommend this place.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay during my three-day business trip to Frankfort. The host was super responsive, even when I texted late at night when my arrival was delayed.

2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Live Kentucky life . The area . A little trouble getting code for checking in
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The host was great! He was so welcoming with little gifts and he met us outside! the bed is comfortable and the property is clean. THE PICTURES DO NOT DO THIS PLACE JUSTICE!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the location. Beautiful surroundings. Very welcome and peaceful. Immaculate home. Some quirks due to the age of the home but to be expected (cold in some spots while warm in others). Responsive hosts that were more than happy to help when a maintenance issue occurred. Highly recommend.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,stayed for one night. beautiful house and lots of space. walking distance to everything you need.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Our group of 10 loved this spacious house. With 5 bedrooms and 3 baths, there was plenty of room for all of us. We enjoyed the well appointed kitchen, the big living area and relaxing on the front porch with a glass of wine. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"The house was perfect for our party of 10 visiting the Bourbon Trail. It's a beautiful historic house with all the amenities you need.

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Great home in a a perfect location. Convenient to Buffalo Trace and B's Bakery (best Apple Fritter ever!) We enjoyed the outdoor porch seating and the large dining room table, perfect size for our party of 10. Peaceful, safe feeling neighborhood for early morning runs/walks.
Definite Frankfort gem."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,The house was perfect for a family trip to the bourbon trail. Plenty of space for all of us both inside and outside. It was exactly as described and the host was very responsive to our needs. Highly recommend as a central location.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a fantastic time at ‚ÄúKentucky Bleu‚Äù!The home is stunning, spacious, and has all the amenities you could need. There was plenty of space, seating, bedrooms, etc. for all guests and the beds were so comfortable. The attention to detail in the home was incredible‚Äî all the decor was gorgeous and well-planned. It is close to downtown Frankfort restaurants and an easy drive to all the distilleries you possibly want to see in the surrounding areas. When we return to Kentucky, we will definitely be staying here again!"
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,"The house is beautiful and we'll worth the price! Our party of 10 fit comfortably. The only negative thing was that the upstairs air conditioner wasn't working when we got there (they were working on a fix upon arrival) and the property manager was slow to respond when we brought to their attention that this was still the case even late into the evening. Being one of the hottest days of the year- this wasn't ideal. Luckily one in our party is an HVAC tech and was able to find a solution- it could've been quite the problem otherwise.
Otherwise everything was great!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay. We had a wonderful time, the house was perfect for hanging out together but also had plenty of room if you wanted get away and read a book.
We would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"I can't say enough good things about staying in this house. Our group traveled to Frankfort under sad circumstances, a funeral, but wanted to be all together for the weekend and this house was absolutely perfect. If it weren't for the sad occasion, the trip would have been a standout! The house is beautiful and the furnishings are stunning. The house itself is huge and has all the charm and character of a historic home but the comfort of a modern one. There is ample space to spread out and hang in the living room, a huge dining table for gathering, a well appointed front porch with tons of seating, and a great backyard with cafe lights and chairs as well. The bedrooms are large! The beds are insanely comfortable and the linens so comfy and luxurious. You will feel like you're at a resort staying in this home. Everything is beautiful. The house is about a 10 min walk to downtown Frankfort and we walked to dinner and ice cream. I would 1000% stay here again"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We loved the house! Five big bedrooms, three full baths and plenty of common space to hang out. Beautiful decor and big back yard. We will definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,This is a perfect house for a large group. We had 8 adults staying here for a long weekend. There is plenty of room for privacy. It was very clean and comfortable. Beautiful remodeled antique house.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Our group thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the ‚ÄúLove House‚Äù in Frankfort Kentucky. The home is a destination in itself.

The home is extremely well equipped and supplied. We had everything we needed for a wonderful stay."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,This is a fantastic large historic house near downtown Frankfort. Five couples comfortably stayed for four nights. The indoor and outdoor spaces are thoughtfully appointed and were enjoyable across the board.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"My friends and I were there to do a Barrel Pick at Woodford Reserve and decided to make a couple days of visiting the diff bourbon distilleries. This place made it all feel like home! All of the rooms were large enough with large enough beds for each of the 5 guys-the largest being 6‚Äô5‚Äù smallest me being 5‚Äô10‚Äù. The house felt like home, street was relatively quiet. It was beautiful, spacious, clean and everything else. We cooked breakfast and dinners (thank you Mikey) and had a great time!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,My sisters and I came here for a tour of Buffalo Trace. It was absolutely beautiful. So well-equipped and beautifully decorated! The owners thought of everything from face wipes in the bathrooms to paper plates in the kitchen. We were all sad that we couldn't stay longer to enjoy more restaurants and shops in this quaint little town. We will definitely be back!
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Everything was as described! Nice house in a nice location
2023-02-01,4,Group trip,Beautiful Home! Lovely Decor! Comfortable Beds with Great Linens! Awesome Front Patio.! Definitely Recommend!! We hope to return when we come back to the area!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"The house is an older home, but it's been renovated and is really outstanding. The location is perfect if you're interested in bourbon touring. It's a super easy walk to the very nice downtown area that is clearly experiencing a renascence. Several very tasty and reasonably priced restaurants easily walking distance from the house. It's a very nice neighborhood as well. The house is huge and has plenty of room for lots of people."

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,I rented this space for myself and my bridesmaids to get ready in for my wedding weekend and it was phenomenal. This is one of the most beautiful homes I have ever stayed in and 10/10 recommend.
2022-11-01,4,Group trip,"This was a beautiful property, however pricey for the location based on my 13 yrs of renting. We paid ~$1200 in fees and taxes on this reso. That‚Äôs nuts. In general, rooms were very large and well appointed with comfortable furniture, linens and equipment. No complaints about the amenities provided. But be aware, the house is located on a busy residential corner so there is loud traffic from the street. Sound machines and fans were provided to drown out some of the noise. The kitchen was well equipped for cooking a large Thanksgiving dinner, however it was challenging with a small double oven and no garbage disposal. This was the only meal we ate on the property. Most of our meals were eaten out locally. No great recommendations to give for restaurants in Frankfort. Considering the Stave came highly recommended and it was bad two different times, save your money and make the drive to Louisville or Lexington. Be sure to plan your distillery visits ahead of time. Tours fill up fast"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Great house in a perfect location. Plenty of room for our group of 10. Very clean and lots of cute touches.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"The Bleu House is a gorgeous getaway and was perfect for our party of nine. Comfortable beds and pillows, a beautifully stocked kitchen, fabulous chairs on the front porch, cozy family space and spacious bedrooms. We loved everything about this house."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home in great area of Frankfurt! Easy instructions for checking in and management team was very communicative. Highly recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"The house is beautiful and in a great spot. We ( a group of 8) went to the Bourbon on the Banks Festival. It was a short mile walk to get to the venue. It is also a few minute drive to Buffalo Trace Distillery. Everything was clean and comfortable, with enought bedrooms for our grouip. I would highly recommend staying if you have the chance to visit Frankfort."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place. Exceeded expectations.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Our group thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Beautifully renovated home perfect for us. Enjoyed a great late summer evening on the fabulous porch with our friends. Was an easy walk to restaurants and a bakery. Look forward to coming back to experience more of the ‚Äútrail‚Äù.

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"The porch was AMAZING! We were a group of seven friends visiting the area for the weekend. We sat out late into the night and also enjoyed our morning coffee out there.
The inside is beautifully decorated, with plenty of seating and room to spread out. Three full bathrooms made it easy for everyone to get ready. While we didn‚Äôt cook full meals in the kitchen, it seemed well appointed and was quite spacious."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful older home that has been renovated. Close to everything in Frankfurt. We have a large family and this house worked great for us. We would definitely stay here again.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,The Blue House was absolutely amazing! We traveled in from MD to experience some of the bourbon trail with several friends and the house provided us with such a comfortable stay. The beds were very comfortable with all the comforts of home. Every couple had their own bathroom which was an A+ and the whole house was super clean! There was plenty of room for 7 people to gather and eat or sit and relax after a full day of exploring the area. We loved the historic charm of the house and really enjoyed sitting on the porch at night enjoying a drink with our friends. Communication with the Kentucky Life Co was top notch!Highly recommend this gem of a spot in Frankfort especially if you want to be close to Buffalo Trace to get the daily specials that they offer! ü•Éüëç
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"What a beautiful home! Historical home and architecture with all the modern conveniences of the update that was done. Very tasteful, relaxing, and comfortable interior.

Huge space. More than enough room for our group of 10. Centrally located to a lot of distilleries. Definitely would recommend!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Blue House is the perfect rental in Frankfort. Spent a long weekend here with our 4 adult children and a grandchild. Great location, beautifully rehabbed home, immaculate inside and out. Thoughtfully planned furniture, kitchen and bedrooms with comfortable beds and linens. Well stocked kitchen including supplies and many snacks!! Would highly recommend."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay in this beautifully updated home. The large rooms, fabulous kitchen, extras like snacks, great soap and reed diffusers were an appreciated bonus. (I ordered the diffusers for everyone in our group on Day 1 as a remembrance of a fun trip since all in party commented on them.) Great restaurants, shops, Andy's Artisan Bread , ice cream and more within walking distance which is a plus for our group. Neighborhood very nice. Many dog-walkers and neighbors greeted us as they passed by. We spent most of our spare time between outings on the wrap-around porch. Everyone wants to book again when we return to Frankfort."
