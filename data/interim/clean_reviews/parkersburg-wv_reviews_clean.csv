2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Donna and Mike’s place is was exactly what we needed after driving all day. The view from the back porch was relaxing as we listened to the fire Mike had started for us. We saw deer and rabbits as the sun was setting. The cabin had everything we needed and the bed was very comfortable. When we travel back to NY, we will definitely try to stay again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Donna met me as I arrived. She and Mike are so friendly, you can tell they enjoy hosting. Extra bonuses include the lovely farm animals, the beautiful view, and the peaceful setting. The cottage itself is so well made--by hand with gorgeous natural wood--and so well decorated. Probably Donna has thought of all the little amenities--homemade cookies in the refrigerator, for example. I couldn't have felt more welcome and taken care of."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Cozy Cabin is such a sweet and quiet experience that fills the soul and provides a true feeling of serenity and peace.
View from the deck was like a picture. The cabin was charming and well decorated. Ducks, chickens, and goats add to the unique personality of the place. Early morning outdoor fire by Mike is extra special and his and Donna’s warmth and hospitality are beyond wonderful!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Donna and Mike were exceptional hosts, very welcoming and made you feel right at home upon meeting. The Cozy Cabin name matched equally with the feel of our stay. Wonderful place for a ladies getaway weekend! Highly recommend to outdoor enthusiasts or those looking for a getaway of relaxation and a list of zero to-do's."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at Donna's place. Well appointed with everything you need for a comfortable stay.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Donna and Mike were extremely kind and the place is cozy!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay. Would highly recommend the cabin. Very clean and every detail well thought out. Hosts were great and showed us around. We have a 3 year old son who loved the loft. The host even provides a safety gate for the loft ladder so we could shut it off to our little one if needed.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Donna was great. Friendly, she met me at the door as I came in. Clear communication about expectations. Lovely setting. I appreciate her tolerance for my menagerie!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay! Always a relaxing and peaceful space. Thank you
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donna & Mike are excellent hosts! The cabin was sooo squeaky clean and smelled fresh. It's feels like you're in the middle of BFE (wonderful!), but you're so close to so much. We explored a few restaurants in Belpre but found Parkersburg to be most interesting. We found Filipino & Lebanese restaurants that were delicious. The Parkersburg Brewing Co. has tasty food and a wonderful selection of beers. We visited The Parkersburg Art Center, where they were displaying, for the first time ever, a collection of some of Billy Foster's work. You're probably not familiar with his art, but it's worth doing a little research.
Overall, we throughly enjoyed our visit and will be coming back again to visit Donna & Mike!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Cozy Cabin was wonderful! The cabin had everything we needed for our pup, and a good nights rest on our road trip to Tennessee! We will definitely be back if passing through this area again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful! Nicely decorated! Many nice finishing touches that made it special. Both Donna and Mike are gracious hosts. GREAT value for the money! Hope to see them again!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Donna and Mike greeted me on arrival and gave me the quick tour of the space. I ran to town for a quick bite and then came back to relax and watch a movie. The tiny cabin was very cozy with an electric fireplace that was great for the cold evening I stayed there. The bed was super comfortable as well. I couldn't believe all the additional space in the loft, so there is plenty of room if you have kids traveling with you. If the weather has been warmer I would have liked to hang outside on the deck, the area was private and relaxing."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This is such a beautiful spot. Very cozy and enjoyable. The host was responsive and everything was perfect!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The description of the place was exactly as described. It was cozy, clean, and enough for a night’s stay for a long road trip with kids."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was great. Donna and her husband greeted me as soon as I pulled in. Allowed us to use anything we wanted on the deck . The fire pit was definitely a plus. And those delicious cookies were the icing on the cake . Loved this place, I’d definitely book again"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Donna greeted us when we arrived. She gave instructions about the cabin. It’s small but an incredible use of the space& beautifully built. We had our dog with us. There’s a small yard outside the cabin & we walked our dog around the farm & down the rural road for exercise.
The cabin was very clean & comfortable."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful location!!! Gorgeous cabin. Warm, cozy, and quaint. Exceptional workmanship!! Donna and Mike are amazing! Greeted us right away, and we're very attentive to anything we may need. We will be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Donna and Mike are phenomenal hosts, they went above and beyond to ensure our comfort in the cabin, and they provided fresh homemade cookies which were delicious! They communicated extremely well and were very willing to work with us on check-in and out times!"

Thank you Donna for opening up your place to us!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved it! So cozy. Perfect for our wrestling tournaments in Parkersburg. My 7 year old son was so so happy with the loft beds and the fireplace heater. & I personally loved the fresh baked cookies when we arrived!! I forgot shampoo and body wash and there was everything I needed already stocked in the bathroom. Everything was perfect. We will definitely be back.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow! What a perfect little gem! We loved the cozy cabin with a great view. The cabin itself was beautifully constructed with attention to every detail to make for a perfect stay. And they are the epitome of dog friendly which my pups and I love. We'll be back this summer and look forward to using the lovely deck, grill, and fire pit."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Good place to stay for a few nights away
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, enjoyed the view very peaceful and really just felt like I was at home Donna and Mike treated us like family. Will definitely go back. Highly recommended."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a great stay at Donna & Mike's guesthouse. We felt right at home and enjoyed the peaceful surroundings. Everything was clean and cozy and super inviting!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,Beautiful cozy cabin that was a great deal with a great host. Wonderful little get away. Donna went out of her way making us feel like home with plenty of amenities and thoughtfulness.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Traveling with a toddler is tough but Donna’s place was warm, inviting, and relaxing. Our whole family felt cozy and at home!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, I would stay there again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Donna and Mike were lovely. The cabin space was adorable and clean and communication was great. They were also very accommodating for early arrival. I love knowing this is so close to my mom so I have somewhere nice to stay when I visit :)
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is definitely one of my favorite airb&b’s I’ve ever stayed in. I cannot say enough good things. SO clean and comfortable. Cozy cabin is the perfect name for this place because it really is so cozy. We loved it so much we decided to stay a second night. Mike even built us a beautiful campfire. They made us feel right at home but we still had our privacy. So much wildlife around and the view from their property is lovely. We loved their sweet little goats! Well worth the value, would love to come back again in the future."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We were down for a hunting trip and this place was perfect. Very well maintained and clean. Mike was very friendly at check in. I will be staying here again if back in the area. I was very satisfied and really liked what they have done with the place.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Donna and Mike are fantastic hosts!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Donna and Mike's place for just a night on our way through town and my only complaint is that we didn't stay longer. Donna and Mike really thought of everything to make their space feel welcoming and cozy and on top of that the view from their property is amazing. Thanks so much, we'll definitely be back and hopefully next time for longer!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This sweet gem is tucked away in the rolling hills and peaceful meadows of Ohio’s beautiful countryside. It’s a just-perfect cozy cabin complete with an awesome fire-pit! You’re going to see deer grazing in the meadow in the evenings and hear bluebirds in the morning while drinking your coffee on the beautiful deck outside your door. Mike & Donna are kind & friendly and have thought of everything. They are there if needed—yet with the perfect balance of giving you privacy as well.
Your accommodations are extremely clean ( super important to me) & honestly—you wont want to leave.
Restaurants, tourist attractions, & vintage shops are amazing & nearby- but (thankfully in my opinion) not walkable. However, evenings by the moonlight with s’mores and/or wine, and comfy chairs are right outside your door.
It’s one of those places that you know you will come back to. We were super happy & felt like we made new friends. It will be our go- to place when visiting beautiful Marietta."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and cozy, just like the description. Everything was perfect!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cozy Cabin is a perfect name for this hillside retreat. Our 2 year old loved roaming the land and seeing the 🐐 and 🐔 🐥. You can tell upon arrival that Donna has been in hospitality for so long! She gave a great introduction to what was available and how to reach her with questions. Mike's attention to detail when building the cabin is also noted in how great the space is utilized. My hubby and I were so glad this was our choice for our 10 year wedding anniversary. The town also offers beautiful river views and parks. We used the local libraries wifi to download Bluey episodes since the cabin was without. In our spare time the games provided kept us entertained and the conversation flowing. Overall our time went by to quickly and we look forward to going back in the future.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We can’t thank Donna and Mike enough for offering their beautiful cabin to guests!! We are SO THANKFUL to have a place close to family that allows dogs, including large dogs. The place was so clean, and private! We would absolutely stay again next time we’re in visiting family! Donna and Mike were incredibly friendly also!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Overall, a very quiet and comfortable overnight stay. We would do it again. The location is slightly off the beaten path yet easy to get to. It’s in a very nice rural setting yet close enough to access restaurants, fuel and other necessities if so desired. Check in with Donna was a breeze as she personally went over the details of the cabin and things nearby.
The cabin itself was custom built by Mike for the grandchildren and it shows in the details — very nice! (Works well for full-size folks, too. I’m 6’-2”.)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at the cozy cabin! Very peaceful, clean, and exactly as advertised."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Donna and Mike were friendly hosts. The Cozy Cabin was well equipped, the setting was wonderful. Very relaxing and peaceful.They have animals, liked them. If you want a cushy bed may be disappointed. This a unique and peaceful place to stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful and relaxing stay! The beds were comfortable and so cozy!! Donna and Mike were very kind and personable and I would definitely stay here again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Donna's cozy cabin was the perfect place for my stay during a very busy week. I loved sitting out by the fire looking over the beautiful view in the evening to unwind. The cabin was very comfortable and nicely decorated with all that was listed plus some extras. Donna and Mike were very friendly hosts who also give plenty of privacy. I would love to stay there again when I'm in the area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I will sum it up this way: it will always be my first choice when I am in the area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay with an awesome host. Will be staying there again in a couple day and every time I come this way.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place is Breathtaking & Donna & Mike are Gods Great people. We will be back
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful place in the country. Loved the view, sounds of nature, and peaceful vibe. Cabin was spotless. Donna was very responsive to questions and requests. I would stay here again or recommend to others."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an excellent one night stay here. It's a very quiet, comfortable, cozy little cabin in great condition. The view out the window is lovely, the hosts are generous in what they offer as options (use of grill, etc.), and we enjoyed the personal touches in the interior decor. Snacks (cookies, granola bars, etc.) and coffee/tea/water are provided; microwave, toaster oven, refrigerator and coffee maker in the room. The listing photos provide an accurate description. We had no trouble finding it at dusk (almost dark); heading out from the center of Belpre, look for the house number on the mailbox post. Recommended; we would stay there again if in the area. Thank you Mike & Donna."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Second stay of the week here. Spent an overnight on the way and on the way back during a road trip from Pennsylvania to Indiana. Super clean, comfortable, beautiful surroundings and genuinely nice people. One of our favorite Airbnb’s ever. Will definitely stay here again if/when in the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great Americans with a truly amazing spot. Mike and my husband were instant friends. He is a true craftsmen. Thank you for the blackberry jelly. ❤️
We love this place and this family and will 💯 be back."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Good space, Donna was a great host, very clean and comfortable"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a quiet and relaxing place, this is it. It’s a small cabin, but feels bigger, and has everything you’ll need. The decor and details really make this cabin stand out. I only used the lower level bed and it was very comfortable. Plus, it’s SPOTLESS, the air conditioning was cold, and the homemade cookies were delicious. I hope it’s available next time I’m in the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautifully built cabin with a lovely view. Super comfortable bed, very welcoming hosts, everything we needed, and an awesome place to unwind after a day on the road."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed my stay at Donna's place. The place was very cozy and comfortable. The check in cookies were delicious! I will definitely come back the next time I am in the area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful space with a beautiful view! Donna and Mike were great host from booking, to check-in, and throughout the stay. The home was definitely designed and put together with thought to make guest feel welcomed and comfortable. The small space did not feel small at all, with everything one needs for a getaway. Looking forward to staying again in the future when back in town!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"In our “camping world” we would consider Mike & Donna’s cozy cabin basically “Outside Living” ! The cabin is handy dandy for anything you prefer to do “inside” otherwise it’s heavenly for the multitude of “outside living” ie: fire, deck, grilling, bird watching, wildlife spotting- you get the idea!
We call it heavenly!!
Mike & Donna did not disappoint either! Great people with a tank of hospitality! Wish we could’ve stayed longer!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Donna and Mike were very welcoming upon our arrival. Donna gave us a tour of the cabin and explained how things worked and where things were. Just super nice people. It was beautiful and peaceful. We had two dogs with us, and they had an area designated for them which was great. We would come back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is truly a hidden gem! Donna and Michael were both very nice, friendly and helpful. Will DEFINITELY stay there again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Donna's place is worth every penny and the trip to get to it which is off the beaten path. The surroundings are peaceful and refreshing with lots of privacy. They welcomed my pets and provided above and beyond amenities including breakfast items and fresh baked cookies!! If you are considering booking this place don't hesitate your won't regret it!!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This cozy cabin was the perfect getaway and we wish we could have stayed more than one night! Hosts were amazing - made us fires and even ran to the store to get ingredients for s’mores for us. Very peaceful and great scenery. We loved everything about this cabin and hope to be back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful little cabin with a beautiful view. We wanted an ""off the beaten path"" place to stay...we got it. It was a great place. Clean. Comfortable. Quiet.
Was nice to meet Donna at check-in. Everything worked perfectly for us...thank you."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice and quiet and the perfect getaway.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place is wonderful. It has that cabin feel both inside and out. Great view and very relaxing. Although we were only stopping through I highly recommend this place to get away and relax at a great location with a great host. Also not to mention some welcome treats.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's an incredibly beautiful location and a prefect place to stay. Quite, comfortable, clean and has everything you need. Much better then anything s hotel has to offer."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I've been on AirBnB a long time, and my stay at Donna's place just might be my favorite trip yet. The house is tucked away in the foothills of Belpre, OH, but is not difficult to find. Once we arrived, Donna and her husband were right there to assist with check-in. Throughout the stay they provided everything we could possibly need, including local recommendations. The unit itself was spotless and exceptionally comfortable, and stocked with everything we might need.
We just can't say enough of how peaceful the AirBnB was, nor how helpful and accommodating our hosts were. If we're in the area again, we'll probably look for this listing first. Amazing value and a great experience!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,family loved the hospitality that was given.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved Donna and Mike's place! They were there to greet us upon arrival and gave us a brief intro and made a special spot for our motorcycles to park. They were available as needed but gave us plenty of privacy. The cabin felt like a home away from home and was extremely peaceful and cozy. Donna made us cookies and provided us with water, coffee and snacks. Their place is just enough off the highway to be peaceful and quiet while still only 10-15 min from great restaurants and town. We would gladly stay here again and highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice, comfy stay. Very cozy cabin!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to unwind! My husband and I were very impressed with this Airbnb.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great folks
Nice place on top of the hill"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Donna noted that most GPS do what ours did and bring you in back roads and past some uncared for places. You can stay on paved roads. I think if you put in Boxers Bed and Breakfast it will take you to the good end of her road and then put in her address.
Donna likes to communicate. She is very helpful. This trip came at a difficult time in our life and she made it better. Thank you."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Donna’s place was awesome. The lil cabin was exactly as she described. They were awesome hosts and the surroundings were beautiful.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The first place I have stayed that is as described and clean. Would definitely stay here again. They drive to the place was a little interesting in the rain but so worth it.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were only in town for the night, to see my Mom for Mother’s Day. I wish we could have stayed longer!! Mike & Donna were exceptional hosts, they met with us upon check in, and walked us through everything. They even made delicious fresh homemade cookies for us! They also built the cabin themselves, and it was beautifully crafted with wonderful attention to detail. Would 10 out of 10 recommend anyone to stay here while visiting Little Hocking, Belpre, Marietta or Parkersburg/Vienna. Away from it all but a short and beautiful drive to any of these locations. It truly is a complete peaceful sanctuary to rest, and take in the beauty of its surroundings, while still being close to everything the MOV has to offer."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Donna’s place was so great! It was exactly as described & the place was so peaceful!

Mike and Donna are extremely kind and helpful and were amazing hosts! They were available when we needed and answered all of our questions. They even offered suggestions of places to go if we wanted to explore the area.
We loved our stay and will definitely be back!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything is as advertised and is a beautiful tiny home/guest house with a beautiful location. Lots to do in the immediate area. Mike/Donna are very accommodating and responsive. They accommodated our weird check-in time and we had an open dialogue for the entirety of the stay.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay at this Air Bnb! The cabin is beautifully decorated, and the host was top-notch. The beds were comfortable and the views were breathtaking. We also appreciated the quick responses to any questions we had. We would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful and relaxing stay! Thanks again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We just signed in to a Doubletree Hilton in Cleveland for the second part of our trip and it's depressing compared to Cozy Cabin. We miss it so much! Everything was perfect. If you want to relax in beautiful home with amazing views and a huge deck in Southeast Ohio this is the place for you. A lot of love, care and craftspersonship went into creating the Cozy Cabin and it shows! We plan to make this our home away from home every time we visit family in the area. Dog and kid friendly too!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at the cozy cabin! Donna and Mike were great and super accommodating. The cabin has a great setup. Very well crafted and laid out, beautiful views and a quiet setting. It was a much needed get away for me and the wife for a day!!!
Thanks again!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,The hard rain on the roof kept us from a good night's rest. Not the host's responsibility.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at the Cozy Cabin for just one night on our way to WV and we really loved it. It was cozy, simple, affordable with a beautiful view. The Cabin as well as the space for entertainment outside were well thought out and admirable. We loved the cookies and were also grateful to be able to bring our dogs and being able to get them out on a short walk on the less travel country road. We would most definitely stay again and hope to have more time next time."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cozy cabin with beautiful views atop the rolling hills of Southeast Ohio. Lovely little touches like a plate of homemade cookies and extra blankets.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donna and Mike were great hosts and made my stay relaxing and easy. I would definitely recommend their place and I will definitely stay there again. Ending the day with a sunset and a fire, and starting my day - after a comfortable sleep - with coffee and a sunrise over an incredible view from the deck was rejuvenating. I would recommend this stay to anyone wanting to get away and find a unique stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donna's cozy cabin is beautiful! It's even better in person than it is in the pictures. Donna and Mike are wonderful hosts, Donna's cookies are amazing.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay! The cabin kept us warm and dry from the the cold and stormy nights that hit us. My young sons had fun and loved the cabin, but they were too young for us to comfortably allow them upstairs. There wasn’t a gate or a guard upstairs to protect toddlers from possibly falling down the ladder. The hubby and I slept upstairs and it offered us some much needed privacy. All of the beds were comfortable, but the best part was Donna and her husband. They were welcoming, friendly, and great to chat with. Donna always answered her phone promptly when I would ask about something or make a request. I would love to stay again next year!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This Cozy Cabin exceeded all of our expectations. Cozy is an understatement! It is charming, well crafted, and perfectly decorated. It’s perfect for a weekend get away from the hustle and bustle. Cabin came well supplied by the friendly and amazing hosts.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at the Tiny House in Belpre,OH. The House with beautifully furnished and the view of the valley gorgeous. When we arrived the hosts greeted us and showed us around. There were ample snacks to enjoy and a coffeemaker and toaster oven for making breakfast. We had to leave early the next day,but next time hope to stay longer."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is a 10/10! Beautiful views and very relaxing. My dog and I did some hiking in West Virginia and spend the day in Marietta. It was wonderful. And the freshly baked cookies were a nice bonus!!

It's a great place to unplug from the busy hustle and bustle of every day life. The little cabin was very clean. I will definitely be back but will stay longer next time.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. I’ve stayed in so many Airbnbs over the years. And Mike and Donna take the cake in terms of hospitality. The cookies were beyond amazing. They both respected our privacy and let us build a fire with their firewood. The cabin looks even better than the pictures. The WiFi was a little spotty, but it only helped our group detach and enjoy the space how it was meant to be enjoyed. At peace. Can’t say enough great things about this spot and Donna & Mike"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was a perfect little getaway for our vacation! Donna greeted us as we arrived and was kind and hospitable. The view was incredible and almost every amenity was provided. Donna even left cookies in the room for our arrival! We really enjoyed sitting outside and using the fire pit.
We stayed here during the Mothman festival in Pt Pleasant, WV. It was under an hour away when all other hotels were booked. Definitely check this place out if you’re making festival plans."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We have stayed at quite a few locations now and can say that without a doubt Donna and Mike have gone above and beyond to ensure you have an excellent stay. The cabin is immaculate and exceedingly well furnished and stocked. Mike is a talented woodworker and did a beautiful job in designing and building the cabin. It is in a quiet peaceful country setting. We really enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend it.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My son and I had a great stay . Donna and Mike were more than welcoming and helpful. They even went out of way to get special treats. Thanks for the wonderful stay
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"No detail is overlooked, as a guest you will be sure to have what you need. An extra special touch was being greeted with an outdoor fire and homemade cookies on arrival. Great stay, would give six stars if I could"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was comfortable and peaceful. Our hosts were great and only as far as a quick knock on the door.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Mike and Donna's cabin was so perfect! The place was well laid out and thoughtfully stocked. There's a beautiful view outside the front deck and a nice drive up to the cabin. There are tons of things to do about 10-20 minutes away and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The hosts are amazing and kind and the cabin is beautiful and peaceful. They thought of every detail. Id pay much more for this place - such a steal. Dont miss the opportunity to use the grill outside! We will definitely be back!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mike and Donna's Cozy Cabin was a perfect place for us to stay...we only wish we could have stayed longer. Everything was great! The cabin was spotlessly clean, the decor was cute, the bed comfortable, the AC kept the cabin cool, (even on a very hot day), coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc. were provided...and homemade chocolate chip cookies were waiting for us! The view from the deck outside the cabin was fantastic. And the location was an easy drive to the surrounding towns, just the right distance away from town to feel like you have some space, but not so far away to feel isolated. Overall, just a great stay. We highly recommend!!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a quiet, out of the way place to stay in southern Ohio, Donna and Mike's place is a great choice. It is exceptionally clean and well set up new cabin, with cozy touches. You might enjoy looking over the rolling hills sipping tea. Donna and Mike communicated promptly and clearly, and are extremely friendly but not intrusive.
I enjoyed my stay.
Note: Donna gave me directions that were better than Google maps, so you might ask."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"this little cabin is a hidden gem, well set up, very quiet, comfortable. it was great and ,should i dare say, much better than it look on the site.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My sister & I rode the North Bend Trail in 2 days on e-bikes & how wonderful to come back to this magnificent riverside retreat each evening. The deck overlooking the river is just spectacular. We utilized the fire-pit & it was such a cozy place to watch the barges & river traffic. So many amenities! Crystal was super quick to respond with any questions & the home was very clean. I would’ve happily stayed a month!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay when visiting Parkersburg
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I was in town for the funeral of my mother. Crystal was kind & accommodating. I’ve been reluctant to leave a review because it was a very difficult time. My lens of the weekend is blurry because of grief.
The home is beautiful, well equipped (except for hairdryer & closets) and was clean. The road in is scary. The river view is fabulous."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We decided to stay at this cabin while we house hunted and loved the area so much we decided to buy in the area! We had an amazing stay, Crystal was an awesome host, and the pictures absolutely do not do her cabin and it's view of the river justice! Our first time making a reservation with AirBNB and we were far beyond impressed!"

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Exactly what she says it is and exactly like the pictures
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home exceeded expectations despite all of the great reviews and that rarely happens. The back porch was the highlight for our group. We ate outside for breakfast and dinner every day. The kitchen was well outfitted and that’s a big plus for me. Crystal was very responsive and super helpful. I would book this house again. Thanks for the memories!
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, right on the water. The road in is dirt and a little rough but worth the trip."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome house on the Ohio River with an amazing back deck and plenty of space inside— 1.5 baths + 3 spacious bedrooms. Sort of remote in all the best ways but it’s RIGHT outside Parkersburg. From the deck, you can even see the “Welcome to Parkersburg, WV” sign down the river. The road is a bit steep and almost seems like a driveway, but it’s super quiet and worthwhile"
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Check in was a breeze. The view was incredible. The wood burner wasn’t available for use at the time, but wasn’t necessary, given the weather. It was a great place to stay while visiting family. Would definitely consider staying there again."

2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Pictures don’t justify Crystals place! Plenty of space to relax and have fun. Expected more traffic on the river but was perfect amount to sit back and watch on the huge deck. Stayed in a few Airbnb, usually kitchens are light on utensils and pots. Crystals place is fully stocked to cook for a big group and even got a gift basket to make some S’mores! Awesome location, just a couple hours away from Columbus. Will definitely book again!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time at Crystal's home! The interior exceeded expectations - it was just a super cool layout, the perfect size, and modern for what is expected in a cabin. The view from the back deck was beautiful and we took advantage of the fire pit.

2020-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a awesome place and a awesome host! The property was way better then the description and photos. Large living room and kitchen. All the bedrooms were super comfy. Greeted at check in with a snack and treat basket. All the amenities we needed! Simple no hassle check in. Crystal was very informative on the area and things to do. The best part was the large back yard deck with walkway leading to a private dock! It was beautiful!!!! I’m definitely coming back with friends for a long weekend trip! Best AirBnB I’ve been to, and a better host! Thanks Crystal😁"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible place. Exceeded expectations. Fast communication with any questions.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the most immaculate place we’ve ever stayed! Even the laundry area on the bottom level was spotless! The location was super convenient for all we were doing in the area. Jason responded to messages quickly and acted equally promptly. He was very customer-oriented and accommodating. We were able to pull right up to the door to unload and load our car. Well worth considering if you’re in the area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place to stay.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great 5 star property located in a quite neighborhood.
Good location close to Parkersburg (10 mins to downtown) and Vienna with restaurants and shopping within 5 mins drive.
Townhouse is new and clean. Comfortable beds and clean linens. And it's great that they have a no pets policy.
Owners are very responsive and dropped off a missing hairdryer same day.
We were here to visit family in the area and would definitely stay here again.
Thank you for a great stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Jason is a great host and I highly recommend this property. It was extremely clean and the beds were easy to fall asleep and stay asleep.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"A beautiful and cozy townhome in a quiet neighborhood! We were looking to get away for a night and came upon this very reasonably priced gem and it couldn't have been more perfect for us! Close to entertainment and food, yet we felt secluded; very clean and well stocked with everything we needed. Owner was responsive and welcoming. Thankful we chose this rental and not a local hotel. Very pleased and would stay here again in what we felt was our ""home away from home""!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were very happy with our stay here. It was very nice and clean and I felt 100% comfortable. The surrounding neighborhood and outside of the building didn’t look nearly as nice as the inside. Other than that, I have no complaints. I’d definitely stay here again. It was spacious and very comfortable . There were extra towels and wash cloths, plenty of supplies (toilet paper, shampoo, etc.). Everything listed on the page for this unit was accurate. Tyler communicated well and responded quickly. For about the same price as one room at the hotel near here the week before, we got an entire apartment and it was much cleaner here. It was our first experience with an Airbnb and honestly, we will probably never stay at a hotel ever again."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The host was responsive and the apartment was clean and spacious.
Steps upstairs were 9.5” deep and one of the beds was 3’ off the ground to the top of the mattress."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. The place was clean with listed amenities and in a good area. I would stay here again if traveling to Parkersburg.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Cozy accomodations! The townhome is beautifully decorated and includes extra amenities such as coffee pods, creamer, and toiletries for the bathroom. The bed in the Master was great; I slept well. Son slept in the other room and didn't complain, so I'm assuming he was comfortable as well. Tyler's communications were friendly and prompt. We will happily stay here in the future. A little tip: if you have time, walk up the hill from the townhome and visit Quincy Park. Gorgeous views of the Ohio River below."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,it was perfect for us and good price.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was fabulous
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,5 Star Host!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great location, clean, great amenities, Tyler responded in a timely manner to questions, parking very close,safe neighborhood, fully stocked townhouse , professional service from rental to check out … recommend this townhouse if short or long term stay"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I've known the host's family for most of my life. He is a man of integrity and it shows with this property. The place was extremely clean, well kept, and the apartment was quiet. The chair and the travel crib for the children were also in good shape.
Pay attention to the fact that it is indeed a 2 story town house. if you can't do stairs, this would not work. However, it is VERY friendly to a family or friends who are traveling.
I would definitely stay here again. Good value."

The beds were comfortable, bathroom was clean, everything was great!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such an amazing stay at Byron’s Place in Belpre. The home was as described. First impression was that the property is very well taken care of. It was sparkling clean! Everything smelled freshly cleaned and laundered. The kitchen is beautiful. I have a daughter with life-threatening food allergies, so finding a place that I can safely make her meals while away from home is paramount! There are adequate plates, cups, bowls and silverware. I purchased cookie sheet and baking dishes, but otherwise most things are available.
Bedrooms were both beautiful and SO COMFORTABLE! No expense was spared on the beds; we slept very well!
The deck is a major bonus. Beautiful view of the Ohio River. Local park nearby was a fun surprise!
Location was quiet, peaceful and near everything one would need while offering a secluded feel.
We visit the area 6+ times a year and will definitely stay here again. 10/10"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best stays since I've been using Airbnb
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved spending the night at Byron's house. The living room furniture was so comfortable and was easy to relax in after a long day on the road!
The bed was comfortable, and the sheets were nice and cool, just the way we like them!
We still had a long drive ahead of us, but we couldn't resist sitting on the deck to drink our morning coffee. We felt quite at home, and very comfortable there."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second visit to Byron's place. It is clean, comfortable, quiet, safe, and within easy distance to stores, shops, and restaurants. At the house, there are plenty of amenities and a strong internet connection. You can get to Parkersburg or even drive to Marietta, Ohio within 10 to 15 minutes. We were very pleased with the price.
We were in the area for my 50-year Parkersburg High School class reunion and needed to rest between events. Byron has the most comfortable beds. We slept well!
You do need to climb seventeen steps to get to the living area, but we had no problem. We actually like that the house sits up high because it offers a great view of the Ohio River. We sat on the deck and watched barges go by while enjoying our morning coffee. We recommend bringing a set of binoculars.
Thanks, Byron! We hope to stay at your place on our next visit."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice place. we would definitely stay again when in the area.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A nice place for a few nights stay, had a full kitchen which we used a lot and the upper floor is very nice. You enter the lower floor which is unfinished and go up the stairs to get to the living area but we didn’t spend anytime downstairs except to get in and out of the residence. Besides that, a nice stay close to the river!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were extremely happy with our stay at this property. The location was fantastic and Byron was very great to rent from.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The exterior of the home needs some siding work and we were a little worried when we arrived, but the interior was clean and the beds were comfy. The TV channels were more than adequate. Condiments and many basics have been left or stocked. Location was in a quiet neighborhood away from main roads, but close enough to not be inconvenient. Nice water pressure and premium TP in the bathroom. We stayed one night and visited Blennerhasset island and museum the next day. Worked out perfectly for our expectations."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"lovely place!! amazing view of the river. the house was clean and comfortable, would definitely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a quiet spot and perfect for our needs. We were taking a little road trip along the Ohio River. Byron’s place was spotless and he was responsive when I contacted him. Highly recommend it.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Byron’s home was perfect for us. We received a code access and a key, which made entering and exiting super convenient. The house was just as the pictures online showed. Very spacious and clean. We were doubly excited to see they had coffee pods for the coffee maker, for us to enjoy in the morning.
The beds were amazing. We slept so well. They were the perfect firm/softness. Probably the best sleep we have had in months. If we didn’t have somewhere to be I would’ve definitely stayed in bed longer. 😊
The housekeeping staff showed up just as we checked out and as we got situated, she ran down with an item we had left on the dresser. We were so impressed that they looked around the house before cleaning and was able to return it to us before we left. It was a prize we won at a raffle and completely forgot we laid it down.
We will definitely return when we head back to the area. Thank you so much for the great hospitality!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was very nice and exactly what he had in his description. Byron always responded very quickly with every question I had and he was so nice. I strongly recommend him and this home to stay in. Very great experience!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was exactly what my friend and I were looking for after a long bike ride on the nearby North Bend Trail. It was great being able to do laundry and relax on the deck overlooking the river. Byron was friendly and responsive. If I am ever in the area again, I would definitely stay there. Highly recommended!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family enjoyed this place very much! We are thinking about getting a home in Ohio now just from staying in your home. Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable we will definitely be back one day.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love staying here. The river is very peaceful and you have a nice view. The layout of the space is easy to navigate and just what you need.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great value, and it is near the river with views on two sides of the deck. The place is a little dark, however there is adequate lighting. The kitchen is great, everything you might need. The flooring in the main area is bamboo and the kitchen and bathroom are ceramic tile, very attractive. Unfortunately, previous guests have spilled and stained the carpeting in the bedroom. Not terrible, but not nice. For the rate charged, this is well worth it."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We planned a small trip to Blennerhassett island, and wanted to find an Airbnb that was close that had a view...We were excited to find this gem! Check in was very easy. We headed up the stairs to find a very clean house with everything that we would need. The best part of the whole house was the second story deck. It was so nice to sit outside, drink coffee and enjoy the rain while we stayed dry. We saw a tree frog on the deck, and watched the boats on the river. The bed was extremely comfortable....so much that I wanted to figure out a way to take it home with me (lol)...
This was by far the most reasonably priced Airbnb that I have ever stayed at, and it quickly became one of my faves."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nice place. Byron communicated promptly with response to questions. Stay was enjoyable. Porch sitting and watching the fire flies at night was magical!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and relaxing place
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Parkersburg, WV is our hometown.
My husband and I traveled from NC and my sister and her husband came from Michigan to attend another sister's wedding in Belpre. We don't get together often, so Byron's place was a great central point and convenient for the wedding.
It was clean, easy to access, and close to restaurants and grocery stores. Some of our local family came over for dinner so we used the grill. We sat on the deck and enjoyed food and conversation. We took a long walk around the neighborhood and across the bridge to Point Park on the WV side of the river.
The house was exactly as described, except for the pictures of the view from the deck. It is much more scenic! There is a great sofa for napping and the kitchen is well-designed for cooking and serving.
If you need to stay in the Parkersburg/Belpre area, consider Byron's place. We really enjoyed it and think you will, too."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying at this property! HUGE FAN. Cannot recommend this place any higher!
Byron is a wonderful host - super quick & responsive.
The property is lovely and the view of the barges and the faint sound of a train off in the distance.. absolutely lovely!
You won’t want to miss this place if given the chance!"
2023-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,This place was very nice however I was told i would be charged for quest that did not stay but was seen on camera coming an going. Also furniture an spots on the carpet that was already there. I advise to take pictures when you check in. I have family an freinds that live close by that i dont get to see often that took advantage that i was in town an wanted to see me. Other then that the place is great

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful spot right at the bend in the river. Trains and barge trains to watch passing along the river corridor from the balcony. Clean and spacious inside. Consider popping up to the old fort site on the hill across the river for panoramic views of the two valleys!

The second story deck is my favorite place to have coffee and watch the barges on the river. Third time here. We will never stay anywhere else when we come to town. Byron is a great host who communicates well. He actually messaged me to be sure our check-in went ok. This place is a gem right on the Ohio River! I’d give it more than 5 stars if that was an option!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Over the last 8 years we have stayed in hotels while visiting family in the Belpre/ Marietta area 4 to 6 times a year. What a wonderful surprise when a friend told us about Byron’s place, I honestly can’t say enough about how much we love it.
To begin with, it feels very safe. It’s a wonderful neighborhood where people walk their dogs and say hello as they pass by. The deck on the second floor is a great place to sit and have your coffee and read the paper as you watch the boats go up and down the river. This place has everything you need and most of what you would want. The beds are so comfortable and the bedding is first class. The “ rain shower” feels like heaven!!!
The kitchen has everything you need to cook whatever you want with top of the line appliances. The grocery store is less then 2 miles away and you have several fast food/ restaurants very close also.
One very important thing for me is cleanliness. I’ve stayed here 3 times and each time I have found it spotless.
If you have to leave your home,,,,this is the place to stay."

And the price was very reasonable.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Nice clean residence, view of river, in quiet neighborhood"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We traveled from DC to Belpre for a friends engagement party happening in Parkersburg, WV and this was a perfect location.
You enter the house through the basement and unfortunately the light had been out when we arrived, but Byron gave us a heads up so we knew what to expect. Once we got inside and went upstairs through the basement, the house was stunning and so clean! I think it’s even nicer than the pictures listed.
There was a tv with cable, kurig with k cups and a few tea bags, half and half in the fridge.
Byron himself made the stay all the better! So responsive and helpful. A 10/10 human being and host. I would 10000% stay here again and I recommend it.
*Pro-tip there is a donut shop not far from the house called Mchappy’s and I definitely recommend a stop by!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"easy to find. quiet neighborhood. plenty of hot water, comfy beds, clean clean clean. loved the deck. sat out there at nite and just watched the lights reflect off the river with a blanket and glass of wine."

Great kitchen with all amenities you would need including coffee. It truly felt like our home away from home because I was able to wash all our clothes before packing to head home. We would definitely come back should we travel this direction again.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful. Lovely views. Clean, spacious, good location. Quick responses from Bryon. Perfect place for a Mid Ohio Valley stay."

2021-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Very comfortable and cozy place. All the convinces of home. Great host and he responds in a timely manner. Place looks the pictures. Also, I loved that this place is in a quiet neighborhood convenient to everything. I'm traveling Nurse that works nightshift so this was a plus. I would definitely stay here again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place on the river.
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great location that is well represented in the photos and generally clean. This is a good place to stay for a small group of people if you're in the area. However, I'm giving a lower rating based purely on the lack of communication from the host which I'll go into detail below.
I initially received no communication from the host, not when I initially booked the location nor leading up to the check in day. There was also no information given on how to check in beyond the listing itself or any general follow up before the trip approached.
So the day before the trip I sent another check-in message in the AM to see if things were okay. There was no response for the entire day so I had to reach out via calling the host. This was the only communication I had with the host, which was less than 24 hours before travelling from out of state to the airbnb.
Ultimately, check in was fine but it was stressful to not know if I was even going to be able to check in and not having any communication prior to me independently needing to call to figure things out."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place! Super clean, Super host! Conventnent location. Will definitely stay again! Well worth the money. Lady Candace Moss Smead"

We had a great weekend.
Thank you Bryon."

Quiet, clean, has everything you need, plenty of parking, fluffy bath towels, nice deck, with great view of the Mighty Ohio River. Is super convenient to lots of things. The street is quiet, especially at night. Plenty of room. We have family and friends that live nearby, and can have them over to visit and not feel cramped. Byron is very responsive. We love staying here!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Highly recommend this place. Very nice and clean. Great neighborhood too.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were surprised with the overall cleanliness of the rental. Anything you could need from Keurig Coffee Refills to Shampoo, Conditioner, Lotion. Washer & Dryer was very convenient, and plenty of room in the home. It's in a nice area, with nice homes, yet the homes aren't right on top of you...so you feel you have space. I'm a Travel Nurse that's worked lots of ER & Psych units, so I understand how important logistics and feeling safe are. For the price you cannot beat it.👍 We came up to cater a wedding with food prep, flower design & wedding equipment,... the whole deal. There was ample space for our cargo trailer.
All around, one of the BETTER places we've Ever stayed!
In addition, the owner happened to be near, and he is just as Awesome. A place you for sure would stay each time you visited the area... 💯%"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is perfect for 2 couples to stay in. The beds are super comfortable and so are the couches. The balcony is perfect to on and relax and enjoy the view.

2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our quick stay at Byron's house. It was the perfect overnight in between stops. It was relaxing and CLEAN, which is something that I value! My only complaint would have to be the living room furniture. However comfortable, it was very worn and ripped all over! we put a sheet over it and it was fine tho!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for our stay to visit family in Parkersburg. Great safe, beautiful location. Very clean and comfortable"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a delightful stay at Tersia's AirBnb! The space was cozy, and perfectly outfitted for everything needed for our trip. Our favorite highlights included: fun/eclectic decor, a super comfortable bed and linens, and a great coffee nook with reading chair. Tersia went above and beyond by offering fresh pastries which we thoroughly enjoyed! We will for sure be repeat customers."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is amazing. The use of every nook and corner in a functional way ~ in the attic spaces was outstanding! It was roomy, cozy (the blankets and comfort!!), well lit with options, beautifully doctorates and furnished… it had every amenity needed. The baked treats!!!! I used every bit of the airtime t in my short stay ~ the kitchen had everything needed. The bathroom was adorable and beautifully done. Books, TV, a little nook with a chair and coffee station ~ that’s where I woke up. The bed was sooooo comfortable!!! I can’t say enough. It’s a gorgeous house and the neighborhood is wonderful. Don’t pass this up."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The apartment was really cute in a great neighborhood and was close to restaurants and the playhouse. We enjoyed relaxing there and exploring Parkersburg. We will definitely stay there again when we need to go back. Parking is around back off of an alley which we figured out easily.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved staying at Tersia’s charming apartment. It is extremely well decorated and gives a cozy feel as soon as you enter. Everything from the bathroom layout to the uniquely painted cabinets show that a lot of attention to detail went into designing a comfortable and warm atmosphere for you to enjoy. Highly recommend and look forward to staying again the next time we are in Parkersburg.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tersia’s place was wonderful and very relaxing! Very homie and just all around beautiful! She was very responsive and very much cared about our stay being a great one! Highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nothing is missing to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable! Parking is easy and plentiful. Yes, it's 36 steps up to the entrance, but the stairs are practically brand-new and well-lit - no problem! The kitchen and bath are well-stocked with snacks, water, juice and toiletries. There is a coffee station in the cute reading nook. The unit is in a fully-restored home in the historic district -- quiet and so walkable -- close to downtown destinations. It is an attic apartment, so tall folks need to be mindful of multiple ceiling heights, and the shower stall is tiny. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the almost authentic, unique, beautiful, and well thought out AirBnbs I’ve ever stayed in. Cannot recommend enough."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was absolutely amazing! The landscaping in the backyard was literally a mini paradise, the interior decor was so chic/cute, and you can tell the place receives tons of love and attention. I would definitely stay here again if I was ever in the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute, artsy unit in a lovely, walkable neighborhood of historic homes. It's well depicted in the photos. Very clean. Quiet, even with the adjoining unit occupied. The pastries were fresh and delicious. Bathroom is tight and the stairs can be tricky with luggage but Tersia has gone above and beyond to ensure you'll have a comfortable stay. Book it!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A beautiful place to stay inside and out. We walked around the historic neighborhood looking at the old houses and then had a delicious dinner at Wine Down on Market just a short block away. Tersia had the place spotlessly clean and full of character, and at an amazing value. We left already making plans to visit again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Tersia's place was so cute. A lot of thought was put into it and it is a nice little space. The historic district near Juliana St is a lovely walk early in the morning. Tersia was so helpful in her instructions on how to find her place. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone needing accommodations in the area. 5 stars!!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, a fantastic place in a convenient and historical area!! Would highly recommend to anyone interested in looking to stay downtown!! HOSTING WAS IMPECCABLE"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I enjoyed our stay. The apartment is just as described and in a great location (downtown restaurants are walkable). The neighborhood has pretty awesome historical homes. The site is also very close to Point Park (>5 minute car ride) to take the boat to Blennerhasset Island. Tersia was very responsive with questions. It was a little tricky to navigate to get to the parking spot initially through the alley (lots of one way roads in the area) but we figured it out! Would love to stay again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tersia was an awesome host! Very responsive and friendly. Her place was so adorable and very clean with lots of extras such as delicious snacks and pastries, coffee, tea, etc. Loved how it was decorated. The bed was extremely comfortable. I would highly recommend staying at Tersia's place and I really hope to be back. Thank you so much, Tersia, for making our trip extra special and comfortable!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"OMMMGGG
This place was so cute. I stayed overnight for a concert celebrating my birthday. Tersia was an amazing host ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tersia's Airbnb (Tabby's Ln.) was exactly like the pictures. Adorable! We found the apartment with no problems. The key was in the lock box (code was provided a couple of hours before check-in) right where she said it would be. The apartment interior was expertly decorated. She had all sorts of books for all types of interests. The space was kept cool with a beautiful wall mounted AC unit in the bedroom, as well as an oscillating tower fan in the living room. There was a wonderful little coffee/reading nook right by the window where quite a few coffee choices were available as well as green tea (k-pod coffee maker). A large screen TV was located in the living room and there were so many channel choices. We only stayed one night so I'm a little sad we didn't get to use the gas range in the kitchen, but it was a beautiful set up.
Tersia has gone above and beyond our expectations! We would definitely love to visit again! ♥️"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tersia was a great host, and the listing was great. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tersia’s place was perfect!
It was private, clean, close to everything you’d ever need, and I haven’t slept better in months…the bed was amazing! On short notice, it was the closest place to Athens I could find. But honestly, I may go back for weekend visits just to get away and hang out in Parkersburg!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay, will be booking again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very chic apartment that is conveniently located in historic district of Parkersburg. Lots of extra touches and amenities, would definitely recommend . Note it is on 3rd floor but very well lit with safety measures."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tersia's place was excellent! The location was extremely beautiful, and the apartment was super cozy! There were so many personalized touches that made our stay feel like home. My only note would be that the fragrance was fairly overpowering if you are sensitive to that sort of thing. Other than that, our stay was lovely!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My daughter and I have stayed here twice. We love staying here! We walk into town for dinner and drinks. Tersia is always responsive, friendly and helpful. The bed is very comfortable. I like sitting at the window in her coffee nook and wake up in the morning. Heads up. If you have knee/foot/hip problems, the stairs can be daunting."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Right in the heart of Parkersburg’s Julia-Ann Square Historic District. Walkable to downtown restaurants and art and historical venues.
Nicely stocked with toiletries, water bottles, and coffee. It is evident the owners put a lot of thought into making the space comfortable for guests. A lot of stairs to get in, but the description says it is 3rd floor! Parking in the back that is clearly marked with the street number. All in all, thoughtfully appointed. Would definitely recommend and stay again."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A really wonderful place to stay! We only stayed a couple of nights, but, this is a place you would be very comfortable for longer or extended stays as well.

What I especially liked was how well-stocked the kitchen was with pans, cooking utensils, spices, and oil."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judy is a communicative and fantastic host who cares about her guests and gives them their privacy as well. Her airbnb is close to West Virginia and downtown Marietta. The neighbors dog gets on your nerves after a while. But, obviously, this is not an issue on the hosts end. Therefore, it doesn’t affect my review. I would recommend staying here and know I will when in the area again."

I'm sure you will see us on future visits."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great affordable place on a quite road close to the edge of town. It is connected to the house so she doesn’t like a lot of noise after 11pm. She has just a few hot plates for cooking but everything else you need is there.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great landing spot if you’re visiting Marietta. Very clean and accommodating. I pretty much used this for a spot to sleep and shower.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Judy’s place was extremely cozy, comfortable and very accommodating. We really enjoyed the tree at Christmas time!"
2020-12-01,3,Stayed one night,"We appreciated how quiet and private Judy's apartment was. We had no issues with check-in or finding the place. My husband enjoyed the Keurig coffee that was there, and Judy included a helpful information sheet on backing out of her driveway (it's a little curvy and on a hill!). The bed was too soft for our liking, but that is definitely a matter of personal taste! Unfortunately, the apartment was just not as clean as we expected it to be with the ""sparkling clean"" ratings and reviews. There was dust in a number of visible places, smudges on the mirror, some dirt on some of the walls...probably nothing a good spring cleaning wouldn't help with! Overall, we had a pleasant overnight stay, and I hate to leave a less-than-5 star review. But I would have liked to have known to anticipate a less-than-sparkling-clean place as I looked at reviews before booking."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I chose the Road Runner because of the combination of the great reviews and low cost. The apartment was very comfortable, and Judy, who I met when I moved in, was pleasant and helpful. The location is just a couple of miles to beautiful downtown Marietta. I was grateful to have this option for my stay and look forward to staying there again."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"For all travelers you can expect
most pleasant experience with
MissJudy at the Road Runner"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Judy's place is great. The apt is as nice, and maybe even nicer, than the pix. It's a short drive to downtown Marietta and to a cool Covered Bridges route. I could see it being a great place to stay for a few days to explore the area.
I had asked beforhand if the driveway was large enough for me to turn around since I was pulling a trailer with my car. It turns out the driveway is one way on a hill, and I wouldn't have booked the place if I knew this. Judy was great about helping me leave -first trying to guide me down and then, when that failed, calling her son to lend a hand. She was such a great hostess to go above and beyond like that.
I highly recommend this place."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place for a rest and a movie! Convenient to i-77. Clean and comfortable 🙂
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judy provides a beautifully designed place. The lay out really makes sense, which helped us have a great stay. We love the nice large bathroom and shower that has great pressure and nice hot water. The walk-in closet has great places to unpack luggage and hang clothes. The couch is very comfortable and a little dining table is just the right size for two people. It’s nice to have a full sized fridge. The full size bed was a little soft for me, but the linens are soft and comfy."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Good place to stay. Quick response to queries
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judy’s place is clean, cozy, & perfect for your trip to Marietta!"

2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Coming from Nebraska, I was looking for something quiet and out of the ways a bit. I came to visit a friend and she was only 15 minutes away which made it very easy for her to pick me up at the start of each day. Upon entering, I couldn’t help but LOVE the smell. I had to ask Judy what it was I loved it that much! I will definitely be returning!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 5th AirBnB stay, (If I remember right) and my best. The apartment was absolutely perfect, through & through. The kitchen was stocked with everything, even ice and the cold packs to use in your cooler, coffee, creamer, snacks, water, and so much more. The living room had a very comfy
couch, tv, with DVDs, cable, all you would need to keep you occupied.
The bed was super comfy, slept great. There is a utility room, with an iron & ironing board, and plenty of space to hang your clothes if more long term. The bathroom is wonderful, and well stocked, even a blow dryer, and scales.
There's also a small table with 2 chairs to eat at, in an open concept floor plan. It was super clean, and nicely decorated. It's a little out of town, but just a short drive. I saw more of Marietta than I ever have, being off the main drag. There's no steps to worry about, good even for the elderly. The shower is elderly friendly.
I'd love to stay there anytime I'm in Marietta. A great find."

2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is one of the best airbnbs we’ve stayed at and we stayed at many. It is a warm and inviting space. The brown tones and squared off but open space design, plus the arrangement and ease of everything made us feel right at home. A balance of helping us feel grounded and a feeling of space around us after traveling for awhile. Slept so well! Spacious enough to do yoga in the morning. My only regret is that we didn’t have a reason to be there more than one night. It was so cozy. I can see all the thought and love that Judy put in to the creation of this space herself. It kind of reminded me of the IKEA showrooms—I always wondered what it would be like to stay in one of those spaces. For us, it was a bit difficult to find the entrance to driveway at night. Hopefully, that may change. We enjoyed wandering Marietta; and she is 5 minutes away from a very significant Earthworks Mounds. If ever we travel through there again, we will definitely keep RoadRunner’s Haven in mind! And we will let others know! The name suits it well."

Bottom line... you can NOT go wrong with this sweet find!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Roadrunner's Haven was perfect for our weekend trip to Marietta. It was a beautiful space and very tidy.

2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed with Judy several times, and Roadrunner’s Haven is my preferred place to stay in the area! It’s consistently clean, a very nicely furnished space, and has everything I need when I’m in town for work. I would highly recommend it!"

2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the second time I have stayed here, and it has been wonderful! The location is close to town, but far enough for it to be peaceful and quite! If you are in the area, treat yourself to this Air BnB! 👍"

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was one of the cleanest units I have ever stayed in.Only a few minutes to town ,however the solitude of the setting was remarkable.The extra touches made my stay even more special."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great as always!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Judy’s place was great. It’s super clean and comfortable. We loved our stay
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Judy was amazing! If I had an inquiry, she responded promptly. Furthermore, her place is quite, in a nice location, and is sparkly clean. If you are in her area, you should book asap! 👍"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Judy was a great host to have during my visit to Marietta. The apartment was extremely clean and we were greeted with little snacks like popcorn and granola bars and coffee. Judy was quick to respond to my messages. I recommend this place to anyone who is visiting the Ohio Valley area!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Judy's roadrunner haven was a great place to stay! She's thought of absolutely everything you could possibly need and was available for help if needed. She and her dog were both incredibly welcoming and the very comfortable bed was a definite plus. I'd be happy to stay here again!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Judy’s place was clean, easy to locate, and included everything needed for a weekend stay. Plenty of space to relax and unwind after a busy day."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay! The bed was comfortable, the room was clean and peaceful. Over all great experience!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Roadrunner’s Haven was the perfect place to stay here in Marietta. Judy has the place nicely and cleanly furnished. She provides amenities like toiletries, snacks, water, and coffee & tea. I love the private bathroom, sitting area, and kitchen, while still having direct access to Judy if needed. I will definitely stay here again!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay at Judy’s was perfect. Will use her location again.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Can’t think of a better Airbnb that I’ve stayed. Roomy, private, immaculately clean, I wanted for nothing and the value was a pleasant surprise. If you are in the area you will be glad I recommended this stay!!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed at Judy's twice during my travel nursing contract. I can't even tell you what a great value and blessing her home has been for me!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So cozy, stylish and great use of space. I was here while traveling as a night shift nurse. It had everything I needed. The bed was super comfy. Just thought of everything for her guests. I didn’t need to ask for a thing. It’s definitely the best value for money I’d seen in the area."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,I totally appreciate Judy's great communication including directions and details.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a unique stay this is the place. Ideal for an individual. A couple might feel claustrophobic in the loft bed, but after all, the listing is for a tiny house. I had a good stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed tiny house. As a couple traveling though the area, this was a way better decision than a hotel. More memorable and you got to climb a ladder to your bed 👀"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a delightful stay…so clean and the host makes everything effortless for the guest. I will definitely stay next time I am in town.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Cozy little home. Perfect for one person for a few nights.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was a beautiful, clean place amd jason was very easy to deal with. Would definitely stay again"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic place! Really enjoyed the exterior space to hang out and read on a beautiful day. Inside is very comfortable and clean and has everything you need. Conveniences are near by if needed. I would certainly stay hear again. Very cool tiny home and very well done.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I always wanted to stay in a “tiny home”. Very cozy and had everything I needed.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our stay here, perfect for a couple! Lovely private outdoor fire pit/swing to enjoy. Only recommendation: put a tiny trash can in the bathroom <3"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Though we had an unexpected occurrence that required checking out a few days early, the residence and host were fantastic."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Our first stay in a Tiny Home. Very clean and well stocked with items used. Due to our age (over 60) the ladder to the loft bed was a little difficult for us to use in the middle of the night. Not at all the host's fault. We just weren't aware of the limitations an older couple would have with a tiny home. All necessary items were well stocked and fans and heater unit were very easy to operate. Wi-fi worked great along with the smart TV. Really appreciated the coffee and cream that were available. For a Tiny Home it offered everything we needed. I do believe though that younger more agile couple would not have any issues with the ladder and the loft bed access. I believe our flexible days may be over. LOL
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,So cute! We loved our stay in the tiny house.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jason’s tiny house in was perfect and comfortable for the week I stayed there. I had the best experience and will be back.

Thank You Jason for hosting
Us. We hope to stay again in the future."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super easy check in. The cabin is adorable and super clean, great way to just relax for the weekend. The loft space definitely is smaller than it looks in pictures, but very doable (I am 5’3”, he’s about 5’11”)."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was great. It is definitely a tiny home. I am 5’9 and it was so much fun figuring out how to fit! House was very clean and cozy. Only thing I would add is an extra bed pillow. My husband always talks about tiny homes so this was a great place for us to stay. We loved it!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! So cute and cozy. Loved the little outdoor area just wish that it would’ve been enclosed for the dogs.

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing Place for a getaway!
Loved staying in the tiny house. The mini fridge kept everything cold and the warm water in the shower was nice. Marietta is a cute town to explore with things to do and there are parks and trails to keep you busy close to Parkersburg. There is also a soap store and a mall close by.
Overall a great stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cabin was perfect for a relaxing evening. Clean, quiet, and comfortable. The loft is a little tricky to get in and out of and has a short ceiling. I ended up staying in the couch after my mid sleep pee."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Jason’s place was perfect for a 1 night stay! It is cute and was clean!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This tiny house is super cute! The loft area is quite cozy but it was perfect in all other areas. Jason’s a great host.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, great stay and fit our needs for the short visit we had in Parksburg, WV. The loft was definitely a small space, but cozy. A few answers here and there, but a quick spray of the outside, it was fine. Would recommend this spot to anyone and would stay again."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The property came as advertised. It was clean, private, and very relaxing.

The property is a great value, and there are a lot of thoughtful touches to make you feel right at home."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The Tiny house is a great stay! I stayed here after a day of mountain biking and it was the perfect place to end the day. Jason is one of the kindest hosts I've come across. The place was spotless when I arrived. The little kitchenette has everything you'll need. The loft bed was extremely comfortable and the TV area was very cozy. The fire pit and swing were a peaceful amenity to wind down at the end of the day.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My dream is to live in a tiny house so I booked a little get away for myself. I work remotely and the Internet/space was more than adequate. I was able to take my little dogs!! They aren’t used to being “in town” so the neighbors getting in and out of their car at all hours set them off. But otherwise it was PERFECT. The host was amazing. I was able to Doordash food and cook and just relax. The towels and bedding were soft and smelled great! Everything I needed was right there. The place was clean. I will return again. :)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place to unwind. Came equipped with everything I needed. Felt super safe as a solo female traveler and loved that my dog was welcome.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Tiny house is really cute and it is a real Tiny house experience, it has everything that you need. The house is just as the pictures and the place offers a lot of privacy and it is very quiet. (This is not related to the house if you have pets be sure to have your ticks treatment up to date because my dog got several ticks on her in a short walk, she has short hair so it was really easy to spot them and it wasn't a big deal but you should absolutely be careful if your bring your dog in summer)"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"it's an actual TINY house. big people avoid. this house is for small folks. very clean! has everything you need. TV had a hard time running without just going black. everything worked. Jason was very nice, and instructions were clear. bed was actually comfortable. watch out for seiling fan as you climb the ladder to bed. hit my ass everytime! haha people who live behind it are in and out slamming car doors. there's a kid that rides his dirt bike by every evening and loves to Rev it up as he passes. I felt it more for a couple trying to have romantic and reclusive get away."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and host!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jasons place was pristine! A little off the beaten path, but very peaceful and private."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute place! Check in and out was easy and the place was very cozy and comfortable. The loft bed was also very comfortable and theres plenty of light and fans and outlets and chargers for whatever you’re charging! It’s a tiny space but feels big. The kitchen has everything you need and the bathroom was stocked too! Oh, and Jason was very responsive and was super friendly flexible with my request for a late checkout. You should definitely stay here if you get a chance! I’m sorry I couldn’t stay longer."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was just in and out on a short business trip. It was a really neat, clean cool little place. Jason was great, let me check in late."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny home was perfectly located near everything we wanted to see. It is in a beautiful area, and is not far from great shopping, historic sites, and restaurants.
The tiny home had everything we needed. It was well-stocked with coffee, towels, and other necessities.
The bed in the loft was very comfortable, but my head did hit the ceiling on occasion. I am a tall man.
If you are curious about the tiny home movement and want a taste of tiny home life, this would be a great place to evaluate.
Jason has a great place at a great price!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Awesome stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great time staying here. Loved how close it was to everything. We lost our key on accident and Jason the host got us right back in within a matter of minutes. Everything was clean, the blankets and sheets smelled great. Loved the swing outside as well."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An adorable quiet retreat!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is adorable and also very functional. I only stayed one night, a cute stop as I was passing through on my way to school in Ohio, but I wished I could have spent a day or two longer there and that my partner was there to enjoy it with me. Great little spot."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a little treasure, this tiny house is an adorable place to stay. My daughter and I enjoyed the fire pit as soon as we arrived.

We had everything we needed and would stay here again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved staying here! Fantastic opportunity to stay in a tiny house if you happen to be in Parkersburg

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"it was a nice clean place just as described, loved the visit!"
2022-12-01,3,Stayed one night,"Host was AWESOME and great at communication. The tiny was very simple and not extremely comfortable (couch was very uncomfortable and small loft even for a tiny house) and just overall not my favorite tiny house stay, but was great for the price and did the job. However, the host was very understanding when we couldn’t get a window shut again and communicated promptly which I appreciate greatly and wish him the best!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The tiny house was perfect! so warm and cozy. very comfortable and well equipped. wish i could have stayed longer.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little home. Close to restaurants and shopping but on the outskirts of town. Visited for a couple of days with my boyfriend. The home was clean and nice. No complaints. It was easy to find and an easy check-in. Will return in the future.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Small in stature, but big on cozy! This tiny house is adorable. We were here on a super cold night- so sadly we couldn’t enjoy the swing and the fire pit- I envy anyone who stays here and does! The fence around the house makes it feel like your own private little oasis. The house itself has everything you need and nothing you don’t. Jason was an excellent host- super communicative!
10 out of 10 would stay here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great tiny house
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the first stop on our cross country road trip and it was just perfect. The place is indeed tiny, but has all the amenities one would want and need, and is very clean and so cozy. The neighborhood is quiet, so we got a very restful sleep before the second leg of our trip. Jason was very easy to communicate with, which we appreciated. We'd certainly stay again if and when we're next in the area!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house, in a great location , host was awesome, kept in touch with us before check in & throughout our stay to ensure we were comfortable. Can't wait to stay again !!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at this tiny home with the fur child. Very well crafted tiny. The space was perfect for the amount of time we spent in WV. The outdoor fire areas was also such a treat on our last night there.
My only comment, (because I’m a little boushy when it comes to sleep, lmao) would be that if you’re partial to your own mattress bring a pillow or blanket that better suits your slumber. (I did not think ahead!) 😂🫶🏼
Other than that Jason was very welcoming and responsive. Would definitely recommend!"
2022-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Bad couch, ran out of hot water. Meh…"

This house was a fantastic place to stay! Thanks Jason!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Awesome spot!
2022-05-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"The tiny house was very clean. The 20$ cash tip for their cleaning lady was very inconvenient and I wish it was just added to the booking free. It was nice that firewood was provided, but the surroundings of the tiny house were unappealing. If you’re looking for private and secluded this is not it."

2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Good stay, just didn’t appreciate having to leave an extra $20 for pet hair when 1) the place says pets are allowed so it should be expected and 2) there was already a decent amount of dog hair when we got there"

2022-01-01,4,Stayed about a week,"I want to start by saying the experience overall was positive. The tiny house is a unique experience and Im glad I was able to stay there! The bed was comfortable, the loft it was in small but manageable. Though if youre taller than 5'5"" it may be a bit more difficult overall as the house is short! The shower head and water pressure were mediocre but did just fine. The provided bed linens were very minimal and the blanket was thin and the sheets and blanket felt small for two people to share. There is no sink in the bathroom, though the kitchen sink is just outside the bathroom door. The wifi was quite bad, doesnt work well up in the loft, and we often had to resort to using our data."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This tiny home is so cozy and is stocked with everything you could possibly need for your stay. My fiancé, dog, and I had such a wonderful time here and especially loved hanging out by the fire pit around back. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a peaceful short term getaway!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stay in Air Bnbs regularly, and I'm not exaggerating when I say this is one of my all-time favorites. It totally exceeded my expectations. The art blew me away. It was much larger than I expected. Lots of special touches, like very nice glassware for wine and cocktails. The bathroom had lots of products. The bed was super comfortable, and the living room furniture and decor was stylishly fun. Great restaurants in walking distance. There are museums that I didn't have time to visit. I hope to plan a trip back to Marietta just to stay there a few days."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this RC downtown
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Located adjacent to a restaurant/bar. During our stay restaurant/bar held a glow stick / dance party. Music and noise from party clearly heard in loft and adversely affected resting at night. Quietness of location is dependent on the events held by local businesses.
Guests are responsible for hand washing and putting away their own dishes. The cleanliness of the utensils, plates, glasses and cookware dependent on how well the previous guests clean up after themselves. The guest(s) prior to my stay did not clean appropriately as dried food was present on items in cabinet and utensils I took out to use during my stay.
Guests are responsible for determining if any other bedding (aside from sheets/pillowcases) is ""soiled"" and warrants being placed in hamper for washing.
Hair from previous guest in shower and on shower curtain.
Convenient location. Hosts quick to communicate. Clear instructions."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great. It was in the middle of the history/culture of the region we wanted to see. It had wonderful features -- hardwood floors, plenty of items for the kitchen, clean towels, plenty of blankets.
My only regret was moving into the place. My wife and I packed a single suitcase. We should have packed two smaller carry-on bags due to the narrow stairs. Live and learn.
Keep in mind, you are living in a downtown apartment. There may be road noises that you will hear, but this can become so much white noise too.
Marietta is a charming community and the entire region is rich in history, educational institutions, river culture and more."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a hip, charming spot! The location was ideal for a weekend stay in Marietta - I walked out the front door for a jog around town, and we picked up dinner and coffee less than a block away. The bedroom was quiet and comfortable. The owners thought of everything - from plenty of toiletries in the bathroom should you need anything, to glassware for all types of drinks. The highlight of the place is the decor and artwork. We took many notes for things we would like to add to our home! It’s a stylish, perfect place for a getaway."

When it looked like the problem was going to continue, they even offered to pay for us to relocate.

The variety of coffee & creamer on hand was a pleasant surprise! Location is perfect for strolling around town. We loved browsing the shops & being able to walk down the sidewalk for a bite, rather than having to find parking every time we headed out and returned. While in town we attended a concert at the Adelphia Music Hall . . . awesome venue & comfy setup. Everywhere we've ate in town is delicious! A handful of faves: A few drinks at the Riverfront Bar & Grill, Great brews & lunch at the Harmar Tavern, treat yourselves out to a little gourmet at Austyn's, enjoy some local craft beer & top notch foods at Marietta Brewing Co. and this time we did check out Tanya's Country Kitchen just across the street for breakfast as we checked-out in the morning (quantity of food was fine and it was quiet) . . . however, we kicked ourselves for not driving over to the Busy Bee instead. Though they can get hopping the quality & service is great. Can't wait to visit Cindy & Kevin's loft again! Thank you for your hospitality & kudos to your cleaning crew for their immaculate service."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I rented this space to host boudoir sessions, and it was exactly what I was hoping for! The unique design lent itself well to the lens, and my models were very impressed.
I didn't stay overnight at all since dogs aren't permitted to visit (I have three and couldn't leave them home alone), so I can't speak to that side of the experience. However, I found the listing quite enjoyable overall. I found myself wanting to be there as much as possible.
Pros:
- Location (Surprisingly quiet, surprisingly spacious, great view of Front Street, SO close to many top attractions)
- Overall design/style (especially the Rousch painting, kitchen, neon light near the front window, trinkets hidden in the bricks above the stairs, teal green chairs, prints in the hallway going to the bedroom, main bathroom with clawfoot tub)
- Laundry offerings (though I didn't use them)
- ""Hosting"" amenities (tons of seating options, variety of glassware, cocktail shaker, wine accessories, cigar box, etc.)
- Variety of toiletries in the main bathroom cover all of the essentials (band-aids, acetone, Q-tips, makeup remover, lotions, etc.)
- Huge bedroom closet
- Wide variety of books & chaise lounge was very comfortable
- Check-in and out procedures were extremely easy
- Parking can be rough downtown, but it was very easy and accessible.
- Stairs weren't overwhelming; I expected more of a climb."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect location for exploring Marietta and convenient to shopping and restaurants. It is spacious and fully stocked. The bed was comfortable. It was nice to have 1-1/2 bathrooms.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best place to be in Marietta! Accurately described, incredibly clean and comfortable, with everything you need to make you feel at home. It’s in the perfect location on Front Street, has plenty of parking, and is sandwiched between the best restaurant (740 Social) and coffee shop (Jeremiah’s Coffee House) in town. Very convenient check-in and check-out, beautifully decorated with all amenities, it’s a perfect place to stay!"
