Thanks Charisse for allowing us to bring our dog with us at last minute notice, and giving us a discount at that. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for 4 months while I was finishing up my last semester of school, and it was absolutely perfect! Charisse was an incredible host who was always quick to respond to anything I needed help with and just really cared about my comfort. The place was exactly as listed with one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever had and just the perfect amount of space. It’s the perfect location as well for doing anything as everything in Downtown Provo is very close, but not so close that you have to deal with all the traffic and noise levels. Overall, I 100% recommend this place for everyone - it had everything I needed for a comfortable stay!"

Car was not needed as it was a very easy walk to downtown. Explored trails and area by using Bird Bike and scooters that were easy to fine. Then when we left we walked two blocks to the Car rental place to continue our journey. Provo is fantastic!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little house, close to downtown and BYU. It fit my needs perfectly. It was a little chilly, so there were extra heaters I had to use, but with those, it was fine. It's at the end of a residential street, but around it are businesses like an auto garage, pawn shop, and a motel, so be aware of that. It had everything I needed, the bed was comfy, and it's perfect for a quick stay for 1 or 2 people."

The studio was cozy, clean, and had amenities like a washer and dryer and a kitchen with appliances. My boyfriend and I were so impressed with how nice everything was! Plus the location is perfect, it’s walking distance to plenty of local shops and restaurants, and it’s right by the temple too so we were able to do all our sightseeing without having to drive everywhere. We loved everything about it and it ended up being the highlight of our trip! William was awesome too, he was very quick to answer all of our questions .

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Myself and my mother felt right at home during our stay! It was a cute little place and had all the amenities we needed for our stay. The tv was huge which made for great entertainment during our nights in. There wasn’t too much commotion outside and we both slept great every night of our stay. Even though the house is on a frequented street it never once felt like it. It felt very private and it was easy to feel at home! We would 10/10 recommend and 10/10 stay again if available :)

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I made a mistake and thought I booked for two nights, but I really only booked for one. William was very understanding and sympathetic.
The place was great and everything was as expected in the unit. It was clean, comfortable, and well thought out.
The location was not as I expected. I expected it to be surrounded completely by other houses. But it was partially surrounded by houses and partially by commercial and industrial buildings."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re interested in this little cute spot, don’t hesitate & book it! Super clean, smelled wonderful, the set up is so perfect. We felt very comfortable.

2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice stay definitely cozy, however ! We recommend installing a peephole since we had someone trying to come in into the apartment. it was a bit scary that we couldn’t see who it was, we open the door and it seem like it was an older man confused.
Other than that I really appreciate that this little cozy apartment had absolutely everything you could need thank you so much for having the most great essentials put into this studio. :) I definitely think that’s what made it more cozy and inviting."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,it was great for the quick night we needed in provo
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little studio. Very clean and was exactly how described. Check in was very easy and pricing was amazing. Studio did not have central heat but we were supplied with a space heater and it worked perfect! 10/10 would definitely stay here again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very affordable place to stay if you want to check out the salt lake area, which is ~ a 30 drive. Matt is incredibly responsive, always replying within an hour to address any questions or concerns."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Matthew's place is great!! Easy to get to, great parking, perfect sized place for a couple to crash, really comfortable bed, cozy quiet environment and was a perfect point to stop for the night!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing stay! The place was lovely, and very clean- and it had anything you could ever need in a small place like that! The overhead light switches from bright-white to a dim yellow, which was a super cool detail. The oven doesn't have a digital interface to check the temperature, but we figured that sticking a thermometer into a cracked oven-door is super effective. For the price, GO FOR IT!! The only downside is that the place is a tad far from some of the public transport lines, making it a hassle to trek around. I stayed in Provo in November when it was around 50°-60° during the day, obviously it got to the higher 30's at night, but I can only imagine going in January and trying to catch a bus (just make sure you're obviously appropriately dressed for Utah weather!), and having to walk quite a ways. But that's not a huge deal. Over all, amazing stay, and I would definitely stay again if I had better method of transport, but that's an issue on my end! Happy traveling everyone!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a cute little place to stay that was just right for my needs. It was a good price and easy to find and access. The bed was comfortable, I had everything I needed, and I was close to BYU and the other places I was going. It was a little tricky parking my big car 😉 and there was a loud noise in the middle of the night from the upstairs neighbors (maybe the hot water since that was the case in the bathroom I used?) along with some stomping around, but nothing major. I would stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,No complaints. Smooth process.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute little place comfy cozy and Matthew was very responsive and friendly definitely would book again when in the area for sure love it!!

Great getaway!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here for a conference, and I had a great experience. It’s in a quiet part of Provo, but it’s not far from the rest of town. It was what I needed for my stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew’s place was incredibly cozy and comfortable. It’s a small apartment that has everything you might need during your stay.

Everything was clean and tidy, and Matthew was super nice and responsive at all times. Great experience."

2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"This was a good place to stay while passing through town. Nothing fancy but has everything you need. As a heads up: there is a loud, high-pitched noise when the water in the unit and/or the water in the unit upstairs is running. So if the neighbor takes a late-night shower, you’re going to hear it… but it wasn’t a huge deal! Parking was easy. Bed was comfy."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt's place was perfect! little studio apartment with everything you could need at your fingertips. books a TV refrigerator kitchenette dishes and even toiletries in the bathroom if you happen to forget something. it's so bright and clean in there that I felt like I was staying in a hotel room. Matt was excellent at communication and got back to me right away, and I really appreciated the bright light on outside at the apartment door. it was late when I got in and I felt comfortable. I loved the keyless entry with the code made it really easy. Will be staying here again!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Matthew's place and would love to stay there again! Thankfully, he is an accommodating host and supplied some new toiletries in the bathroom, because I forgot my toothbrush and face wash somehow! I really appreciated not having to go out late at night to the drugstore for a toothbrush and the makeup remover wipes worked wonders. The space was perfect for my simple needs while I attended a conference in the area. Matthew provided great hospitality and the accommodation of a late check out. I would definitely book again next time I'm in town!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew's place was prefect. It was exactly what I had looked for and it matched the description and my expectations perfectly.

I hope to stay there again when I come back to Provo."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is just what the listing states, a studio apartment in an old residence that has been converted into three apartments. The outside of the building is not that appealing, but the inside is nicely redone and is a great option if you just need a place to sleep, bathe and make a meal for a few nights. I would stay again."

It was very quiet at all times of the day and night. Comfortable bed, clean linen, compact kitchen, but well stocked. Great shower and good amount of counter space in the bathroom.
I loved the ease of the locking mechanism you have and the view of the mountains from the window. You mentioned that you were new to Airbnb. I think you have done a great job. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again and would recommend it to friends."

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, great location, super nice place to stay for a few days, the only thing it failed to describe was its fair bit of bugs in and out of the house but apart from that I loved it and I would love to book again one day if it is possible."

I loved everything about my stay and will definitely be staying here again! Thanks Matthew!

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I stayed here during our time in Utah filming as extras in the TV show, The Chosen. It was really an amazing, clean, and comfortable place to come back to after long days of being on set. The beds were so comfortable it felt like coming home to a real house. All the finishes felt top notch, well thought out, and clean. If we get the chance to be extras in Utah again, we'd definitely have this place on the top of our list of AirBnb's to stay at. The only other thing I would say is that it would be nice to have some more blinds/curtains especially in the bathrooms. Other than that, it was absolutely perfect! One of the best AirBnB's we've stayed at. So grateful for this wonderful, homey, and high-end place to stay during our time here!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay. The unit was in a nice neighborhood that was close to a lot in Provo/Orem area. Beds were comfortable and the amenities were nice. Britani was also very responsive when we had some needs. Would 100% stay here again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place. It is in a great location for food and shopping and very easy to get in and out of. The host gave clear instructions on how to get in and even though the this listing is behind the main houae, we felt like we had our space and privacy. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Britani’s for a week while in town for a neuro treatment program and it was absolutely perfect! It felt very safe, and comfortable. The neighborhood and mountain views were gorgeous! The kitchen was well stocked to be able to cook while I was there with no issue. The master bedroom bed was very comfortable. There were multiple shopping and restaurant options close by. I’d definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in the Provo area! It really is the full package of clean, comfortable and very pretty!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Easy to find and comfortable.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I wish there was a TV in the bedroom. I did not notice that when I booked but the guest house was very nice and clean the beds were comfy and the location as lovely. Host was responsive and delightful.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can’t say enough great things about this place. Without a doubt the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Absolutely perfect. Highly recommend!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was my second time staying in the guest house. Love the location and the beautiful gated neighborhood. Great proximity to Provo and Sundance. Nice high end finishes throughout. Probably be staying again next time I’m in town.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Cutest little guest house behind a home in a very nice gated community of homes. Beautiful open kitchen with large island and the most comfortable bar stools ever! lots of natural light. Enjoyed sitting by the gas fireplace looking at the picturesque view of the Mountains and waking up to the same view every morning. Perfect for 2-4 people sharing one car(limited parking). Overall the best place to rent in the Provo Orem area!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful guest home! It had everything we needed from full kitchen to great bathrooms! The neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous and so quiet and peaceful! Love the location because it’s minutes from BYU and also an easy jump to get into the Provo Canyon. We’lll be back to stay here for sure!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our night away. The house was spotless, well furnished, very comfortable and in a fabulous neighborhood.

Location was fabulous and so were the mountain views.
We love it all and will return again. Highly recommend."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,My son and I stayed at the place and it was a very comfortable home away. The beds and bedding were soft just like ours at home. Every item we needed or adjustment we needed to make was accommodated quickly. The host and family are very kind and friendly. I would highly recommend this excellent location and space.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place that we would happily stay at again.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed over a week,"This is a gorgeous guest house in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. It’s clean and comfortable. It’s in the backyard (you can see the main house from the glass doors in the living room on the listing) of the host’s home so not super private. I didn’t feel comfortable opening the curtains often because I value my privacy. The host was filming a reality show which I wasn’t told about and there was a small issue getting out of the shared driveway due to the film crew. I would’ve appreciated some notice about that. I also don’t think I should be responsible for finishing the laundry from the previous guest which filled the washer and dryer. I had to specifically ask for the master bath to have towels before I realized they were all in the dryer. Otherwise a great stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent guest house in a very nice upscale development. The house is a stand alone unit behind the main house. Very comfortable and well furnished. We really enjoyed our stay here and will stay again if we have the opportunity.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The guest house was cozy and perfect in every way. Note, it looks directly at the main house through patio doors and the patio at main house is across the grassy yard from the cottage patio so if you’re looking for privacy, this may not be it."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa was great to deal with.
Place was better than expected use of the home not just the room.
Very impressed and a great price."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place could easily be 5 stars with a little maintenance.
The pros:
- Very clean (except for moldy/stained shower curtain)
- Nicely decorated and plenty of space
- Very comfortable beds and bedding
- Beautiful and quiet location
- Well-stocked kitchen
The cons:
- Only 2 washcloths for 4 people. We notified host but she didn't offer to do anything to remedy the situation so we had to buy or own washcloths.
- No hot water in 1st floor shower which meant my 88 year-old dad had to go to the 3rd floor to shower. When we told the host, she said that she was already aware of the problem. I think she should have notified us before that the shower was not useable.
- No shower gel even though it is listed as an included amenity.
- Only 2 small washing machine pods so bring your own if you plan to use the washer.
- Shower curtain was moldy/stained.
- Solid dripping faucet in bathroom.
- Bathroom sink did not drain.
- Need to strip beds, start a load of laundry and take all trash outside."

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent place, clean and comfy. Super close to BYU."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Good location, clean and nice play to stay. The beds and furniture were comfortable and everything is what you would expect. We had some trouble with no check-in info the day we arrived and the dead bolt was dead so could not get in. The host had to help us find a different way in. I have a feeling this issue doesn't happen often and is not normal. Just unlucky for us."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"This place was clean and wonderful to stay at! It had lot’s of room for everyone. The host was very responsive to any questions and/or needs we had. The only thing is there are a lot of stairs, but it states that in the listing."

The layout involves a number of stairs but the rooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable, the space is clean, quiet neighboorhood, close to downtown and we had almost everything we needed. The kitchen was well stocked. We did encounter a few relatively minor issues such as not receiving our check-in information the morning-of as advertised, difficulty using some of the devices such as the sinks (the automatic sink, and figuring out how to make the bathroom sinks drain), the downstairs shower, the lights, and the front door which we couldn’t make lock from the outside so we had to rely on the 3-minute auto-lock function. We lost access to opening/closing the garage door the following morning after checking in and couldn't get the car out until that was resolved.
Overall a good experience. Sydney was responsive and helpful.
Overall, the space provided what we needed with a few hiccups here and there."

2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"First impression from the outside was not good. Building is in need of some care. Front door blind broken in many spots, building needs painting, etc. and the cleaners had locked the door handle so automatic door lock didn't work. Jason got back to me within 30 minutes. The inside of the condo is very nice, new carpeting and clean. My only suggestions are to have hand towels in the bathrooms and replace the kitchen faucet with regular faucet. The sensor on faucet was not responsive and was very frustrating to use.
Also, parking spots are not clearly marked. Paint worn off and neighbor was parked in the condo's spot, which I didn't know. I was towed while using the visitor spot. I was not happy as I got there after 10:00pm and that was the only available spot. I had to pay to retrieve my car. I hope the owners will refund my $100. The parking is not clear in the inside book.
I would stay again now knowing what I know"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I come to Provo a couple of times a year to visit my daughter at BYU. This was a great location and was under a five minute drive from campus to pick her up and drop her back off. There was a view of the mountains from the living room and bedrooms. This was a relaxing visit and I spent a lot of time in Sydney’s place. I was very comfortable and felt right at home. The place was spacious and everything was very clean. Sydney was quick to respond to any questions or concerns I had. I would 100% stay here again!

Sydney was very responsive and helpful. We were traveling over the Christmas holiday and she even decorated per my request to make it special for my family! There is enough seating in the living room for my family of 5 to comfortably watch a movie together and have a meal around the dining table. You can enjoy a beautiful sunset from the living area, master bedroom, or upstairs guest bedroom each night. It is a little tricky to find using maps for iPhone but we managed. Its in a nice, quiet location and though its a townhome, we could not hear anyone around us. Plenty of options for watching TV (netflix, hulu, disney plus etc). We highly recommend!"

The combined living room and kitchen area is very well furnished and spacious including a big dining table and a large convenient sofa to rest. The kitchen was well equipped as well. On the second floor we had 2 spacious and very comfortable bathrooms. The house was very clean, and it looked exactly as on the photos.

Location was perfect for what we needed as well."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This townhome is the perfect stay if you have an event downtown or need a quiet place to stay for your outdoor adventures! The dual master bedrooms are great for accommodating two families. A shoe free home gave us assurance that kids could play on the floor and not worry. The home is very clean and includes all the basic kitchen tools needed for meals. The tub in the guest bathroom is great for a soak or getting your little ones clean! Will definitely stay again in the future!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super great spot. Quiet neighborhood close to BYU and all the action that surrounds it.

Kitchen is well stocked with bowls, plates, cutlery, and even some baking stuff which we used. Beds and bedding were comfortable and immaculate. It was just the right size for our family of four. The TV/living room area and sectional couch came with plenty of pillows and comfy blankets and easily fit two lazy adults and two teenagers when we decompressed after enjoying the outdoors. There were even some games and even a few Thomas the Tank Engine tracks. We’re coming back to this same place in February!"

2021-10-01,4,Stayed over a week,We had a comfortable stay at the townhouse. It was perfectly located and served as a good home for the 2 weeks we were there. The place could have been a little cleaner. We found it a little dirty and dusty in places and the kitchen could have been better equipped.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sydney’s place was a perfect home base for our family during a week of fun in Provo - conveniently close to BYU and direct access to I-15. We had plenty of room for our family and were extremely comfortable with the amenities provided. A heads up that check-out procedures require a little of your time (30ish min - stripping beds, etc), which we were happy to do, but some parties may need to know ahead of time for booking. We are planning a return trip to Provo next summer and would happily stay at Sydney’s place again."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay here! The location is lovely and convenient. The house itself is beautiful, comfortable, and spacious. The way the house is set up makes it easy to all hang out together, but also provides ample space for family members to find a quiet place to rest and relax too. We did a lot of cooking at home and the kitchen easily had the cookware needed.
Only suggestion for improvement, or something I would bring next time, would be a baby safety gate. Upon entry there is a steep wooden staircase the top of which is by the living room and we had to be on high alert to keep our toddler from trying to go down it."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This condo was amazing in every way. It was clean, spacious and our home away from home for over a week. Sydney was super easy to work with and very responsive to our questions and needs. We look forward to staying here again in the future!"

2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This townhouse is in a great location close to BYU and right next to the mountains. It’s very nicely furnished and the tv had a sound bar which made watching movies much nicer. Lots of nice touches and Sydney really thought of what would make a nice stay for a family. The carpet is sooo nice. Everything was clean and in order. The townhouse is older and the walls are thin so that’s just something to be aware of. My family really enjoyed our stay!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely LOVED our stay at Sydney’s place! The townhouse was stylishly decorated and had the most comfortable beds (and softest carpet). There was room to stretch out and enjoy hanging out together as a family. We would definitely stay here again!

2020-04-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay at this stylish townhome in Provo! It is close to BYU, and was within walking distance to our daughters’ apartment. The layout is great for a family, it feels more like a home and less like a townhome. We loved hanging out together on the main floor, had plenty of room for dining and watching movies at night. It was very clean, the beds were very comfortable, and the kitchen well-stocked. Shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom and plenty of towels and blankets available. The laundry room is conveniently located next to the kitchen so we could multi-task while making meals.
I don’t usually comment on carpet, but this carpet is amazing! I wanted to take it home with us! All in all, a really great place to stay in Provo.
We highly recommend Sydney’s place and will definitely return again!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We made our reservation late on the day that we needed a place to stay due an earthquake closing down the airport and canceling my husband's flight home . Sydney was quick to respond and to get the cleaning taken care of so that we could stay there.
The beds are very comfy, the carpet new and soft, the living spaces (kitchen, dining, sofa area) are big. Clean and beautiful! This being a townhouse among many townhouses, there are stairs to get in and stairs inside, and neighbors sharing walls on both sides.
Fortunately the neighbors were quite quiet when we were there. Nice, too, that there were 2 parking spaces."

There is just no comparison!! Everything in the place is new and updated and has all the conveniences of your own home. It’s a complete steal to stay here for the price! Thank you Sydney, I’ll definitely be back soon!"
2020-02-01,5,Group trip,"If you’re in the Provo area and need a clean, modern, comfortable and quiet place - look no further. Our family of 4 was more than adequately accommodated.

And the accommodation for my truck in the driveway was thoughtful and welcome. 🙏"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place to stay, well laid out, comfortable, and well stocked. Host was kind, happy to assist as needed, and very attentive. The bed was quite comfy, the cute counter table in the kitchen was great for work, and breakfast. perfect place to stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed for a night as a treat to myself on Mother's Day weekend. I wanted privacy, fast internet, and a good night's sleep, and I got all that and more. The room was very clean, and the bed was fairly comfy. I did hear footsteps upstairs in the evening and morning, but no one was loud enough to be much of a bother. The tub was great for a bubble bath. (I brought my own supplies.) I was hoping to find something to watch on Roku, but there wasn't much of a selection, so I just watched something on my laptop in bed, which suited me just fine. Marie and Reed communicated really well. Great experience overall!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The home was very clean, from the extra large towels to the good kind of soap this stay was wonderful!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great option for an overnight stay on our road trip. We were welcomed by a big smile from Matt. Quiet, simple, and had everything we needed"
2023-08-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The first day the host was rude when I asked if my 3 year old daughter could play in the sandbox. I almost didn't ask because every other Airbnb I had stayed at (100's of them) were always willing to share their entire backyard, including kids toys. So from day one I felt uncomfortable at this hosts house. Their reply was that ""I was limited to the basement dwelling."" That was rude! Another thing is that the shrubs and roses were hanging way out over the walkway so I had to walk on the grass, I didn't dare say anything. Oh and the grass was about 6-8 inches long, hadn't been mowed in 4-6 weeks, so it was harder to walk on. I would have offered to mow it for them but they were rude to me so I didn't. The futon bed was extremely uncomfortable to sleep on so I slept on the roll-away, which was also uncomfortable. There is no kitchen table, just a countertop with 2 chairs, so don't plan on having dinner here with more than 2 people. Internet was fast and they let me do an early check-in."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best airbnb experiences we have had! Super friendly hosts, pristine apartment (very comfortable bed, shower, AC). Really appreciated the guide as we didn’t know much about Provo. Communal and Taste were both fantastic."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and very comfortable. Marie and Reed were super-responsive and AC was perfect on a hot day. I'd stay again in a heartbeat.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Basement apartment was clean and comfortable. Nice and cool compared to the 100 degree heat outside. Had everything we needed and they were very responsive to my questions. It was great.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"cute basement place. can hear upstairs footsteps but was quiet after a reasonable hour.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Marie and Reed's place was perfect for our overnight stay in Provo. Clean, spacious and quiet. We were traveling with bikes, so we were able to park them in the fenced backyard. Beautiful home! 5 stars. Would definitely return."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. Convenient for our needs. Nice, quiet neighborhood. Had a chance to meet Reed. Very friendly. Nice proactive follow up messages to check we were doing well. They thought of everything including the space heater (which we used) since it is cooler being a basement location. I would highly recommend it if you desire a South Provo location like we did!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Na
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay! The space was just what we needed for our weekend getaway. The hosts were very friendly and responsive. They checked in with us often to see if we needed anything and if we were enjoying our stay. The place looked just like the pictures, and the neighborhood was very nice and quiet. Do keep in mind that this is a basement apartment with a family living above it. A little noise is to be expected. Overall we are happy with our find."

Location is a bit outside of town (car required), but very close to the airport which was the whole reason for staying. Owners were very flexible and answered messages immediately. Their tips for what to see and do in Provo were very useful. Can’t wait to stay again!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"We stopped by for an overnight while traveling through town. Really nice neighborhood and close to restaurants! Had no coffee or coffee pot. So if your a coffee drinker like us, plan ahead ;) Otherwise perfect small place for a quick stay!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely stay in Provo! Marie and Reed offered wonderful recommendations and were thoughtfully responsive.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was fine and as described, except the location description says, “downtown & BYU.” It was about 15 or so min away from both which was a bit disappointing. We live about 20-25 min away anyway, and wanted to stay somewhere close enough for going to and from BYU, within 2-5 min for woman’s conf. to avoid problems with parking and getting up early. Plus we were interested in more of a downtown or campus type atmosphere. Instead we were in a neighborhood southwest of all of that. I should have paid better attention to the address, but went more by the description.
It’s comfortable & cute. The owners seemed friendly and checked on us through Airbnb a couple of times. Didn’t need to use air mattress or couch for sleeping, bed was comfortable. Had access to Netflix, Amazon prime, and other streaming apps. Everything you will need for kitchen/bathroom. Clean. Will recommend for people visiting and are okay with the location."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay… easy in and easy out… well appointed and comfortable! Would book again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great communication and quick responses when something was needed. Quiet neighborhood and really close to everything in Provo.

We enjoyed the cleanliness of the apartment. The warm water was ready to go as soon as we turned on the shower. The fridge was nice and cold to store our food for our continuing road trip. The apartment was nice and cozy. I honestly didn’t want to leave the bed in the morning lol We look forward to staying here again :) Thanks for having us <3"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"It's a super convenient location. A hop, skip and a jump off the 1-15. Needs a little TLC. Looks like some of their clients haven't been too nice to the unit. Dings and scrapes to the walls and doors. Could use some touch-ups. A little water damage in the bathroom, and the microwave was a bit burnt. Nothing too terrible. It's a bit noisy with the upstairs as a family lives there. Good communication from Host.
Really needs a coffee pot. The unit is clean and has the basics. Very reasonable price and close to anything you might need."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had such a great stay at Marie & Reed’s. They were quick to respond when I had any questions and were incredibly accommodating. The place itself is exactly as listed and pictured. Very clean. Very quaint and quiet. They were sure to check to make sure we didn’t need anything else and answered the couple of questions I did have very quickly and were extremely kind in the process. I would definitely recommend and will most likely stay again. 5 stars in every category!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marie & Reed had good accommodations at their AirBnB. Everything was marked, and available, including air mattress, extra bedding for it and for the futon,board games, and cooking utensils. The one thing I actually I wish was there was toothpaste but otherwise, we had everything for an enjoyable stay. Checking in, and Entry Code was easily provided, and the couple gave us our space, but still were available by messaging. Overall great experience. 10/10, would recommend."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"As advertised: clean, easy access, clear communication. Perfect if you're just looking for a comfortable place to stay at a reasonable price!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Place! Thanks for letting us stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at this place. The hosts took care of the one complaint we had quickly and efficiently. The place was very clean. The neighborhood was inviting. It was close to many things.
The only complaint we would have is how uncomfortable the seating is. It was not fun to sit around and watch a movie because there was no comfortable place to sit. But… the pictures acutely showed the furnishings and they were in good repair. We should have paid attention to that knowing that was part of our plans."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,A great space with everything you need. Located in a safe neighborhood and proximity to town and hiking spots was great.

We couldn’t of asked for a better Airbnb experience, thank you so much marie & reed!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place. I really enjoyed the large basement windows that weren’t even below the ground to need window wells. It let so much light in that it didn’t feel like a basement. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen is a great set up for cooking in. It is well equipped and there is a lot of extra cupboard space for whatever you might need to bring with you.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment was comfortable, clean, and well located. The host provided all the necessary supplies in the kitchen and bathroom including shampoo and conditioner which I really appreciated.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can’t say enough good things about this stay. Comfy bed, plush towels, and it has got to be one of cutest studio apartments I’ve seen. It was quiet, clean and well appointed. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! 10 stars!!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marie & Reed’s place was the first place I’ve ever stayed at in Utah, and I couldn’t have picked a better place! Safe area that served as my home base for exploring Provo, the mountains, and the occasional drive to the city. Would stay again!"

2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Seretta's guest house was a clean, cozy place to stay for a nearby conference. She was responsive and kind as a host, and the place was close to the BYU/UVU bus loop to get around."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A friend and I spent two nights here for a mini writing retreat, and both of us loved it. The whole place smelled amazing and was very clean. The main room was bright and airy when the sun was out, filled with artwork and books and other lovely touches. When the sun went down, it felt warm and cozy — the perfect place to curl up and chat and drink some tea while watching the snow fall. There were tons of wonderful touches, such as fresh flowers, comfy pillows and blankets, a white noise machine, hand-written notes with instructions, and a variety of seating options. The location was great, too. The neighborhood was quiet and had a nice vibe, while still being accessible to restaurants and shopping. It seemed a good area to go for walks/runs/bike rides when the weather is nice.
Although we never spoke in person, the woman who rented to us was friendly, helpful, and communicative via the app, and even left us a little something for when we checked in!
Would definitely recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Seretta is personable, kind and helpful. I enjoyed my stay and will be back again. I appreciated all of the thoughtful touches, such as soft sheets and pillows, tea, snacks, juice in the fridge and some great books to peruse. Just a stone's throw from BYU.
Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My first impression was how cute and cozy it looked and felt. Seretta was extremely friendly, helpful, kind and quick to respond. Like a few others have mentioned, I wasn't aware that the shower/tub combo is an ADA accessible sitting tub with handheld shower head. This also was not a deal-breaker for us, but I don't think it's made clear in the description that this is not a standard shower/tub combination. My husband is over 6’ so it was tricky for him to shower. Not ideal for someone who wants to take a quick shower. If I could’ve, I would’ve given it 4.5 stars (only because of the shower/tub) but I wouldn’t give it less than that. It had everything we needed and best of all it was very close to the place we needed to go. If the shower/tub combo doesn’t bother you, I would 100% recommend this place!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for visiting my BYU student!
Very clean. Very comfortable bed. WiFi worked well and the perfect table was available for working at."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect for my husband and I’s 22nd anniversary
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic home feel, and a great host!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely guest house for me and my partner to stay in while visiting, the quiet, private atmosphere made for a perfect place to relax and decompress in the evenings."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Five star location within easy walking distance to BYU and dorms. Beautiful, safe neighborhood. Apartment is clean, freshly painted and appears newly furnished. I have only one real caveat: I wasn't aware that the shower/tub combo is an ADA accessible sitting tub with handheld shower head. This is not a deal-breaker, but there was a learning curve to using it and I don't think it's made clear in the description that this is not a standard shower/tub combination. Other than that, this is a lovely new studio perfect for a single person to stay in while visiting Provo."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay with a wonderful host. Highly recommend!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I needed a place to stay overnight, because of construction going on at my home. Her place was close, affordable, clean and exactly what I was looking for."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful. Comfortable. Nice touches throughout.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Location, host and place was good. However, 2 big drawbacks;
1. For a private space, you wouldn’t expect a door that leads literally directly to the hallway of the host’s house. Made us feel pretty uncomfortable knowing that there was a flimsy door blocking the other living space
2. There pretty much wasn’t a shower or kitchen; only a bathtub with a handheld shower head and a microwave and mini fridge.
I guess it was described correctly but just doesn’t seem like it was described as in detail as it should’ve been.
Place was however extraordinarily clean and came with some basic amenities to feel comfortable. For the price, I would recommend with these 2 things in mind."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Provo was wonderful, and the apartment made us feel like home. one of the cleanest Airbnb that I have visited so far. Thank you!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Seretta’s place was lovely. They’ve really thoughtfully curated the furniture, art, and setup! The only downside was not enough hot water— we couldn’t fill the tub all the way up. Other than that, it was such a cute place to stay in a convenient location, and I would definitely recommend it!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location if you need to go to the BYU campus. Very quiet and homie. Flexible check-in and comfortable bed.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a nice stay. The apartment was clean and inviting. Everything seemed newly done. The only disappointment was the walk in seated tub/shower—only because it was something we are not used to. Would definitely stay here again.

Shower/bath feature extremely relaxing and even had a jacuzzi feature. Comfortable bed, convenient kitchenette, luxurious bath area. Clean, homey, private, accommodating hostess. will definately be booking again. the only thing is that the curtains dont completely block out all light coming through the frosted windows, which might be an issue if you’re light sensitive."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed there for four nights. We absolutely loved our stay. This was a safe neighborhood with easy access to everything in Provo and Orem. The area has plenty of restaurants, with many within walking distance. Directly across the street are The Shops at Riverwoods. This had one of the better-equipped kitchens compared to a few other places that I have stayed. Bathroom supplies were plentiful. The condo was immaculate, and the beds were very comfortable. It had a Novafoam bed. I know this because before I left, I stripped everything to find the brand name. While I usually wouldn't say I like memory foam, I loved this bed! The master bathroom has a large, jetted bathtub. This was of better value when I compared it to hotels in the area. Haley was very responsive to any messages that I sent. This will undoubtedly be on the top of my list of places to stay again in Provo."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was just how the pictures depicted. Great location for BYU, Park City, Sundance and SLK. Checking in and out was seamless and Haley was always responsive. We definitely recommend staying and we will return."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect place! The condo has a large living room with a comfy wrap-around couch that seats many people, and Haley has added plenty of extras to make this large, 2-bedroom condo seem cozy. There are extra blankets and pillows, a fluffy throw blanket for the couch, and lots of fluffy towels in the bathrooms. The decor is warm and inviting, and everything, from the walls, to the furniture, to the kitchen, is sparkly new and clean. We especially appreciated the basket of snacks that were awaiting us after a very late night arrival. I highly recommend this place. I've stayed in many Airbnbs, and this one is definitely in the top 5%!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay! Location was great for both skiing at Sundance and access to restaurants! The house was spotless and obviously very well cared for.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent stay at Haley’s condo. The home is exactly as pictured and clean.

She always responded very quickly which was so helpful. Also, her kitchen is the best of any Airbnb we've stayed in. Everything I needed was there. It was awesome. The condo is spacious, the master bathroom has a jetted bathtub and the bed in the master bedroom is very comfy. We will definitely stay Haley's condo again. I can't think of anything that wasn't 5 star about the whole experience."

We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Provo."

The apartment itself is fine, the bed is relatively comfortable and the kitchen has most of what you need. The bathroom is a little cramped but was ok for one."

I was able to keep my car parked for the majority of my stay and walk everywhere. The weather was perfect. The place is upstairs and has carpet. I enjoyed eating in for a few meals and used the well stocked kitchen. Thanks Christopher.
Aloha"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed with C&B in the summer of 2022 and enjoyed it so much that I didn't hesitate to book it again for my recent stay in April 2023. My stay was comfortable, relaxing, and I always felt safe; which is important to me as an often solo traveler."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"traveling for work is not always ideal. however, Christopher's place made our time away from home less stressful with everything we needed. clean, cozy and fantastic!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time at The Zen Retreat in Provo. Christopher has done a wonderful job in presenting a very clean apartment with a very homey feel!
They have everything that you could ask for in their kitchen and more. It was very cold and snowy while I was there and there was an extra blanket to curl up with in the closet. Details are well thought out! It would be helpful to note that there is a family with young children that lives directly below this apartment. For the most part this small detail would not detour us from staying again. Nice space that is close to Center Street with many dinning options within walking distance."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place. Easy to get into and out of . Was clean and functional!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hard to compare…blocks from restaurants and other things…Chris was super responsive and helpful…already planing our next stay with them…easy and assigned parking…

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was great! Chris was very responsive to any questions and helped with anything as needed. The space was very clean and had all the promised supplies and amenities, and instructions for getting in were simple and worked easily. Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved Christopher's apartment for our stay in Provo. It's warm, it feels like home. It is well decorated and equipped with quality items. Everything necessary is here. The bed is very cozy and the sheets are very soft. In addition, it is ideally located next to Smith, BYU. It has parking space. We will return to Christopher's for our next stay in Provo."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The unit was great and Christopher’s communication was fantastic. Location is perfect as well.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very well thought out and comfy. We had no problems getting in, or checking out, and everything we needed was there. Definitely would stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Provo for three days for a Conference at Brigham Young University. Our stay was great and Christopher was impeccable. The place is EXTREMELY well-located, both to city center and the BYU campus. However, it is a little bit of an uphill battle to get to the north side of campus (where the Conference Center is). Nonetheless, we adjusted that by leaving a little earlier and having a ""freshening up"" session at the bathrooms, so we wouldn't present all sweaty. I wouldn't recommend this as ""walking distance"" to campus if you have a knee condition or something like that, because my calves were burning during all my stay from the journey to BYU. Nonetheless, we were the best located in regards to downtown, close to both shops and restaurants. There is a lot to do around the apartment and the zone felt very safe. There is a Seven-Eleven minutes away and a supermarket less than 10 minutes away. From one of the pictures, we assumed that there would be a futon AND a single person bed, and only when arriving, we realized it was the futon with a bedsheet. It was comfortable enough, but we wouldn't recommend more than one person sleeping on it. Also, having a washer and a drier made our life much much easier. Great apartment overall, would stay again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication, very clean, perfect for what we needed!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Great communication. We were really impressed with how clean it was! Highly recommend!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The first and foremost that we appreciate is the host who is very easy to get in touch with and tries to see that we are doing well from the check in to the check out.
The place is very homey and clean and well organized. Overall, the host is superb and the place is cool! I will definitely recommend this place to others and will definitely go back."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Such a convenient location south of campus. Christopher was extremely responsive and helpful. We look forward to staying again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying here. The apartment had everything I needed, and was cute, up to date, and clean. I will definitely look to stay here again the next time I visit my people in Provo."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very close to BYU campus. Was perfect for education week. They do have some odd fees. The check out is at 10 am but if you don't text them they charge you per hour. The check in is after 4pm, which is 2-3 hours later than other places and if you want to come early they charge you 25 dollars. Seems to me they have either had some bad experiences or are looking for ways to get extra money. The building is shared with other units, so when you get to the front door, ignore the door on the right and go through the door directly across from the street and up the stairs, the apartment will be on your left at the top of the stairs. The space was put together well, sheets were good quality and comfortable on the king bed. Couch not so comfortable. No laundry detergent on site, so if you plan on doing laundry bring your own. Communication was top notch."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great host and EXCELLENT accommodations! Chris was responsive and quick to check in to make sure I was enjoying my stay. Great location and I felt safe my entire stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We were in town for a show at the Dry Bar. We walked to the show—great location. The place is well equipped and Christopher responds quickly. We would stay here again.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved Christopher's place. It was so well set up. The bed was probably one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The air worked great on the super hot days and there was fan above the bed. Couldn't have asked for anything more, and great communication!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely comfortable place to stay. We will definitely come back here.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely and clean, Christopher was thoughtful of all details making my stay pleasant and enjoyable. Would stay here again."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Christopher’s place was very cozy and homey. The location is perfect! Right in the heart of Provo. Amazing view of the Y in the mountains. We had everything we needed to feel at home for some days. Check-in was easy and had a parking place for us. Communication was wonderful and quick, Chris is super nice! 😁"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an excellent place. Everything was better than described, and right near downtown Provo."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You will not believe how beautiful this location is. Peaceful and quiet, it really is a Zen retreat. Right next to BYU walking distance from downtown Provo. We got some ice cream and walked around the temple with my three kids. We had an amazing night. Helpful to have YouTube TV my kids were entertained by the selections there while My wife and I were able to talk in the kitchen. So nice being able to section the space in half with that door so we could still get some work done in the kitchen while the kids were sleeping. I also really liked the updated stainless steel appliances. Sparkling clean and I love the little details of the Jade knobs. Very tastefully presented bathroom with extra towels and helpful to have a designated parking spot. Amazing place and highly recommend to anyone needing a place for three adults or two adults and three young kids like us. We will be back. Chris was a delight and very responsive. Worked through every question we had with patience and resolved all of our concerns before we even had them with his communication. A Superhost in the making. Also so nice to have a desk to work at that had extra outlets for all the crazy electronics my kids have iPads and computers all were able to charge because they thought of every detail. Thank You!!! 6/5 Stars"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From beginning to end my stay at Maria's was delightful. Everything from reservation through check-out was professional, personable, clean and organized.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maria and her husband are truly wonderful hosts. They are extremely kind and helpful throughout the entire process.
I heard from someone that back in 1850, Abraham Lincoln stayed in that exact location very briefly. I can't be certain of these facts, however, I am happy to know of this possibility."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place and value and very friendly.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"It was a great stay. The place was very comfortable and clean for such a budget AirBnB. Maria really goes to a lot of effort to keep the place clean and maintained. There aren't a ton of kitchen supplies, but there's enough to get you by for sure. The location is in a safe and quiet neighborhood. If you get a chance to talk with Maria or her husband Steven, they're both really interesting people, and lovably quirky each in their own ways. Would definitely consider staying here again."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Price quality the ideal place to stay in Orem. The kitchen and bathroom are shared with 3 other rooms located on the basement floor. Maria is a very friendly and helpful hostess. Maybe a small suggestion: a sitting area in the garden would make this place perfect.

2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for a week. The day we arrived, the access was easy, clean and it was walkable for our needs. We contacted the host requesting more hangers for our formal attire and a dish rack/drying mat/drying towels for hand washing dishes. The host did not acknowledge our request. It was convenient to have the washer, dryer, kitchen supplies and ironing board.
The cooling system kept running making the place uncomfortable. We tried adjusting the thermostat. It went back to the original setting making it too cold for us."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I would stay again
The windows, interior brick wall, and tall ceilings stood out! Stop to smell the lilacs outside! Walked to get boba and live music at Velour!
Thanks again"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I felt very fortunate to find this great apartment in such a close location to shops and restaurants. I would definitely come back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location in Provo. Across the street from Smiths. We walked to several restaurants. (Bombay House is fantastic) the size of the apartment was perfect for us. The shower was great, beautiful big windows. The bed is memory foam which isn’t our favorite, but it was fine. The only issue we had was with the tv. Couldn’t watch netflicks like we thought we could. We tried to cast our own netflicks account but that didn’t work. No big deal, we didn’t have time to watch too much tv anyway. We will stay here again for sure!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Todd's property was very nice. Everything was very clean, warm and welcoming. We were working on the local Target in the Provo Town Center. Where we stayed was only 8 minutes away, across the street was Smith's grocery and many amazing places to eat. We worked long hours, getting back later in the evening. Everything was very quiet and peaceful. We loved the amazing water pressure while taking a shower and the comfortable bed after a long day of work. I loved that we didn't have to use our own streaming accounts like most airbnb's. Todd was very responsive and accommodating and we will definitely stay at one of their other properties the next time we are in town. I highly recommend staying with them!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fun unique location. Very central to lots of activities. Awesome tall ceilings and windows. Clean, comfortable, and warm."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The unit was absolutely lovely. Great amenities, including a washer and dryer. The high ceilings made everything feel so much more open and spacious. It was very cool being in an old church. The building was right in the heart of downtown Provo and easily walkable to everywhere I needed to go. Loved that there was a supermarket right across the street (very convenient). Todd was a very communicative host and responded promptly. I would definitely stay there again. And would recommned it to others."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Todd’s apartment is so beautiful! I fell in love immediately with the gorgeous windows that let in tons of natural light. It’s stylishly decorated with modern touches: I especially love the exposed brick and high ceilings! I needed a space to work while I visited Provo, and Todd’s place was perfect. It has all the cozy conveniences you could want, all in walking distance to the amazing restaurants and shopping in downtown Provo. I would love to return!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay in Provo with Todd. Great place.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little spot in the center of town. Easy walking to most areas for food and entertainment as well as close proximity to Marriott convention center.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed staying at the apartment. It was conveniently located so that walking was a good option.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Todd’s property. It was a great value and just as described. It is a queen not a king, but I’m glad we booked it anyway because it was great.
We really like this location. We have stayed next door as well, and this location is close to everything.
He provided full size laundry soap etc. which was great. And it was nice having an actual laundry room.
There are folks above you, but we really could barely hear them.
The huge windows are beautiful.
This is a great place to stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. We nejoyed our visit.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Condo was nice and in a good area of town.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is a really great location for base camp if you are visiting the Provo/SLC area. It has walkability and is within 15-45 minutes drive from several amazing hiking trails, Park City, and Salt Lake City. Todd was professional and responsive when I had questions. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Todd’s place was wonderful. It was a unique and fun location!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Exactly as described, Todd was very responsive and clear instructions were provided. Nice little place to stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is beautiful, super clean, and close to restaurants."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Todd's place was extremely clean and well-stocked. He was very communicative and helpful. He had a manual of basic instructions and well as a great list of restaurants and things to do. Would stay there again when I come into town.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Todd's place was in a perfect location downtown walking distance to restaurants and a grocery store.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely accommodations, great location, and a kind/responsive host!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Todd was quick to respond to our call and helped us settle in after a long day of travel. Perfect size for a couple. Rental is stocked with everything you want & need. Parking is a breeze. Steps from full grocery store & local restaurants. Queen bed is comfortable & perfect if you like a plush mattress.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was so clean, cozy, everything you need. Would highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for a few days to participate in the Utah Valley Marathon. The apartment was within walking distance from the expo, finish area, and bus transfer as well as practically next door to a big grocery store and lots of restaurants. It was the perfect place to relax, prepare, and recover. We loved the tall windows, great natural light, thoughtful touches like the bedroom's black-out blinds, faux plants that created a homey vibe, and even a few cooking ingredients. The bed was super comfy and everything was very clean. We had everything we needed. If we pass through Provo in the future we'd be quick to stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Feels like home. Private, secure, and quiet. Everything you see in the pictures is real."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Todd’s place was really cute! The bed was comfortable and the apartment was clean. Todd was very responsive when I texted him with a question. Thanks Todd!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Looks exactly like the photos -- bright, charming, and very clean (linens and bathroom especially). Great location in the beautiful historic district of Provo -- walkable to restaurants, coffee shops, and ice cream shop. It is a 100 year old church, so just keep in mind that it smells like a 100 year old church, especially in the winter time when the windows have been closed. If you are sensitive to smells, the building directly behind the church (on the same property) is newer and I believe those apartments don't have the same smell. Great water pressure and plentiful hot water. Todd is a very responsive host."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is fantastic. Highly recommend. Great shower, comfy bed, and netflix works lol."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great
2023-03-01,3,Stayed over a week,I sent Todd a private email about my stay. Very uncomfortable bed and insecure front lock among other things in a long list. Excellent location and laundry but needs updating and description revised. NOT luxury.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and comfy space perfect for my husband and I. Walking distance to grocery store and weather permitting, parts of downtown Provo. It's a short drive to several places of interest. It's our second stay in the Church. We were able to attend the Provo City Center Temple and it was beautiful."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place spotless clean so close to everything. Wonderful responsive host. Thank you !!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'm a repeat customer with Todd. I've stayed at one of the other units advertised on Airbnb. So I know the level of professionalism, cleanliness, and rental hospitality I'm getting with renting another of their units. And this stay did not disappoint in any way. Everything was exactly as I expected it to be. In my last Airbnb stay the only constructive criticism I gave was that the hot water didn't seem to last long. I have no problems this time. There was more than plenty. I'm absolutely satisfied in my stays with Todd. And it's likely that I will return in the future and rent from him again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Certainly one of the most unique and comfortable places I have stayed in over the years. It was a short one night trip but I’d highly recommend this if you’re staying longer over winter to hit the slopes. Very quick drive to the resorts and walkable distance to plenty of restaurants.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unit 6 was an amazing find while staying in Provo. I spent the previous night in a hotel and had a terrible time, so I was desperate for something clean and comfortable for the rest of my stay - Unit 6 was perfect! The place was clean, accessible, and close to downtown Provo (a lovely walk). I'm a cautious Airbnb booker (I've been burned before), but Unit 6 was EXACTLY as promised. Would recommend and would stay here again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,We loved staying at the Chapel! Such a beautiful place and convenient to a lot of great food options.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Would definitely stay here again! Was a good and relaxing getaway. Todd was always there for questions and responded quickly.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is amazing!
Great location, and is very comfortable.
I had everything I needed while there. Also, Todd and Mikki are very attentive and will make sure you have a good stay.
I would definitely come back to stay with them if visiting again Utah."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was amazing. It was so fun and just perfect for our stay. We will probably try to stay again if the price is right and it’s available.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique place, we loved it!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I should've checked the cleaning fee and service fee before booking, more than doubled the price. Otherwise a great place to stay, clean, super friendly and helpful host"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot in beautiful Provo and walkable to everything downtown. Nice quiet street and the renovated church is very cool. Very roomy place, super clean and quiet. Would definitely return! Kitchen is great - they have everything."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place! We stayed one night, and it felt like a home away from home. Very clean and beautiful! A fun idea to sleep in an old church. Definitely a place we want to go back to."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easy to access, simple stress free location near downtown Provo. The unit is exactly what we expected. The host communication was great throughout the process."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Todd was exceptional at communication, and everything was perfect. A very lovely, quiet and comfortable spot for my week in Provo. 5 min walk to downtown and right across the street from the grocery store! Awesome."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Todd & Mikki’s place was great! Very charming location & conveniently located. Perfect for our needs..and great view of mountains.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cool place to stay! I loved the staircases inside and the decor of the apartment. Easy entrance and had everything we need.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay here and would happily come back!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for my week at RMU. Centrally located, spotless and full of Utah charm!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place met our expectations, easy access and parking was no issue. Location to downtown was perfect for a nice stroll to the downtown shops and eateries. Recommend Guru’s cafe for breakfast and Black Sheep cafe for dinner. Close to many hiking locations as well."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Todd was great! Easy check-in, the place was nice for our short stay!
It had everything we needed. Definitely a college-feel location.
We walked down the street for some Boba and felt it was a safe area.
We parked on the street just in front of the entrance, no problems.
We would definitely stay again.
Thank you Todd for making our stay a great one!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Great place, convenient to the the bus and BYU. Todd was very responsive. I would stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I like to find unusual places to stay where we can cook dinner while on road trips. This apartment is one of nine in an interesting repurposing of a decommissioned church. Nicely done throughout, with a well-equipped kitchen. We planned to roast a chicken and make some side dishes for a full meal. Only problem: there was no baking dish or roasting pan. I called Todd and asked if he was close enough to the apartment to loan us something. He was actually out of town for the evening, but said, ""Just walk over to the big food store across the street and buy a baking dish, send me a photo of the receipt, and I'll reimburse you."" So I did just that. We cooked a lovely meal, and now the apt has a Pyrex baking dish.
That's what I'd call a responsive, solution-oriented AirB&B owner."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night but it is a wonderful place. We had some slight difficulty with the door code but Todd was extremely responsive in getting back to us, even though he was in the middle of a hike with his family. The apartment was clean and had easy temperature control. The bed was very comfortable. Wonderful lighting throughout the apartment. We will be back again."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,small but modern and convenient
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute little place. I loved how bright it was!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is beautiful! The location is great, it’s very close to downtown Provo and directly across the street from a grocery store. The apartment was clean, well taken care of, and the grounds were very nicely kept. I had to walk around the building a bit to figure out where Apartment #6 was, but i found it eventually! It’s on the far side of the building opposite of the parking lot (North face of the building I believe.) I highly recommend this location for a quick getaway or part of your vacation!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful space.. exactly as advertised! You have everything in apartment.. nice neighborhood with nice grocery across street, downtown with convention center and wonderful restaurants Within easy walking distance!!!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I recommend this space for sure! Not only is it cozy and private but I also love the interior design. This was a great place for me to recharge after some adventures in the desert and before flying back home. Enjoy!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice location and setting in an repurposed chapel
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really great stay! Location was perfect. We walked to so many restaurants and fun places to hang out. The apartment was lovingly restored and quiet. Hot water was hot and plentiful. Parking was never a problem. Grateful for all the cooking ingredients and washer and dryer. Started feeling a little small for my son and I after a week, but with so many places to see nearby it was not a big deal."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cool Airbnb! It has extremely tall ceilings so it feels very spacious, has an excellent kitchen, laundry, etc., plus lots of great hooks in the bathroom! The floor is extremely comfortable to walk on (weird thing to review but it was quite noticeable!). There are beautiful mountain views from the living room. The bed is on the firm side, and is quite low to the ground, in case you have that preference. Street parking is super easy, fantastic location as well. I also loved the door knobs with codes- hate having to remember a key. It's also pretty quiet, barely heard anything or anyone."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was lovely! The windows let in so much natural light, which made the place very cheerful and inviting. We had everything we needed. We will certainly stay here again!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Super nice apartment. Central location and everything very clean.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This charming little apartment provided just the escape I was looking for. Close enough to feel connected to the necessities but still far enough from the world to feel quiet and serene. Todd was an eager host and easy to work with. I’ll look his way when I’m looking for another Provo retreat!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicely updated apartment in a charming old renovated church. We loved the location with it being in the heart of downtown Provo close to some amazing restaurants. Parking was easy. Nicely decorated with all the amenities we needed. Very clean. Super cute!

2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This location was ideal for a peaceful stay. The walls are thin but everyone seemed to be quieter & respectful. The light in mid-morning is beautiful, the view of the mountains is nice, & it’s walking distance to center street. The ring cam at the front of the apt door definitely helped me feel safer as I was traveling alone. Todd responded quickly which was helpful. Instructions were super clear & it was a great, cozy place to stay."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great stay! Very comfortable, centrally located, and great value for all the amenities."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute apartment at rear of repurposed 100 year old church. Clean, comfortable, plus great location. Lots of light pollution all night long. Not a problem for us because host kindly provided eye covers, however if that is something you're adverse to, it may be best to book elsewhere."

2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place. One note is that the Building next door has bright look on all night and the shades in the bedroom don’t block the light fully.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Comfortable home.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the most amazing AirBnb’s I’ve ever stayed at.

The place had EVERYTHING I needed! Washer/dryer, bathtub, all the internet and streaming I could want, full length mirror, and plenty of supplies. I cooked everyday here and it felt like home.
Worth every penny so that I could have every thing that I needed, no sacrificing amenities here! And it’s really cute too. I may have taken some decorating tips from them!
I plan on staying with these hosts the next time I’m in town!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Neat building. Amazing location a block away from the grocery store. We'll probably stay here again.

There’s a grocery store across the street which was incredibly convenient. Easy to park on the street. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2020-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Lovely little place! Styled very nicely with a lot of nice touches. If I was granted a late check out my stay would have been perfect- paying $200 for the night and having to rush in the morning is not ideal, but Todd was very quick to respond and I appreciate that."

2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient, cute and clean."

2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Todd was a great host! The space was so clean and cozy. The appliances in the kitchen were amazing and I loved using them. Only complaint is that the photos of the views out the windows are no longer accurate. The views from the kitchen and bedroom windows are completely obstructed by the construction work... I didn’t love how there were workers walking around right outside of my window and I felt they could see right into the bedroom. But I simply kept the blinds closed. Other than that, photos are very accurate and the space was wonderful."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent stay
2019-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is very lovely! Really nice updates in the old chapel. Kept some of the historic touches like the windows and exposed brick.

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Centrally located to an assortment of restaurants, ice cream parlors, and coffee shops in what seems to be bustling downtown Provo, this apartment is absolutely terrific. The space is cleanly decorated with all the necessary amenities."
2019-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It is very clean, comfortable, and centrally located. Very efficient AC. It could use some art work on the walls as the ceilings are very high with bare walls. The only issue with this apartment is the very loud, creaky floors, especially in the bathroom. Don’t know if anything can be done about that because the building is so old, but it wouldn’t stop us from staying there again."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay at Todd’s place. It was sparkling clean, the cleanest air bnb I’ve stayed at and had thoughtful touches in kitchen and bathroom. Everything worked, it was perfect for my stay and I will definitely return on my upcoming trips in Provo. Great place, great host!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I stayed at Todd's place for the Utah Valley Marathon and Half Marathon races. The apt complex is a chapel converted into apartments (super dope). It is quaint and perfect for two travelers. Everything was clean, clean linens, huge kitchen, natural sunlight, great living space, big bathroom, access to in-unit washer and dryer. The place was the whole package. It's also right across the street from a 24-hour supermarket, which has a great selection of food, beverages, and beer. Also within walking distance to downtown Provo. Thanks for having us, Todd!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place - very clean and great location.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bigger than it looks in the pictures. VERY nice! Highly recommended.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and within walking distance to local stores and restaurants. If you are looking to stay somewhere truly unique. This is your place.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely, very clean and well stocked apartment. Close to wonderful shops and restaurants on Center Street. Easy check-in and great communication with Todd. Highly recommend this apartment and this is my second stay. -Anita from Seattle."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"An amazing apartment within a renovated old church that has long term apartment renters. You hear some footsteps of others and the floor squeaks in places but only reminds one of this great renovation project. Great set of amenities with high end full-size appliances including washer and dryer. One of the best places I've stayed. I wish there were dark out drapes although I loved the large original windows and light window shades in general. For any that have mobility or arthritic issues, the bed is lower but comfortable. There are steps (9 I think?) inside the building to the door; the few to the outside door are small. Security is great with exterior door to building and to apartment with touch pad locks. There is construction of a new apartment building right outside but they don't make much noise before 8 am and are gone by 5pm and weekdays only."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Todd is a great host..I've never felt more welcomed in a home except with my own family
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place. It has everything you need and the host was very responsive. Apt was immaculate and well decorated. 0.4 miles from the Provo Rec center so it was an easy walk to work out or in the other direction to town. Provo Rec center is beautiful and a $5 day pass. Highly recommend!
2019-02-01,4,Stayed one night,Awesome!!
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful space! Great hosts!
2019-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Great location. Very clean. Really appreciate how such an old building / church has been restored.
2019-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful building with nice finishes. There is another apartment building being built outside the bedroom and kitchen window. I would not recommend staying here if you’ll be there during the week. There was no construction over the weekend.
2019-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Todd’s place was truly wonderful. Super clean. Great location. Beautifully decorated. I wholeheartedly recommend it in every way.
2018-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The good:
Great with communication through text or phone.
High ceiling (for this luxury unit)
The bad:
Inaccurate information;
1) pets hair all over the couch
2) not real fireplace (fire looking screen) *this is for other unit, which I had to movie 2 times.
3) If you don’t reply to Todd’s text, he might cancel your reservation and leave your belongings outside the doorway. (Changed the door lock code) since I was here for leisure, I don’t check my phone often. But that’s not an acceptable for him! So make sure before.
*still didn’t get reimbursed for fresh blueberries and unopened ice cream that I was locked out of door since Todd, changed the lock and left a minute before me arriving. (Says he has to attend his Christmas dinner)
***review other properties by Todd BEFORE booking. Has several other properties"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed one night,He had the best place in the best location. Definitely recommend
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean, comfortable, and centrally located apartment. The place is just as described and host responds quickly to inquiries."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you. The apartment was beautiful and well appointed. We were very comfortable and slept great. I would stay here again.
2018-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place in excellent location and would absolutely love to stay again! Highly recommend.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was super cute! Perfect for my trip to Provo and very well located. There's a grocery store literally a block away and some good restaurants around the corner as well. Todd was very responsive by text and phone when I had a silly question. There was some nearby weekday construction but I had been made aware of it so it wasn't a problem for me at all. Would definitely recommend!
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the coolest spaces I have stayed in. Mountain views from the beautiful chapel windows. Awesome Airbnb
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect space, beautiful renovation, and a great location. Only a few blocks from downtown, and it felt like home. One of my fav AirBnBs so far (several years later)."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying here! Everything was clean and comfy! There was even body wash, shampoo and conditioner, and makeup remover wipes for our use. The building looked really cool and I loved the big windows and nice little ""home-y"" touches."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at this apartment! I was able to find parking out on the street right outside (there is a car park on the other side). The door code/self checkin system works really well. The apartment is clean, bright, modern and beautiful. There’s fast WiFi, a big smart tv, hot shower, comfortable bed, access to a washing machine and tumble dryer. It’s located in a great part of Provo, near downtown. I would definitely stay here again!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a gem of a place attached to the back of a church!
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. It is exactly as it is advertised. The area was quiet and close to everything. Todd offered great ideas on what to do while in town. We were at the wrong entrance when we arrived and we didn’t know it, so I messaged Todd and he arrived within minutes and stayed to make sure we had no more questions before leaving. We took a stroll thru center street and visited all the temples. We got to make home cooked meals. We had everything we needed to be comfortable and relaxed. It was a much needed peaceful stay. Loved it!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, stylish, convenient, well appointed condo"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You won’t be disappointed with you stay here or your host. Charming, clean and great location! All of your needs will be met!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was well beyond all of our expectations. Super clean and close to everything you want to be around. The hosts were amazing. If I can give it 10 stars I would give it 10 stars but this is only let me give it five stars. So I get it twice the score 10 stars!!! Book now and know you get to stay in a fantastic apartment in the heart of Provo.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As repeat guests, we love The Old Chapel and appreciate the excellent host that Todd is. He is responsive to his guests' needs and is quick to reply to any questions. The property is charming, welcoming and warm. We will always check with Todd first whenever we are in Provo!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,This apartment is beautiful and in a great location! Love the character of the old building with its exposed brick walls and amazing windows!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with restaurants and sites within walking distance. Lovely decor and gorgeous windows! Comfortable and roomie, with little special touches, like water bottles, snacks, etc..."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. Very modern.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, new interior and nice bright large windows. All new appliances and great location."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. Great folks
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Todd's place was very clean. Check-in is easy with plenty of parking. I appreciate that this is a dedicated Airbnb that is not someone's full-time residence. It is across the street from a grocery store and within easy walking distance to multiple downtown restaurants. A great place to stay in Provo!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and communication.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, modern apartment in newly renovated building. Close to downtown, grocery store, and campus. Highly recommend!"

2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I didn't want to leave! This by far is the best Airbnb experience I have had, in every way!
When you first arrive you see a beautiful historic chapel. Beautiful large windows, red brick and green grass.
The security of exterior and interior lock pads are easy to use with your individual code. Making check-in a breeze.
When you walk in the apartment you smell clean fresh air and see sparkling clean interior. Beautiful granite countertops and amazing appliances in the kitchen. Everything you need, including a Keurig with coffee pods and snacks! A large TV in living room with Netflix & more. The furnishings are tasteful, comfortable and cozy. There's a very clean washer & dryer with name brand detergent,(same brand I use at home) & fabric softener! The bathroom is large, clean, sparkling tub with very nice, soft towels. The hosts are so thoughtful they even supply make-up remover face cleaning cloths (the same brand I use at home!) The shower & tub is stocked with large bottles of shampoo, condition & body wash (each the same kind I use at home!). Then step into the bedroom, beautiful white comforter, very comfy pillows, and a bed I sleep better in than the one I had at home! They even provide a snuggly white robe!
I loved the charm, and thoughtfulness of the hosts. To many thoughtful touches to list! Best stay ever!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A beautiful little apartment and a place that I would want to actually live.

2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful place! I appreciated the cleanliness and attention to detail. Pretty much perfect. I especially loved the high ceilings, and gorgeous windows with the exposed brick in areas that gave the mostly modern feel throughout a very charming historical feel! I want to come back :) The hosts are incredible too!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. Clean, bright and comfortable. Eat check-in process and owner communicates very well."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful spot and a perfect destination for our short little “staycation.” We felt close enough to everything in downtown Provo but also just far away enough from the hustle and bustle. The best part was waking up and being able to see those amazing mountains right on top of us!
2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great experience
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome spot with modern and rustic touches. High ceilings, great finishes and great location."

Enjoyed our stay and plan on returning!
Nathan is an excellent host, quick to respond and the house was clean and comfortable!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was comfy and just what me and my family were looking for, for our quick weekend stay! Beds were comfy and the place was really like a home away from home. We would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Convenient location!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little place. We will come back again!
We could hear the neighbors below at night talking, but they were very friendly helpful too at the same time."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a lovely stay. The home was clean and private. There was lots of space and plenty of parking. Coffee and food was in walking distance
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really appreciated the quick communication! the place was a great reprieve for my long road trip out west. Very spacious and the parking was very generous to accommodate my Jeep and a six foot trailer. The bed was comfy, and the tv worked great!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Adorable upper floor of quaint home in Provo. Two bedroom. One bathroom. Ample parking. There are people living in downstairs unit, so must be comfortable with hearing them talking til 10pm and when waking up at 8am."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"great place to stay! you can hear the downstairs tenants when they walk in through the separate entrance, due to how it's closed off...but overall definitely cozy and had all the things to make ya feel at home"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay. We were visiting BYU and the location was perfect. Very happy with the accommodations and would stay here again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a quick stop in Provo and this fit the bill for our family!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely little home in a quiet neighborhood. Great place to stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute place, small but met our needs! They set up the pack-n-play ahead of time which was super helpful! Nathan was quick to respond and very friendly"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nathan’s place was great! A cozy comfortable place and highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little place - beds were very comfortable! We saw/heard the downstairs renters a couple times but it was fine. the fan/air filter in the bedroom was really nice. Twin bed room was great for kids - all beds had nice new sheets on them. House is on an older street with lots of people walking around - we walked a mile to the grocery store and stopped at a park in the neighborhood. Communication from host was awesome.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, fit our family and was a great location."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nathan was a good host. You can’t beat the view from the front steps!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nathan’s place is very affordable for the area and has been updated. However, the noise from the downstairs was very noticeable in the master bedroom and got to be bothersome late at night while trying to sleep. We put 2 kids on the couch, but it would not fit 2 adults. The house was fine for just going to sleep at night (minus the noise)."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,It is a cute place. It fit our needs.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Host and a great place to stay! Definitely recommend. We’ve been several times and it continues to be a favorite for location, value, cleanliness etc."

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful little house! Perfect for our stay to visit BYU.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as expected, thank you!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, quiet, comfortable place to stay. We had everything we needed. I love how it was decorated. Nathan was so kind and got his place ready for us at the last minute. Thank you!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay. It was exactly where we needed to be and it fit us perfectly. One small issue was we could hear the down stairs tenant at night through the master bedroom vent. Sometimes we could hear the next door neighbors as well. So if you are going for a quiet stay this may not be for you. We used a white noise maker anyway so it didn’t really bother us. Plus we have kids so we probably bothered the downstairs tenant more than he bothered us!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in this clean, well-appointed home. Will return!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really nice and clean place. I would definitely recommend it to others.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Berry comfy

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable home and convenient location
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location! It was perfect for our quick trip and felt very comfortable. I would recommend!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great place for short term stay! Would love to have had hooks on the bathroom door for towels and maybe more outlets for phones ect!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very impressed with how clean the space was! Everything was spotless, clean towels/linens readily available, and a variety of dishes. A little old and creaky, but with modern updates. Nathan was super nice and very responsive to any questions i had. The air conditioning units in every room was an appreciated touch. A great, affordable space to rent for a long weekend, and easy self check in!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was great. Provo turned out to be a beautiful little town. This home is a great location to explore the town and mountains. I was a little confused thinking the home was attached to another larger home, but this listing is for the actual house. The listing says “upstairs” so that had me thinking it was a second story apartment. There are renters below in the basement, which didn’t bother us at all. So, you are to enter the main entrance for this listing. The place was just right for us! Thanks!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient location, clean, decor was nice and updated, beds were comfy. I enjoyed the personalized welcome sign, found an iron when I needed it.
The neighborhood is fine, nothing fancy. It was difficult to see the house number at night; so a lighted sign may be helpful in the future. And an additional mirror in the bedroom would help us get ready for the day while someone else was in the bathroom.
We would stay here again."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Positives: very clean, close to downtown, amenities as described, excellent linens.
Negatives: very aware of downstairs tenants as little soundproofing between up & down. Two a/c units noisy & not effective."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay. Nice and comfortable home. Very clean and well maintained. Rooms and beds are very comfortable. We loved the location, very close to the university and downtown. Would highly recommend Nathan’s home for anyone traveling to the Provo area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean house and perfect location
2023-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Overall, a nice place to have a home-base for outside business. Home is small, but worked well for us. A 20 minute walk to BYU. Outside is very unkempt with no place to enjoy the outdoors. There is a separate-entry basement that is being rented out who used the small backyard with their dog."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house in a quiet location and it was very easy to find.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nathan's place is super cute, stylish and very clean.
We were there for just a single night. When we returned for the evening around 9:30 pm, there was no running water (we soon learned due to a break in the main on the street) .Nathan was extremely responsive and a neighbor stopped by to see if we needed any of her stored water. Water was returned to the street in an hour or so and all ended well.
I was very impressed with Nathan's concern and helpfulness although the problem was out of his control."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Our second stay! Great place/value for our family. Host is very kind/responsive. AC units were very nice for our summer stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great for our quick weekend. Beds were comfortable, place was clean."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great place for a night with our family traveling. Safe location. Walked to grab coffee and doughnuts nearby. Would stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect for our stay in town!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The home was easy to locate and was in a quiet neighborhood. The space qas cozy and met all our needs for an overnight stay for a family of 5. The fresh flowers in the kitchen and welcsign with the wifi info was a great personal touch. It was a hot day when we arrived and the window air conditioners throughout the home were already turned on and kept everything nice and cool. Thank you for a great stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and just as described
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a great stay at Nathan’s place! It was perfect for our family and was ideally located for us. We already plan to return :-) They have done a great job updating this older home, with the Airbnb occupying the main floor, and a tenant living in the basement. Pro tip: keep the porch light off at night to reduce insects trying to get inside (as is common in Provo during the summer)."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was conveniently located, 10 minutes or less from everywhere we wanted to be in Provo. Bedding and linens were clean and Nathan was extremely responsive and helpful."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was very easy. I would stay here again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would love to stay here again when back in Provo. Thank you

We would for sure stay there again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot in downtown Provo. Quiet and clean.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,perfect accommodations!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay,getting in on day one was a bit tricky with the code,the dog outside did bark a lot in the early early mornings and some late nights.The bathroom door doesn’t shut or lock correctly.Other than that the house cleanliness and locations is awesome! Lovely place!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was cute and clean and had easy access to the east end of Provo which was really great for us. The neighborhood seemed safe and we didn't have any problems. It was nice to be able to park in the driveway. Nathan communicated with us for any questions or issues we had. He put our name on a little sign in the kitchen as a welcome. That was delightful.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great spot! We came for BYU graduation and were super happy to find this home! You can easily walk to campus, have an amazing view of the mountains, and the street is very quiet. The house was super clean and had everything you could need."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,The house worked very well for the two weeks we stayed. Excellent location and easy to get around.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nathan was quick to respond when I contacted him and I really appreciated his friendly messages. The home has everything we needed and felt clean and light. The beds were particularly comfortable—-I got some of the best sleep I’ve had in a long time. I’d stay here again and wish I could have been here longer . Thanks Nathan!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,It was a great stay for one night for a girls night getaway.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nathan provides a sweet little house! It was smaller than I expected, but adequately bedded our family of 6! We didn’t use much in the kitchen, but it seemed to have a bit of all the necessities. I would recommend it! :-)"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nathan’s place was perfect for our needs. We were in town for a hockey tournament and we’re right down the street from the rink. Only thing I would say is the couch is not very comfortable, otherwise we found our stay very enjoyable."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is a great house in a very good location with quick access to BYU, and downtown. It’s a very cozy home with a great electric fireplace that is super easy to use with a remote control. The house has been completely redone so everything was new and clean. The hosts made sure we had what we needed but also gave us plenty of privacy. I would definitely stay at this house again. We enjoyed our stay very much."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan's place was so so cute and comfortable. We were so comfortable we asked to book a second night on the spot and he let us do it! He answered quickly and was very helpful. There were drinks in the fridge and extra hygenie supplies. We loved the old house charm with the modern fireplace, tv, and appliances. The washer and dryer were a great bonus. Would love to stay there again!"
