2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This could have easily been 5 stars all around other than a communication error. We rented the place based on the pool. However, it was not listed that the pool would not be open until late May. The owner was very responsive to our messages and was apologetic for not letting us now. Just be sure to check if the pool will be available when you book."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cottage is charming, clean & a peaceful getaway. Location is safe, in a lovely farm setting. My brother & I thoroughly enjoyed staying at the cottage. With out a doubt highly recommend this property."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spot was perfect for a fall weekend! It was tucked away in the north Georgia mountains and we had the best view of their small farm. We felt safe and secure the entire time! The bed was very comfy, the tub was easy to step in and out of, there were plenty of towels and places to sit! If we need to come back to this part of Georgia we will check here first!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed or stay here at the farm cottage! We had an event to attend in Rome and it was easy to get back and forth to. It is a cute, quaint cottage in a compound setting. Very unique and will definitely stay here again if we are going to be in the area again! Thank you, Sandra!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far the best place we have ever stayed. The place is like a resort! It is clean, decorated SO CUTE, and very comfortable. My only regret was that we were SO busy that we didn't get time to enjoy it. I could easily stay here a week and never leave. I highly recommend Sandra's place if you are ever in the area."

Thank you for sharing your little slice of heaven with us Sandra, Stacy and Mr. Buddy. We hope to see you again soon :)"

I wish I could have spent more time there and I hope to return soon!

Highly recommend!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were visiting family in the area. Sandra's home was the perfect location for us. We are planning another visit in the spring. Planning to stay at Sandra's again. Her home was exactly as described. It was appointed beautifully. Sandra and Buddy were very thoughtful and helpful. We look forward to our next visit. Hoping the weather will be better on our next visit so we can enjoy the farm animals.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Let me first say working with Miss Sandra was easy and she was super helpful. It took us 4 hours to get here due to traffic and she had everything ready to go for us. We were traveling for a softball tournament and we were about 20 min from the fields. This location was perfect. It was nicer and cheaper than a hotel. It was peaceful and quite. We got to enjoy hot chocolate and chill out afterwards. The bed was comfy. We could not asked for a better place. Thank you!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay. Very quiet and cozy.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An extended vehicle repair on the way home from a retreat in the Blue Ridge Mountains brought us to the Farm Cottage- though we quickly realized it was a Divine Appointment! God blessed our stay here with privacy, relaxation, and reflection. The wonderful hospitality from Sandra working with our unexpected schedule and even the gifting of fresh farm eggs was the cherry on top! Comfortable furniture, a full kitchen to prepare meals, and evening mountain drives as we looked for deer (though many days they were standing in the front yard) made this stay perfect in every way! It is great to meet people that have a zeal for the Lord! We will absolutely plan more getaways to the Farm Cottage!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the Cottage outside of Rome, Georgia was a delight. It is off-the-beaten-path and in the quiet of the country, but still within 15-20 minutes of most conveniences in and around Rome. Sandra was very easy to communicate with during my stay, responding quickly to any questions or requests. I look forward to staying here again in the future."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Sandra, Mr. Buddy and Stacy for your hospitality! The cottage is beautifully decorated and impeccably clean. We enjoyed the pavilion with the relaxing swing benches and the farm area with the animals. The baby goats were adorable and it was a treat petting them. Maybe next time we’ll go in the pool (the water was a little to cool this go ‘round). Communication with the host was excellent, and we received responses almost immediately. The check-in and -out instructions were detailed and clear. We appreciate the attention to detail and care. ¡Muchas gracias!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely gorgeous cottage. We loved visiting with the baby goats, cows and pig. I hope we can make it back some day."

We were in the area to help with a move and the Farm Cottage was the perfect home base for us! Buddy and Sandra were great hosts and very hospitable. We will definitely return, should the need arise."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sandra and Buddy have a beautiful place.. The farm cottage is so much more than the pictures make it out to be… very comfortable tons of room lots of closet space it is so much bigger than a picture can describe… The outdoor patio was a wonderful place to hang out for the evening.. we slept like babies.. hope to be back again someday in this area.. thanks for sharing your wonderful piece of Heaven.. Jeff and Kandy Scott
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Sandra and Stacey are such wonderful hosts!The cottage was absolutely beautiful and incredibly peaceful.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully decorated farmhouse.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay for a great value! Perfect couple getaway! We definitely intend to return.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Farm Cottage at Silver Creek must be experienced, because it is so much more than even the beautiful pictures describe. The comfort and style that surround you are a feast for the eyes and honestly all senses, because it's so fresh! Creativity pours from every corner, inside and outside your space. It's an ideal couple's getaway or even as a single traveler in need of a retreat. Close enough to Rome for shopping/food, but far enough out to enjoy the serenity. There are several properties that the family offers with sweet hospitality as a joint venture. We could have explored Rome, but we knew once we arrived that this was a ""hole up with your groceries and pamper yourself"" spot, because it had everything we needed and then some. Incidentally, Sandra and Stacy have booths at a local antique mall, if you would like to take home a piece of your experience. Sandra is lovely to talk to and makes you feel right at home, yet you have the space and needed whenever needed. The peace of God flows over you here, even when the animals greet you ""en voz alta"" when you're reading on the unbelievably comfortable swinging daybed outside. Though our stay was a winter one, we loved every minute. (If you DO decide to dine out, check out The Gravy Boat for breakfast, even to go, and Jerusalem Grill for lunch/dinner.)"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay quite relaxing beautiful home have all the essential you can think of. Feels like home. A must stay

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely worth the cost. Southern hospitality is real and they were so nice and helpful.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5 star service, recommended highly"
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This was a great stay and probably the cleanest air bnb I've been to. The owners were also great to communicate with. It was a great stay for a wedding in Cedartown. Only knock against this is the surrounding farm and area is quite pretty but you can't see it from inside the rental. The windows looking away from the pool area are covered by landscaping and the two that look out look right out on where you park.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very pleasant farm ~ the animals, the peace and quiet ~ and the company too !"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandra and Co made booking this trip for my in laws a breeze. They had an absolute ball: loved the company, bed swing, and interior decor. Highly recommend."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had such a wonderful time at the cottage. The space was extremely clean and attractive. The farm was calm and relaxing. The hosts were gracious. Thank you Mr. Buddy and Mrs. Sandra for a perfect stay!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars for everything, first time airbnb-ers and they made it amazing; they are sweet gentle souls really wish I could of stayed longer. They introduced themselves as soon as we got there and we got to meet the furbabies as well. Cottage is right behind the house, however you have your own privacy. Pool was crystal clear when we took a dive, outside padio was very serene, I would love to visit again ! Thank you for letting us stay 😊"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding location close to anything you need near Rome. Place is beautiful. Cleanliness is top notch.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an awesome weekend at Sandra’s place. It is very comfortable with so many amenities many other rentals do not offer.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! So much to say about this place and my SUPERB Hostess with the Mostest!!! I absolutely LOVED this place. It’s like a little slice of Heaven. So many little nooks - to just “be”
and enjoy the scenery! The Cottage by the pool is beautifully decorated! So appealing to the eye! The place is immaculate. The bed is comfy and accommodations are just what I needed! A HUGE thank you to Sandra, Stacy and Mr. Buddy for your hospitality, talks and big help while I visited! I feel like we are family now!
I also love that they are only a 20 min drive to Rome and what a great little, trendy town that is!
Until next time!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cute, and comfy! Loved everything about this little farmhouse!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to get away for a few days, we had everything we needed, it was so comfortable inside the cottage. Sandra's family was very sweet, and we loved using the pool!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! Our stay was very relaxing and enjoyable! Thanks for the great time!

The outside pool & covered picnic area is very nice.
Everything is clean and decorated beautifully! We really enjoyed it and plan on staying again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for my needs, very peaceful experience."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful home, great hospitality and has everything you need to have a great stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in the country. If you are looking to get away from it all and spend a little time on a farm this is the place for you. You drive about 15 minutes from the main road to reach this place. It is roomy inside and my favorite part was the bed swing outside under the gazebo area which is next to the pool and has a full outdoor kitchen. Bring a book and you will probably fall asleep on the bed swing.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandra's place is very good. It is a great space, especially for two people. It was very clean.
She makes you feel welcome. The outdoor space by the pool was very good also. We enjoyed sitting and talking with her and the family. She was very welcoming but also gave you our space. We will definitely visit again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, immaculate, precious animals and lovely people"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really wonderful location, easy to find and very well appointed. The pool pavilion is deserving of more photos! The only two suggestions I have are adding a fan to the bedroom and possibly a tv. The rooms are very large if you're an apt. dweller, it was so much larger inside than the pictures can show. The kitchen was very well suited for a longer stay, with a crockpot, tons of utensils and even more cooking options outside with both propane and charcoal grills. On my next trip I'd love to make use of the fire pit after dark. The bed is perfect for me, pretty firm but delightfully luxurious. Having the stack w/d for wet garments was handy, too. I enjoyed the animals, the wandering friendly kitties, the small dog, the turkeys, goats, and chickens. Miniature horse didn't show his face for me but I'll see him next time :)"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is very clean and tucked away in a country area! You do stay near the owners home but they don’t bother you! There’s a little old man that is outside with the animals quite often! The setup is so beautiful and definitely worth it!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Recommended! Great place to stay and unwind! Hosts were truly wonderful! The place was impeccably clean with everything you would need, the pool was so fun and relaxing, and the outdoor seating area took all your stress away. Fresh eggs and animal friends too! We had a truly terrific long weekend away."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This country cottage was an amazing stay. Nice, private getaway with beautiful scenery and a cool pool, especially necessary during this heatwave! The host provided us with our every need and want and quickly responded to every one of our concerns. Heck, my guitar broke on the trip, and they brought me wood glue to help fix it.
Me and my partner's stay was wonderful and romantic, and we were almost sad to leave! 10/10!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,If your hunting a quiet and cozy place to stay you won’t be disappointed with this cottage only steps away from a beautiful pool and lots of flowers.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a lovely separate cottage, gated and safe, in the countryside. It's super quiet, quaint, and very cozy. The space is large, has full kitchen, lovely den area, streaming shows at your fingertips, and a large bedroom with COMFY bed/sheets, and large bathroom. It included other residences on site but was still very private and included separate parking. I would most certainly stay here again and am beyond grateful for an affordable, NICE space to stay in the countryside."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay. Clean, spacious, comfortable and a very hospitable family. You won’t spend a better week in the country! Very comfy king beds too!"

2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Amazing value for money if you’re wanting to stay near Rome or Cartersville. Beautifully decorated and spacious place. AMAZING hospitality and amenities. I really enjoyed the outdoor bed swing and the impeccable decorations of the house. Took some notes for how I want to decorate my house! 15/10 great place to stay and we REALLY enjoyed our time here.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best value for the money! It's so tranquil and peaceful! This was my second stay. I truly enjoy being in a place that makes me feel like home. There is nothing lacking. It is ""off the beaten path"" as someone else mentioned, but it's still close to stores and restaurant. Great stay!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute cottage with a nice pavilion outside. Huge comfy bed.

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful pace to get away. Beautifully decorated. Enjoyed sitting outside each morning with coffee watching the farm animals. Every evening was by the fire pit.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is like a dream. I felt like I was staying in an upscale suite that I shouldn’t be able to afford. The bed was super comfy, the chandeliers were a nice surprise, and it was all around cozy. Sandra was a wonderful host and there is a lot of friendly animal life if you’re an animal lover. A perfect little getaway for yourself or for a couple for sure."

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in the cottage was absolutely lovely! The host was wonderful, responded quickly, and was completely understanding when an accident caused us to be late. Our stay far exceeded our expectations and we look forward to going again!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of THE BEST AirBnBs I’ve ever stayed at!!! So freaking cozy, cute, clean, and happy. I didn’t realize how large the place was until I was pleasantly surprised - it’s basically an intimate house!! It has everything you could need and more. I made a late-night grocery run and was greeted by the floofiest and happiest kittens, welcomed into my warm and cozy stay, and given a total oasis on my work trip. 20/10 recommend!!!"

I needed a couple of days to rest and relax, and I could not have found a better place to do so. The bed is large and comfortable, the living and kitchen area ample. I spent several hours on the swinging day bed on the pavilion, reading and watching the farm animals. The hosts were super friendly and easy to chat with.

Just a wonderful peaceful place to relax and enjoy. Very comfortable outdoor living with all kinds of out door hang outs including swinging bed under tin roof pavilion pool side.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay at the farm, this place by far is a hidden gem.
Sandra and Stacy treat you like family! Inside the AirBNB the bed is huge, comfy, homie feel.
The kitchen is updated with a huge refrigerator, washer/dryer combo in the kitchen, a dishwasher!
The living room has 2 large sofas and they are super inviting! My favorite is the porch area and I relax on the swing.

This cottage was one of the best places I have ever stayed. The farm animals (and how friendly they were) were a definite highlight for me.
Walking into the cottage I was in love with the whole vibe. The cleanliness was impeccable, that’s something that is huge for me. And the decor was absolutely superb, from all the little decorations everything was beyond what I envisioned!
After a day of errands, being able to sit on the back porch was one of the highlights of my trip. I would recommend this cottage who is looking for a beautiful place to relax and feel like home at the same time!

FYI the bed is really a king which is important for me since I’m 6’4”. At the time of my booking it was listed as a queen. It is easily one of the most comfortable beds you will ever sleep in. The dog mentioned is one of the sweetest dogs I ever met. It is a small dog that I didn’t hear bark not once during my stay. If you are in the area and don’t stay here you will miss a wonderful experience.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandra's place was absolutely beautiful. If Country Living magazine came to life, it would be this house.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was just lovely! So peaceful! Everything was very clean and homey. They left a binder with information about my stay, things to do and local stores and restaurants.
I called them to see if they had a step stool I could use to get into the bed which is kind of high. Normally not a problem, but I was still recovering from surgery and it was a bit of a struggle for me. They were on their way to their anniversary dinner (in Tennessee, I believe) so I told them not to worry about it. They texted me the next morning after I left for the day to let me know they had left a step stool by the door for me. It made all the difference for me and the bed is sooo comfortable! I would definitely stay there again and absolutely recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay at Mark & Annette's Cottage, yet again. The Cottage is warm, comforting, clean and so convenient to most things in downtown. During our stay the power went out due to Mother Nature. It was just a windy, stormy day. The hosts were so prompt in calling to check on us and cared enough to make sure we had everything we needed during the short power outage. They even brought a care basket to the Cottage filled with candles and things we might need. It is nice to know we have a place to visit where we feel right at home. Spring Cottage is highly recommended!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark and Annette are so amazing. I don’t think I can put it into words. They helped us out in our most desperate time. We fell into bad luck during our trip but Mark and Annette stepped in; even though they didn’t need to. I can’t recommend them enough as hosts, and cannot say enough words as to how terrific these two people are as individuals. I do want to put out there that getting an Uber or a Lyft may be more difficult if there’s a large event going on, as there are not that many, but a taxi service may be more reliable or maybe rent a vehicle if you must travel. Everything is so walkable the food is great. The community is very welcoming. We will definitely be booking with them again, if they will have us again, when we decide to come back."

Additionally, Mark and Annette were wonderful hosts; we got to visit with them for a bit and they were gracious and very helpful. We would highly recommend their place and hope to return again in the future."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Place is so cozy, so peaceful, and in such an ideal location. Cave Spring is a neat little historic town and the cottage is located within walking distance of the little downtown and the park. Mark and Annette outdid themselves with the decor and all and so many extras!!! We didn't get to use the fire put and toast the marshmallows they put out for us but my husband did eat some . And the natural spring water from the Cave, which is within a nice walking distance, was such a plus. You get more than the moneys worth here. And Rome is in easy driving distance for more , food and fun. Thanks Mark and Annette. We used this as a prayer retreat, my husband and I and it was perfect."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was clean and comfortable. The decor was on point! Most local shops and restaurants were closed as we arrived on Sunday and Monday was a holiday. Rome was a short drive away so we're able to find plenty to do.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying here and we will be back again in another week. It’s our escape into the wilderness where we love to be. It has that feel of a cozy cabin nestled in the woods and it’s just what we wanted. Cindy is proactive with instructions and updates about stuff on her property. Cindy also responds quickly with any questions you have. We will continue to come back year after year!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place to stay, and priced as an absolute steal. Cindy's place was incredible beautiful, and in a relaxing wooded area that was still within a reasonable distance from Rome, GA. We enjoyed our stay here with 3 little ones. We didn't use many of the amenities, but they are numerous and go above and beyond what is listed in the description. I saw board games, tons of folding chairs, and even a pack and play. Great great place!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our visit was great, renewing my faith in Airbnbs (our visit to another Airbnb six months ago in another state was disappointing to the point that I didn't think I'd rent another one). But our stay at Dogwood Creek was very comfortable. Cindy did a really nice job renewing this period house, and it's clean and nicely furnished. We were on the go a lot during our two-night stay but it was a pleasant place to return to at night. We'd be happy to return."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beds: Gel memory foam mattresses, nice protectors (not crinkly plastic ones), bedding was clean, tons of warm fuzzy blankets. Best sleep!
Linens_ Ample towels and toiletries!
Water Pressure was AMAZING! Great water heater, phenomenal dishwasher!
Kitchen: Spectacular supply! crockpot, mixer, tons of pans and containers that made eating in and enjoying time with family such a breeze!
Internet was used heavily as I work online and had No connection issues when I had to log in. Cell phone coverage was minimal (AT&T) But wi-fi calling worked just fine.
Beautiful yard with plenty of space to enjoy.
Hopefully next time we return it will be summer so we can enjoy the pool!
Highly recommend this place! I have stayed with many vacation rentals and this was one of my favorites!"

Nice long country road with very nice houses and at the end…. A Hobby Lobby!!!🤗 Thank you Cindy for sharing your home!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy's place was perfect for a long weekend away with my husband. The home is welcoming and had everything we needed to have a nice relaxing reset.
The home is exactly as described. The kitchen was well stocked with all the pots, pans, and utensils needed to cook a meal.
The pool was still open when we went and was clean and clear when we arrived. A generous supply of pool / beach towels were also available. Make sure to bring sandals when going out to the pool as there is a small walk across the driveway to enter the pool. The pool was private with plenty of sun and shade.
There was plenty of outdoor lounging space on the front and back porch and around the pool. There was a firepit in the front and a standing outdoor fireplace in the back and wood for both.
The location isn't too close to the hustle and bustle of the city but close enough for a trip to Broad St to see some of what Rome has to offer for visitors.
We really enjoyed our stay and look forward to going back!"

There wasn’t a conversation that was full, she was very kind and caring sharing stuff about her life it truly felt welcoming. When we come back in town I know exactly where I’ll be staying 😊"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cindy’s place is amazing! I could not have asked for more in an Air BnB then what Cindy’s place provided.
The home was surrounded by woods with a creek, footbridge and fire pit. We enjoyed the pool and it’s space as we would eat then swim as we enjoyed the day. The home is clean, comfortable and has the best set up! Wifi worked like a charm.
We are interested in living down South and Cindy went above and beyond to provide information on the city: schools, housing, restaurants. The time she took with me was so much appreciated.
The house had every amenity including pods for laundry and dishwasher.
We will be back! If we are not lucky enough to grab this place, we will definitely seek out her other Air BnBs!!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"There is nothing like smell of a wood cabin and this house had it all. Between the three different fire pits/places, firefly’s, remote woods, running water from the creek, and cozy cabin feel inside, this house was a perfect getaway with the kids. We will be back!"

2022-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"There mold on the ceiling of theTV room. Also the lock to the back door to the garden room needs an adjustment. The door under the kitchen sink won’t close and the bathroom ceiling dripped half a pail of water when it rained. We placed a bucket over the toilet, which caught the rainfall. Pretty cute bcuz I love old things but undesired. Back patio furniture and the chairs around the fire pit outside in the front hadn’t been cleaned 4 a while. Overall great stay, awesome views, and beautiful architecture but needs some work. Also, living area has a wasp nest, which my grandkids were obsessed with. It’s natural considering the location but something needs to be done to control wasps on the inside"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great host. Wonderful home, gorgeous location, great amenities, we will definitely return!"

Amazing hosts for an amazing place (even better than on the pictures)!
It has everything you need to start with. You get that cosy feeling when you walk in. Garry had started a fire in the fire place for our arrival. Unfortunately we had car issues when over there. Cindy and Garry were kind enough to let us use one of theirs until it was fixed.
There is only kindness about Cindy and Garry."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this place was amazing! pictures do not do it justice. you have so much space and everything you need. i love the sunroom and coffee area and laundry room. cute little bridge and creek next to the house.

Huge bonus that we could take our dogs with us as well, and they also had a great time. Julie was an extremely accommodating and thoughtful host. Pictures don’t do the place justice, it’s just beautiful. Incredible price for the value of our time there. I’d recommend this to friends and family any day."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay! Conveniently located near JSU—27 minutes away. The mattresses in all the bedrooms were so comfortable. We ate locally at Shell’s Downtown—great wings. We’d rent again.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,good location nice views.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We met family at Julie’s place for a quiet weekend together. The guys went to Indian Mountain ATV park and had a great time. It’s very close to the house. I’d love to bring my grandkids back during warm weather and let them play in the creek that runs along the back of the property.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! We were in town for a work trip. Julie was very responsive to any questions I had. The house was very cozy as well. After some very long days it was great to come back to place that felt like home!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came to spend a weekend here because of the location, right next to (arguably) the best section of the Chief Ladiga Trail. Parked the vehicle and just used our bikes the whole time. Rode into town the first day to eat at a local coffee shop and stock up at a grocery store, both of which were very close to the trail. The platform queen-sized bed in the master bedroom was the most comfortable I’ve ever found at any Airbnb or hotel. Wife also really enjoyed the jetted tub. Complimentary bottled and refrigerated filtered water were nice touches. Kitchen was well stocked and equipped and we also appreciated the charcoal grill out back. Cozy well decorated cottage. Makes you feel right at home. Host Julie was also very responsive and helpful."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome Place, Great stay for the race weekend!!! Highly Recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We very much enjoyed our stay. The cottage is very comfortable and well equipped. Instructions abound for everything you may need to use. The setting is beautiful with a creek in the back and the Chief Ladiga Trail literally at the end of a very private driveway. The fenced back yard for our dog was great. Best of all the most scenic part of the Chief Ladiga Trail is 5 miles on either side of the driveway. I highly recommend for cyclists or those seeking a quiet getaway.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,This place is beautiful. It’s isolated and feels so cozy. Julie is awesome and great at communicating. Very accommodating.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was the CUTEST cottage EVER!! Loved the decor and privacy! The hostesss was the SWEETEST!!!!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. We biked the chief Ladiga trail and it’s literally at the end of the driveway. Couldn’t get any closer. The home, property and setting were excellent."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Very nice and comfortable house, privately located. You are in nature and steps from the Chief Ladiga Trail, which is why we chose it. We were adult couples and all the bedrooms were comfortable and the kitchen was well-supplied. A peaceful and happy holiday weekend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,WE had a great time.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place! Would highly recommend.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From beginning to end, this is experience was outstanding!
The communication with Julie, the house, the location and everything else could not have been better!
We'll be back."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, quiet place to stay. We stayed due to proximity to the bike trail. Next time we might be back to try some kayaking with Terrapin Outdoor Center."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Julie's place was a fantastic peaceful getaway. The surroundings were beautiful and the house had everything you might need. The bike trail being at the end of the driveway was great and there was lots to do in the area for nature and the local town. I'd definitely recommend staying here.

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Always a great stay
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The pictures do not do the cottage justice! I drove up to the warm lights of the Christmas tree. I felt like I was staying in a friends house. There were so many thoughtful details. There is firewood for the fire pit and makings for ‘s’mores. Tons of yard and board games. It is just the driveway away from the bike trail. Make sure you follow Julie’s directions though. I was following my husband who was riding the trail from Powder Springs and I discovered county road 94 stops just short of the cottage as the bridge is blocked off! It was just the two of us but there are four bedrooms making this a great place for several couples or families. We definitely want to come back and stay longer in the spring or summer as it is right on the water.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Excellent location for the best part of the ladiga trail. also convenient to Terrapin Creek for kayaking. The house was very well appointed. It is remote, but we did not encounter any dogs on the trail thankfully. kitchen is well equipped. Wi-Fi worked the entire time we were there."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Privacy! It’s like a private bed and breakfast! Went there for work and it turned into a perfect get away
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,the house was very clean and it is in a nice location
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home has it all - very charming, super clean, nicely decorated. The host put out a gorgeous welcome basket - thank you for your very thoughtful touches, from the yummy treats to the plentiful supplies of everything we could possibly need. Tucked away down a beautiful country road with walking and bike paths - huge yard, screened in back porch, fire pit … we couldn’t have asked for a nicer stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful and very clean !
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Julie’s place is an ideal spot for families looking to take advantage of the many outdoor activities in the area. It is also close to the shops and other destinations on Jacksonville and Anniston. We’re sure to stay again!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house and location in nature :)
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,This cottage is beautiful and accommodating! Such a fantastic location by the Ladiga Trail!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Chief Ladiga Trail Cabin is large and well equipped in a quiet, secluded area but just fifteen minutes away from restaurants, gas stations and other amenities. Front porch, enclosed back porch, fire pit and jetted tub are a few of the highlights. Truly a lovely spot to stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at this adorable cabin 2-3 times a year for the last 3 plus years. We absolutely love it! Amazing host, beautiful home, and stunning views.
It has truly become our home away from home."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was charming and had everything we needed for our stay. Julie gave detailed directions to the house and we found it with no trouble at all. We will definitely stay again and highly recommend to our family and friends.
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our time at the Creekside Cottage. The location is ideal for exploring the Chief Ladiga (and Silver Comet) trail, and we did lots of biking during our time there. We loved the fire pit and appreciated the extra goodies that Julie had for us (s'mores kits and roasting sticks, popcorn, and oatmeal). The master bed downstairs was very comfortable and I appreciated the basket full of clean hand towels and washcloths. We had a few minor issues with communication and supplies, but things were resolved very quickly. My youngest child is 8, so we were fine, but I could imagine that younger kids might have a difficult time with the antiques in the house and the hardwood stairs to where all of the bedrooms are (except master). All in all it was a great stay!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is special. Anyone biking on the Chief Ladiga / Silver CometTrail should highly consider staying here. It is right off the trail. It is a remote place in the forest with few humans near by. It is 5 miles by bike to the town of Piedmont.
The kitchen is fully set up for cooking, we made particularly good use of the electric skillet and the coffee maker and of course the BBQ.
There are four bedrooms, 3 upstairs with one bathroom and a very nice master bedroom on the main floor with a master bath. The open living area, walls and the floor seem to conduct sound, so don't expect lots of privacy.
You can do your laundry with the washer and dryer. There is ample property on which to have a bonfire, or throw a frisbee.
Julie, the owner is extremely helpful and communicative. Which I find very important."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home in a beautiful location. My family and I appreciated the oatmeal and popcorn that was provided.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful peaceful location. Great roomy four bedroom with comfy beds, beautifully decorated. Easy check in and out. Sweet owner who is easily reached and helpful. We will be back! All the amenities you can possibly need."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were two families of 3 + 4, and the setup was perfect for us! We really enjoyed the house and the grounds, especially the fire pit. The Ladiga Trail was right at the end of the driveway. Next time we will bring our bicycles! The town of Piedmont is super-convenient, but you feel as if you are miles from civilization. Great stay, great value. Thanks again, Julie!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family had a great time! We look forward to coming back and spending time on the trail and down at the cheek.
The house is cozy and causal but lots of room and outdoor spaces. The setting is ideal for a quiet, active family gathering."
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,Great secluded location to relax and unwind. Great host. Will be back.
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,Another great stay!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Once again, we had a great time at the cabin. We especially like the Chief Ladiga trail at the end of the driveway and the fall colors. Also the Dugger mountain hike. Cabin is quiet and plenty big enough for us. Nice front and back porches to relax on and a big fire pit to roast the provided marshmellows on. Several nice yard games are provided."
2021-10-01,4,Group trip,"Julies place is the perfect location if you want to cycle through quiet woods along rambling creeks with interesting bridges and mountains and fields. The house is perfectly situated on the trail in a very remote location, but merely 5 miles from the grocery.
Our party consisted of 5 upper middle aged or senior women and 3 senior men. The layout ensured that everybody was in close proximity to the necessities.
She asks us not to park on the grass, but there is ample room to park in the drive. We had 5 cars which easily fit. There is a wonderful front porch and a great screened in back porch. The kitchen has most everything you might need. The living room is very comfortable. And Julie has supplied many games for rainy days or yard play.
I would definitely recommend this stay and hope that we can return. For us it was about the trail. We rode 44 miles from the cottage to Weaver on Saturday, with a stop at Struts in Jacksonville. Sunday we rode out before dawn to the Georgia state line, which was another 20 miles.
Beautiful country. Beautiful cottage and property. Very memorable trip."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Very clean and comfortable with lots of helpful instructions from the owner!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,A very well kept getaway! Julie was great at communicating and seeing if we needed anything. The cleaning crew was extremely friendly and did a thorough job. We were in the house for 3 weeks and didn't have any issues. This was an excellent place to get away in the woods for a few weeks!
2021-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay! We came to ride the bike trail and we had great access right from the house. We were also excited about the creek. There was no easy way to get to the creek. It is a steep drop off to the water. So prepare to climb if you want to attempt to get to the water.
The house itself had plenty of room and everything we needed for a weekend get away. We found 3 out of 4 beds to be extremely firm for our taste."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place and great host.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Perfect place to stay. Very comfortable and relaxing.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie’s place was perfect for our group of four single adults! It was secluded, quiet, clean, and had everything we needed for our 4-day trip to ride the Silver Comet and Chief Ladiga bike trails."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, very clean, very peaceful, would recommend anyone to stay, we enjoyed it so much."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house. I wish I had more time just to explore the nature around the house. Very peaceful.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,This cabin is fantastic. It is right on the bike trail. Far enough out to be very private but just 5 mins from town. Julie is a great host and provides all the homey touches that makes this place so special. I definitely recommend it for large families
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very special place in the Talladega National Forrest! The Chief Ladiga Trail is practically right outside your door, a beautiful ride! The cottage was spacious and equipped with everything you need to relax and unwind. We especially enjoyed the fire pit and smores! Julie provides a wonderful experience!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved the place, so cute and peaceful! Julie is very quick to respond if you message her or need anything."
2021-05-01,3,Group trip,"NOT suitable for children.
It's a very pretty home, however there are an extreme number of easily breakable items in literally every room, making it a nightmare if you have kids. Also the complete lack of phone service is something you should be aware of. It's also rather hard to find at night. If you want a nice private hideout for a small group of adults than this will be great."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was fantastic! We will definitely stay again! Julie was extremely easy to deal with and quick to answer any questions! The house was beautiful as well as the location.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location for touring the Chief Ladiga Bike Trail. Enjoyed our stay.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for biking and nature enthusiast! Beautiful cabin!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a special place! Julie didn’t miss a detail in providing anything you might need and extra special touches that made the trip so great. This is a true gem of a place, and we can’t wait to go back!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay with Julie! A wonderful spot for a family.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet house in the woods. Right on paved trail. Well decorated. Plenty of space.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay, well stocked to meet many needs, a quiet and refreshing retreat."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place in a great location!
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay here, came in town for a wedding that was about 45 minutes away. The cabin was perfect for the number of people we had. Thank you for sharing your place with us."
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, quiet, awesome scenery, very private and secluded ."
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,Always peaceful and perfect
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We found Julie’s home as we arrived in AL for my dad’s funeral. While we weren’t able to spend much time at the house, the setting was serene, peaceful and was a wonderful place to stay. Next time we are in the area, this will be our go to. If you need to recharge, escape, or just find some inner peace you will love this home! ❤️"
2021-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to get away for relaxation. Phones don’t work, so it was nice to see those who are normally glued to their phones doing something other than that. It was clean and I especially enjoyed soaking in the jet tub."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place very roomy and the wildlife was an added bonus
2020-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a neat home! Spacious, well decorated, and comfy. It felt like home when we walked through the door. The Christmas tree was lit when we arrived and that was an especially nice touch. We did not realize how remote the home is which wasn’t a negative for us. It made for an interesting ride in the dark as the roads got narrower and changed from pavement to gravel and we wondered if our GPS was correct! There is no cell signal at least for Verizon, so if you’re looking to be unplugged, this house makes that easy for you. You could totally disconnect from the world and give up the WiFi and Direct TV.
We chose this home in place of staying at the Hampton in Jacksonville due to the pandemic. The home was quite clean, Julie was always responsive, and there are lots of games, bikes for the Chief Ladiga trail, the makings for s’mores was a nice touch. I personally loved the screened back porch in the warm sun to read. We didn’t use the fire pit but it was available as was an outdoor heater on the front porch. Julie has clearly gone through what makes an Airbnb house desirable and made those things available to those who stay here.
The book of instructions and local tips was great. We found the Elevated Grounds cafe that was recommended had great coffee, great breakfast wraps and wonderful service.
Although our son graduated from JSU which was the point of our visit, should we return to the area in the future, we would choose this house again."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and many thoughtful touches!
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Very roomy quant home. This home was well laid out and decorated. We where well informed about the home and area due to notes and information that was left and given to us. Owners answered all questions before we even asked. Would highly recommend.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We chose the cottage because we needed a place to house our family of 5 for a nearby wedding, but the home ended up making our down time feel like a wonderful getaway!! We enjoyed the games, the peaceful front porch, the jetted tub, and we had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable and the kids kept saying, “This is the coolest place!” Thank you Julie!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We found this little treasure to be right off the Ladiga Trail and it was perfect for what we wanted to do which was ride our bikes. It was incredibly clean, completely warming environment and I would recommend."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay tucked away from busy city life.
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,Perfect getaway if you are wanting to unplug and enjoy the outdoors.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,A very remote and quiet location. If you need peace and quiet. This is the place.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place queit
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot agree more with how accurate the reviews that I read before booking Julie's cottage. The cottage was creatively decorated, and there was plenty of space. Julie provides some added little touches, like the s'mores, as well as indoor and outdoor games and fire pit. It is a great place to go and disconnect and feel right at home."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time in Julie’s home. It was decorated beautifully and she left many thoughtful touches like bottled water, dark chocolate, and fixings for s’mores. She is very kind and quick to respond. If you’re planning to ride the Chief Ladiga Trail her location is absolutely fabulous and the trail is incredibly lovely near her home. We especially loved riding toward the Georgia state line/Silver Comet Trail. I also highly recommend kayaking Terrapin Creek while there. It’s a beautiful, fun float. There’s also a great little coffee shop in Piedmont called Elevated Grounds. The coffee, food, and owners were lovely. Our experience was a very nice and much needed get away from home. We’re already planning our next trip."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a nice getaway! The thoughtful touches, like the free firewood and s’mores making kit, or the fact that every light switch was labeled, was very helpful and much appreciated. The beds were very comfortable with high quality sheets. Response times were also quick and thorough."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute, thoughtful accomodations! You can't get any more convenient to the Chief Ladiga Trail. Remote, quiet and so relaxing. Was a perfect long weekend."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Julie was a great host, and she added so many special touches that made us feel so welcomed. The space accommodated our family well. We thoroughly enjoyed being able to sit fireside and enjoy s’mores, with a mister and music to keep us comfortable. Definitely a location for everyone that enjoys the outdoors."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The perfect getaway!!! My family and I had the perfect weekend in the woods! It was better than expected! We were looking to disconnect and this was perfect! Julie left us s’mores and our children absolutely loved them! Fireflies!!! I haven’t seen fireflies since I was a kid! It was magical!!! We will definitely be back!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's a beautiful house at a beautiful location! I loved the decor. There were plenty of rooms for everybody. Pretty much everything we needed was in the kitchen. We were delighted to find the ""fixin's"" for S'mores right there on the counter and we certainly took advantage of them. It turned out the weather was near perfect for a fire in the fire pit in the front yard. We were kept company by between 5 and 12 deer that were to the North of the house every night. There was also a bunny rabbit that was hopping around the yard. During the day we found large cat tracks behind the house and what looked like the tracks of a small bear along the bicycle trail. But what was best was the night sounds echoing through the mountains as we sat by the fire roasting hot dogs! A perfect get-away!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Out of the way and secluded.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our “home away from home”. Cozy.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! From the well stocked kitchen to the comfy beds to the best bath towels ever, it was great! They take great care to make sure that you are comfortable and have everything that you need. We loved sitting by the fire at night and watching the wildlife during the day. It is a beautiful, quiet location where you can relax and feel far away from every day life. The kids loved riding their bikes on the bike trail and playing hide and seek all over the property. It’s just a really beautiful place, with an awesome, attentive host. I can’t wait to go back!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Beautiful home with beautiful views! We will definitely come back!
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful place! Do not trust Apple Maps! Follow the instructions that the host gives you. There is no cell phone service, but the internet is super fast, and we had no problem using WiFi calling. All of the rooms were immaculate. Each with a different theme. Definitely planning on staying again."
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"We chose this home to have our Desert Storm reunion. It couldn't have been more perfect for us! The home was decorated farmhouse style, which was absolutely beautiful. The host had a sign to welcome us by the front door. She also had smores condiments waiting on the counter for us to enjoy. There was a tray on our bed with bottles of water and chocolate! We had a firepit for our bonfire, charcoal grill for our cooking, and beautiful scenery to enjoy! Don't think twice about staying here, or you'll miss out on some great memories!"
2019-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very roomy and nicely decorated. Remote location on the Chief ladiga bike trail. Great for groups and cyclists.
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay at the Chief Ladiga Cottage was AMAZING. I can't recommend this place enough. If you are looking for a home-away-from-home get away, this is it. The house was wonderful (so clean, cute, and homey) and the hospitality from Julie was excellent (she was constantly in contact, easy to reach, and extremely kind). Julie gave recommendations for things to do in the area (hikes, bike trails, local food, etc). We spent our days going to local parks for hiking (there were so many amazing national parks within 45 minutes of the house). There is also a really nice biking trail right next to the house. The amenities provided at the house were more than you could ask for and the sleeping arrangements were perfect! Plenty of space for a large group or a small couple. We didn't want to leave. I honestly cannot recommend this place enough! Thanks, Julie, for all of your amazing hospitality!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic and will be back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place!!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,I feel so lucky to have found this peace of heaven on Earth spot. Richard has done such a fantastic job of truly bringing you into a perfectly peaceful experience. Fully set up with anything you could need or want. My soul truly needed this country peace away from subdivision living and this was the absolute perfect spot. Sitting on the front porch watching the rain with my love was perfection. Richard we hope you had a wonderful Birthday. Can't wait to visit again soon.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Good place to stay if your in the area, really close to town"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Richard lives next door. He is friendly and full of information and he made us feel kindly at home.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I came to the area to bicycle segments of the Silver Comet trail. We both enjoyed our stay at The Roost. Richard has gone out of his way to make a comfortable home for visitors. A hot shower and comfy king sized bed was most welcome after a day of riding. Special to find an electric blanket for a chilly night! The property is great for both hiking and relaxing on any of the porches. Also had fun shooting pool on the covered deck area Richard graciously shared with guests. I would recommend staying here for anyone who likes a peaceful rural area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very comfortable and Richard was very friendly and polite.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay when riding Indian Mountain.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Richard's pace was the perfect home base for exploring the Silver Comet and Chief Ledigga rail trails. The home had everything we needed to relax at the end of a day cycling.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,💪
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Roost was perfect for our needs. My husband and son had a hunting trip and Richard’s place was perfect for that. I stayed to cook and such and it had most things I needed. Richard is incredibly responsive! Highly recommend The Roost and would stay again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,If your looking for a quiet place in the country this is a great spot. The kids loved having a bon fire and playing with Richard’s horse. We will be back for sure!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Roost is a must stay lodging and recovery spot for Bikers riding the Silver Comet Trail. The mattresses and pillows are supper comfortable for great nights rest. The whole place is roomy, comfortable and the kitchen fully supplied with everything you need to make a nutritious recovery meal after long days ride. Richard, our host was attentive and responsive to our needs. He went above and beyond by generously supplying us extra butter and bread when we came up short on food supplies! I miss calculated thinking the Roost was closer to town and stores. So bring in food supplies for your multi day rides or stays. We thoroughly recommend The Roost and Richard, plus his pooches. Genuinely warm and inviting. We had a lovely nights stay before biking on to the Alabama/Georgia State line. Our 91 year old Mother rode 38.8 miles with us. I truly believe the good nights rest and recovery at the Roost really made this possible. Thank you Richard!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super nice, has everything laid out for easy access and simple instructions on where everything is and how things work."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house!!! Great property!!! And the best home owner I’ve had the pleasure to rent from!!! Richard surpassed all expectations of a good host. He met us at the house when we arrived and made us feel completely welcome. By the end of our short stay he felt like an old friend.
BTW: If you’re looking for a place to stay while you ride motorcycles at Highland Park, this is a great place. Plenty of room to park a full sized truck and trailer."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! We were in town for an event at Indian Mountain ATV Park. The house is about 25 min away from the park which wasn’t bad at all! There was plenty of room to turn around and park a truck and trailer. Richard was super nice and very helpful. The house was perfect and in such a peaceful area. We also enjoyed the dog and the horse! Definitely recommend staying here, we would do it again in a heartbeat!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing host. Quite place to rest
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We got to visit with Richard and it was like talking with an old friend. place was beautiful,spacious and extremely comfortable.we hated we didn't get to tell him goodbye.i would definystay again"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard came to check on us and reviewed everything we needed to know. Everything was labeled with clear instructions. Beautiful quiet setting close to Silver Comet bike trail access lot and sky diving location. He provided plenty of Keurig pods with machine, fresh spring water and candy. The charcoal and gas grills we clean. Charcoal provided. Direct TV. Three covered porches with rocking chairs. Two bedrooms with comfortable kings. Would definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,My girlfriend and I absolutely loved this cute rustic farmhouse. The secluded beautiful location was just what we needed for a weekend getaway. Would totally recommend this to all. It’s a perfect getaway for 2 couples.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough good things about The Roost! It was very clean, had all the basics needed & is very peaceful & quiet. Richard was a great host, was attentive & anticipated our needs. He even includes mineral water from nearby Cave Spring which is SO good! We enjoyed sitting out on the porch in the rocking chairs. I also enjoyed meeting Richard’s pets, George (cat) and especially Triscuit (horse) whom I got to pet & feed apples. Just a wonderful stay! We will definitely stay there again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Top-notch!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Richard went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable in The Roost

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Myra and Tom were fantastic and accommodating hosts. Their place is an oasis of peace and tranquility. It is more like being in a park! My husband and I rode bicycles on the Silver Comet Trail. We then had some great conversation with our hosts. The bed was comfortable, the house was beautiful, and hospitality was unending! Breakfast was a great selection of yummy goodness. We will be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Beck Lake Suite was very comfortable and the property is stunning and peaceful. Most of all, we enjoyed time with our hosts Thomas and Maira. They were so gracious and went out of their way to ensure our stay was safe and enjoyable. Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I needed a place to stay while I went on my annual ride on the Silver Comet Trail. The Manor caught our attention since it is on a private lake, had walking trails through the woods and was near the Silver Comet. We found The Manor to be perfect! We were in the Becks Lake Room with its own private bathroom. It met our needs well but the beauty of the rental is the common areas we were able to enjoy and of course the breakfast Myra and Tom provided each morning. Absolutely fabulous! We will recommend it to others and likely will return ourselves."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful property, delicious breakfast, helpful and kind hosts. We really loved out short stay in the cabin. It had everything we needed. Myra also makes great Jam, and the resident dogs are so sweet and playful. We had a wonderful trip and hope to return."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"perfect stop for rest and relaxation while riding the Trail. Beautiful home, plenty of privacy. Hosts offered to drive us into town for a beer run. super friendly dogs if your needing a little pet therapy while missing your own pets. Breakfast was FANTASTIC, lots of options to choose from. Would definitely stay again and will recommend to all our biking friends."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The Manor is beautiful and comfortable. Thomas and Myra are spectacular host.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Manor at Beck Lake is a wonderful place to stay. Tom and Myra are amazing host and the proximity to the Silver Comet and Chief Ladiga Trails is a plus for cyclists riding the trail and need a place to stay.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful location. Thomas and Myra made us feel so at home and so welcomed, it felt more like we were visiting old friends. The property is beautiful and it was in perfect proximity to a wedding we were attending at Hightower Falls.
From the beautiful fire place at The Manor, to the delish home cooked breakfast, our comfortable room (complete with electric blanket to warm your toes) - we couldn’t have been made to feel more comfortable. We would highly recommend anyone to stay here!!
Myra and Thomas thank you so much!!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Such kind people
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place with all its natural beauty. Friendly host very helpful. Clean and Beautiful home. Can't wait to go back.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great stay! I came to Rockmart for a wedding at ""In the Woods,"" so I didn't really get a chance to use all the amenities this bed and breakfast has. But, the stay was great! Super easy check-in, and Thomas gave me easy directions to find the place and my room. If you're coming on Sunday, breakfast is served early, and I overslept, but they left it in the oven for me and had plates, coffee, and water all ready for me when I woke up!
I'll also note I was surprised with how quiet it was, other people were staying there, and I never heard them leave, and I didn't hear anyone cook in the morning either."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Friendly staff, peaceful setting, perfect location."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,An amazing stay.....a life time memory.....a desire to return.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful scenery. Super clean and nice. Super sweet family!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best AirBNB I think I’ve ever had! The kayaking was great, pool looked inviting, great breakfast, nice hiking. Highly recommend and can’t wait to see them again!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,I needed a quick get away from Atlanta. And this was the perfect place. The Hospitality was amazing and I had a wonderful time Kayaking and breathing in the Georgia fresh air. Highly Recommend staying here.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"So my husband and I stayed last night here at the Manor on Becks Lake in Rockmart. We were so impressed with the beautiful lake views and more than anything the sweet hospitality we received from the owners. We felt like and were treated like royalty the entire time. If you enjoy just being outdoors and looking at God's beautiful creations please consider this bed and Breakfast in Rockmart GA. As soon as we checked out I had to share on my facebook page how serene, how beautiful, how relaxing our stay was. So this is what I shared on my FB page for all my friends to see: “ We want to tell you all about a bed and breakfast we stayed in last night. We just wanted to do a little over night visit close to home. And boy did we hit the jackpot. A couple from our church have opened their beautiful home overlooking their ten-acre lake with 50 beautiful acres for walks (or sitting and looking and thinking about walking). They have fishing and kayaking too for those who like that. But oh my goodness the breakfast was absolutely delicious and they made enough for an army. So you are asking where is the gem of a place? How about.....rockmart ga. Yep we went and stayed 15 minutes from our own house and had one of the most peaceful relaxing overnight stays we have ever done. I guess I just want everyone to experience that same welcome we received from this very sweet Christian couple who opened their home to us. The name of this place is The Manor at Becks Lake. And you reserve thru Airbnb. I know Rockmart is close by for us but well worth the trip to go.”"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We found this place after lots of searching for a local getaway. I like to believe it was fate. Myra and Tom were such amazing hosts and we couldn't have felt more at home. They welcomed us into their home and made us feel as family. The lake and kayaks were our favorite. The animals on the property were a hit with the kids, the goats were so cute! The pool looked beautiful (not ready for use at this time). They gave us a tour of the property and some back history on it. They made a yummy breakfast for us on each morning of our stay and invited us to join the family for dinner. Our kids just adored them. We will definitely be back to stay at the Manor. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Robin was the most awesome host and her Red Barn and surrounding area was so cool and beautiful. Anytime we are in the area again - which we will be - we WILL be a repeat guest.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The PERFECT spot for a relaxing girls' weekend. We're ready to go back and don't care if we ever leave the property!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This charming barn stay was unique in style, location and all the “above and beyond extras” provided by Robin. We saw wild turkey, deer, so many wild birds. It provided country like privacy with the touches of a boutique hotel. There were shampoos, lotions, plenty of linens, a well stocked utensil cabinet with pots, pans, glasses, etc. We especially loved the s’mores kit and danishes left for us!! Just need to mention that it rained while we were here and the sound of it was so pretty on the rooftop. Oh, and working bathtubs overlooking the woods/fields! We highly recommend this place. Go a couple miles down the road for quaint antique shopping, taste local candy or kayak a river. Then, onto Rome for regional events or shopping. Enjoy!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We cannot thank Robin for our experience The Holt Family Barn enough. She is absolutely wonderful and her property is amazing. Thank you again and we will be back!!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ms.Robin was a fantasic host. Communicated leading up to the day my stay consistently. The house itself was perfect...clean everything and beautiful layout
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a laid back place to escape your busy life, we highly recommend the barn! Robin was so sweetest host, she checked in on us and made sure we had what we needed. Pete was the best part of the stay, he’s the “farm dog” as we called him, and he made sure to visit us a few times a day. We will definitely be back with our kids!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Comfortable southern hospitality all around.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The kids loved the outdoor tubs! My daughter and I learned to play chess on the oversized outdoor board 😀 Lots of nice grass to run barefoot with our dog. Beautiful sunrise view on the deck. Kitchen had everything we needed. Comfortable mattresses and couches.
We love good food and hiking-highly recommend Doug’s deli in Rome for lunch, Swift &Finch coffee, and Black Bluff Preserve for playing in the creek (short hike with limited parking right in the roadside). All just a short drive from the barn. The ice cream shop in Cave Spring was wonderful. We did fill our water bottles with Cave Spring water which was really good!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Robin was a great host and was very responsive if we needed something. My family had an amazing time and really enjoyed being out in the mountain air and having peace and quiet from the normal daily activities. We look forward to staying there again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing stay and it was just what we were wanting. The Red Barn was peaceful, relaxing, and cozy. It had so much space and had everything one might need when away from home. Our dog loved playing with sweet Petey, who is one of the calmest and nicest dogs I have ever met!! Petey’s co-host Robin, owner of the Red Barn, was just so kind, caring, and thoughtful. She made us feel like we were part of the family.
Time seemed to slow down during our visit to the Red Barn and it was definitely hard to say goodbye."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The pictures are beautiful, but seeing this place in person was an absolute dream. Robin’s place was thoughtfully stocked with everything we needed from seasonings for food, to games and books and even s’mores stuff. The views from the red barn are just gorgeous. It’s situated within minutes from the downtown of Cave spring, but how it’s laid it makes it feel really remote. If the night is clear, you’ll have no shortage of stars to see. We have three kids who had the best time running around the property and playing on the play-set. Robin was great and so helpful during the trip. I will recommend this place to everyone and hope to come back once my husband returns from deployment. Thank you for such a memorable experience!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Red Barn was a delightful getaway for our family. We can’t wait to go back.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The pictures don’t do the barn justice! It is super clean, well decorated, cute little added touches, fully stocked kitchen and games, and has so much character. It was the perfect spot to just enjoy our time together. We are a family of six and had plenty of space. The outdoor space is so nice even in the winter months. We enjoyed our visits from Petey, the dog, as well. We went to Rome, GA for a nice meal and to explore. Cave Spring is a cute little town. We also ventured to Little River Canyon and De Soto Falls in Alabama to hike and see waterfalls. It was a great spot to relax but also has things to do that aren’t far. Robin was also had great communication. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the place very much! Great place to stay!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Robin is so friendly and very helpful. The cabin is so clean and has everything you need. It's very rustic and very comfortable. The view is just breath taking. I've enjoyed it here again and will return.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Robin is one of the best hosts I’ve ever came across! She was sweet and kind and extremely helpful whenever we needed anything. She was very attentive and friendly and understanding of certain situations.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Red Barn was simply spectacular.
We loved how cozy the place was with a breathtaking view, fire pit, and outdoor bathtubs! Robins recommendations were all winners. We loved hiking the beautiful Pinhoti trail and perusing around downtown Cave Spring.
Robin was super responsive and a wonderful host. Eager to come back and visit again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The barn was very clean and such a fun place to stay! The kids loved staying up in the loft and playing outside. We also loved taking a bath outside at night in the cool tubs! Oh, and Peety was so friendly! The kids loved loving on him and he loved it too! We are already talking about coming back to stay again!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the cabin. It was cozy & comfortable with everything we needed to feel right at home.
It was tastfully decorated with many extra amenities that we were not expecting. One of my favorites was the coffee bar & the smore kit.
There were plenty of games & other things to do.
We loved the beautiful views & serenity.
We highly recommend staying here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay with Robin. She is always responsive. We knew how to find it.The power went out in Georgia due to a big storm. Robin had candles for us on arrival which was very late because we of a rental car issue delay. She was very helpful to us during this stressful time. She checked on us & still gave us space & privacy. Last time we did not meet her but this time we got to visit a few times & I was so glad did. She is a new friend. We always enjoy the tubs on the deck. We had family visit us as we did last time. My brother in-law enjoys flying his drone planes. It is a perfect place(if you are a good operator, last time was a tilled field, this time tall cornfield!). Robin recommended Joes BBQ in town & the Cave @ Cave Sprgs( which I had planned) as a way to get food & cool off. The food was great! anyplace where you can get turnips & banana pudding as sides with Beef brisket is ok in my book! Full kitchen to cook & lots of rest! Dozens of Fireflies @ night over fields"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this is the second time we have stayed here this year. It's a great place to stay with a great view. the red barn is beautiful inside and out, and the outside tubs are amazing after a long day to just relax and look at the sky. this is the best place to stay when visiting the area hands down."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Robin is an amazing host! The Red Barn is just what we wanted for a private and peaceful location to work on writing music and completing some songs for our next release. The space is just as described and more!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,This is our second time staying at The Red Barn. It is definitely peaceful. The views are great. Will definitely be coming back to stay again.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed are stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Robin thought of every detail! Very well stocked kitchen and bathroom. Our family enjoyed the Red Barn and would definitely come back again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay here and it met all our expectations and then some! I would highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,What a great stay! Had family and friends and even my dog tell me it was a blast! Petey gave such a warm welcome and we had great fun watching the dogs play around in the field. Would love to stay again!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had enjoyed our stay at Robin's place. It's close to pinoti hike trail and little river canyon. We had our full day-time activities nearby. During the night-time, we setup camp fire and watched starring night sky. It was very joyful vocation for us!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to spend our Anniversary. We enjoyed being there.
Robin is a great host!!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will return. Beautiful area of Georgia and wonderful little place to disconnect and relax
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The red barn was as anticipated and more. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay from the moment we arrived, soaking in the ambiance of rural farm life. Our entire family felt a sense of history of good times, relaxation and country living throughout the property.
The kids enjoyed running and playing in the wide open field and on the play set, the woods and especially Petey, the farm dog. They truly appreciated the landscape and the openness and stayed outside almost the whole time despite it being cold. We built a fire, made s’mores and didn’t turn on a TV or screen even once for the whole week. They did puzzles and arts and crafts and just had fun being kids.
Robin was extremely accommodating and helpful with finding things to do, like going to Cartersville to the Tellus Museum and Chattanooga to the Caves. She even helped us find a great mechanic when we needed brakes because we don’t have hills like this in Florida. Can’t wait to visit the Red Barn again soon."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing place, comfortable and cozy! peaceful surroundings , private , and I loved the welcome dog Petey! I will stay here again if we are ever this way again!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great place to stay very peaceful,great views,inside was amazing the woodwork and rustic barn look was perfect,everything was clean and well taken care of,definitely want to stay again in the near future."

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Loved being close to nature as well as close enough to Cave Spring's downtown to explore. Robin was welcoming and communicative!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We brought our teenager, her best friend, our 9 year old and our fur babies. Everyone loved our stay. The barn is adorable and comfortable. There was plenty of space for everyone. The hosts thought of everything, including shampoo and conditioner, snacks, coffee bar and s’more supplies. We loved meeting Petey the dog. Our hosts were there to greet us, and incredibly responsive. The surroundings are peaceful and beautiful."
2022-12-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"unfortunately there was some very low temperature that caused frozen pipes and having no water , in addition the heating wasn't very comfortable, my kids had to sleep downstairs and I barely slept , then when water was fixed there was issue with shower not draining well and water went all over floor , by that point my kids and me decided to check out early, sadly was not a very good stay . Robin did send a little bit of money back but not sure if I would stay again , even though robin did try to help , things just seemed to keep happening that made it very uncomfortable and my kids didn't sleep well . I hope that everything gets fixed and hopefully rest of stays go smoother for future visitors 🙏"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Red Barn is a great spot. The house was decorated for the holidays and Robin provided coffee and some homemade candy as a thank you for staying. We definitely would stay again.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,We loved the barn! And Petey the dog too. Well appointed and great place for a family stay. Very responsive Host.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the most relaxing girls weekend! The porch and the view from it were spectacular! We got to see a doe and her babies walking across the field. We enjoyed coffee and watched movies and Cooked breakfast to eat all day and Robin was kind enough to bake us some DELICIOUS bread. 10/10 recommend!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best ever! (Towels are included!!!)
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"ABUNDANCE of towels, soap, shampoo, conditioner and COFFEE! All thing’s necessary for an adventurous group to come home to after a long day. The view was awesome and had fantastic parking.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place well-maintained great host
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The red barn is a perfect place to unwind and relax. We stayed in jammies and enjoyed the views from every window, porch, and yard. My husband and I couldn’t have had a better wedding anniversary. This was our second stay and I’m sure there will always be room on our calendar for another stay at the red barn."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay. Everything was good.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fabulous weekend getaway!! Beautiful place!!! Within 30 min to Rome and Berry College. (We were in for Mountain Day!) The barn isn’t high tech, but trust me you’d rather be looking outside then at a device!! We enjoyed meeting “Petey”, our dog loved it, lots of deer in the morning and evening, and the PERFECT spot for a bonfire!! Good directions, easy check in and excellent communication. Would def stay again!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We love staying at the red barn! The location is beautiful and the barn was perfect for us. We had everything that we needed and Robin was an attentive host. Hope to visit again one day!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was such a perfect spot! Beautiful fields and dozens of deer every morning. Isolated and peaceful but not too far from Rome. Very well stocked with comfy beds and tons of cozy blankets! Great communication with the host as well:)
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, private location with everything you need! Unique experience staying in a barn but it’s been finished out perfectly. Great coffee bar. Even provided firewood for the fire pit outside and all the makings for our s’mores! We’ll be back."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great setting.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Red Barn is such a beautiful place to spend a relaxing weekend. The beds are comfortable. There is plenty of room to spread out.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great property, the location is wonderful surrounded by forests and cornfields. Lots of deer all around. Very quiet and peaceful. Very comfortable beds, large clean bathrooms, lots of books and games, a fire pit outside and a wood burning heater inside, the a/c worked super well (it’s hot in July). We had 5 adults, 2 kids and an infant and there was plenty of room for everyone. Kitchen was well equipped and big enough.
The host Robin was very friendly and accommodating!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"The place is great - super cute, neat and lots of supplies. It's secluded so it's a great place to get away. We had a girls weekend and it was a lot of fun. Would be great as a romantic getaway. Thanks so much!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My kids will talk about ""the red barn"" for years. From the outside tub to the upstairs loft we made a million memories. I loved the little town close by and we visited the Savoy auto museum and my kids loved it also. I would recommend this place to families or couples looking for a getaway. Loved it!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The barn is absolutely beautiful! The view is breath taking pictures don’t do justice. Robin was very sweet and we even got a visit from petey! Thank you Robin we will be back!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this was our second stay at the red barn. our first was a family gathering; this time was a quiet getaway for my husband and me. both times, we found this to be an extraordinary airbnb site operated by a first-rate host (robin). the setting is peaceful, beautiful, and set apart. the barn is charmingly and lovingly appointed. all amenities are as advertised: full, complete, and satisfactory. coffee supplies (including grinder) are the fullest and best we've encountered at an airbnb.
and those tubs on the deck! we chose this spot specifically to celebrate the conclusion of my 500-mile walking pilgrimage on el camino, arriving straight from the atlanta airport. sitting in the tub was with the view of the cornfield and tree line was a much-anticipated delight!
excellent host, excellent lodgings. highly recommended."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Peaceful, beautiful sunsets, exactly what we needed! Recommend to everyone!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and peaceful property. Very clean. Lots of extra bedding and towels.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay off the beaten path. We use this place to stay and travel to different cities to visit. Easily travel to Chattanooga, over to Alabama, or one of the many small towns in north west Georgia. This was our second stay and we can’t wait to go back."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay! Beautiful place. The Barn was just as described. Nearby Rolater park in Rock Spring was a perfect diversion for kids - stream to splash in , swim area, Canadian geese to watch, and small cave to explore. Hope to visit again soon!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,We travel tons for work! This is by far the best place we have ever visited. Everything was perfect. Many thanks to Robin and her family for a wonderful weekend.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Great place. Great location. Host was very helpful and easy to work with. Will definitely return.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect at The Red Barn. It exceeded our expectations. You will not be disappointed.
2022-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,An amazing property to recharge (peaceful & quiet). Would be really good for a multi-generational family gathering. Robin is a great host!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fun place! The dogs loved it
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome hosts, excellent location, quiet, secluded. There's enough close to keep you ""busy"" during the day. But as the hosts says, it's best just to disconnect and relax. Go fill up some water bottles at the springs, eat at the local Linde Marie's, maybe float the river if it's warm enough.
Word of caution, there isn't enough hot water for BOTH tubs on the porch, so enjoy during the summer, but don't plan to enjoy both for a warm tub during the winter. Do, however, plan to take full advantage of this gem of a barn."
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"The Big Red Barn commands attend in a huge field all on its own, upon entry you will know you are in for a unique stay. Sleeps 6 ( I think) upstairs in the loft. The Master bedroom is spacious with a private bath and laundry room which was much needed on our two week trip. The kitchen was well appointed, a little too well as one of my sons on a special diet, but I quickly saw all the condiments and such so it was ok. We used the fire pit (firewood provided) and roasted marshmallows. Had family member visit for a while. We were going to see Cave Spring but it isnt open yet, so we just enjoyed the claw foot tubs, HOT AND COLD water on the deck, and some wine. We cooked all our meals and just relaxed. LOTS of cozy blankets which is hard to come by, I bring my own but nice to have extras. The outside table to et is nice we had lunch and dinner out there. We saw fireflies and heard some coyotes talking back and forth in the field at night when we had our fire, it was kinda scary cause one was pretty close, but kinda fun at the same time. Lots of green grass to play/walk in, and we will definitely come back for a longer visit. Thank you for sharing."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting , friendly host. Unique touches and well equipped!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful view, comfortable beds, and lots of blankets and pillows to keep you cozy. When we arrived the fire pit was all set up and ready to enjoy!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,A very clean cabin. Very nice people helpful if you need anything.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Easy to find, secluded with lots of room to run. It's hard to choose between staying inside the unique lodging or relaxing outside. The bathtubs were our favorite, but heads up, there's only enough hot water to fill one at a time! The occasional visit from Petey the dog was delightful. We stayed here with young boys but it would be great for a couple, family, girls getaway."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So roomy & perfect for a large family! Plenty of dinning space and the porch was our favorite hangout spot. There’s literally no one around, so quiet and peaceful and open field stretches across the home and makes for a beautiful sight to see!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot to relax and suited our purposes. Nice space! Will stay again when in the area.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing getaway. Quit. Except for the sound of a running river across the field (good things).
If you go PLEASE pet the dog. He is the nicest guest that could show up. He met me on arrival and hung out for a while to make sure everything was ok.
Short drive to Rome and surrounding attractions. Can’t wait to go back"

The view is beautiful and the place is very peaceful. Robin and Thom are the kindest and most gracious hosts. They make you feel like you’ve known them forever. They are very responsive but will give you privacy if you wish. We fell in love with their dog, Petey, and wanted to bring him home with us. Petey was so friendly, sweet and played very well with our dog, Brody. We will be staying here again in the future!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place is clean is relax if you are looking for a place to really be in contact with nature and relax this is the place to be robin was nothing but great the whole time we love it , thank you robin!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Red Barn is such a quiet and relaxing space down a long driveway tucked along the edge of a field of farmland. The driveway starts almost right across from the two mailboxes. The space has everything you may need and more. Robin and Petey are such nice hosts. There are so many places to sit and relax. It is a great space for family gatherings or a quiet getaway as a couple. Robin also allowed our senior pets to be with us, which just made each moment there all the more special for us."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is an amazing place to stay, relax and enjoy time with family and friends. You wont regret it. From the fire pit, clear view of the stars and just the quietness makes it a perfect getaway. We had our five year old and enjoyed it immensely as well.
It is not just the place but also the host is amazing. Probably the best host we have had in the many places we have been over the years."
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,This place is beautiful And secluded and spacious enough for a family to stay. Robin was very helpful when I had a question and responded immediately. It was very clean and had everything you would need to stay. Will definitely be back!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here. Very peaceful and quite. We stayed during Thanksgiving and was able to cook our entire meal there. Plenty of towels and blankets which is always a plus. Robin was one of the best host we have ever had. She made us feel right at home and we can’t wait to come back.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Barn looks even better in person than the photos show, especially the view. Saw so many stars, didn't realize how much living in a city causes light pollution and you miss stars until you see somewhere like this with very little light around. Would stay again, really close to town for feeling so secluded."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is awesome! What a neat decor! The barn was immaculately clean! Host was very responsive! Would highly recommend! Post went out of her way to make certain that things were set up properly. Down to the smallest detail including good soft toilet tissue and a variety of coffees. View was outstanding. Will definitely be back

The Red Barn is nice and private. The host is wonderful, as she is available if you need anything, but otherwise gives you privacy. The host's dog, Petey, is the sweetest!! We hope to go back again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a delightful time in such the most relaxing atmosphere!! We are trying to plan a return trip real soon. We truly believe our parents would love the little red barn as much as we did! Everything was just perfect, clean & nicely decorated. We loved the outdoor baths!! We had a couple of peaceful nights to enjoy a hot bubble bath in the crisp cool night air & gaze at the stars above. It was sad to leave and wish we had more time to relax & enjoy your slice of country living. Thank you so much & we look forward to our next adventure to your neck of the woods! The Norris Family"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Second time staying and still one of our favorites!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Barn was everything it claimed to be! Kitchen had all the essentials. Good cell reception as well as excellent wifi. Plenty of extra blankets,pillows etc... Comfortable couches & master bed. Great water pressure. The towns water comes directly from the underground spring nearby. So your tap water is literally the bottled spring water you buy at the store. We will definitely be returning this winter!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful start at the Red Barn. The property is so picturesque, we got lots of great family photos. Robin couldn’t have been any more helpful or responsive. We are already making plans to come back during the next meteor shower so that we can soak in their porch tubs and watch the stars."

Tell Petey, Georgie already misses her running buddy! 🐶❤️"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful peaceful place. Very relaxing, quiet & private. Everything you would need for a great refreshing weekend. Over looking the corn fields, watching the deer in the morning, sunrise over the mountain, Spot on. Tubs on deck were a special relaxings added touch. I'm adding some to my place now. I recommend The Red Barn to anyone needing or wanting to just relax. Very romantic for a couple, Fun for a girls weekend or exciting for a family. I never turned the TV on during my trip. Thank you Robin for such a refreshing stay. Much needed. Terri R."

You will fall in love with this place! ❤️"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,An awesome home base while visiting nearby family. Very special for our three young children and comfortable enough for the adults. A great start to our summer!! We could make this our norm when down this way again!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect. I would recommend this barn 100 times over. A perfect getaway with plenty of romantic aspects. Bathe under the stars or enjoy the endless view of corn.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"We LOVED this place. There was privacy, unique touches, awesome communication, beautiful scenery, updated amenities and plenty of outdoor seating in the shade and on the deck. The night sky was full of stars and we were far enough from town to have a great view of some constellations. We were 5 minutes from Cave Spring and enjoyed visiting the cave at the park as well as some antique shopping. The sleeping loft had very comfortable beds and there were plenty of dishes, cookware, towels and extra blankets and pillows. I highly recommend the Red Barn."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,You will enjoy everything about this comfortable home away from home. Great host Robin and great barn to stay at. We will be coming back very soon. Thank you again for everything. Melissa H
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Red Barn. Very quiet and relaxing. There are two old fashioned bath tubs on the deck, so much fun and relaxing under the stars at night.
Look forward to reserving the next time we come to Georgia."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was great. Everything looked brand new. Thanks
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Robin was a fantastic host that did not miss a single detail. We came in town for an event in Rome that is only about 20 minutes away and decided to extend our stay another night because my two kids had so much fun. Definitely plan on coming back again!

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"peace and quiet! we gathered at the red barn with four of our adult children to celebrate a family milestone. we all loved our stay in this peaceful, quiet setting, with unencumbered views of sky, trees, and fields. it was just as pictured, but the bedroom and common rooms seemed more spacious than we expected. (always a nice surprise!) all was very clean, beds were comfortable (with the adult children bunking in the same room like on our early family trips), towels were plentiful, and the deck tubs were a great bonus. this will be our first choice when we return to the rome area for more visits and exploration."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful stay
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Robin was such a great host. Very responsive and the property was absolutely gorgeous. We will be back without a doubt.

2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved exploring Cave Spring and Rome. We also loved spending time with our little ones at the barn. The bowling, baseball, and water guns were a big hit with our two year old. The owner provided a few snacks, which was a nice surprise! The barn is a great vacation for young families. I’m sure we will be back."
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful location. As relaxing and serene as the pictures show. Downtown Cave Springs is quaint. Antiquers paradise.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"AMAZING find! Plenty of space, great kitchen to cook / save money on vacation. Close enough to other areas to explore but far enough to get the quiet of country life. Great hosts and space!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay! It has a cozy farm feel, with an even better view morning and night. Tucked away yet close to delicious food! 5 Stars!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Red Barn is a fantastic little getaway! Robin, as a host, is very attentive and easily available without ever being invasive. The property sits on the edge of beautiful farmland just far enough away from the roads to feel secluded but not isolated. The cabin itself has all the necessities and is clean and spacious. We loved being able to bring our pups along and how they were able to play with the very sweet farm dog, Petey. Overall, I couldn’t recommend the Red Barn more highly!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So glad we found the Red Barn! We had a great time and really enjoyed the places Robin suggested around the town. Can’t wait to take a trip back there.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We got a great trip!
She was very kind and there was everything."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The red barn is one of the most beautiful and scenic places I have ever stayed! It is beautifully decorated inside and out and it is the perfect place to find peace. Robin is absolutely amazing and so kind. I enjoyed meeting her and playing with her sweet dog, Pete. There were so many thoughtful touches to the red barn, that you do not find at other air bnb, such as a basket full of goodies, and a very nice coffee bar! The hospitality alone makes it worth it. I spent two days in this beautiful place and it was not nearly enough! I am so glad I stumbled upon this place and will definitely be returning."
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,This place was great! Robin had everything we could possibly need to be comfortable. Thank you!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This barn house is such a treat! So warm and inviting! The views and fresh air bring your heart peace. This place has everything you’ll need. Robin was easy to communicate with and you feel at home right away. We loved every minute here and hope to return sometime!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was amazed with the location and how nice the barn was! This is just what I needed to escape for a little! Plenty available to cook with and to keep yourself busy with! My dog absolutely loved the space as well and we both felt at home. For what I was wanting out of this trip the privacy was great, but I knew if I needed anything Robin was just a call away! I honestly can’t say enough good things about this place and the hosts and if you’re wondering if this is worth it.. it is! Don’t hesitate just book your trip here!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Robin’s place was fantastic!! So SERENE yet close to anything we needed. We highly recommend it!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Every year we look for an escape where we can celebrate my husband’s late January birthday. We decided to do something different than our traditional cabin-in-the-mountains getaway. Our search led us to The Red Barn and it surpassed our EVERY expectation! The website pictures are enticing, but they still did not fully capture the property’s actual beauty or the barn’s loveliness with all of the special touches we discovered in every room. Nor do the pictures adequately reflect the spotless cleanliness – so important during this pandemic time. It’s obvious that the owners are focused on keeping their guests not only comfortable, but safe.
Our entire experience was delightful. The property owner Robin has clearly earned her Airbnb “Super-Host” designation. She was wonderfully helpful during the reservation process and the time leading up to our arrival. She checked on us shortly after our arrival and greeted us with a plate of right-out-of-the-oven, gooey-good but healthy brownie-bran bites! They were delicious every morning along with the fabulous coffee we made from the very specially and fully stocked coffee/tea bar!
During our stay we enjoyed… preparing meals in the large kitchen that had everything we could possibly need/want; grilling on the deck; lazing on the super comfortable great room furniture while being warmed by the fire; watching the beyond-description pink morning sun and full moon rises over the trees; puzzling at the table and looking out the windows to see deer grazing in the winter field; our dog waiting for the owner’s precious dog Petey to come to the door every morning so they could play together outside; the quaint Cave Spring downtown and an amazing dinner at Linde Marie’s Steakhouse on the Square; exploring the surrounding areas – our 2 favorites…. the Little River Canyon National Preserve (Fort Payne, AL) with its magnificent falls, and then walking on the Silver Comet Trail.
Of our many, many vacation rentals over the years The Red Barn is our new favorite, and we’d love to experience it in every season! Thank you so much for having us."
2021-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful setting with tons of space and a fantastic kitchen. It was lovely meeting Robin and their adorable dog Pete. Fun place to spend a long winter weekend!
2021-01-01,4,Group trip,Super cute place. She is very nice and the place have everything that you need
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely hosts, beautiful outdoor space! We were in town to visit family and we will be back to stay again."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely place! The kitchen is fully stocked so there's no trouble cooking your meals if you like. Be sure to head into Cave Springs and enjoy all the antique shops, boutiques and home goods stores. It was so cold and rainy the weekend we were there, and we enjoyed grabbing hot drinks and strolling from store to store. I would absolutely come back and enjoy the Red Barn!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the barn was perfect!

2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for the christmas long wkend from Miami and we absolutely loved this barn home. Tom and Robin were such great host. Tom helped us out of mud puddle after getting stuck upon arrival.. Peter 🐶was such a sweet boy, my kids adored him.The barn home was PERFECT! It had everything, plenty of pots, towels and extra blankets/quilts. Robin had such the sweetest little touches such as smore kit baskets, coffee cart, pillow sprays. We cant wait to come back and spend more time in the barn. Oh and we had snow flurries which the kids so psyched about, first time seeing ❄ snow. Again thanks so much for everything. SEE YOU SOON!"

2020-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at the red barn! My kids loved our nightly bonfires and bathing in the metal tub. The barn beds were very comfy and the place was well heated. We appreciated the coffee bar. One perk was the tap water. It is local spring water and so much better than our city water back home.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the most wonderful stay at the Red Barn. It was quite, peaceful yet offered a lot fun things to do for our three kids. We had so much fun making fire, flying kite and just enjoying the view on the deck. Robin was an awesome host as well. We highly recommend this property."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a relax great time.

We cannot wait to go back!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the best Get Away! Peaceful. I needed to get away from the noise and chaos of life and it was perfect! The barn is cozy, clean and just felt wonderful! We had a bon fire and snores and watched wildlife in the mornings. Enjoyed coffee on the deck with families of deer running and literally playing in the fields and surrounding woods! PERFECT!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location. Close enough to great restaurants in Rome. A bit farther but still reasonably close to several Silver Comet Trail access points.

2020-10-01,5,Group trip,You can expect pure beauty when arriving to the Red Barn. A deck with seating where you can gaze for hours into the wide open or the Stars at night. An open floor plan that makes the place truly special. We will be back!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The red barn is in a perfect location! Thanks for the host’s detailed guide, we have no problem finding it. Before our arrival and during our stay, Robin sent out messages to see if we need anything. The barn has everything that you possibly need, including several different flavors of coffee. Our kids had a lot of fun at the barn, especially the bon fire right in front of the barn. We were left with the impression that the barn doesn’t have WiFi when we booked it. But it does! My son did the online lesson with no trouble at all. Overall, we had a great two nights stay at this Barn and we highly recommend this unique stay!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"In the morning, you will love drinking coffee on the porch overlooking the corn field with fog rising from the pasture."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing space secluded away from the public. Host is very responsive and helping. Will rent again
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was everything and more! Tubs were awesome and the local town is so small and easy to explore! They have a great coffee and icecream store in the town,as well as an awesome small town restaurants! There is a park called Rolater park right down the road that has a beautiful pond with ducks, geese, and trout that you can feed!
The locations is very safe and relaxing! Me and my girlfriend are police officers and when we go on vacation we like to relax and get away! Very safe place and would take my family and feel safe enough to keep the front door unlocked! Definitely will be going back! Thanks for the awesome experience!"

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a completely delightful time at the Red Barn! It was perfect for our girls' getaway - plenty of room for sleeping, eating, talking, taking walks, going window shopping (and ice-cream eating) in Cave Spring and Rome. We practically lived on the porch, and just thought the tubs on the porch were a hoot. So many little touches - it is very well appointed. We brought food and had amazing meals with the assistance of the grill - never ate out once (except for that ice cream). It's such a peaceful place, and we enjoyed walking the country road and basking in the lovely fall temperatures in the chairs on the porch. Planning to make this a twice-a-year event, for our mental health, you know."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,AMAZING! Perfect place to to all the out doors activities or nothing at all while staring into the field of corn. It will definitely be whatever you make and more.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Robin’s place exceeded my expectations. Very relaxing. The town was also beautiful. Just ran across this awesome place and said let’s go. Very glad I did. Robin was a great host and so was Petey (lovely dog).
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful spot off the beaten path near a charming town in Georgia. The place was clean, well furnished, and peaceful; and Robin was a wonderfully responsive host. I hope to make it back next year."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed to get away from my apartment and all the noisy neighbors. So, I found this listing under unique stays and it was perfect! I can't get over how quiet and peaceful it was. I also took my two pups who enjoyed exploring the fields and finding a sunspot on the patio to nap while I soaked in the tub. The kitchen has everything you need to make meals and the coffee station is well stocked with coffee, tea, sugar, creamer, etc.. I did drive through the town square area that is like 3 mins up the road and it is very charming. I didn't feel comfortable eating at a restaurant during these times but maybe next time. I highly recommend this place."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very pretty view, close to the town and easy to navigate there. The bathtubs were so great, I didn't even try the shower. The space is cute and comfortable, very light and bright (bring a sleep mask if you like to sleep in!), and a really fun place for kids to hang out while parents relax. It was a great spot, if buggy outside (thanks, Georgia summer!), and we saw deer and rabbits while exploring!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time taking our two young kids on a trip but Robin’s place was safe, cozy, and perfect for them to feel at home. They loved getting to sleep in the bunks, play with the games, and see the wildlife on the property. The views are gorgeous and the nearby towns of Rome & Cave Spring offer charming restaurants and shops. We ventured north to go hiking and enjoyed returning to the barn to see the stars! Robin was a thoughtful and welcoming host."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Red Barn was a perfect getaway for us. We spent about 99% of our time on the patio enjoying the 2 tubs and the wonderful view from the porch. Checkin/checkout was easy and Robin was a wonderful host that went above and beyond to make us and our small dog feel right at home.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean! Super accommodations and nice touches of hospitality (s’mores kit, bag of ice in the freezer, lots of sweet touches). Beautiful location."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was exactly the respite I needed. I really enjoyed the beautiful landscape and all of the wildlife around the property. I will definitely make this an annual getaway. Thanks, Robin!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The views from the porch are breathtaking! Our first night we enjoyed some relaxing time in the “hot tubs” while my children chased fireflies in the massive yard. There was plenty of room for my family of 6 plus our Aussie. My kids appreciated the large selection of games and puzzles and each had their own bed (which was nice). The master bed is nice and big and comfy. I wish the floors were better insulated because I could hear every move, giggle and step my kids took above us, but I knew it was a loft before hand, so I didn’t expect to not be able to hear them. There is only one bathroom, two would have been more convenient for such a large family and there is plenty of space for one off of the master bedroom but again, I knew that before I reserved it. Robin is an exceptional hostess, we were coming up for my husbands birthday/ annual family white water rafting trip. She offer to go pick up his cake for a local bakery (the she also recommended) and even purchased some balloons and had them waiting on the counter for us when we arrived. She is incredibly quick to respond and very accommodating. We loved this little slice of heaven, the sunset was so beautiful over the mountains in the distance. If I ever find myself in GA again on vacation we will be booking the Barn."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Robin’s place was absolutely beautiful. The home was charmingly decorated, super comfortable, sparkling clean and felt so spacious. The patio and tubs were really a fun way to end a busy day! Robin’s dog did come to the patio every morning to visit, so if you’re not a dog person, beware. However, my girls loved the puppy visits. Robin was a wonderful host. She was incredibly helpful and responsive. Her home was more beautiful in person! Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Things I didnt know I needed include outdoor bathtubs and a barn next to a river. We were all in love with this place. I read the other reviews and had to experience it. Im so glad to have taken this getaway. Unplugged for sure with a coffee and the dogs running around. Robin was so nice and easy to work with. She responded quickly and always tried to be a gracious host. We had our space to ourselves so we didn't feel crowded. We were also very comfortable knowing Robin was just a phonecall away.
Expect to make beautiful memories."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The photos do not do the cabin justice! Its beautiful , clean and cozy! Heaven on earth! Loved my experience. We cant wait to go back. Robin was super nice."

We honestly could not have had a better visit to the Rome/Cave Springs area this past weekend and the cabin played an important roll in that."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family truly enjoyed our time at this property. The location was private with beautiful scenery. The kitchen was well stocked and the beds were all very comfortable.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our Thanksgiving stay at Fieldwood! It was cozy, clean, and a relaxing getaway while visiting friends in Rome. The kitchen was perfect for meals in and game nights. The front porch was my favorite spot for coffee and morning devotions while watching the deer. If you want rest and relaxation this is a great spot… the heated floors in the master bath was a nice added touch!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Secluded and private. Deer in the yard and plenty of room for the kids to roam. We enjoyed our stay and will stop through again one day.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the cabin! It's a beautiful cabin sitting on a hill overlooking a meadow and woods. In the morning, I could sit on the porch with my coffee and watch the deer graze in the yard. It was very peaceful and relaxing.
Melissa was a wonderful host. She was flexible and accommodating. I needed to contact her a couple times and she would answer right back. Couldn't ask for a better host!
As far as the actual cabin goes, there was everything listed and more. We had an excellent experience! Thanks Melissa!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Very nice house surrounded by beautiful nature. BBQ grill was available and we had a very good time. We arrived a little early but Melissa was very kind to let us all in. Thank you for the accommodations Melissa!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An awesome retreat. Would love to come again
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The stay was great and just what we needed for our family weekend. The only suggestion is to have some better linens. The sheets and quilts were very thin and we could only find one blanket in the cabin so we went out and bought some more for a comfortable night of sleep. I did accidentally leave something in the nightstand and the host was great with letting me go back to get it.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. My family and I enjoy Cave Springs at least once a year. This home was perfect, with great interior. Outside was conducive to small hikes, camp fire, and grilling."

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Really enjoyed, this was a very nice place to stay. I love the fire pit and the grill on the back porch. The space was nice and clean and the host was very responsive. Thw location is secluded with lots of beautiful nature surrounding. Just be careful to make sure you pull in the correct driveway as the next-door neighbor does not like anyone pulling into his driveway and it can be confusing. Would love to stay here again and plan to in the future."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Super responsive. Family loved it!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying and it's a peaceful environment. Everything was perfect and great hosts.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is gorgeous! It was the perfect place for a weekend getaway that wasn’t too far from home. Melissa was very friendly and made sure we were comfortable throughout our stay. Great experience overall and would definitely stay again. 10/10

We were able to cook meals no problem.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife loved the heated floor and i spent hours just admiring the hand drawn beams and architecture. Best of both worlds with the privacy of a cabin off in the woods but you can be in town in a few minutes for necessities. Highly recommend ""local joes"" on broad st. Great food and people."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great stay at a beautiful location! From the heated master bath floor to open spaces/convenient amenities, we will tell everyone about the cabin in the woods.

Upon entry, the impeccable cleanliness stood out. The kitchen and both bathrooms were pristine and each bedroom likened a high-end hotel.
Melissa and her husband Jeremiah were so helpful and made sure our stay very comfortable.
We’d definitely retreat here again! And next time we’ll be sure to use the fire pit!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Melissa was a fantastic host! We came to enjoy the possum drop for New Years and the cabin was beyond our expectations! It was comfortable, cozy, spacious and had an elevated design ( which makes me feel like I’m on vacation)! She went above and beyond by helping me find my lost license, military ID, and debitcard…AND met me back in Atlanta to give it to me! We loved staying here, the fire pit, and especially how friendly And accommodating Melissa is! Thanks,
Joan Daigle"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved the cabin and the property! We would definitely stay here again if we were looking to stay in and relax. The cabin has well stocked with kitchen utensils and gadgets. Bathrooms were nicely stocked as well. However, there wasn’t much to do in Cave Springs. We had to drive at least an hour in either direction to find things to do for our small children. Overall, we had a lovely time and would highly recommend."

The cabin itself is fabulous! Clean and modern and yet rustic somehow! We were provided the basic amenities. The trees surrounding the cabin, the swing in the front porch perfect for a nice cup of coffee or tea. Rome is about 20 minutes away. Check in and check out were seamless. I highly recommend this place!!
Puja"

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"I cannot say enough positive things about this cabin or the hosts. The cabin was beautiful inside and out. We enjoyed coffee on the porch in the mornings and watching deer eat their breakfast on the lawn. Inside is completely modern and updated with lovely furnishings and everything you could possibly need. The cabin is a short ride (less than 5 min.) to Cave Spring, but you feel completely secluded in the wooded environment. My only regret is that we didnt' get a chance to have a fire in the fire pit (just didn't have time!) Melissa is responsive and check in was easy. We didn't need anything during our stay but Melissa sent messages to ensure we had everything we needed. I wish I could give 10 stars!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words cannot describe how wonderful this place is....its location was absolutely perfect, the serenity of the front porch was my favorite spot and I really didn't want to leave. Inside is stunning, pictures do not do it enough justice.....every little detail covered....every light switch labeled, every remote labeled....Melissa checked after first night and asked if all was good and if we needed anything....
Do not overlook this stellar experience, a MUST for anyone who likes a nice quiet location.
Thank you again Melissa for sharing your beautiful cabin with us! We will be back!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Melissa is a great and welcoming host! She went the extra mile for me and family before the booking was ever booked. & especially after by adding a baby gate, pack n play, & booster chair for my 2 year old if any was needed! she even left us a welcoming gift! the cabin is beautiful secluded & has a brand new house feel. Melissa is a great communicator and even accommodated my last minute extension after my work schedule changed. 10 out of 10 highly recommended host & listing. I would definitely book in the future with her at any of her listings and know that my stay will be great."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We rented this place for 2 days for several of the bridal party and the sec in night for the bride and groom! I would give 10 stars if I could! The place was absolutely perfect and so clean and beautiful! The neighborhood was so quiet and just perfect! The host was AMAZING! She communicated and had everything so perfect for us! We live in the area and the venue was just minutes away so it was perfect! I would highly recommend this house to anyone who is looking to rent an Airbnb in Rockmart! I literally would love to go to just sleep on the comfortable beds for just a a little getaway! The host even provided cokes, waters, and juice which I thought was going above and beyond! Cannot say enough wonderful things about this house and the amazing host! She even allowed us to have a little extra time to checkout since the bride and groom stayed on night two! I was really blown away by how nice the house was! I’ve rented Airbnb’s before but this was by far the best experience I’ve ever had!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay at Lilia's was great. The house was clean had everything we needed. The area was quiet and peaceful, perfect for relaxing.
We felt safe even when we arrived lateer than expected. Lilia reaponds quickly if needed and kept me well informed.
The location is convenient to stores and restaurants yet tucked away on a quiet street.
Lilia'd place definitely has my recommendation."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was clean and spacious and very considerately furnished. We had everything we needed and more. Communication with Lilia was excellent.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Location is in an older neighborhood where most of the homes have been renovated. Very family oriented community that feels safe with children playing in the yards and having fun. Very close to SR 278 which is one of the main artery roadways connecting west Atlanta suburbs and Ex-burbs to the west side of the city. Many places to eat right around the corner and walking for exercise or fresh air is an easy thing here. Owner was responsive and easy to deal with and we enjoyed our stay. Btw, we stayed here because it was close to my work and we were moving so needed a place for about a week in the transition period."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,5 star all around!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great place to stay!
Will definitely repeat!
5 ⭐️"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"They were very easy to deal with, prompt,made you feel at ease. Would definitely rent from in the future!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was literally the cleanest place I've ever stayed! There was attention to details and items included that are normally included (K cups for the coffee maker, makeup wipes, cleaning products available). My dogs loved the fenced-in yard, and the home was quiet but located close to Rome, GA and Douglasville, GA. The host always responded quickly to any questions I had."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lilla & Jose were the perfect host! This was our first time staying in an Airb&b and my husband & I were amazed with the experience. This was the cutest house & her decor was impeccable! Everything was perfect! We just cannot say enough good things about these host. My husband said we would never stay in a hotel again. We came to the area for a wedding and ended up having the best experience in the house & with Lilla & Jose! They are just AWESOME people and have an excellent private home for others to enjoy. Thank you so much for the weekend we were privileged to spend in your home! ❤️
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This little cottage was super peaceful and nestled in the perfect little corner. The pictures do not do it justice. Such a beautiful place and so charming !
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was thoroughly impressed with this Air Bnb and Sam as a host. We were welcomed with fresh eggs and a fresh loaf of bread even! The place was very clean, had beautiful scenery, and well organized. Sam was very responsive and responded quickly. 2 of my guests also enjoyed fishing down at their pond and caught a pretty good sized bass. Bed’s were very comfy and Kitchen was fully stocked with utensils and cooking devices. We used the air fryer a good bit. We will be back for sure and I will recommend to my friends. Thank you for your hospitality Sam!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Very good communication everything was perfect
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Good place, not worth the money though. Needs remodeling around the kitchen. Odd bathroom inside laundry room."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Nice and cozy place
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Thanks for hosting us Deelip. We will visit again next time we are in Cave Spring.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Good place was clean and had everything we needed. There’s no pictures of the outside which makes sense since I believe it is a trailer home in a weird looking neighborhood.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We were visiting family in Rome and needed a larger place to stay. This mobile home provided 4 bedrooms/2 baths with a living and eating area spacious enough to accommodate our group of 7. Rome was an easy 20 minute drive.
The home was very clean and comfortable. The beds were comfortable, but with high mattresses. This made it a little difficult for the older and younger ones to get in and out of bed, but they managed.
We had plenty of clean towels, pillows, and blankets for our group. We had what was needed in the kitchen for a quick breakfast before heading out the door. There was plenty of parking for our two cars with enough room for a few more.
Our host was very responsive. We had clear and simple check-in and check-out instructions with a very generous cancellation policy, if needed. He was very quick to respond, when help was needed for the tv.
The neighborhood had some houses that were a little unkempt but overall was still very quiet and we felt very safe."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The location was just what we needed while visiting family. The host was proactive in checking on us to make sure all was to our satisfaction. Great night sleep. Would rent again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an absolutely wonderful day at this Mason Circle property. It was less than a quarter mile from our family that we were visiting. Everything was extremely clean, close to town, and absolutely wonderful! We will definitely be staying again. Thank you so much."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Deelip’s place was perfect for our family during Thanksgiving break!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deelip’s vacation stay was excellent. There was plenty of room both inside and outside and very clean. It was easy to get to and in a very safe area. We had to add another day with short notice and Deelip handled it within minutes. We were in town visiting family and definitely will request this stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"I messaged Deelip a couple days before arriving to see if there was a crockpot available, he said no but then before we got there he had one available!! There was lots of towels/ rags, toilet paper, paper towels and trash bags! Most places usually don’t provide enough. We had a great time staying here!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great vacation! I would say if you enjoy a laid back location that’s in a more rural area, it’s a great spot.
We enjoyed watching the deer in the back yard over early morning coffee and looking at the stars at night on the back porch.
The house suited our needs! I really appreciated how stocked the house was and the amenities. We were able to do everything we needed to over the week without really needing anything. I really appreciated that!
The host was both proactive and responsive, which was fantastic!
It was only about 15 minutes from your Kroger, Walmart etc. They actually have these little festivals just 5 minutes up the road.
We had a great time, and I think you will, too! :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"loved how communicative Deelip was. Any question he took the time to respond. Very fair and place was clean, and everything as expected. It was a joy and we will be back."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay! Loved how simple and nice it looks inside!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Very nice place at an affordable price
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The property was well maintained and it had plenty of room for our family.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay for my family/dogs. It was a very last minute booking, and they were able to accommodate our needs. Definitely recommend."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Comfortable house
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Deelip was very responsive and the house was very comfortable!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Needed a place for family to stay for a funeral. The home was great but the host was beyond hospitable. The accommodations that were made for us were so appreciated and really took a lot of worry and stress away from our family. Such an amazing host!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here while visiting Indian Mountain ATV Park. The owner was very prompt with all communication. The place was very clean. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and plan to return.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful very clean beautiful view
2022-11-01,4,Group trip,"Our stay was very last minute and late in the day but everything was good. The house was very clean, spacious, and had some extras (coffee, toiletries). Only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the fridge kept popping the breaker and ice kept melting onto floor. The host responded to all our needs and was accommodating."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,comfortable and quiet
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Christina’s guest home was perfect. The entire home was spotless. Everything was just as described or pictured. Worth every penny. We would certainly stay there again. Christina and James were great hosts.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a wonderful stay at Christina's place for Darlington's graduation. it was peaceful & close to the school!! Very clean & had everything we needed! The host was quick to respond! Great place to stay!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christina’s guest house was perfect for our weekend getaway.
It’s a guesthouse, but it’s very private. The guest house has a beautiful wall of windows/glass door that faces the private tennis court. You’ve got your own private driveway as well.
The house was very clean & welcoming! Christine even placed a couple fresh flowers as a nice touch!
Christine was very quick to respond to any questions. Check-in & check-out were both very simple.
We were about 10+ mins away from downtown Rome.
We’d love to come back for another visit & we will be recommending Christine’s place to family/friends! Everything was perfect!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Incredible! Beautiful home surrounded by exquisite grounds. Host communications were spot on. A perfect stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we arrived, it was clear that this Airbnb was something special. Nestled in a serene location, the property boasted modernity and comfort at every turn. The house itself was nothing short of impeccable - it felt like we were the first guests to ever step inside, with every corner of the space sparkling clean and every amenity functioning perfectly.
But what truly set this experience apart was the stunning tennis court. It was an absolute dream for any tennis player!
However, the crown jewel of our stay was the hospitality shown by our hosts, James and Christina. They didn’t just provide us with a place to stay; they made us feel like part of their family. Their warmth and kindness were unparalleled, and they went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay. This place is a rare gem that we cannot recommend highly enough."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very responsive, house is great, area really doesn’t have much around so be prepared for that. Kinda hard to find. But overall stocked with needed things."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The location was beautiful and we loved sitting out listening to the creek run. Beautiful place.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay. Very relaxing and peaceful! Funky fun place that our family thoroughly enjoyed.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lot of trouble and they helped us every way possible and refunded us a night even though they didn’t have to! Great ppl
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of my top favorite places I have ever stayed at! The house is very unique and the location on the creek is absolutely beautiful. The house felt clean and climate controlled. We spent most of our time hanging out on the balconies and our dogs loved exploring the creek. Neighbors are just far enough away that it still feels remote and private. The hot tub felt amazing after I did two rounds of a 4.5 mile canine obstacle race!! We would absolutely stay here again. Pressure hose availability was a bonus, too!! This place is a VIBE."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Already planning our next stay. SO CLEAN. Great location if you want to get away from everything! There are a handful of restaurants in town if you want to dine out but everything you need to stay in!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Highly Recommend! Good people and such a quiet and great place.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect cabin in the woods. Very unique stay with nice touches to the cabin. Quite literally on the water with a very ""outdoorsy"" feel. Lots of nice amenities in and around the cabin."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Matthew and Melanie were both a pleasure to communicate with and were very responsive with any and all questions. The place was about the cleanest AirB&B we’ve ever stayed in and the setting was tranquil and peaceful. It was a perfect place for us as we were biking the Ladiga and Comet trails and their property was right on the trail. They also were kind enough to let us leave our car there for a few days while we bike packed to the end of the comet trail and back. We would highly recommend and would def rent again if we were in the area!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Can’t say enough great things about this unique stay! This home surely offers peace and tranquillity, if you’re looking for a romantic getaway, I’d highly recommend Matthews Treehouse!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I reserved this home for a special getaway for my son's 30th birthday! The location was absolutely breathtaking! The house sits right beside the creek surrounded by beautiful trees. Words can't describe how serene and relaxing it was here. The house was quaint with just enough space for 3 adults, 1 child and 2 dogs. The hosts were very thoughtful with all the special touches throughout the house, including the s'mores. Thank you for a memorable visit! We loved playing in the creek during the day, then soaking in the hot tub under the stars at night!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was perfect!! We were in town for the Chief Ladiga 100 miler and it sat right along the course. Matthew and his wife were great. Communication was great. I just hate I was not able to fully relax and take in the serenity this place had to offer. 100% will rebook -- but during a much less crazy weekend. 😅
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Tree House was the perfect spot for myself and my daughter to unwind. We spent our days hiking local trails and playing in the creek with our pups and our evenings stargazing in the hot tub.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wow. This was an amazing location. Me and my significant other were celebrating our 9th anniversary and this place hit the ball out of the park. We brought our dog and he had soooo much fun. The hosts were extremely accommodating when it came to little things they already had in place. We were so worried about forgetting to bring something and they almost had everything we would’ve needed. Extremely responsive as well. The fire pit is a marvel in itself. There is tons of foliage and dead trees around to build an awesome fire. The hot tub was absolutely perfect for the two of us. I wake up early and I saw herds of deer running around. The pictures really did not do the location justice. It really is breathtaking. I couldn’t think of a negative thing if I wanted to. An absolutely amazing place for a private couples retreat. Would absolutely book this location again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little spring break get away. Our family enjoy a few days adventuring.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was fantastic . great views, & very relaxing."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing 4 nights at the Tree House! Matthew and Melanie were excellent hosts. They were very communicative both before and during our stay, and we appreciated the little extras they provided like smores and firewood!
The house is rustic-chic with tons of character and unique touches. The property is very private and, although you can see a couple of neighboring houses, there is enough distance so that you will feel isolated in the woods. We loved sitting in the hot tub and listening to the creek and the sounds of nature. If you plan to prepare meals on-site (there are very few restaurants in the area) be sure to bring cooking oil/salt and pepper etc. There isn't much in town, but you'll be able to find any necessities you may have forgotten. There are some amazing trails in the area, including one at the bottom of the driveway, and don't miss the gorge at Noccalula Falls in Gadsden where you can go all the way behind the falls! Overall a great trip, thanks!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don't do this place any justice. It was so beautiful and peaceful. Perfect environment to put your cell phone down and just relax. Loved, loved, loved the walking trail. I never do the same place twice, but we will definitely be back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cabin!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot with great views!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I enjoyed our weekend stay! The property was well maintained and very secluded. We enjoyed that there was a paved walking/biking trail just across from the driveway and enjoyed being able to use the hot tub. We plan to come back and stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I was looking for a peaceful getaway and got just that! Everything was amazing. I’m definitely looking forward to another trip to this location. Owners were quick to reply and very helpful with my questions.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cozy creekside treehouse is even better in person! It would make the perfect romantic weekend getaway, but even as a family of five, we were very comfortable and we enjoyed a lot of time together! Between cooking hotdogs and s’mores on the fire pit by the creek, swinging on the large bed swing on the porch, and walking the paved walking trails right off the driveway, we had an extremely relaxing, enjoyable weekend! We can’t wait to come back in the summer!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We are a family of five and wete able to stay comfortably in the treehouse. The location provided privacy and entertainment for the kiddos. Would definitely recommend this location and stay again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Matthew and Melanie were great! Very helpful and made us feel right at home. Great communicators.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spectacular tree house retreat in the woods with a creek running through. Fire pit was fun. TV had multiple channels. Wifi awesome too. Super unique get away.

This is a very Cozy cabin to enjoy with you couple or family too. Definitely I will back again. And extra star dog friendly too..
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jodi and Traci have the perfect little cabin for those that are looking for quiet, cozy, clean, private accommodations. Easy walk down to the river. Many amenities included that make it enjoyable to be by the river. If you pick their cabin, you won’t go wrong. You’ll come home refreshed."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can’t say enough good things about Jody and Traci! They welcomed us as-if we were family which I really appreciated.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the decorations and atmosphere
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed every minute of our stay at Joy Cove. Thoughtful touches and amenities, lots of comfortable spots for lounging, and we and our dogs felt right at home. Would book again in am instant."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful and relaxing stay at Joy Cove. Our host was thoughtful and went above and beyond to ensure or stay was comfortable. Very comfortable and clean environment with all amenities being as described.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jody and her family were so welcoming and helpful before, during our stay, and at check-out. They have created a very cozy and relaxing space filled with charming, hand-crafted and antique furniture and decorations. The property is private, wooded, and has a variety of local wildlife to watch when you are relaxing by the fire. It was a bit early in the year to enjoy the lake access, but the view was great! The town was quaint with several unique attractions and shops, and the locals were all very friendly. My husband and I had a very relaxing stay and we will definitely visit again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely wonderful place ! I would highly recommend Jody and Traci’s place.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"There’s something special about walking into a place and immediately feeling like you’ve “arrived”. Joy Cove provided the perfect amounts of cozy, homey, and peace. Our hosts even include some very kind and thoughtful touches that made our stay even more special. I appreciate their effortless balance of being available and friendly while still allowing us the privacy of a weekend getaway.
We all left with smiles on our face and a lightness in our spirit after a rejuvenating weekend at Joy Cove. I would definitely come again and recommend this place to any of my close friends. What a treasure"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend staying at Joy Cove! The hosts were very gracious and thoughtful. The space is decorated with fun and funky handmade things, from the furniture to the decor. I loved it! It was also cozy and in a peaceful location. We enjoyed the sweet town of Cave Spring. Great place for antiquing. We had wonderful meals at the local Linde Marie’s Steakhouse and Local Joe’s. The whole area is beautiful with a lot of history and nature."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing!! It’s so cute and comfortable. Traci, Jody , Nancy and Ken are all so precious!! We did a craft workshop and it was so fun. This place is definitely a place I am coming back to. The outdoor shower is the best. We loved Joy Cove !!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed for Schnauzerfest 2023 and it was perfect! This gave us a place for our fur kids to unwind and relax after a day of festivities without having to be around other fur kids. The little fenced outdoor area was perfect for a quick potty.
We will stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jody was amazing! super helpful and accommodating
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We felt right at home! Jody, Traci, and Kenny were warm and friendly. My husband and I came into town to do flowers for a wedding and chose to extend our stay at Joy Cove. What a great choice! We not only found a great place to rest our weary bones, we made some great friends! They had part of their beautiful workshop/barn converted into a little cabin decorated with whimsical handmade art.
We will definitely be back again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved it at the little lake side cabin! We plan to come back for sure.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were trying to find a last minute inexpensive weekend stay to remove ourselves from the chaos of Atlanta for a couple of days. Pets allowed and some body of water were a our only “musts.” Obviously, the dog(s) situation limited things a lot so we were grateful to run across Joy Cove.
What an amazing little gem too! Jody, Ken and Traci have created such a unique and peaceful oasis. The place was super clean and stocked with everything we needed and they were such a sweet and gracious family. Everywhere we turned we found a surprise in art or nature. The outdoor shower was an added bonus. We rode bikes, explored the water, visited Rome and Cave Spring and got plenary of R & R. We could not have been happier! Highly recommend and we will be back very soon for another stay!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our welcome and our stay were absolutely wonderful. The space was beautiful, and the many things they had
inside the home and outside to do was great!! We kayaked the river the two days we were there and fully took advantage of the outdoor shower. We definitely would stay again!!!"

The extra little touches they had added like a package of s’more fixings, a handmade keepsake ornament and all natural blended insect repellent added to our stay and were much appreciated.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at Joy Cove! Clean and cozy room with anything we could need. The hosts were very nice. We didn’t get to stay long enough to enjoy everything Joy Cove itself has to offer, but if you get a chance to check out downtown Cedartown, we recommend some axe throwing at Cedar Valley Chops! We also recommend the outdoor shower at Joy Cove! Very cool."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend which was celebrating my recent retirement! We were able to get lots of rest mixed with a visit to Rome for a walk down Broad Street, enjoy some really cool shops and delicious food. Fished off of the bank and read a book under the shade trees. Hosts were friendly and made us feel like family. We will definitely be back!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved our stay at Joy Cove! The accommodations were very clean and exactly as described and pictured. Lovely and unique art surrounds you in a warm and cozy space. This truly felt like home away from home. The private courtyard was wonderful for our 2 dogs to lie in the sun and we loved having fires in the chiminea! So many thoughtful details inside, no shortage of outlets. It rained all day for our only full day here but that didn’t put a damper on our spirits. We played some of the board games and enjoyed unplugging for a bit. Cave Spring is such a cute area and we can’t wait to come back to Joy Cove in the summer! I would highly recommend, our best Airbnb stay yet! Jody was so sweet and helpful. We will definitely be back!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place with a lot of cute little touches. Bathroom amenities were a surprise, qtips were much appreciated, complete little tea set up, kitchenette was so neatly set up, generally really relaxing and unique atmosphere.
Highly encourage new guests to take advantage of their craft shack. My husband and I had a great time creating our windchimes and they even let me come back later in the day to finish it up on my own.
Gracious and thoughtful hosts! I unfortunately had to send my dog Rylee to the rainbow bridge before arriving and they were right on it whenni asked for my pet deposit to be refunded. Jody even asked for a picture of her and made me a great little piece to take home with me! Highly recommend this place!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I stayed the weekend for a girl’s trip. It’s a beautiful property and a very convenient location to Cave Spring, Rome, and Cedartown. We enjoyed the kayaks too! Would definitely return."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great experience all around! Great accommodations and even better hosts! Will definitely book again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is an amazing place to stay! It is super clean and homey and the beds are very comfortable. They also had two trundle beds so all three of our kids had their own bed. The communication prior to check in was outstanding and they even met us at check in to show us around. We stayed here while visiting our daughter who is at Berry College, and it was such a nice and refreshing getaway close to Rome but much better than a hotel. If you’re in the area, you should definitely stay here!"

If you are thinking about ordering a breakfast picnic, we highly recommend! All of the food was delicious! Jody and Traci, are very welcoming and friendly hosts! We could not have asked for a better place to ring in a relaxing and restful birthday!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"You do not want to pass this place up! The owners truly make you feel at home.
They are so so thoughtful in making sure you have everything you need. Forget something?? They got it! The place was spotless on arrival and smelled fabulous. We were greeted with fresh wildflowers on the kitchen table with a personalized note, Birthday gift for my lady and bones for our pups! I think our dogs may have loved it even more than we did. My Chinese Crested enjoyed playing ball in their yard while our Boxer chased geese in the cove. We took advantage of the kayaks and floated. They have the perfect spot to launch off and pull in at. We absolutely can not wait to return!
Thank you Jodi, Ken and Tracy!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are searching for peace & solitude you definitely can find it here. If you are looking for THE xtras of a great Airbnb it is also here. They thought of everything down to the details of a multi cell charger, a tea bar & a snack jar filled with breakfast bars & snacks among coffee & spices. The kitchen was stocked with everything needed if you want to grill or cook inside. The cabinet in the bathroom was stocked with every necessity you could think of. The beds were so comfy & sheets were of great quality. It was decorated with so much detail & it really went well with the theme.
My favorite was the outside shower. I used it while it was pouring rain 🌧 & it was perfect.
The first day we arrived it was a beautiful day no rain but knew it was coming. The host greeted me & showed me around. Had chairs awaiting down by the lake so we could watch the sunset & the outside fire chimney was ready to be lit 🔥 when time came. A brand new grill was provided stocked with all the utensils 🍴 needed. We were offered a workshop experience & can’t wait til next time will definitely make time for that. The surrounding are beautiful with plants & flowers. The cove was a perfect place for privacy. Can’t wait to kayak next time.
There is nothing I can say bad about this listing & I’ve stayed in plenty of Airbnbs. This one is a 10+. Thank you both for providing everything & more. God Bless you & yours."
