2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful cabin was perfect for my wife and I to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. The cabin was clean and equipped with everything we needed. Just a short drive from Madison but yet a beautiful, quiet and serene location. Watching the sunrise in the hot tub with the cows was the best. We will definitely return."

Thanks for sharing your great place!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is what I wish all Airbnb's felt like! It had the right touch of character while still feeling like a boutique unique hotel. Internet worked great, hot tub worked even better, and the bed was comfortable. You feel remote enough to enjoy all the stars but still close enough to Madison to enjoy that, as well. I can not wait to come back!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot and super clean! Interesting surroundings with some farms and creeks and such. Everything was as described I though and everything worked as well. Factor in that there is no cable tv out there unless you bring your own. Bedroom curtains are shear so if bigfoot strolls bye you will get a pretty good look!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved my stay
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Austin and Kristy's cabin for our anniversary, and thoroughly enjoyed our time there! The cabin is charming and cozy, and everything was exactly as described. It is closer to the road than we expected, but the traffic was minimal. Austin came to meet us when we arrived and both he and Kristy responded super fast to any needs or questions we had! It was a relaxing place to come back to after a day of hiking in Clifty Falls State park. We really appreciated all the kitchen amenities, and the corn hole game on the porch livened up a rainy day! We would definitely come back again 😊"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here! The cabin is beautiful, we loved all the natural wood of the walls and the furniture. We had a crazy windstorm while we were there that knocked out the hot water, but Kristy and Austin changed their plans and came to help as quick as they could! They were very helpful and friendly. We were there to do some songwriting and creative stuff, and it was the perfect place for it. It had comfy beds and was very clean, we'll definitely be coming back!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay! Kristy and Austin’s cabin was just what we were looking for on our last minute winter road trip. Everything was comfortable and clean, and the location in the woods was great. We agreed we’d love to come back here in the summer."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cute cabin for a weekend getaway for one or two couples! My husband and I really enjoyed the home away from home for our first 2023 quarterly retreat. Comfy couch, lots of kitchen amenities and lovely property - if only we had stayed here in a slightly warmer month so we could have made good use of the front porch and grill, it would have been perfect (not the property's fault of course). Will be back if we're in the area again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristy and Austin's cabin was exactly what we needed for the weekend. The cabin was roomy and comfortable. Communication with the hosts was a breeze! I actually forgot something there and it was very easy making arrangements to get my forgotten item! Thanks Kristy and Austin!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We appreciated the prompt response to our inquiry about cabin details in advance of our stay. Thank you, Kristy, bringing over extra blankets and for a bit of grace on checkout time when we slept later than planned on our final day."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A lovely weekend getaway in a cozy cabin. I highly recommend staying here if you want peace and quiet in nature while being close to Madison and all its activities. We will stay again if we're ever back in the area!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great stay at this cabin! The cows came right up close to the back porch and were very cute. The location is convenient and very close to town, but still gives you the feeling that you’re out in the country. Cabin was well stocked and very clean. Can’t wait to stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was wonderful! It brings about the sense of peace that you'd want from staying in a cabin and it is just a short, and beautiful, 15 minute drive to many of the attractions the area has to offer.
The cabin has WiFi to support texting, calling, and streaming after a long day of activities. A wrap around porch, an outdoor grill, cornhole boards, and cows can also bring you entertainment throughout your stay.
Austin and Kristy nailed it with this cabin; you won't be disappointed if you book your stay here!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice cabin and only a short drive to Madison or Clifty Falls State Park. Very peaceful and perfect for our party of three.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is a amazing place to stay! And the creek/river so close was a added bonus that really makes this place stand out. This was probably the cleanest airbnb i have stayed at. I just wish i could have stayed longer and enjoyed more of the scenery and peacfulness!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, quiet, new, beautiful wood interior and absolutely spotless. Great open porch with a grill! Well in the country, short trip to Madison with little traffic."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect scenic getaway. Secluded, beautiful, and a ton of cool stuff to see nearby. Definitely would recommend this place to friends!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful cabin was absolutely perfect for our anniversary get away! It had everything we could have possibly wanted for a weekend in. (Seriously, we didn’t leave the cabin our whole stay, it was that wonderful!!!) So, If you are looking for a clean, cozy, and refreshing haven to snuggle away in,THIS is the place! 100/100, we will definitely be coming here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin was great. We enjoyed being out of town but close enough to get to town in about 15 minutes for the Madison Ribberfest. Communication was good. Overall the cabin was very clean. We are “country folk” so we liked the rooster crowing in the morning & cows grazing in the backyard. The porch is GREAT! We will stay here again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I would give more stars if I could! The air b&b looked exactly like the photos and was definitely the cleanest b&b I’ve ever stayed in. Kristy and Austin were very welcoming and communicated very well with us. We came up for a bachelorette weekend and all of us girls were obsessed with how cute the place is. It felt so homey and cozy! Would definitely recommend staying here if you are ever in the area!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,What an immaculate cabin in the perfect location. If you’re looking for a quiet getaway this is definitely the place for you. Everything was exactly as posted and one of the easiest check inns and checkouts that I have experienced with an Airbnb. Definitely will be on my list to check out again and explore more of the local attractions.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully decorated, designed, and spotlessly clean! Everything was exactly as advertised! Competitively priced. It was also not too far from historic Madison, Indiana."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice cabin! Had a great time Madison out the shops and wineries!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay overall. However will cite these conditions that would have improved our stay. The cabin is not accessible for mobility challenged. Wood and stone steps with no rail.
I would have appreciated knowing before booking. A paved walkway to side of cabin would have been great help. A back step would be a great addition to your cabin. The rains made the getting from car to steps difficult to avoid the mud. We found large bugs in cabin each night of our stay. Not flying bugs but crawling type. Gaps between walls and flooring likely contributed to this problem."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute cabin! It wasn't as secluded as I imagined from the description but still off the road and very quiet! Everything was clean when we arrived and having the toiletries was so nice!
We enjoyed sitting out in the porch after a long day of hiking Clifty Falls! Highly recommend staying here!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very responsive host.
Location is beautiful"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the quietness of the cabin. We found all the accommodations very complete and comfortable and would definitely come back here again. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch in the morning and evening, very relaxing."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. Nice and clean. Close to all the cool things happening in town.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely cabin, clean and cozy. Enjoyed sitting on the wrap around porch and listening to the river sounds. Hosts were friendly, quick to respond and very accommodating. Would definitely suggest this place to others. Hopefully someday we will return to the area.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific experience at Stoney Creek Cabin: beautiful setting, sparkling clean and can’t beat the location. We took a few field trips (Clifty Falls, Switzerland County & historic downtown Madison) and didn’t even have the chance to take advantage of the property’s full amenities (corn hole and fire pit with wood included!). Gas grill was top notch too. We made warm memories just kicking back on the wrap around porch. Kind thanks for your hospitality, Kristy & Austin! Hope to visit again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The absolute best Airbnb experience we have had thusfar.
Great place...great location...great host...great value."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kristy and Austin have a beautiful, sparkling clean, cozy cabin. We were 2, but room for 4. Bed/pillow comfortable. Tvs in 3 rooms. Wraparound deck. Beautiful setting. Patio and hot tub in the works. The owners were responsive and hospitable. We will definitely recommend and stay again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful! The cabin was super clean and cozy. It had all the makings for a great weekend getaway. A beautiful porch to sit out and relax on, a grill, and even corn hole!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible stay! The hosts were prompt in responding. The amenities are always a welcome perk to an Airbnb and this place was fully stocked. A little low on K-Cups but they were available- although I hadn’t been expecting them. I stayed there with my two brothers and slept on the couch and it was very comfortable. The water tastes good- for travelers wondering about water quality. Overall, the place was as described and perfect for a relaxing getaway."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A beautiful cabin with lots to do. Super cozy and welcoming. Amazing hosts and memorable vacation. Close to town but secluded. Will absolutely be back!!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Worked out great, comfy and cozy cabin in a great location, one of my favorite airbnb stays."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic! What a wonderful trip. Take advantage of this cabin. Great location, super clean and totally awesome! Thanks to Kristy and Austin!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristy and Austin’s place was a great place for a short family getaway! They were so hospitable and went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed for a few days of fun! We will be back :)
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous home like be thrown into simpler time. Feels like you are away from it all but everything is close. Kristy is very communicative.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The visual aesthetics alone make their place worth booking. Property is gorgeous and the newly built cabin is decorated beautifully. It was only two of us but the cabin can perfectly accommodate 4. We arrived at night so we weren’t aware of the creek until we heard it while sitting on the porch the next morning. It is on the other side of the barn; we encourage you to walk to property. Kristy and Austin checked in intermittently to make sure all was well, which was appreciated. Just a few minutes drive outside of downtown, which was pretty in itself. One of my favorite touches was the guest book, where past guests have noted where they came from and info about their stay in the air bnb. PS- hot tub in the works! Can’t wait to be back."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was just perfect. The location and proximity to town were great. The cabin was clean & cozy. Beds and pillows were super comfortable. Kristy & Austin are quick communicators and very accommodating. This is a hidden gem and I would highly recommend!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful new log house close to Historic Madison. The location provided a nice blend of being close to downtown Madison (and even closer to the hilltop business district) yet out in the country, away from it all. Kristy and Austin were great hosts. One thing to be aware of -- the two-lane road to get to the house is twisty with some sharp turns. So drive carefully!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin was splendid.....my wife thought of just staying permanently it felt so much like home.....Kristy and Austin were excellent to work with.....we enjoyed driving through backroads of Switzerland County and shopping in Madison....plus lots of coffee shops and the beautiful Ohio River
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Let’s start by saying I booked last minute and they was able to accommodate for me and my family. Their communication was everything and their cabin was absolutely beautiful and we was so comfortable and it was a much needed getaway and I highly recommend others staying there even if it’s to just get away from the everyday city life!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristy and Austin have built a beautiful cabin. It's perfect for a weekend getaway. It has all the amenities and then some. It's a nice secluded location and still close to anything you'll need. We definitely plan on being back!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin was beautiful. The porch wrapped all the way around the cabin. It was definitely a good place to stay
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can't say enough good things about the cabin, the owners and the fun things to do in Madison. We chose this location as a place to meet our daughter who lives in Upstate NY. With us coming from the TX panhandle, Madison was a 14 hr drive for us and a 10 hr drive for her. But we'd love to go back for the beauty, the attractions and the comfortable accomodation. Enjoyed antique shopping, touring the Lanier Mansion, Clifty State Park, Versailles State Park, and lots of game playing and homecooked meals in the cabin. Thank you Austin and Kristi! You have a true jewel in this cabin and your homestead!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to get-away. Wish it had more hiking areas but the place is in great condition.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect cabin! Very nice and clean! 10/10
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unbelievablygreat place to stay; quiet and remote yet just a few minutes from town.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Remote, but only a few minutes from town, this place is a hidden gem that I woukd recommend to anyone. You will not be disappointed."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,I just got back from a stay in Cara’s place with 4 of my friends for a girls getaway. The house is so charming. She is obviously an excellent quilter because there were several quilts and pillows all over the place that were beautiful! The pictures do not do it justice. We loved that there were 6 beds so we could each have our own. The dining table was perfect for our catered brunch and we loved hanging out on the porch. The walk to downtown was easy and there are lots of places to eat and shop. Definitely recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home! We enjoyed hanging out on the wonderful porch!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed a wonderful weekend at the Fox Den! Our family has gotten too big for hotels and we prefer the freedom the Airbnb gives us. Walkable to everywhere we went, very peaceful and accommodating. Would definitely use Cara again. Thank you for opening up your home!"
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,"Our stay was wonderful.
We were a group of 7 ladies & were very impressed on Caras home.
The stairs were easily accessible & there was plenty of room to relax.

The home was close to the park where we hiked as well as to restaurants. The beds were very firm but comfortable. The back patio was nice but the table was a bit rickety and any light touch drinks were spilled . We also thought there was a grill outside and brought food to grill based on pics but there wasn’t one back there upon arrival.
The house behind the patio is replacing a walkway ? Patio? And very noisy work going on but not at all the homes ability to do anything about .
Loved the swings on the front porch- would definitely stay again. Thank you for the wonderful hospitality."

2023-03-01,5,Group trip,We loved our stay at Cara's house! There were 6 of us and we each got our own bed - 2 of the twins are in a loft style (not a true private bedroom) but was tucked away and felt private-ish. The house was way bigger than I expected and was so adorable. Can't be the location - you can walk anywhere you want! Would definitely stay here again!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"From beginning to end, our stay at Cara's place was top-notch. The home was just beautiful -- warm and comfortable, spacious, with everything we needed. Two of our eight people couldn't come at the last minute, but there was plenty of room even if they had.
Bring your own speaker if you want to play music. We improvised, set the holder for the remote on its side, and set a phone in it, which did the trick!
Cara knows how to treat guests well and make them feel at home. We'll definitely be back!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Cara was an excellent host. I/we would definitely recommend staying at her home and we are looking forward to staying again in the spring/summer.

The area was quiet and within walking distance of several shops and church we wanted to visit even in the cold. Highly recommend Cara’s home if you’re looking for an Airbnb in Madison.

The decor in the home is what sets it apart. It has modern appliances, high-end fixtures, and beautiful countertops, blended with cozy quilts and rustic pieces.
The space is also much larger than I expected, based on the photos."

2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"If you are visiting the cute small town of Madison, IN, you can not do better than Cara's wonderful guest house. It has been beautifully remodeled and decorated. It is in a wonderful location to walk to see all that the downtown has to offer and it was so comfortable for our group of women who came to Madison to celebrate a friend's 50th bday. The beds are all comfy and the kitchen well stocked. We couldn't have asked for a better place and we hope to return next year. Cara was always quick to answer our questions and gave us so many great recommendations for places to eat and things to do.
FYI though. If you have someone in your group who is elderly and has trouble with steps, this may not be the place for you. There is a steep step to go out to the back patio and narrow steps going upstairs. This was not a problem for us at all but might be if you have older folks who have trouble navigating steps."

We walked two blocks to get to the main downtown strip, so the location was excellent. Also, only a few blocks from the river.
Cara sent me a list of activities that were happening around the city. Lots going on at this time!
Overall, very wonderful stay and we had a great time at her stylish home. You won’t regret it."

We really enjoy staying here and feel safe while we do. The home is fully stocked, plenty of towels and extra blankets, kitchen is well stocked. There are packets of oatmeal for breakfasts. The beds and couches are comfortable. The backyard is a nice, shady and quiet place to sit and relax. During our stay a neighbor’s tree limb broke during the night and fall onto a power line causing a power outage to the home; we called Lisa and Richard in the morning and they worked quickly to ensure that the problem was resolved and the power was returned to the home before the end of the day.

I mean everything! From typical kitchen supplies to condiments in the fridge, Lisa has planned for it all. There’s even shampoo in the shower and laundry supplies if you need them. The AC was cold which was much appreciated since the weather was toasty during our stay and there are ceiling fans in the bedrooms, too.

2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"House is just ok. Clearly a remodel with lots of fine tuning that was skipped. The floors felt like the sub floor had just been covered and not actually fixed.

The front porch has a glider, is shaded, and there was always a cool breeze blowing across the porch.

I’ve stayed at quite a few airbnbs & sometimes when you get to a house, while it “technically” looks like the pictures posted, it’s clear a professional photographer took the pictures because it isn’t truly an accurate representation of the space. What I loved about this airbnb was that our experience of the inside of the house was actually better than the pictures! We loved the original hardwood floors and it was fairly spacious and very clean. We would certainly ask to stay again when visiting Madison!"

Lots to do and see in the area! House is on a Main Street but the bedrooms are in the back so it was very quiet. Would definitely stay here again :)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"When we walked in, it immediately smelled clean. When we took out the sheets for the sofa sleeper, I could smell the fresh laundry detergent, which instantly makes me feel better when staying somewhere. Other places we've stayed have been questionable with how often they clean bedding, especially for the sleeper sofa. The hosts provided welcome snacks and drinks, such a thoughtful and nice touch. I also appreciated the binder with information on the area and the house. So helpful to have easy access to this info rather than having to pull up the listing on my phone for everything. My kids LOVED the Nintendo. We also loved being able to walk to dinner at The Red Pepperoni (SO close!) and across the street in the morning to get donuts. We drank our coffee on the front porch and enjoyed looking out onto Main Street. Would definitely stay here again. Madison is such a cute little town."

The listing itself had comfortable beds and living room furniture, super nice kitchen, seating for meals, bathroom and bedroom both set up to conveniently unpack, awesome shower, quality linens for bed and bath, bonus amenities throughout and even fresh flowers!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt & Lynda were great hosts! The house was very easy to find and accessible to everything, but still felt secluded and private. They were very responsive if we had questions and made it easy to check in, find things at the house, and even had things laid out in the house book to make it easier to settle in and get familiar with the house. Everything was as described. We will definitely keep this in mind for our future writer weekends!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful unique home, an absolute pleasure to stay in! We came to check out Clifty Falls State Park but we had a rainy day during our stay and the home was so lovely it wasn't any hardship at all to snuggle in on the very comfy sofa and watch some holiday-appropriate scary movies! Beds are VERY comfortable and clean, kitchen is very clean and very well appointed (even had snacks on the counter and drinks in the fridge!), neighborhood is peaceful and quiet, the small porch in front being covered allowed us some outdoor chill time even in the rain, and it's super close to downtown Madison and the park! The host binder pointed us toward some delicious food as well! (We had decided on The Off Broadway Taproom, incredible eats!!)
Loved every moment, will be happily returning again in the future! Thanks Linda + Matt!!"

Highlights include truly excellent communication and responsiveness, ease of check in/out, and the beauty of the space, which reflects thoughtful attention to aesthetics and details. Some nice snacks and cold drinks were available upon arrival, very appreciated after hiking for hours. I forgot my toothbrush and toothpaste (rarely happens but every once in a while, darn it) and incredibly, there was a little travel kit in the bathroom, so I didn't need to go back out and find a drug store late in the evening. The kitchen is beautifully appointed with everything you might want, even champagne flutes. I didn't need them but appreciated the detail. The bedrooms are quiet, restful, and lovely... ... I could go on and on but this is already really long. I'd love to go back."

peaceful, quiet neighbohood, a short drive to food, shopping and entertainment"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful getaway for the night away from our platoon of three kids. Quaint,quiet, lovely breeze way. A wonderful combination of modern meets countryside aesthetic. Extremely great communication and even helped with the surprise birthday cake for the husband! Thank you for all your special little things that made it amazing!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in the perfect location between downtown shops and the shops/restaurants up in the hill. Clean house with fresh flowers and beverages/snacks which were a nice touch! Wonderful Airbnb!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I definitely know where this place got its name! This was such a beautiful house to stay at and is definitely a top choice for next time. We stayed here tonight just to sleep for our road trip but managed to stay the next day to visit the town and it’s many small stores. The beds were great and there was a great place to sit outside to have breakfast.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Matt’s space was beautiful and unique in itself (love a good A-frame!) but it was made even better by his thoughtfulness in anticipating any needs his guests may have. With all of the small details, we felt right at home. As a fellow host, I was really impressed and would 10/10 recommend this space. Would love to check out one of Matt’s other spaces if we’re ever back in town!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fresh flowers on the table, snacks on the counter and cold drinks in the refrigerator, we felt welcomed. The binder was most informative about the area and guest expectations. So many nice touches from supplies in the cupboards and little notes here and there explaining the home's idiosyncrasies. Comfortable living room and beds, and nice, private patio to enjoy the outside. Interesting art work and decorations to look at. Our every need was anticipated. We truly felt comfortable and at home at The Artist's A-frame. Matt and Linda are wonderful hosts; we hope to come back to the area to experience their hospitality again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect. We loved this little, unique house!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and nice area. Close to town and quiet.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely enjoyed our stay. The house maintained the beauty of its original architecture but with added modern vibes. The neighborhood is close enough to all of the fun downtown locations, but just far enough away to feel private and homey. The bedrooms were spacious (we had to fit a pack n’ play in our room for our son, but he also would have fit comfortably in the king sized bed with us). The neighborhood is very safe and friendly and I was able to go on a few walks around with our son to get some exercise in after eating so much good food lol. (Btw I highly recommend uncommon pizza). They don’t want you to turn the air down under 70 degrees in the summer, which originally concerned me since we like sleeping in cold temperatures , but the house stayed cool the entire time and was never an issue. We highly recommend this town and Airbnb! :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Being my first experience at an Airbnb, this was perfect. I wasn’t sure at all what to expect. Matt and Linda were very helpful, answered questions, added great personal little touches, and provided an unexpectedly awesome place to stay. I look forward to hopefully staying in one of their places again next time we’re in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolute perfection
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Artist’s A-Frame was exactly what we were looking for: Beautiful, peaceful, and close to Clifty Falls State Park and other scenery on the hill (all while less than 10 minutes from downtown’s Main Street).
Linda and Matt’s home is a lovely retro space that was comfortable in size with thoughtful touches and curated decor, and gentle natural light in every room.
It’s the kind of space where you can stretch your legs and take a deep breath of fresh air, while enjoying a glass of wine on the twinkle-lit patio or watching the fireflies dance on the front lawn."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Immaculate place and such kind hosts. We will be definitely be back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Matt’s place and it was great. Very clean, tastefully decorated, and the snacks and water were a nice touch! Would recommend this place to anyone."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay! Beautiful space with lots of accommodations and thoughtful touches! Great natural lighting and charm!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our time at The Artist A-frame. The space was exactly like the pictures, clean and well stocked with extra goodies (blankets, towels, snacks, even umbrellas and ponchos). There was a sweet note when we walked in and a beautiful bouquet of flowers on the table that just sent everything over the top.
We will definitely be back as well as recommend our friends and family come and stay at this gorgeous home. 😊"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved it! Had a sister’s weekend and enjoyed hanging out in the house and also shopping and having a picnic by the river.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I took my wife to the artists a frame for her birthday weekend. She has thanked me so many times for taking her to Madison and the A-frame. We had several great experiences at restaurants and similar places. I am not much of a hiker. We did do a hike to see the Tunnel trail at Clifty Falls State Park. My wife also did several hikes on her own, and really enjoyed herself. We were really impressed that every place we went into. Everybody was so friendly. People going out of their way to recommend things to you and to talk to you and ask you where you were from. We also enjoyed watching several episodes of only murders in the building on Hulu, which is our favorite series right now, and several old episodes of mystery science theater 3000 on Roku. We felt very nostalgic about that. We would definitely consider staying at the same place again, if we come to Madison."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Matt and Linda were excellent hosts! We were surprised to find fresh flowers on the table, waters, sodas and snacks for us upon arrival and a spotless home!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the best Airbnb homes we’ve ever visited. Beautiful and comfy. So many nice touches! Can’t thank you enough, Matt and Linda! We will be back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When an unexpected problem arose (no fault of Matt and Linda’s) late on a Friday night of a holiday weekend, they jumped in to find someone to handle it immediately. We appreciated their response so much as Madison was booked elsewhere due to graduations and Memorial Day weekend. Linda even came to clean up after the repair was complete. Couldn’t ask for better service.
The house was conveniently located on a quiet street in a nice neighborhood close to both downtown and the hill top. We had everything we needed and more — thanks to snacks provided by Linda and fresh flowers on the table."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wanted to stay here for the interesting architecture and it didn't disappoint. Very quiet neighborhood and home. There were snacks, drinks and you have access to a washer/dryer. I like to stay places with Netflix since I don't have at home and I was able to enjoy a great movie. I liked that it was away from the historic district (about 5 minutes).
This is not handicapped accessible and I'll go further to say not movement issues accessible. There are about 7 steps to go down once you enter and a tub/shower only (1 grab bar outside the tub though). It was ok for me but not for a lot of people I see walking the streets."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The Artists A frame is a routine stop throughout the year! Always the quintessential Airbnb destination!!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt and his mother Linda are beyond super hosts. Everything was exceptional-communication before, during, and after our visit. The house is a very nicely appointed and the amenities (snacks, beverages in the refrigerator, laundry detergent, first aid kit, and more) were outstanding. The house is very cozy and the beds were very comfortable. I highly recommend staying at this property. The cost of our three-night stay was cheaper than a hotel stay in Madison."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Matt and Linda were perfect hosts with the perfect home. From the prompt replies to them being overly understanding to help get us a home base before the wedding we were attending, that was just the start of a great visit. Upon arriving, we felt like were family.
The home has great vibes. Snacks, sodas and waters in the fridge, local coffee roaster coffee, memory foam mattresses, fans in the rooms, and so much more. We hit the jackpot with getting to stay here.
Before we checked out, I had a chance to flip through the binder they had curated. My heart was warmed to read the Linda’s (co-host) parents built the home. It really made it feel warm and not just a company buying up homes around a town just for business.
When we come back down for a weekend, we most definitely will be booking here again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My fiancé and I had a wonderful stay! We were so impressed with the adorable home itself, as well as all of the thoughtful touches that the hosts put together for us.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this house was absolutely everything the photos showed— but better! the hosts were so polite and left snacks and drinks for our arrival. they knew we were celebrating our wedding this weekend and when we arrived there was a very sweet card and some beautiful flowers to celebrate our new chapter of life.
the home was incredibly clean and loaded with thoughtful things— plenty of dishes, extra toiletries if anyone had forgotten a toothbrush, and comfortable surroundings in and outside.
this was truly one of the most beautiful air bnb’s we have ever stayed in and we will certainly be back. our weekend away from home (and getting married! 😬) was made even more wonderful by staying in this Lovely, warm home. if you are interested in staying here, please do! the serene surroundings, quiet neighborhood, inviting space, and pleasant (and kind! and thoughtful!) hosts really make the stay fully worth it. i assure you, you will not regret a stay in this beautiful place!!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough about how wonderful our stay here was. The house is beautiful. Much of the house has been updated but they have managed to keep the mid-century feel. It was fantastic after two days hiking at Clifty Falls state park to come back to this wonderful, clean, cool home to relax and recover. Linda & Matt were attentive, friendly, and helpful. On top of the beautifully kept house, there were lots of little amenities provided which make you feel welcome and at home, including snacks, sodas, coffee, and tea. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Clifty Falls."

Location was just perfect. Walking out of the front door we saw the whole historic district from start to finish.
Check in and check out were a breeze and when we left behind a couple of coats in the closet — we hadn’t even noticed yet when Trevor reached out to let us know. He assured us that they would send them back to us, no problem. When I asked how I should reimburse him for shipping, he declined the offer.
