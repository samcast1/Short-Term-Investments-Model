Super lovely!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was visiting a friend in the area and stayed one night, very quiet, clean and nice, and I got to meet Brett which was fun. This is perfect if you‚Äôre fishing nearby or visiting friends or family nearby or just want a weekend getaway to relax and go for walks."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I don't have enough good things to say about our stay! We greatly enjoyed the space of the rustic, yet modern guest house. Having access to the porch from the adjacent house was a very nice amenity and allowed us to see 2 deer and other local wildlife.
Every possible detail was clearly planned and thought out, down to having ice pre-made in the trays before our arrival. The property was isolated, but within a 10 minute drive of Huntingdon for restaurants and entertainment.
I 100%, without hesitation recommend this airbnb to anyone in the area. Incredible value for your money!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed in the middle of July. The weather was great the fireflies and deer were everywhere.

We were also pleasantly surprised by the thoughtful touches such as snacks, Keurig cups, cozy blankets and a personalized welcome note.
This Airbnb was a hidden gem that provided us with an unforgettable experience! We cannot recommend it highly enough! If our daughter decides to go to Juniata, we will definitely be returning in the future!"

The property is perfect for an outdoor adventurist! We saw deer every day; the river is In walking distance and there is a great trail mowed on the property to walk on and see all kinds of wildlife and flora!! The Allegheny Mountains are within minutes.

It was a beautiful and peaceful spot and a super easy drive to the Allegripis Trail System. Julie's place is immaculate, nicely renovated, incredibly quiet at night, very well stocked with everything you could need, and perched in a beautiful spot in the woods at the top of a hill. Loved my time here and will definitely try to come back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This newly renovated home was such a treat. The house was well equipped and the host went above and beyond to provide extra food and snacks for us.

From start to finish, the owners were so attentive to detail and made sure the space was meticulously clean and so welcoming. From the welcome note to the thoughtful goodies and the warm blankets throughout the home, this space definitely has an authentic B&B feel. We also really loved the short walking trail we found in the back yard, the fire pit, the twinkle lights, and peaceful woods on the property.
Julie is so friendly and we were delighted to meet her briefly during our stay. She offered us some tips on sites to see at Juniata College. I also appreciated that she proactively reached out to us a few nights before our stay to provide us with details to know about arriving. Thanks for making us feel so welcome, Julie!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is easily one of the best Airbnbs I‚Äôve stayed in. The home is very clean and easy to navigate. The master bed is SO comfy. The yard and surroundings are beautiful.
Judy and Kevin were extremely communicative and made check in and out so easy.
I can‚Äôt imagine a better experience anywhere else."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything at the cabin was great. Very clean and everything we needed. The only negatives were a broken front door lock and only 4 towels in the whole house. The description of 2.5 acres may be misleading bc there are visible neighbors on each side and behind the property. Overall a great place and a great stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, quaint, quiet and private. Very enjoyable stay, attentive hosts. A really pleasant experience!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for the weekend. Loved how private the place is with a beautiful woodsy drive up.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here with 2 adults & 4 kids. Layout was perfect! We loved having 2 bathrooms & appreciated how well stocked the towels & linens were along with the quality of said items! 6 people can use a lot of towels, even when you're being thrifty with your usage.
Kitchen is well stocked, more than most Airbnb's we've stayed at. Pots & pans could use an update but we still had everything we needed to cook for our group - I also understand the challenge of keeping a place stocked with cookware when hundreds of guests per year are using the items.
My most appreciated aspect was the water! We usually bring our own water everywhere we go but after reading other reviews, we took a gamble & didn't lug our crates of water on this trip. I was extremely satisfied! The water is good clean drinking water!
Everything was adequately clean! Thank you for having proper cleaning supplies.
The property is gorgeous with plenty of space for outdoor activities! Love the horseshoe pit!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,This was our first time staying at an air bnb so we weren‚Äôt sure what to expect but we were so happy to find that absolutely everything we could need was provided by Kevin and Judy. There were plenty of extra pillows and blankets and all other comforts of home as well. Definitely a positive experience.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Peaceful and quiet. My first time staying here, I was looking for a place to stay while visiting Raystown Lake. Now, I go to the lake because I'm staying at this place. There is no internet, and it's still a favorite for my 10 year old daughter."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed the seclusion of Judy and Kevin‚Äôs place. Very neat place. Wish we had more time to enjoy the fire pit. Very lovely setting and we liked the quiet rural areas around it. Thanks for the clear instructions for arrival and local recommendations.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great time and want to come back again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Judy and Kevin‚Äôs place. The home was bigger than we anticipated, it had plenty of space for everyone to have some quiet, solo time but cozy enough to feel connected throughout the stay. The hosts were very friendly, accommodating and helpful. The outdoor space was awesome for my two kids - a large grassy area to run and play, plenty of outdoor eating space and a fire pit close by. The kitchen was better stocked than most Airbnb‚Äôs. There were real pots and pans and great silverware. There is a cute library of dvd‚Äôs (with plenty of kids movies). The AC units, coupled with the fans, kept the place nice and cool and provided great white noise at night. The home was clean and well stocked with some household cleaning supplies if needed during your stay (very helpful when you have young kids). Some
Airbnb‚Äôs lock these items up, so was very grateful for the access to things like windex and brooms. This was probably my favorite Airbnb stay. The home was perfect. 10/10"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The cabin was really nice and larger than I expected. It was a great value and I‚Äôm looking forward to staying here again!

They also had terrific sightseeing and restaurant suggestions. as well as providing maps for driving tours and local destinations.
Hope to be back soon!"

There was enough room for us to spread out and it was a great way to unplug and enjoy the gorgeous fall colors and amazing scenery. Judy was very accommodating and the communication was great! We definitely stay again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"I would definitely recommend this place. We, (5 adults) stayed here for a weekend getaway to attend a nearby wedding. It was clean, warm & cozy, and offered all the amenities mentioned in the listing. So nice to not have to drag that stuff along. The outdoor fire pit was a fun place to hang out and we appreciated the firewood. Thanks to Judy for her great communication and for meeting us there to explain everything. (we did get some internet service, too. T-Mobile & AT&T). It was definitely a fun and relaxing time!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a great quiet spot for a short mini-cation.
The cabin was clean.
It was coolish outside but the cabin was warm.
The fire pit area was great for a campfire and sitting around and visiting with our friends.
The closet had ample games - but the campfire won :-)
We will definitely keep this place in our radar if we ever come this way again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Really lovely cabin in a secluded area. You‚Äôre unlikely to see other people. There were many great areas to relax in and around the cabin. We really enjoyed the nearby Trough Creek State Park and just relaxing in the peace and quiet. My daughter really wants to come back again!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay perfect for our small family
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent communication and customer service
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin is a great stay for Raystown lake visitors. It‚Äôs very private and offers enough space for 4 adults and 2 kids plus additional beds. It was perfect for our short visit!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great house and very quiet location. 5 guys plus myself had plenty of space and made for a great value given the price! Very clean, owners respect your privacy. Well done would recommend"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's a beautiful place in the peaceful woods and within striking distance of a lot of adventure opportunities, many of which are included in a binder, with directions on how to get there."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, quiet, and a quick ride to Raystown park / lake on the other side.
A nice weekend to unplug and enjoy the outdoors. Thank you for the hospitality!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great space with lots of hiking trails all around! The hosts were incredibly helpful in letting us know possible things to explore around the lake.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice retreat! Great accommodations for a family.
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great location, very clean and Judy was very good about communicating with us and flexible with our dates and check out time. Highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved this cabin! By far the cleanest Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in. We had an 18 month and 7 month old with us for vacation and it was a great space for them as well. Close to lots of things to do get private and quaint!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean, in the woods and very close to the lake! It‚Äôs great for someone that wants to get away. The only thing is there isn‚Äôt great wifi or cell connection, besides that it was a great get away"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice location and beautiful home. Exactly as pictured with peace, quiet and privacy."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Their place was clean, exactly as described and a great location. Perfect firepit placements."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The cabin worked out great for my family. There was plenty of room for us. The cabin was very clean. If we had better weather we would have been able to take advantage of the decks and fire pits which looked really nice. Unfortunately the rain didn‚Äôt allow us to be outside.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this for a weekend getaway to mountain bike in the area. Everything was fantastic, and we were very pleased with what was offered! We would recommend this cabin to anyone visiting the Raystown Lake area!"
2021-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love how easy it was to check in and out of this cabin. That made the travel and packing SO much easier!
The cabin is very cute and just as pictured. The outdoor spaces were absolutely beautiful with the changing leaves.
Pros:
- The cabin has even more space than listed - we had lots of room.
- There aren't many movies but there is a good variety. Same is true for the games, and we enjoyed both.
- Judy was helpful and provided firewood for the firepits. A snafu kept us from using it, but we were really looking forward to it, and wood availability was a big plus.
- The spaces are really comfortable.
Cons:
- The listing appeared to be a bit inaccurate - after talking with Judy upon arrival, it turns out that ACCESS to Raystown Lake is much further away than described. Her shared maps did get us to Trough Creek State Park, but we never made it to Raystown. :-(
- The listing claims pets are forbidden but there are pet dishes in the kitchen. I realize that the owners may simply not want other pets in their space, but that's misleading if you have allergies. Fortunately, my son didn't have severe issues while there, but others could.
- There are a wide variety of dishes and appliances in the kitchen but there's not a dishwasher - and there are mice. We ran out of paper towels because they ate the extra roll and left lots of evidence in the drawers. We ended up avoiding the entire room. I realize that in this rustic, rural setting they may be difficult to keep out, but ... still."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice cabin, cozy and comfortable-- will stay again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is a perfect retreat. Judy gave great advice as we biked the canal, kayaked the no wake area, and hiked the trail near the ice cellar. They stocked everything we needed and even made a special trip to bring us firewood. The steaks on the fire were the best we have ever made. Comfortable beds and large common areas to enjoy."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent girls weekend at this cozy little cabin! It was the perfect destination to get away and relax. They provided movies and games to play, which was great! They were great at communicating directions for check-in and check-out. We loved the book of local attractions and restaurants they provided. Overall great experience!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family loved staying at the cabin, and we had a great time! We love that they offered a Guest Book and an entire binder dedicated to the things that we could spend our time doing together as a family. There is no cell service in this area which was both nice and a bit daunting, but they had plenty for us to do including games and movies on the only rainy day we had at the cabin. There were 3 firepits, and they provided plenty of wood for us to use along with 3 different decks and a grill. We had a great time and appreciated that while the neighbors were not right next door, they were close enough in case we needed them. Very family friendly location, and the wildlife is wonderful & active (deer & chipmunks mainly!)"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, peaceful, and well-appointed. Wonderful for our weekend away!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely and clean cabin. Much bigger than I expected. Easy to find and accommodating. Would stay again if we are back on the area.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a get away with great communication!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect for our family! We wanted privacy, room for our toddler to run around and a nice, clean place. This checked all the boxes! Judy was a great host! Highly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Place to stay. The cabin has a great feel at home vibe, area is beautiful, and super peaceful. The area has beautiful senic routes and senic views. I had a great time during my stay and hope to make my way back over there again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an unbelievable time for our family at the cabin. Lovely gated getaway. The cabin was one of the best we every had stayed in. Everything is around 20 minutes or so around the lake each way, some longer distances since we drove out to the main routes instead of the back roads. The shortcut to Trough Creek and other places are off of John Bum Rd. (all gravel and crested). I would recommend something with 4wd or a Subaru or something, but our car was able to make the trip into the community. There are some steeper areas but worth the drive in. There was everything you need. The hosts stocked the cabin with anything you need in the kitchen, anything you need for bedding, and all toiletries and cleaning supplies. Quiet and respectful, just like we were looking for. There are 3 fire pits for any angle of the cabin. The kids loved it, and were delighted with having movies on the flat screen tv there. The grill is all ready for use on the back deck as well. We fell in love with the hummingbirds in the back. They inspected each day when we had our coffee off the back deck. I can't wait until next year. We will stay longer next time. Air conditioning in every room, very nice considering we were in the 90's this week. Again, loved the stay and the hosts were very accommodating. I recommend it highly."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING!!!!
Judy greeted us at arrival. She took the time and answered any questions we had. She showed us around the whole cabin and made sure we knew where everything was. And yes I say everything, because Judy and Kevin surely keeps the cabin well stocked with everything you would need. The only thing you need to bring is some food and clothes. They respect your privacy, but was still close by incase we needed them for anything. They genuinely care about their property and the happiness of the guests that are there.
Judy and Kevin's cabin is clean and cozy! A perfect getaway, for quality time with family and or friends!
The only part we didn't like was when it was time to go. It was sad to leave!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I loved your cozy clean cabin. Unfortunately it rained a lot when we visited and we weren‚Äôt able to take advantage of all the area had to offer but Judy was great. She responded quickly to any questions we had and was even willing to go above and beyond by offering to bring us anything we might have needed. We would definitely stay again.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cutest cabin EVER! This was perfect place for our little getaway and to celebrate my daughter's 20th birthday! Very clean, very cozy, and all we needed to bring was food and our clothes! We plan on making this an annual event and will definitely be back again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely stay! Very clean cabin. Judy was an excellent communicator. Thank you, Judy and Kevin!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the cleanest house I‚Äôve ever seen on Airbnb. Seriously. Everything was great, we enjoyed our stay. Be ready that there‚Äôs no service in the house or anywhere around, we had to drive 20 min to get any connection with the world:)"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was great! About 20-30 minutes from most things to do but all easy drives. Real quiet, tucked back in the woods. Nice getaway."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and comfortable.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved the peace and solitude of this cabin in the woods. It‚Äôs proximity to sights we planned to see was perfect. Trough Creek State Park for hiking, access points to Raystown Lake, swimming areas and overlooks.
A comfortable spot with many thoughtful touches to make it a lovely stay. Plan to bring your groceries and cook in since there is not much around as far as groceries/restaurants; the kitchen is well stocked with cookware and utensils.
The host met us to gain access to the property and orient us to the cabin. She was so friendly and kind. I will definitely be staying here again when I return to the area."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely and spacious A-frame cabin in a tranquil setting. Very comfy, clean accommodations in a serene wooded setting. Everything you need to unplug and relax."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely cabin in a great location with easy access to the lake and nearby state park for hiking. Hosts were very communicative and made everything quite easy and available if needed. House is cute and cozy and provided an excellent space for our family of 4.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is definitely not your typical ‚Äúcabin‚Äù where you need to bring everything. They go above and beyond by having so many essentials that you need from home readily available for us. It was great having the separate space upstairs for other family members. We will definitely be back!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great communication, easy check in. Such a sweet and cozy little cabin. We enjoyed sitting outside each night enjoying the outdoor decks. Loved hearing nothing but nature. We were a little surprised how far ""off the beaten path"" this was but it ended up being super enjoyable to be so secluded! Raystown Resort was close enough and we enjoyed the restaurant there both nights as well as water park."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful cabin for our short getaway trip! It was very clean, very cute and very private-- just what we were looking for! We enjoyed hikes at Trough Creek State Park, exploring the beautiful nearby Raystown Resort, and just sitting on the deck listening to the birds. Such a lovely place! We feel refreshed and relaxed. Thank you for the great hospitality!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Judy and Kevin were very flexible with our check-in. It was very comfy and cozy for my family of 4. we took advantage of their board games while it rained, and the cabin was in the prefect place for some much needed time away from the city."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was my second time here and won't be the last. It's an amazing place with awesome hosts. Definitely a gem.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved everything about this cabin. It‚Äôs just so beautiful and quiet tucked away in the forest. There were more than enough accommodations for our family and plenty of space for everyone to spread out too. Trough Creek State Park has a lot to see and Tatman run recreation area is a great spot to spend the relaxing day on the beach. So much more for us to see at this incredible place, can‚Äôt wait to come back next year."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking to totally disconnect (and when I say totally I mean no cell service, WiFi, cable) this is the place to go to!
My family and I were looking to spend a weekend in the cabin to catch up, grill, run around with my 2yo nephew, sleep in, drink and play games - and we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better home to do that.
Judy was super communicative. The house is so cozy and clean. Absolutely LOVED our weekend away!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to get away with the family for rest and relaxation. Clean and quiet.Very close to Trough Creek SP, which has a lot of nice hikes and other activities for young children like ours."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is a lovely place for a secluded and unplugged getaway. Kevin greeted us with a bottle of wine as it was our 25th anniversary. If you want a place where you can't be easily reached and want to get away from technology but still have the comforts of a home, this is the place to go. I recommend bringing in food and cooking at the house to make it even a more secluded time as it takes 20 - 30 minutes to get into town."
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice getaway at a great value.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great charming home. Plenty space inside and out. Very clean and well equipt. Beds were confortable. Perfectly situated in the park. Close but still secluded. Judy was only a phone call away for querstions or recomendations. If or when we are back in the area this is where we will stay!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off this is the CLEANEST place we have ever stayed in!!!! It immediately felt like our home. Even though we brought our own dinnerware, pans paper towels and more they were fully stocked pictures don't do it justice how cool and cost this place is. We are still amazed at how clean it was!!!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is amazing for anyone wanting to get away from it all. It was a perfect stay-cation for me and a couple of friends. You could easily fit 8+ people in it if you needed it. There is no major cell connection, so prepare for that. We downloaded a lot of movies and brought up card games. There is just enough connection to send short texts for important things. The fire pits were great for a cozy evening outdoors with plenty of wood/twigs/leaves to burn! Hosts were very nice, and check-in/out was a breeze! I will be coming back!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage exceeded our expectations, much cuter in person than the photos show. We loved the multiple outdoor porches and decks. Very well kept and clean!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean and cute cottage. Supplies were very well stocked and we had everything we needed for cooking, sleeping and showering. Our kids had a great time and having three fire pits to choose from was awesome! We can't wait to come back. So private and peaceful we didn't want to leave."
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is our second time staying at this A-frame cottage in a beautiful woodland setting. It is well appointed and cute inside and out, as well as extremely clean so we felt safe. It‚Äôs the perfect retreat and Judy and Kevin are very communicative and helpful. Several members of our family stayed there for a wedding and we couldn‚Äôt recommend it any more highly!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Overall its a great place and you will love it! Very peaceful! There are cabins near but the folks at the neighboring cabins are very respectful and quite. The cabin is adorable oh and my 3yr old loved the rock on the porch! If you stay here look for it. Lol If you have kids they will love the place. My son called it the Triangle house! He was very very sad to leave!!!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well equipped kitchen.
Very clean.
Fun games in closet
A lot of moves to chose from.
Good directions to attractions in the area."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy and Kevin's place is soooooo great!!!! Clean, spacious cabin, lots to do all around. Pennsylvania is beautiful and you get to see it in all the state parks close by. Lots of my favorite movies in the dvd collection. If you want a pleasant stay, please come here! Then go get a chicken fiesta wrap at standing stone coffee it was the best wrap I may have ever had."
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This cabin is absolutely amazing! Clean, spacious and it just feels like a home away from home. If you want peace, quiet and tranquility near a beautiful lake, this is the place to stay."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing time in the cabin! It was exactly the relaxing getaway we needed. We would love stay here again in the future! Highly recommended!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great A frame in the woods. Quiet and chill for a couple or a family. Would definitely recommend for peace and quiet. There is just enough service on the deck to exchange texts, but bad service is a selling feature for a cabin in the woods to me."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place is definitely a home away from home
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to go for a relaxing getaway! Very clean and kid friendly :)
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are considering booking this place, DO IT!! It was by far the cutest cabin we have ever stayed at! My husband and I went with one other couple and it was the perfect amount of space and just what we were looking for a cozy getaway in the woods! We loved every minute and with fire pits, outside seating, a tv with DVD player there were so many options for laid back fun in the cabin. Plus it was only a 30 min drive to raystown lake!!!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great secluded location for a weekend away!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cabin was clean and well stocked. Great quiet location. Would definitely return.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a change of scenery and wanted to be in a quiet and remote location.
Judy and Kevin‚Äôs place was just perfect. It‚Äôs spacious, immaculately clean and lovely. It had all the amenities we needed. Wonderful views.
The communication was great and they could not have been more helpful. Highly recommended. Could not have been happier."
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location in the woods in a secure setting. Judy & Kevin's cabin is very comfortable and we found it to be extremely clean and with everything you'll need. Check in was easy and contact-less. Communication was quick and efficient. Plenty of places to gather as a family or find your own little niche to read or be by yourself. We would not hesitate for a second to highly recommend this cabin.
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The cabin was beautiful and my friends and I had such a great time getting away!
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place and communications. Would love to see it this winter!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place. Plenty of outdoor entertaining space. Beautiful and peaceful. Perfect place to stay when visiting Raystown Lake. Definitely in the top of my list.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean and comfortable, much better than I ever anticipated it would be. Everything you could possibly need was provided. All you need to do is bring food, unpack, and relax. This home is an incredibly cute cottage tucked back into the secluded woods setting with an extra sense of security in the gated community. Minimal phone service and WiFi gave us the chance to unplug and spend time together as a family. Spacious enough to comfortably accommodate 6 people, we all slept well in the surprisingly comfortable beds in the home. There are decks off of everything entrance to sit and enjoy your morning of coffee, or just enjoy the great outdoors. We rented a pontoon boat and went tubing at the nearby Raystown lake. I would recommend booking in advance as they do fill up quickly. We walked the thousand steps that is just a short drive from the cottage. We had an amazing time, and would definitely stay here again. I highly recommend!!!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,My friends from school and I had such a great time just relaxing and hanging out! The house was clean and had everything we could‚Äôve needed and more.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place super clean and nice.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If your looking for a quiet retreat getaway this is the place to come, we had planned on visiting some places but when we arrived we got lost in the serene atmosphere and never left the property. A definate hidden gem that gets 5 stars on every level."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy and Kevin‚Äôs place was exactly what we were looking for. The home provided privacy while also allowing easy access to some amazing hiking and kayaking. The space was clean and well taken care of, and we enjoyed the fire pit and deck immensely. Prior to our stay, the hosts were communicative and helpful, and we are very grateful. Thank you!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! Judy was very kind and stopped by to see if we needed anything. We were not able to get cell reception, but we didn‚Äôt need it. It was a nice relaxing getaway. The house is adorable and the kitchen has everything you need. Definitely recommend if you want to disconnect and relax."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy little cabin is great for a family getaway! 2 families of four could potentially stay in the house, but as a family of four, we were very comfortable! 3 decks, 3 fireplaces and outdoor grilling, as well as a small yard, allowed us to enjoy a lot of time outside of the cabin. The cabin was very clean and well stocked! You don't need to bring much with you when you stay here! I look forward to staying here again and seeing what it looks like during different seasons!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, beautiful place to stay. Judy was very friendly and quick to respond back to messages."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is in just the right place if you want easy access to everything Raystown Lake has to offer while enjoying some peace and quiet off the grid. This was exactly what we needed to unplug for a bit and enjoy the outdoors!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean cabin! Loved that they had brochures and a guide to local areas made things very convenient for us. Nice and quiet! The cabin has just about everything that you need that made things handy! Loved every bit of it!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was the perfect escape from city life. Charming property with plenty of space inside and out. We took full advantage of the nice weather and had some great BBQs on the porch and nights around the fire pit. Close to some great hiking and water activities on Raystown Lake.
Communication and check-in was effortless, and Judy was a pleasure to interact with.
We plan to come visit again in the future."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at Judy and Kevin‚Äôs and it was exactly as perfect as it was the first time. So glad to have an awesome place to stay before our yearly Memorial Day vacation at Raystown Lake. They provide everything you could possibly need and more, and it doesn‚Äôt get much better than horseshoes during the day and a campfire at night. The cabin is so cute and comfy and this year we were welcomed by Kevin and a lit gas fire inside due to chilly May weather. Very much appreciate your hospitality- hope to see you again next year!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin in a wonderful location. Hosts were very friendly. Cabin was very clean. Perfect location for our weekend get away!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent check-in and out. Very clean! Fast responses.

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy and Kevin‚Äôs cabin was exactly what we needed for the last few days of my in-laws visit. Fall colors, nearby hikes, campfire and extra space. The cabin was very clean and had everything we needed."
2019-10-01,5.0,Group trip,The cabin was super clean! Everything you ever need is supplied! Made for a great getaway for our girls trip!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy and Kevin, Sorry for the delay in getting you my review of your home. I wanted to have time to reply. WOW, Just WOW! For all those out there spending hours and doing weeks of research to find a great location, and home for a ""rustic"" getaway in the country woods of PA...Look no further. I spent weeks looking for just such a spot, all over the Eastern PA, Pocono Mountains and West into Raystown Lake area. I can‚Äôt say enough about Judy and Ray‚Äôs 3BR, 2BA home nestled in the mountains near Huntingdon, PA. Their home was stocked with everything one needs for a quiet weekend away. Fresh towels, linens and paper supplies were also included. It sleeps 6 easily and the front living room futon is huge and comfy as well. The plate of peanut butter cookies was also a nice touch and didn‚Äôt last long. I was there for a guy‚Äôs weekend away and we all loved the quiet location and HUGE rock firepits. Outside yard was spacious, even in the woods and had 2 porches/decks to relax on. We even threw some horse shoes in the back yard too. Home was VERY clean. I could find nothing out of place and nothing to complain about, and believe me I am picky. Again, it is not a 5 star hotel, but it‚Äôs the perfect ‚ÄúRustic‚Äù home in the woods! One night of rain and we still enjoyed their large TV and supply of DVD movies. If there is a negative at all, there is still no Wi-Fi or Cable in the home, so be prepared to disconnect. Cell reception is very week if any at all. It was odd at first, but was nice again to disconnect from the real world for a few days. Also note, this home is not very close to fishing at Lake Raystown, as it is nearly a 30-45 min drive. We did fish and made the trips, but still not close. Just be aware of that, as I was not. Lastly, I will add that this home is a wonderful VALUE for all they offer! You won‚Äôt find a better house for the money. Also, it is quiet and perfect for any couple who want to detach. I can‚Äôt wait to come back with my wife, as I‚Äôve already told her all about it. Thanks again Judy and Kevin. Your home is a 10 and I‚Äôm just jealous it is not my own. Stay Blessed!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place to stay near Raystown and gather with friends. It was clean. Check in and check out was easy. Very peaceful. Would stay again.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Really great spot and great location. Clean and worth the money. Quiet and cozy.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely little cabin back in the woods. Very cozy and relaxing.
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"My co-workers and I had a great time at the cabin. The space was great, affordable, and comfortable. Beds and furniture were really nice and the backyard/patio area was perfect for outdoor hangouts. Awesome spot, would recommend."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy and Kevin's place was exactly what we needed for a get away in the woods. Our 2 kids (6&3) loved sleeping the living room, smores in 1 of the 3 fire pits and playing games. Judy brought us firewood on our first day and was very resourceful with all the questions we had. They have a wonderful binder of information! The place is exactly as described, clean and peaceful. Will definitely stay again!"
2019-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"This house was adorable and set nicely in the woods. We did happen to see a mouse in the house, in which we caught and released. There were also a ton of black ants upstairs in the loft. However, you are in the woods, so it wasn't too surprising. They had dishes and cookware to eat with. There were games and a few movies. There was also a stereo, which was nice. There was plenty of bedding and towels. We enjoyed our stay and would stay there again."
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome place for a family trip!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,First thing ... the house was very clean! The bed was very comfortable. The accommodations were excellent. It's very quiet. We loved sitting on the deck having our morning coffee and then again later in the evening. I really can't say enough good things about this place. The owners were terrific to deal with and they were very thoughtful. I'm a pretty tough critic but I really can't say anything negative. We will definitely be staying there again.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were here for a family reunion in Huntingdon, though also here to relax...and we very much did just that.
I have a terribly stressful job as a nurse and all I wanted was quiet and peace, it was provided in your home.
I so loved the space that I want any excuse to come back to it for absolutely no reason at all, just to spend time in the quietness...and run, read, bike, cook in the lovely little kitchen, drink coffee and watch the deer come into the front yard, pick raspberries and just breathe.
We will be back or maybe just me!
All of us, even the twenty year old and fourteen year old with spotty cell serviceüôÑ, we loved it!
They loved playing games, cards and eating yummy food.
I recommend it highly, cozy, comfortable and relaxing."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin and Judy‚Äôs A frame home was an awesome home away from home. While the weather did not hold up for our four day 4th of July weekend the home was inviting, clean and comfortable. My kids took to the home naturally and enjoyed it as well as my wife and I."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is so beautiful and cozy! Our host thought of everything, towels, shampoo, games, directions, extra plastic bags. We were able to relax and enjoy our family - truely a blessing. 5 stars all around."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy and Kevin have a wonderful ""A"" frame set in the woods. It is comfortable, clean and has everything you will need for your stay. The owners are easy to contact, although we had no problems. The setting is beautiful and the area has great places for outdoor activities. We will visit again!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great weekend get away, great location."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house (cabin), very quiet. My husband and I were here for our first wedding anniversary and as outdoor enthusiasts, it did not disappoint! House is close to Trough Creek State Park, Raystown Lake and Thousand Steps. Took full advantage of grill and fire pits outside. Plenty of outdoor sitting areas surround the house. We were welcomed by Judy, check-in (and check-out) was simple, and had delicious muffins waiting for us. All in all, a great few days‚Äô vacation. Highly recommend Judy and Kevin‚Äôs place; we hope to return again sometime."
2019-06-01,5.0,Group trip,A great cabin with the necessary amenities.
2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Fantastic place!

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, gorgeous house .. sleeps more if you have to. Loved the communication.. great hosts"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy was so kind and responsive when I asked her questions about the cabin and the surrounding area. There were muffins waiting for us in the kitchen, a lovely book full of suggestions of things to do in the area, and the cabin was spotless. We had a lovely time building a fire, grilling, and playing games inside when it was raining. Thank you Judy for opening your cabin up to us! It was such a lovely trip. We hope to come back next year!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at this beautiful property. This charming, roomy A-frame provided us with a relaxing romantic retreat space during the graduation festivities nearby for our son. It‚Äôs amazing that an idyllic woodland hideaway could be so close to all the necessities. Charmingly decorated and carefully appointed with everything we needed, we could not have asked for a better experience! Warm fireplace, movies to watch, beautiful outdoor wooded views, plenty to do nearby, and even breakfast bread provided as a courtesy. We loved it all and send warm thanks!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was very clean, very remote, quiet location. Was about 25 minutes to the nearest restaurant or grocery store. Very close to many attractions...Trough Creek state park, Raystown Lake, Lincoln Caverns are some that we enjoyed!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Let me just start off by saying that this was definitely a gem hidden on the mountain. this was a perfect getaway where cell phone coverage was minimal there was no satellite or digital TV and no Wi-Fi for everybody to be hooked on. There are so many attractions within the area including the caverns and park areas, and places to go kayaking etc etc. It was a perfect getaway and this place was absolutely amazing. The home was better than what the pictures showed and exceeded our expectations. The little touch of muffins on our first morning there was perfect and made us feel like we were in a beautiful b&b. The view was absolutely amazing and although there were neighbors in this tiny cul-de-sac hidden away. Most of them looked to be cabins and nobody was there during that time. The homes are spaced far enough apart that you have your own privacy. Everything was clean and wonderful extra linen and pillows. All the amenities were wonderful and everything was exactly what we had hoped for and then some. I cannot say enough for how wonderful our stay was other than the fact that we will most definitely be coming back again for years to come I hope. Thank you Judy and Kevin for a wonderful stay that my little family absolutely loved."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a weekend getaway with our family and the cottage was perfect!!! Super clean and hosts were very accommodating. 1 hour drive to beaver stadium but totally worth it! We loved cheering on PSU during the day and relaxing in this cozy cottage in evening. Lots of room for family of 6.
Thank you!!!!
Our cell phones all worked fine"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are looking for a charming cabin getaway this is your place.

2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is the perfect place for a quiet vacation.. very peaceful and a beautiful location
2018-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great cabin! So cute yet spacious, with a roomy living room and plenty of deck space. We were fully entertained even without internet and cable! A very relaxing long weekend."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The cabin is adorable. We had a fun family stay, a nice get away from city life. Grill, fire pit, AC were all great. Be sure to bring essential condiments with you (ketchup, mustard, etc.) The lake is beautiful, swimming, boating, and hiking were so fun. Lincoln caverns were great. Alpaca farm was a fun quick visit on our way out."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space in a quiet serene location. The cabin is very comfortable and amply supplied for your visit. Although you cannot access the lake directly from the cabin, we really enjoyed spending a day on the lake in a small rented boat. Be prepared to eat in as the closest restaurants and grocery stores are 30 minutes away. We found a couple of good eating places, but the choices are thin. A pleasant surprise was a local alpaca farm worthy of a stop and tour. An outstanding visit."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was amazing I definitely would recommend to anyone looking to get away!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful mountain retreat! So wonderfully decorated with everything you need and plenty of room! The fresh morning air was delightful! We enjoyed Judy and Kevin's place immensely! Can't say enough about this wonderful place!
2018-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"An adorable, cozy cabin within driving distance to the main lake amenities - our stay last week was perfect for an unusually rainy summer week! The hosts were VERY friendly, helpful and communicative. Loved the fire pit (s‚Äômores in the rain!) and all the games they provided!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin! Lovely site! Great place to relax!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time while staying at the cabin. Our goal was to get away and relax, and we were able to do that at here. Unfortunately it rained every day, so we weren't able to enjoy the decks and firepits as much as we had hoped, but we were very comfortable hanging out inside. The cabin is very clean and has all of the amenities you need. We definitely would recommend staying there!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was very clean and comfortable. Great air conditioning. Close to Raystown Lake yet very secluded. Judy brougt us muffins and answered all our questions. I definitely would rent again. Thanks!
2018-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything you would need included in the House plus a great and safe area
2018-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had an amazing stay at Judy and Kevin's cabin! It was everything that we needed it to be. Communication and check-in went smoothly, Kevin and Judy met us at the gated entrance to the street that the cabin is on. Its important to note that this cabin barely gets cell reception and is not equipped with wi-fi, which was perfect for our weekend escape. Bring a book and play some games- there are board games and horseshoes on site. We also brought our cornhole game since there is ample backyard space to play! The fire pits were so much fun for hanging around the campfire and making s'mores. The cabin was also well stocked with kitchen items (utensils, paper towels, plates, coffee makrer etc.) so all we needed to do was bring food and beverages. The cabin is about a 30-40 min drive from 7 Points Marina on the other side of Raystown Lake. We spent the day there and rented a pontoon boat-- HIGHLY recommend this as something fun to do in the area!!"
2018-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Scenic. Easy access to resort.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a perfect oasis for any occasion. We were comfortable, well taken care of, and charmed by Judy & Kevin's cabin. The stairs were a little steep for me as a pregnant visitor, but I would have loved to stay upstairs to really capture the A-frame charms! We will have to come back!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and private area. There was a bear seen in the area by other people but unfortunately we did not see it. If you are looking for a quiet area that is stress free this is the place. A grocery store is not far away to get whatever you need. You would be about 10 min to Lake Raystown which is a very serene area. Judy was great and will be there for whatever your needs are.
2018-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"As my first Bnb, great little cabin tucked away in solitude. Judy was a great host and made us feel welcome."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Four of us traveled to Raystown Lake to rent a houseboat for the week, but this year we decided to go a few days early and found Judy and Kevin‚Äôs cabin. The location and price were perfect, and when we got there it was even better than we expected. Such a charming, quiet, peaceful setting! There are 3 fire pits and a horseshoe pit (we are planning to build one at our house now). It was literally a vacation before our vacation. We had no idea it would be so relaxing... we already have our weekend picked out for next year and have added on a extra day :)."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy and Kevin‚Äôs place is so nice! It is very quiet and they definitely take the time to make sure they have everything you would need, from firewood to the small things like paper towels. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for somewhere to relax!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed Judy and Kevin's place and found the cabin to be extra cozy and had everything we needed. It was a nice, secluded location where we were still able to access what we needed in Huntingdon and were able to enjoy the peace & quiet back at the cabin with the family. Judy was very easy to work with and we definitely recommend this stay!"
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Judy and Kevin's cabin. We appreciated their prompt and thorough communications before and during our stay. The cabin was well stocked, clean, and perfect for a quiet weekend getaway. Oh, and the banana bread was a thoughtful touch! :)"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at Kevin and Judy's place with a group of 5 girls and it was amazing! We loved that everything we needed was provided and space was a perfect size for a group. Enjoyed a fire for s'mores out back one night, loved cooking in for most meals and sitting on the porches was our favorite part. Highly recommend visiting the alpaca farm down the road and eating lunch at Stand Stone Coffee Company in Huntingdon! We are already planning to come back next year!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judy and Kevin's place was very comfortable and peaceful. They are very attentive hosts from the muffins at check-in and flexibility with our check-on time to delivering fresh firewood for our campfire.
If you are looking for a family friendly get away from all the normal craziness that most of us experience in life. This is your place!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Judy and Kevin were perfect hosts. They greeted us with homemade cookies and were available for any questions we had during our stay. Their place is really nice and ideally located in the forest...a perfect 'off the grid' family weekend.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was perfect for our unplugged get away. We spent most of our time enjoy the cabin and it's fire pits. We also loved hiking the state forest trails, that were just a few minuets up the mountain road. I would recommend this cabin to anyone looking for a quiet family (or friends!) vacation. We happened to come at the end of peak season and had the entire neighborhood to ourselves! We hope to back year after year!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is great for any cabin getaway!
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A pleasant surprise of a cottage. Situated in a private setting, quaint and well appointed. We enjoyed a fire and we slept with the windows open in the middle of August! It was a very welcomed change of pace and noise from the inner city life we came from. The perfect recluse."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Beautiful area, super cute cabin and plenty of sleeping space."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time. We hiked, biked and paddled. Everything we wanted seemed to be within a half hour drive. We used the kitchen and grill everyday. Fire pit and outdoor space was great. We would recommend to to a friend for sure."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay in the Raystown Lake area though it is a bit of a drive to the various lake access points. The house is secluded and even larger than we were expecting however. The three different decks/patios and fire pits give you an idea of the room you have here. Having two showers is also a plus if you have four to six people staying at the house.
Judy was also very communicative for the check-in and check-out process. I would definitely recommend this house if you're looking for a relaxing spot in Huntingdon County."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely place to get away from it all! We like it so much that we returned for a second stay!!
Each time we've stayed during the week and the gated community is very quiet!
It's about a 25 min drive to the Allegripis Trail System, which is great mt biking!!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent 6 days at Judy and Kevin's cabin and loved every minute of it. It was truly a home away from home for us. We appreciated the kitchen being fully stocked, including the use of an outdoor grill, and that we only needed to pack clothes and food for the week. Everything else was already at the cabin! We were able to spend lazy mornings there watching movies and playing board games, and our afternoons exploring Raystown Lake. We were even able to roast marshmallows one evening over a bonfire after spending the day swimming at the beach. Something we could never do at home in Illinois due to the heat in July. It was a very relaxing vacation, and our four boys want to come back again!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! The house was perfect!
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had a great time!! Judy was always there if we needed anything and she was always just a phone call away! Very clean and very accommodating. Nice and private place with plenty of woods surrounding

2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter (4 years) and I met my grad school friend and her kids (4 and 2) for a great weekend. The children were so excited to stay in the ""A"" house. Judy was extremely responsive. The muffins rock!"
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I recieved a warm welcome from Judy. She gave us a tour of the cabin and local suggestions. There were tasty muffins left on the kitchen counter for us and the cabin was so clean and comfortable. I was expecting a few spiders and such as we were on the middle of the woods, but I hardly saw any critters during my 2 night stay, maybe 3 black ants total. Although there was no central air, there were lots of ceiling fans and the house stayed a comfortable temperature. This is coming for someone who's thermostat stays at 66 degrees in the summer. I will say this, if you have T-mobile don't expect to have any contact with the outside world electronically during your stay. Other than that, it was awesome! We'll definitely be back!"
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Quiet and relaxing. Off the beaten path and so refreshing to be able to enjoy quality family time.
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is in a very quiet, scenic location. It is very cute and very cozy. Our wonderful hosts provided yummy muffins for us and we had all of the comforts of home...including coffee! It rained the entire weekend, but my husband and I didn't care. We ventured out to Raystown Lake, but it was so rainy and chilly, we couldn't wait to get back to our warm cozy cabin in the woods. We had a wonderful weekend! Thank you so much!"
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful, quiet house & spot to unwind, relax and connect with friends and family! I highly recommend this house & Judy was wonderful to work with - very welcoming & extremely helpful! The perfect place to ""get away from it all"" and enjoy the outdoors."
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful secluded location, I give this cabin and hosts, Kevin and Judy 5 stars!!!! I highly recommend this cabin whether you are looking for a quiet well equipped cabin (including great movies they have provided) to going out seeing the sites, hiking, fishing, or just simply enjoying a campfire at the cabin! Raystown Lake is beautiful so be sure to venture out and go to the Lake!!!! This very clean comfortable cabin offers all the amenities you would need to make your stay most enjoyable! I highly recommend this place and will be back! Judy and Kevin are the best hosts I've ever had!!!"
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful cabin in a beautiful private community. The beds are comfortable and everything worked great. Heat was easy and quick to adjust. Kitchen had everything we needed, and everything was very clean. The outside is lovely with nice decks to sit out on and fire pits. We visited Raystown Lake and Trough Creek Park, which are both amazing with incredible hikes. We ate at Tops Diner for breakfast which was awesome, huge servings, especially of meats and pancakes... definitely recommend the sweet potato cakes. Also got pizza at the Deli place across the street from the Diner and that was yummy, too. Never thought I'd find such gems in a remote area."

2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Judy was a great host could not have ask for a nicer person.
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first experience using Airbnb, and we couldn't have been happier. Kevin and his son met us at the gate/cabin to show us around and give us tips for our stay (they even had a book and brochures for attractions in the area). The cabin was immaculate having every amenity you would need for cooking and personal needs, including a closet full of games and movies to firewood for the fire pits. It was great being at this perfect secluded place away from all the crowds but still being able to easily get to hiking, biking and Raystown Lake to enjoy the area. It was a much needed get away to relax which we did!! We hope to return to this cabin again in the future. Thank you, Kevin and Judy!!"

There were many thoughtful touches including coffee, snacks and toiletries and best of all, there was a sweet, handwritten note to welcome us. The scenic river view was lovely!
Also, highly recommend the 1,000 steps hike nearby! It‚Äôs not for the faint of heart but it was super fun and had an amazing view!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was adorable and very clean and comfortable. There was a goodie bag with some of the local favorites. Fresh eggs in the fridge. Lots of nice touches. Walking distance to our favorite restaurant - ""OIP"" and a few blocks away from family. I will definitely see if this is available the next time I come to town to visit. So much better than staying at a hotel."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We rented the Riverside Retreat to visit our son at Juniata College. We had a terrific weekend entertaining his friends for dinner, hiking, and exploring the town. We were in easy walking distance to town and enjoyed the view of the river.

Stephanie has definitely thought of every detail and we felt right at home as soon as we stepped inside. Will definitely rent again!!!! Thank you!!!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great getaway for my son and his new wife. My son is in the military, and it was a surprise home visit, plus we had a wedding to plan in just 1 week.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This place was awesome. My partner went to Juniata College and we usually stay at Raystown Lake for the holiday. We decided to book Stephanie‚Äôs place and it did not disappoint. The place is in such a beautiful location. The balcony views are amazing. Coffee and tea plus breakfast from the balcony is a must. The binoculars were an added touch to help us look at birds and stars when we were out there. We didn‚Äôt end up using the tubes but I could tell it would be an awesome time on the water. Aside from the beautiful scenery and location, the studio itself is so cozy. We loved the large kitchen to make breakfast. Stephanie left us such nice gifts along with farm fresh eggs, butter, coffee, tea and a ton of other small cooking items. The window views from inside the studio is also a nice bonus to enjoy the nature around you. This spot was so close to everything in Huntingdon & Raystown. Fabulous host & space!

We've already booked a return trip to see the football games!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and Stephanie was very accommodating! We enjoyed our stay and will definitely return again next summer while the kiddos attend camp at Juniata.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We made a last minute decision to do a weekend get away & this was ideal for how close it was to Raystown Lake & also close to many other local restaurants/breweries. Great, clean, little spot & the hostess paid close attention to detail & even had an organized binder full of local restaurants & activities & calendar of events. Not to mention the thoughtful gift bag & carton of eggs."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Riverside Retreat was the perfect spot to land - quiet, well-appointed, space indoors and outdoors for relaxing. Stephanie's personal touches are spot on - guest book with menus and recreation ideas, Netflix-enabled tv, usb charging plugs on each side of the bed (I hate having to search for outlets when I travel and these already had the built-in!), extra cables, in-room laundry, a welcome gift of snacks and eggs! Stephanie was incredibly responsive and flexible to my travel needs and reached out to ask if I needed anything for my stay. I'll certainly look to stay again in the future for either work or fun. Things to know: 1) there is a pretty active train line immediately across the levee/river (you will also hear this train if you stay at the local hotel up the street) and 2) space for storing luggage is limited if traveling with more than one person."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was our third stay at Stephanie's Riverside Retreat in Huntingdon. When we are in the area the unit is in a good central location as I needed to visit towns between Altoona and Lewistown. I enjoy the walkability of the area as well. If you are in town over Sunday or Monday when restaurant options are slim, it's nice to have the option of preparing your own dinner in the little kitchen and eating it at the kitchen table or on the pretty porch overlooking the Juniata River."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The AirBnb was exactly as described. Stephanie was very responsive and truly mad every effort to make you feel at home. The kitchen had the basics.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I do have to mention there's a train not too far away that is on a very regular running schedule. It might be an issue for very light sleepers. Not too bad for me personally, but it is worth a mention.
Great host. Very kind and responsive, socked with a lot of extras, coffee was great. I found another piece of evidence that I'm on the right path in my life. The owner and I made a serendipitous book exchange. Stephanie and this place are now a part of my path in my wake of my wave im riding. I'm on my right path.
Are you on your right path?.?.?"

The little extras she included in our stay were appreciated as well ,"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best Airbnb visits we‚Äôve ever had. The accommodations were lovely. The description says a studio, but the very large eat in kitchen and bedroom were separate. There was a nice view of the Juniata River and it was next-door to Riverview Park which is beautiful.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very comfortable and convenient stay in this Huntingdon studio. My husband and I were in the area for an extended period while I worked on a writing project. We found the location very convenient, and the amenities in this studio well suited to the two of us. I even became fond of the evening trains and missed them when we moved on to another town. The outdoor space on the porch is a peaceful spot to rest in the afternoon with a glass or cup of something soothing. I enjoyed watching a great blue heron or the occasional human, fishing in the river that flowed past the place. The host is very attentive and quick to respond...something one does not encounter everywhere. We highly recommend both the property and the host."

The kitchen had everything we needed to post up for the weekend. As an added bonus, there's a TV with Netflix and Prime Video hooked up to it.

Clean, nice countertop in kitchen, nice double sink bathroom. Mattress was very comfy. River and grocery-store access onlyminutes away. Has a nice deck and grill area with cute string lights. There‚Äôs only one door protecting you fromoutside and it‚Äôs the sliding door on deck with only a small latch. Did not feel completely safe."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax. Stayed while golfing in the area so just hung out for the down time but it was perfect for us.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Let's start from the beginning of our trip. The check in process was so simple. The host gives you step by step instructions on how to get in and has pictures. You walk into a beautiful apartment over looking the river. The apartment is completely redone with beautiful (and comfortable) furniture. The kitchen has a ton of space for just whoever is staying or if you would like to host people. The entire apartment was super clean and hospitable. There were tons of amenities that we didn't even realize we might need! Coffee, tea, ice cubes, board games, books, fishing poles, etc. There's a grill outside that invites such a nice outside vibe for your trip. The TV was a great addition if you want to stay in and it swivels to face the seating area or your bed. There was a washer and dryer if you needed it as well. Really like the option of having more beds if needed as well to again have more guests. Got to wake up this morning and have a complimentary coffee on the deck over looking the river. 12/10 and would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Huntingdon.
PS the host has great recommendations of what to do in town as well as where to eat- definitely take their advice!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stephanie's place was brilliant! The Riverside Retreat was very clean and well stocked with everything a person could need. Loved the picturesque views of the river and morning sunrise views from the large windows. I read Stephanie's local information booklet from cover to cover and we did just that, explored the little treasures in the small town. Loved being within walking distance to several parks and to town. Check in and out was easy and added bonuses made us smile and feel very welcomed upon our arrival. Highly recommended! We would stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a nice relaxing weekend here. We had no issues, but Stephanie responded quickly to the couple of messages I did sent.

I enjoyed all the games available, some that I hadn't played since childhood. They even had an Atari set up in one of the bedrooms!!! the bathroom had extra amenities and the outside had all the tools for the fire and they provided s'mores. such a great place to get away and recharge yourself. I look forward to going back again."

It was filled with lots of great places to eat, and tons of stuff to do in the area. The outdoor space was so peaceful.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Steve and Diane's place was a perfect home base for a weekend of biking and hiking. I booked it knowing their house was a bit further away from the Allegprippis (Raystown Lake) trail system than some of the other listings, but their house was much cleaner and better updated so it was worth the little bit of extra time driving to the trails. The house has a lot of privacy and some great views, especially at sunset.
As the description notes, there's no wifi - and cell service is good enough for a call but not streaming. We actually made that part of the fun by bringing a bunch of old DVDs and doing movie nights. Bonus: I was actually able to get my kids to watch a bunch of my favorite movies that they would have had no interest in when they've got access to Netflix/Disney/etc.
We definitely enjoyed our stay and would book again!"

The view is indeed the best...the most impressive was the sounds of nature (and sporadic traffic was low key). My sister from California never held a lightning bug... that was a highlight. We took lots of pics and videos of our first ""real-life"" get together after 5 years of keeping in touch via letters, texts, video calls etc. We will never forget our awesome experience........and again, it was so awesome meeting both of you!

The drive to Trough Creek State Park was just long enough to fully enjoy the changing leaves. The house itself was stocked with movies, games, and every creature comfort needed for a weekend getaway.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mountain View Guest House was extremely clean and very well stocked. Everything you could need for cooking is included and there were more than enough towels, pillows, etc. The cabin was larger than we anticipated. One note, especially if you‚Äôre traveling with small children, is the largest of the bedrooms is in the open loft space. The area was private and peaceful with the exception of some mooing at the nearby farm, which my kids got a kick out of. There were a handful of little restaurants nearby and lots to do in the state park. Seven points marina was a little further away but an easy drive."

We look forward to staying there again!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the Mountain View Guesthouse was wonderful! The house was super clean and organized well. We had everything we needed.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I would suggest using these hosts if you are looking for a comfortable home away from home and peaceful/serene experience.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first ever stay at an AirBNB. I was slightly nervous having heard some stories of bad experiences but the hosts were phenomenal and the property was amazing! For the price of a small hotel room you get an entire house in a gorgeous setting. Our dogs loved it too! The view from the master bed room out the front windows was just amazing. The bed was comfortable to us. Sitting on the covered porch was very relaxing. The leaves were just starting to change during our stay. I can only imagine how awesome and awe inspiring it would look as it approaches peak colors. The house is well stocked, clean, in good repair, and very comfortable. I felt at home, comfortable, and relaxed very quickly! Steve welcomed us. He was very friendly and told us to let them know if we needed anything. Our phones didn‚Äôt work and that was a welcome forced unplug. We spent a good portion of Sunday on the porch and let the dogs explore the yard. A minor thing, there is a pig farm nearby that if the wind blows in a specific direction it can be smelled but it didn‚Äôt last long."

2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,My friends and I had an amazing weekend here. The place was very clean and the property was beautiful. The front porch offered a fantastic evening view! Also not too far from Raystown Lake which was our main point of interest. Steve and Diane were wonderful hosts.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was pleasantly surprised how nice the cabin was and how easy the process was. This was our first airbnb stay and it really felt like a home away from home. Everything you would need is there and in the drawer you‚Äôd expect to find it in. It was very clean and decorated very homey. Our dog loved rolling down the hill and running in the woods. The fire pit was nice esp with provided wood which was tarped.

The cabin is nicely positioned in a secluded area just outside of Calvin on top of a hill overlooking the forest and surrounding farmland (with plenty of space for the kids to run around - they loved the hill in the front). We enjoyed the evenings on the front porch overlooking the valley and sunset or sitting around the fire pit (the firewood is also provided). The house was very clean inside with just about everything provided, including a scrapbook with things to do and places to eat in the area (OIP has the best strombolis). The owners are very nice people who promptly respond to questions and even visited us on our first evening to check if we needed anything, which is just above and beyond. Thank you so much for providing us a great place to stay for our weekend getaway!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful and peaceful getaway nestled high on a hill. This is a wonderful home to escape to for a weekend vacation.

2018-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Everything was wonderful during our stay! This is a gem hidden in the mountains. It was slightly further from Raystown lake than we would have liked, but in the end was worth the drive (<40 mins to most places) for what you got. We loved that it was pet friendly with lots of space for our dog to run. Everything was very clean and they even gave us everything needed to make smores. Would highly recommend if you want to get away from everything and enjoy a relaxing time in the mountains."

The three bedrooms were perfect for gathering our family together, and the house was spotless and felt as if we were the first guests to stay there. We cooked many breakfasts and one dinner in the well appointed kitchen, and we loved the nice laundry facilities. It was so peaceful and pretty on the property - we loved sitting on the front porch and walking our dogs. Great star gazing on clear nights too. Diane and Steve are warm and welcoming; they responded back immediately to any messages I sent and helped to accommodate my family‚Äôs time schedules. We enjoyed boating on Raystown Lake, taking the kids to Lincoln Caverns, and attending a nearby family reunion. I absolutely recommend this property to anyone looking for quality time with loved ones in a beautiful location."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The view of Irish acres is phenomenal! The pictures do not do justice for the view of the mountains that you can relax and just soak in.

Starting and ending the day in the hot tub was lovely!! Already looking at dates for next year. Thank you Gary, for sharing this special spot!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is privately situated on the upper portion of the farm. The views of the surrounding public lands and mountains are spectacular. The property ""Irish Acres"" is a legitimate farm of yester year. The obvious love that has gone into this land over the years by the fourth-generation owners makes it a spiritual get away opportunity for those visiting. The host was gracious, sinecure and warm.
We will go again and skip the football game next time."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What can we say? By far the best air bnb we have ever stayed at. If you want to get away from everyday life, this is the place. Private and beautiful views. Gary was excellent. We really enjoyed the hot tub and wood stove. We will be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Booked our stay based on our friends recommendation and Garys site photos. We (Wife, Son and 2 pets) thoroughly enjoyed its relaxing location and privacy. Gary built this cabin strictly for his family many years ago without (Us) in mind, so grateful to be able to enjoy their labors of love.
Its location and view will leave you speechless upon arrival. Morning coffee on the porch was elevating, walking our dogs on his pathways felt like home.
Can't say enough about our host Gary, friendly, very communicative and accommodating. Thank you Gary for allowing my family to stay at your cabin. Looking forward to our next stay - what a privilege.
Tom & Jen"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Gary's place was wonderful! The view was absolutely gorgeous and we had it all to ourselves at the top of the mountain. My husband and I are so grateful to have been able to stay at Gary's place and experience such a peaceful serene setting and stay in such a clean, cozy place. It had everything we needed, including a well stocked kitchen. And Gary was so accommodating of our dog! Our dog loved running around and exploring the property while we enjoyed the fire pit and the stars (that we did a glimpse of despite the rainy weather). We will definitely be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We cannot recommend this cabin enough! We had the most relaxing stay, the cabin was clean and cozy and the views were spectacular!
We had one clear day and one rainy day‚Äîwe explored some local parks and trails on our nice day and Gary gave some great recommendation. We stargazed in the hot tub and by the fire, it was so clear! We saw a few shooting stars, too.
Our rainy day was the best vacation rainy day I‚Äôve ever had‚Äî we cozied up by the fire and read books and played board games. When we got a break in the rain we would sit in the hot tub and watch the clouds and fog roll over the mountains.
And I can‚Äôt gush about the cabin without a very glowing review of the host‚Äî Gary is above and beyond the most welcoming AirBnb host we‚Äôve ever had! I had such a wonderful time getting to know him and learning about Irish Acres. It really is such a special place‚Äî we‚Äôve been raving to all of our friends and are already scheming our return! Thank you for making our weekend getaway so special!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Gary‚Äôs Irish Acres Cabin is what dreams are made of! His special slice of Heaven was one of the top places we‚Äôve ever stayed in. We found Gary‚Äôs cabin because we were looking for a serene getaway to enjoy the fall foliage. It was incredibly freeing and peaceful and to stay on top of the mountains and be among the breathtaking scenery. We absolutely loved the hot tub and enjoyed the rolling hills while enjoying the rolling bubbles of the spa. We enjoyed swinging on the porch swing at all times of the day, and especially under the stars at night. We went to Hawk Watch mountain to hike and enjoyed seeing hawks at eye level. We toured Belleville and found various farm stands with delicious fruits and vegetables. Gary‚Äôs cabin was extremely clean but what was most impressive was that he and his friends and family built the cabin with love and devotion. We are honored to have met Gary and be guests in his home. We left feeling more like family and we can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolute GEM! In town for football in State College, and It was an easy drive to Gary‚Äôs cabin‚Äîdefinitely recommend a 4WD rental car, but what a find! Exactly as pictured, but pictures don‚Äôt do justice to the views and the peaceful setting. Thanks again for sharing your little piece of heaven, Gary! Can‚Äôt recommend enough!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very quaint cabin at the top of the mountain. Amazing views of the mountains. Great hot tub, porch swing hammock and fire pit seating. Cabin was very clean and well organized. Loved everything about the cabin. Gary was super responsive and helpful but also gave us our space to enjoy the property. Would definitely recommend."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My wife, pup, and I were lucky enough to book Eugene's (""Gary's"") property for a Fall college football weekend. While things didn't go our way on the football field, this cabin was a convenient (<30min) and beautiful contrast to the craziness of State College. Perched high atop a hill with complete privacy (aside from many deer!), Gary's property only recently became available on AirBNB after many years as a family cabin -- the family photos and history only add to the charm. While rustic, the cabin is as-described, clean, and has all the basic creature comforts. Outside, the porch swing, hot tub, fire pit, and horseshoes complement the awesome views. Each morning, we awoke to fog nestled in the valley below. Our only regret is that our weekend agenda consisted of too much of tailgating in parking lots -- and not enough relaxing back at the AirBNB."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We found the cabin after planning a short trip to the Raystown area and made a great choice. It was very clean, comfortable and well appointed , the hospitality was greatly appreciated and the Mountain Views from the cabin were breathtaking!

Can't wait to come back again."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is beautifully maintained and comfortable. The hosts make it very easy to check in and out and their instructions were great.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very clean and well stocked. The kitchen had nice pots, pans, utensils and a fantastic coffee machine.

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you stay in Huntingdon and want to be in an exquisite and unique home, this is the place. The home was comfortable and had all the amenities you'd need in a ""home away from home"" but with furnishings and rooms that give old world elegance. The beds were amazingly comfortable and the home was perfect for 2 couples and a single person. We cooked while we were there, and the kitchen had everything (and more) than you'd expect. Thank you to our hosts for being so responsive to our questions and for creating such a beautiful space."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautifully restored Victorian home! Perfect for parents or alumni on a visit to Juniata College. We used it for our 50th reunion with another couple and it worked well. Just a few blocks walk to campus. JBC Brewing Co. nearby and a coffee/lunch shop across the street. Highly recommend.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can't say enough about the Queen on 13! Truly lives up to her name. Our hosts were amazing giving us clear instructions well before our arrival with super helpful tips for staying at their home.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely stunning and comfortabe home. Interior design and furnishings could be featured in a magazine. Each of the three bedrooms are spacious and unique.
We spent a good bit of time just admiring the gorgeous wallpaper and window treatments. The bedding was not only beautiful but supremely comfortable. I had to do some work on the computer and attend a remote meeting and the wifi was great, and there were flat screen TVs in each bedroom and in the living room, which we didn‚Äôt use but looked like they are high quality. The cafe just across the street is amazing- they roast their own delicious coffee and serve breakfast and lunch items (and yummy smoothies!) with a very nice sit down area. We enjoyed walking around and looking at the older homes in the neighborhood. There are a number of good restaurants a short 3-4 min drive away (.8 mile). Can‚Äôt recommend this stay enough! We hope to have the good fortune to stay again soon."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very unique home! Clean and affordable. Great coffee shop across the street.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We spent one night at Jeannie‚Äôs place. It was very clean and organized. We stopped by there during our roadtrip, but it is also definitely a good place for a retreat or getaway. There were a lot of board games and books on the shelf! We met the host in the morning the next day and they were very nice to us!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jeannie and Herb‚Äôs place was good for a night passing through. Pretty view of the farm and cows. House has everything you need and the porch was great to watch the sunset. The only negative thing is that when I arrived their very large dog ran over to my car, jumped on my door and stuck his nose in trying to get to my dog. The following morning he was let out into the yard while I was walking my dog on leash and again ran right up on her. Luckily my dog is not reactive and I was able to keep the situations under control, but anyone that has a reactive dog should be extremely guarded and protective of their dog. Other than that, it was a pleasant stay."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jeannie and Herb were very helpful and made our stay great. The space was even larger than we anticipated.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable and quiet is how I would describe staying here. It's a private space, on an actual farm, about 1 mi from route 22. It's near Rothrock State Forest, Canoe Creek State Park, Alexandria PA and the Lower Trail. Communication with the host is always fast and very pleasant. check in is as easy as could be. This Airbnb is apartment sized, with fully equipped kitchen and three bedrooms, one with a queen bed, and two bedrooms with two twins each. Board games, cable TV, decent Wi-Fi, and watching the farm animals, made our stay extra enjoyable! Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I think this is our 3rd or 4th time we've stayed in Jeannie's place. If I'm in her area and need a rest, she would be our first choice.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The hosts are warm and friendly, they reached out to me to assure everything was just right. The farm location is quiet and feels safe and remote, with a few restaurants just two to three miles away. The Lower bike trail is only 2 mi away. The space has all the essentials, is clean and cozy. it's so roomy, I had the feeling a family of four could actually live here full time. I appreciated having a full kitchen and everything needed to make a good cup of coffee. it was really delightful watching the farm animals from the porch, as I sipped morning coffee. The hosts went above and beyond at checkout, going out of their way to help with a last detail. I have stayed at many airbnbs all over the country, this one is not elaborate or fancy but makes up for it with country charm and gracious hosts! Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

In time which was great. When we arrived Herb welcomed us. We loved the map on the wall with pins to put where all the people that stayed there were from. We wish we could of enjoyed the fire pit, cows and chickens but we were only there a short amount of time for my daughters volleyball tournament at state college. I definitely recommend staying here."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful find for the family. We were traveling and found this AirBnB was near our route and could accommodate our party. Was much better than any hotel we could have stayed at, especially when you get to see the countryside and enjoy a quiet community as part of your stay. We recommend this as a great place to stay while traveling or as a destination while visiting the Altoona PA area."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We arrived in the afternoon and everything was as Jeannie told us.
Because we were the only ones staying there it was very spacious and we enjoyed it very much. There are another three bedrooms there but they weren‚Äôt occupied."

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I stay here because of the value and also the proximity to my family. Also enjoy smallmouth bass fishing in the frankstown branch..
The hosts are very friendly. Because the unit is dog friendly, folks need to expect some nuances such as paw prints on the floor.
Overall the hosts are very attentive .
The Wi-Fi signal was not very powerful and actually found myself going outside and using my Internet on my phone because their Wi-Fi did not perform adequately in the basement"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place and farm!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jeannie was very polite and responsive. The home is in farm setting and very spacious. It was great home for a vacation to spend a few days just for relaxing. Too bad we didn't have enough time to stay more as we came on tour purpose instead of vacation.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was super cute. The farm atmosphere was very homey. The place was perfect for the two of us and our dog. It was perfectly located close enough to our plans in Altoona.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a pleasant and relaxing stay at the farmhouse apartment. It is very quiet and dark at night for extra-good sleep. The cattle are wonderful to watch out the window. The scene out the window and from the porch is like a pastoral painting.
The location is well-signed, and easy to find. The vibe is peaceful. I cooked the entire time I was there and there was every pot and utensil I needed. We are happy to stay again and recommend. Jeannie responded right away to any text I sent, and Jackson gifted me a dozen farm eggs. Jeannie allowed me late checkout at late notice, even though she was expecting guests within a few hours. Very generous, considerate hosts. Thank you."

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay very much. It is a hidden gem! The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. Beautiful views, and good accommodations for a small group or family. We messaged the host to ask for permission to use the fire pit and we were given a quick reply that yes, we could. They even gave us treats to feed the cows. Such a fun experience. I did take one star off because I found several spiders inside the apartment during our stay. I understand it‚Äôs the country, but nothing a quick pest spray wouldn‚Äôt fix. Overall great experience, and would stay again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It‚Äôs a calm, bucolic retreat. Far enough away from the city lights to enjoy the fireflies and starlights. Follow the directions as Jeannie instructed and you won‚Äôt get lost.
The fire ring was a +++. We dined Al fresco during our meals. They are great and friendly. Would definitely stay there again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Large apartment on 1st floor. Nice view of hill side and cows coming down hill to shed as the sun set.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and clean apartment on a farm setting as described. Both Herb and Jeannie were very hospitable, friendly and helpful. Took a visit to Lincoln caverns, ate a good meal at Kelly's Corner and also Backwoods bbq, and rented jet skis on the lake. It was a great time. We prepared a dinner using the equipment in the kitchen and had a wonderful meal sitting on the patio looking at the farm."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This apartment is just as pictured, only much better! It is impeccably clean, well-stocked with necessities, and in a quiet, peaceful location.
Indoors: Two of the three bedrooms have no windows, which made them wonderfully dark for sleeping. We used only two beds; the queen in the master has a memory foam mattress and is very comfortable. My son (17) slept in one of the twin beds and said that it was, ""springy, but comfortable."" (He has a memory foam mattress at home, so this was different.) All three bedrooms have dressers with plenty of drawer space, as well as extra blankets and pillows.
The kitchen was well-supplied with everything needed to cook and serve a meal. Coffee, dish soap, sponge, and dish towels are all provided. The bathroom is huge, and had more than enough towels. Sofa and loveseat in the living room were comfortable for lounging on a quiet day. Dining room table easily sits six people.
The air conditioning comes from two window units on the opposite side of the apartment from the bedrooms but kept us cool enough for sleeping, even on 85 degree days. We turned them off during the day, because the apartment was comfortable without them.
On a couple of evenings, we smelled cigarette smoke in the master bedroom. We speculated that the hosts might have been smoking either upstairs or on the front porch, and the smell came in to us. Other than that (and it was neither nightly, nor heavy), we have no complaints or concerns.
Outdoors: We appreciated the pet-friendly property. We loved the fire ring, and the plentiful supply of firewood. It was beautiful to sit beside the fire, watch the fireflies, and see the cows come home to the barn for the night."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very large space, clean, comfortable, quiet. Lots of amenities. Fantastic deal for a great place to stay. Jeannie is very kind and accomodating"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cleanliness is extremely important to me. I was so relieved to see that Jeannie's cleaning was great as per previous reviews. We had everything we needed to be comfortable.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a great time! Thank you for sharing your farm with us! Our so had the best day ever with the cows! üòä everything was perfect and if ever back in the area, we would definitely book again!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a good location and quiet... Good for canoeing in the little juniata or fishing or going to places such as spruce Creek or even raystown.
The upgrade to the master bed last year was very beneficial and will make your sleep experience better.
There is no scald guard on the plumbing so be careful and mindful of that if you have children.
I don't watch TV but seems to have a decent viewing selection and reception.
Internet is sometimes hit or miss."

It‚Äôs the perfect distance between Huntingdon and Altoona where we were visiting family. We‚Äôll definitely be back next time we come to visit!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Highly recommend!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"WOW! Fantastic place to stay. The pictures dont do the space justice. One main bedroom with Queen bed, and two other bedrooms with two twins each. Spacious eat in kitchen and cookware for making your own meals. Living room is spacious and affords tv for relaxation. I am not much on watching tv but seemed a fair amount of channels offered. WiFi was excellent for my needs. I dont stream videos so can't comment on speed of internet. I have Verizon cell and found no issue with cell service during my lengthy stay.
Large bathroom with enough towels for an army. The apartment is under the host's home but that presented no issues whatsoever. In fact the benefits of having Herb and Jeannie nearby was an added bonus. I actually stayed seven full weeks. Felt like home. At this location you are 8 miles to Huntingdon - grocery stores and eateries and playgrounds. You are also close to hiking the Lower Trail 4 miles away. Or drive 28 miles to downtown State College Pa which offers nightlife, sports venues (PennState) and several museums. This rental is in a country setting and ad states ""suv recommended""; heed that warning in Pennsylvania winters. I have an suv and had no issues with access to apartment but also Herb was on top of plowing and dealing with the ice storm fallout. The property is home of the Belted Galloway cows. Goregous view from kitchen window. Dont hesitate to walk the pasture lane to witness these creatures up close. An added bonus to this rental is the collection of games, puzzles, and reading material. Something for all age groups. Isaac and I loved the assortment! Don't hesitate to rent this space. There is much to be appreciated.
Looking forward to my next visit."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Don't hesitate to stay at this lovely, comfortable apartment in Alexandria. From the moment I reserved the space Jeannie reached out to give great detail as to location and specific information regarding access on winter roads to the apartment. Herb had driveway plowed and treated with cinders. The ad states a 4 wheel drive is suggested. During my stay we have been hit with two ice storms and brutally cold temps. I was glad to have an suv with 4 wheel drive.
The apartment is located in the country. It is a full living space under the host's home. This has only been a positive experience. A few things I needed, Herb was quick to respond and assisted me in a warm friendly manner. My three k9s have been welcomed as well; not many places allow more than one dog. The apartment kitchen window faces a large pasture on side hill, the view offered some fantastic sunsets. The pasture is home to Registered Belted Galloway cows. The pasture is surrounded by a lane which is accessible to the guest, good workout to crest the hill. View is breathtaking. GOREGOUS! My stay had had been for six weeks straight. Cant say enough how comfortable I was. Safe environment and quiet. Dont pass up a chance to rent this lovely apartment."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is much larger than it appears in the photos. It was very clean and well stocked. We absolutely loved it, and being able to bring our dog was such an added bonus for us. We will be back!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and very clean! Just a wonderful place that met are needs perfectly.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very accommodating and perfect for a getaway!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay! It is of great value, and it can actually host 5 people! It is exactly the place you want if you are here for the football games!
It is cozy, and everything is clean and nice. You can find all the things you need.
It is in a farm, so you might find some bugs but only very few especially considering you are at a farm!
It is also expected that the Internet is not very good. It is even hard to load photos. My ATT almost does not work, so make sure you get your navigation app working before you leave the house. This is typical of Airbnb houses according to my experience.
Another thing we would like to mention is that they have giant dogs! However, you won't feel their existence at all if you do not ask for a visit to Jeannie, so no worries if you do not want to see any dogs. We are interested so we paid a visit and that is a fun experience!
Generally, I like this place a lot, and it is not too far from the football game!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at the ranch. Great location and very comfortable! Jeannie is very responsive and the space is outfitted as promised. We did find the wi-fi to be a little slow this visit for streaming as well as teleworking (it‚Äôs satellite), but otherwise it was a perfect weekend. The location is just gorgeous and so close to so many outdoor pursuits. One of our favorites!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We only stayed at Jeannie‚Äôs for one night on our way home from vacation, but it was a very comfortable and clean stay and plenty big enough for our 6 person family to fit comfortably! We hope to be back and stay for a couple days to be able to enjoy the cows a little longer!"
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A quiet and roomy place. It feels like being in another world, in the country. The cattle are so beautiful, the outdoor space perfect for dogs. Yet, it is close to Huntingdon and Altoona. So many bedrooms, a huge bathroom. Great space for a family."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We always have a great time at Herb and Jeannie‚Äôs place and look forward to the next time!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! After our other airbnb cancelled on us the day before our trip due to a bridge outage from storms which made it unsafe to access the airbnb, we were left scrambling to find a place to accommodate us and our 3 small children in this somewhat remote area. We found Jeannie and Herb's place and booked it immediately. I was a little worried about the drive since my husband was taking a class in Belleville and I needed to be able to drive him back and forth from his class. While it was 35 minutes away from where we wanted to stay, it was still a manageable drive, especially relatively close to huntingdon, which is where I ended up spending a lot of time with the kids while we waited for the class to be finished each day.
Every was as described, very spacious accommodations. Unfortunately this was the first time we tried to get our 18 month old to sleep in a pack n play instead of his crib and it did not go well and I worried that we were disturbing our hosts as our little guy refused to acknowledge bed time and alternatively fussed and tried to play/wouldnt fall asleep until late! Kids were very upset when we had to leave and keep asking to go back to our ""other"" house."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice convenient place.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean and quiet, the views are pretty! We stayed for a quick over night to get some rest before heading up to NY!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect place to stay. We were in and out for a wedding so didn‚Äôt spend much time there, but the time spent there was comfortable and clean. Everything we needed was there. The yard and animals were nice for the kids."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The fact that this was the fourth time I have stayed here shows what a great accommodation Jeannie and Herb provide. Spacious, clean, and a great location. I cannot say enough good things about it. I look forward to the next time I stay at Jackson Mountain."

There's a lovely outdoor table and firepit where you can cook or roast marshmallows while watching the sun set on the beautiful Belted Galloways. It is sweet and simple. Everything you could need is provided. If you feel anything is missing, you need anything, or have questions about the area, Herb & Jeannie are more than accomadating. Very sweet, friendly couple. We will be back."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a quiet place to stay but close to everything you would want to do in the Huntingdon/Raystown area! All the amenities of home!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jackson Mountain is an unbelievable place. We boat at Raystown Lake, the apartment is about 20 minutes from the closest boat launch. The Jacksons will take care of anything you need."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Oh my! What a place!! Everything about it was perfect in every way. From the time you pull up and see the amazing view out back to the moment the ‚ÄòBelties‚Äô come running down the hill to get some water. Magical!!!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great Place to stay, Clean, Quiet location. And the Cows were fun to watch."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tucked away in Alexandria, minutes from Diner 22 (Yummm). Don‚Äôt pass up an opportunity to stay here. Dog & Pitbull friendly (dream come true for pit owners).
All accommodations were provided, full kitchen was such a bonus!! The best part of waking up, was the Foldgers in our cup. Coffee provided (you make it though). The fridge had gallon water jugs, but the water tasted fine...to me.
Lots of books and puzzles/games provided for adult & child entertainment. TV provided and wifi available.
Will definitely come here again if we ever pass through the area."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice, spacious and clean lodging. I didn't personally meet the hosts but great communication through texts and emails. I dont think anybody could possibly complain about anything at this bnb. The price is super low, place is well stocked with towels, salt, pepper, coffee, sugar, etc. and just overall a very nice quiet place to relax. We are locals and just like to take grandkids for a change of scenery from time to time. We will definitely tell our out of town visitors about this place. Thanks for hosting!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Unfortunately due to unforseen circumstances we ended up having to head straight home and missed our stay at Jeannie's. BUT I can say she was sweet and friendly and great with communication when we did. We appreciate the kindness
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jeannie and Herb have a wonderful apartment on the Jackson Mountain Farm. I have stayed there for the past three years while fishing the Little Juniata. The apartment is immaculate and in a wonderful setting on the farm. And it is very convenient to location along the Little J for fishing. I highly recommend staying here!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodations were absolutely spotless, roomy and had a beautiful view of the country side from the back porch. The only issue I‚Äôd like to convey is that the driveway to the property was graveled, steep and a bit rough. Furthermore, the parking slot was sloped and uneven and could be a concern for certain people."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, spacious apartment with all the amenities to have a pleasant stay."
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jeannie's apartment is very spacious and clean. We needed a place to stay during our daughter's Penn State graduation weekend, and we were pleased to find this spot. It suited our needs. We wished we could have stayed longer. The stars were amazing when we arrived and, the porch area gave us a nice view of the cows on the hill."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Way more space that a couple needed for a short overnight for a wedding. The place would be a good place for a family or group of friends to explore the region and/or enjoy Herb and Jeannie's farm.

I can get to my favorite fishing spots and meet up with old friends all within a short distance from your place. Quick communications, super clean, comfortable and ideal setting. Seeing the day old calf while having my morning cup of coffee was priceless. I‚Äôm looking forward to coming back. Thanks again!"
2021-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"1) box spring mattresses are not real comfortable if you have back issues
2) thermostat is locked at 68 which is a bit chilly for certain times of the year"

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Perfect spot to unwind out in the country! Sitting on the back porch listening to the rooster crow and watching the sun come up was the therapy we needed! A little home away from home with super nice hosts available for any needs. Highly recommend!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great find. This place has everything thing you need for spending time in the great outdoors. Very spacious, super clean, all the amenities necessary for a comfortable stay. The views are incredible from the back porch and nothing like enjoying breakfast with the belted galloways! Thank you so much for making your place available. I will definitely be back!

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect place for a two day biking trip.Quick communication.Very spacious.Lots of beds,towels and channels.Best value so far on Airbnb!"
,,,"Beautiful place, very clean. But all of the beds were very hard/cheap which caused us to not be able to sleep at night. We had to cut our trip short and leave a day early due to the beds being so uncomfortable."
,,,"The home was spacious, which was appreciated. But, there was an overwhelming smell of a dog, dog hair, and a pumpkin spice air freshener to cover up the dog smell. As someone with allergies, this was a lot to take. Further, we got in late at night and woke up to Trump flags flying high on the property. If you are going to fly a loser's flag, rep it proudly on your listing so folx know what's up before booking your place."
