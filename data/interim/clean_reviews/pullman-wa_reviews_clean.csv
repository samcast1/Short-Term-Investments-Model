2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I HIGHLY recommend the College Town Cottage, to everyone. Very clean & cutest place.
Host is very kind and responsive. I’ll definitely be staying here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed a few busy days to move out our college kids for the summer, so this place was a nice peaceful, and private oasis to come back to and relax each night. Quiet, cozy and spotless. East to get in and out. Great instructions for check in and in general. Responsive host and loved the little gift and sweets when we checked in. Overall a very pleasant and enjoyable stay."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are planning a stay in Pullman or Moscow, this is a perfect spot if there is just a few of you. Everything you need is close by and the hosts are very helpful. It was clean, quiet, and very home like. We would recomend this spot to all our friends. Great job guys .... thanks for the wonderful stay! ~The Wilson's~"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is immaculate, cozy, beautifully appointed, and with comfortable beds! You'll be very pleased should you stay. We came for our last kids commencement and I wish I'd found Annies cottage much sooner. Not enough stars to accurately describe."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute and SO comfortable! I actually slept in a bed that wasn’t mine. I loved that our host was right next door, very friendly and helpful. I felt very safe and relaxed at the cottage, in the neighborhood, on the WSU campus, and in the town of Pullman. Delightful experience altogether!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the best Airbnb I have ever lived. It gave me a feeling of back to home and it has everything I need. The surrounding is also really good. Will definitely recommend all my friends to live here if they want to come to Pullman.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely fantastic, it really captured the feeling of being home even though I was there for less than a week! Beautiful, cozy and clean. And the hosts could not have been better. They were the type of people I would love to have as neighbors, friendly, respectful and super helpful. Thank you so much!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was meticulously well kept. We were very impressed by how pristine it was - its classic architectural design, as well as the updated amenities. It is conveniently located within walking distance to downtown and our hosts’ recommendations were very much appreciated. They truly are super hosts. We would love to stay there again the next time we’re in town. Thanks for making us feel so welcome."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, I would gladly stay there again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Came to Pullman to tour WSU. The house was so comfortable and welcoming. It had everything we needed. The coffee was so good in the morning. It was fairly cold so we didn’t get to use the backyard but it looked like a great place to hang out.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was perfect. Great house, hope to stay there again."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I liked the charm of the place quite a lot. Both me and the fella I'm rooming with have full size crew cab long bed trucks. This Is really not a good place for these types of vehicles. Very narrow and tight getting in the driveway with no street parking near the home. Just something to be aware of, otherwise pretty good acomodations."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Clean, close to downtown which helped maximize our time in Pullman!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Annie was extremely helpful and responsive, and her place was homey and spotless. We stayed with our two young daughters and the place was perfect. We plan on staying there again the next time we visit Pullman. Thanks Annie!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect home away from home. Easy and close location to WSU.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Came for a quick work trip and this place did not disappoint. Normally we stay at a hotel close to the university but they were booked out. Coming back I’d rather choose this option as it was even less expensive! The house could not have been cuter and being on a tight timeline the fact that we didn’t have to complete chores upon departure was really great!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very thoughtful renovation. Very clean and comfortable. We especially appreciated the good mattresses, pillows, and linens. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As always, an outstanding place to stay!!!"

Annie was gracious and friendly, always communicating promptly through messaging. The beds were soft, clean, and very comfortable. We found the location very nice- within driving distance to the University. Would recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We love Annie's place so much that we have made it our ""home away"" from home when we visit our grandson in Pullman! It is a refreshing moment to open the door and see the beautiful home waiting for our stay! Always clean, responsive hosts and I love that they added local recommendations for our stay this time! We will be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Annie's absolutely deserves more than five stars. It's charming inside and out. The house is roughly the same age as my 87-year-old mother, who tends to speak without filter these days. But even she had only kind things to say, offering, ""I could live here!"" My husband and I agree it would be a sweet place to call home. Thank you. You've created a gem."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Very clean nicely appointed and would stay here again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay. Very comfotable, clean and relaxing. It was extremely hot in Pullman (close to 100 degrees f) but the A/C kept us feeling just right!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Super cute and clean. Wish we could’ve stayed longer will definitely be back.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, quaint home. We loved it"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Annie's place was ideal for our WSU and University of Idaho visits. So much better than local hotels. Great location, incredibly clean, well stocked, good parking situation, pretty grounds and Annie was friendly and responsive. We will definitely book again when we are back to visit."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We’ve stayed here twice and will probably stay here again. Nice location, good amenities, and just what we need."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wish we could have stayed longer. A lovely place! Very clean, comfortable and quiet with lots of nice finishing touches. Would happily stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home is idyllic, perfectly clean and well-stocked with just about everything you’d want in your own home—and all of great quality. Annie and Javad are amazing hosts, very personable, responsive, accommodating, and attentive to whatever needs arise. We stayed for a month and it felt like we had great neighbors; although they are around for a friendly hand waive or if you need assistance, they are not intrusive and give you your privacy. We really loved grilling outback with company, the kids played in the fenced-in front yard, and the living room was so cozy with all the best movies and tv-shows available to us. Cooking was easy with all the pots, utensils, spices and condiments, and I loved listening to music with the provided sound system. We felt at home instantly after arriving and were sad to leave. This will always be our first choice place to stay when visiting Pullman from here on out."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"State street cottage was a lovely place to stay for our travel weary family. The place was extremely clean, and the beds were extremely comfortable! Overall it was the perfect place for what we needed."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and relaxing stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first big trip as a family of four with our infant, so we were a bit nervous about how everything would turn out. Annie and Javad’s place was a highlight of our trip— so peaceful, thoughtfully appointed, and charming. Little details like a few plastic dishes and a fully fenced grass yard made us feel welcome with our young children. There’s also a tot lot nearby. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the cleanest Airbnbs I've ever stayed at which is extremely important to me. Bags of coffee and a nice welcome sign awaited us- just what we needed. The hillside location does pick up noise from the highways below, but with the windows closed it was very quiet."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kitchen was the most well equipped AirB&B we have ever been to. The place was perfectly clean and spotless! Perfectly quite neighborhood. HVAC system was new and the AC appreciated! There can be nothing negative (zero) to say about this place, as it truly was a good find in a small community…..where I would not have high expectations! We did not use the outside BBQ or fire pit with provided wood, but thought this was a nice amenity.
It also would have been very comfortable for two couples or a family, as the bedrooms are separated by the nicely finished bathroom."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at Annie and Javad's place. We come to Pullman often to visit my 106 year old mother-in-law. Staying here feels like home; clean, spacious and comfy. Close to town by car and nice and quiet."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place and love the chocolate!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Simply wonderful and cozy home, located in a quiet spot. This is a tastefully renovated place featuring squeaky clean interiors, and a nice private backyard with fire pit and BBQ grill. Private parking spot in back is a great plus! Highly recommended for a family getaway."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This lovely cottage is spotlessly clean with two queens and a queen sofa bed. Plenty of extra linens and snuggly blankets. Central air for hot days. It is the main floor, 2 bedroom apartment with an apartment below. Plenty of comfy seating for movie night. Lovely fenced yard, gardens and a back yard fire-pit. Free off-street parking. Safe, quiet neighborhood. Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is very clean, well stocked, and charming. The location is easy to find and close to the WSU campus. The hosts were very responsive and the home was spotless. I would absolutely stay here again. The 2 private parking spaces were a nice touch."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Annie and Javad are perfect hosts and their house is welcoming and inviting with everything needed for our stay! We love it!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We like to stay here when we come visit my MIL, living in a retirement home nearby. It is the main floor of a beautifully restored older home. (Sparate apt below.) Spacious, clean, comfy beds and couch. Nice tv set up, too. It is within minutes driving downtown to shops (Bruised Books, used bookstore is one of our favorites) and grocery stores and restaurants. Close to WSU, too. A few miles further is Moscow, ID with some box stores (Target, Old Navy, Rite Aid) and another one of our favorites, TriState (hardware, camping, garden, kitchen, clothing, etc.) Communication with Annie and Javad is great. They are extremely responsive and live right next door. The whole experience couldn't be easier."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed in other Air BNB's that seemed nice but upon arrival wasn't great. The State Street Cottage was as advertised! We loved everything about the place! Annie and her husband were great. The State Street Cottage will be our home away from home when visiting Pullman!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Will definitely book here again. Lovely home, comfortable beds, clean, and close to WSU."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,My family and I came to this Airbnb for one night to celebrate my sister's birthday. We plan on coming here whenever we visit her again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a short stay however upon arriving, having a parking space on the property was awesome, especially when there is snow in the area. Nice room temperature mud room where you could leave your shoes before entering the house and not have them cold when you leave the house.
The house was warm, cozy, with plenty of lighting. Living room was inviting to sit, read, watch tv, play some games or just take a nap.
Bedrooms were spacious, beds with two different feels to the mattress. The bed in the smaller room was firmer then the master room therefore we slept in the smaller room. Built in closet and shelf space, plenty of linens and great pillows.
Bathroom was spacious and nicely country modern style. I really enjoyed the bath products that were provided (and I always bring my own).
We did not use the kitchen much besides for water but it was well stocked with essential items.
All in all this home was wonderful. I will keep it in my favorites for when we visit Pullman again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect. Annie & Javad were so helpful and accommodating. The house is very clean, comfy and we loved the decor and furnishings. Quiet neighborhood and very close to WSU campus. Great place to stay and we would love to come back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were there to attend our grand niece’s graduation ceremony at WSU.
This was conveniently located within 5 minutes of the campus. It was clean and cozy with everything you need for a extended stay. Large living room, full kitchen with separate dining room plus 2 bedrooms. All very clean and nicely appointed. There is only one bathroom, so be prepared to schedule it’s use if there are more than 2 persons in your party."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Annie was very responsive to inquiries. The place was clean and accommodating. There were box fans in the bedrooms, which every listing should have in my opinion. Location was great, close to everything fun to do in town. Only thing missing was a washer and dryer, which I should have double checked the amenities prior if one was going to be needed."

It had everything we needed from the kitchen, to the bathroom and entertainment. The beds were comfortable and the sheets were so silky soft— combined with blackout curtains made for an excellent night of sleep! The yard was so sweet for our girls to play in and get some sunshine. Annie and Javad were amazing hosts- easy to access if we needed them but also gave us our space. We enjoyed chatting with them in the driveway. Our time in Pullman was so special and we are so grateful for the special space we were able to enjoy!"

Netflix, Amazon and Disney were also available.

Annie's communication was impeccable, and this Airbnb is close to everything in Pullman. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay! So darling and close to everything! Love the enclosed heated porch😃. The hosts are amazing too!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great house in a great location. While it was very close to downtown and WSU, it was exceptionally quiet. The house itself is relatively old, but the kitchen and bathroom were updated with modern appliances and fixtures. Annie communicated clearly and promptly, but did not overdo it."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The house was perfect. The furnishings were excellent and everything I would need. If I had any questions they were answered quickly.
I will definitely stay there again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful stay in a beautifully historic home in Pullman. It was clean and lovely, Annie is a great host!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Annie's air bnb felt more like a home than any other air bnb I have stayed at. The layout, the furniture, the decor, and interior design were so beautiful and comforting and we all felt like we were staying in a place we would call home. would highly recommend to anyone! thanks so much"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful home. Very clean, comfortable, and cozy. Great location also. Can’t recommend enough"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hosts are incredible! Home is perfect with a great location, nice views, and nice furnishing. We enjoyed our stay and will be back"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is bright, quiet, and homey, and it is a short walk from downtown, Conservation Park, and Dissmores grocery. It worked perfectly for the three of us while working virtually for a week, and the wifi held up surprisingly well to multiple simultaneous video calls. We had workstations set up in the dining room, bedroom, and living room, and occasionally used the second bedroom when all three of us were in simultaneous meetings."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Annie's place is very comfortable, cozy and convenient. We would definitely stay here again when we're visiting WSU."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a perfectly wonderful home. We were very impressed with how clean it was.
Our beds were very comfortable and we liked how one was soft and one was a bit firmer.
Great location and easy to get to from the heart of Pullman. Being able to have a fire outside in the backyard was a lovely offer. We highly recommend this home!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Looking for a great location to campus….you have found it at this quaint Airbnb…….extremely close to campus, great space for up to 6 people…..nice that there is a full kitchen so if you didn’t want to eat out you could very easily cook!! Annie and Javad were great to work with!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time here and its perfect in every way! The host is so attentive but you have your privacy. If there was a higher rating than 5 I would give it this is the best.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding spot for a visit to Pullman! The house was spotless and comfortable, and a perfect location for visiting campus. We loved sitting out at the fire pit during the evening! We highly recommend staying here."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Darling home. Very clean. Very comfortable.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Best airbnb! We wish all of our airbnb's were like this one. It's spacious, charming, in a fantastic location, and so welcoming. The furniture is truly comfortable (unlike many rentals which look great in the photos but are smaller, cheaper, and not comfortable at all when you get there). Great beds, great bathroom, kitchen, livingroom and diningroom spaces. It's well-appointed with all the amenities we care about, and the house itself has such beautiful architecture and all these fun, original built-in closets and cupboards. I'd live here if I could! The owners are responsive, friendly, and communicative. And this is one of the few airbnb's that's not overpriced. Would DEFINITELY recommend this place."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location in town and cozy cottage. Would certainly stay here if we happen to go through Pullman again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great stay. This home has everything you might need. Great location, very clean and lots of room to cook sit at the dining table or relax in the oversized living room. There’s also a cute fire pit with a bbq and lights. I can see why Annie is a super host. There’s no detail missed. We will definitely be back."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute cottage, well appointed and close to campus and downtown. Just what we needed on a trip to visit colleges but would work well for a longer stay as well."
2021-08-01,4,Group trip,"This location was super easy to find, a great location for visiting the surrounding area, or going onto WSU campus.
It was clean and fully stocked with all the things we needed.
The outside sitting area was nice and a lovely place to hang out."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect in every way! Location was awesome and the interior of the house was well maintained and exactly what I needed. There isn't anything I would change. Annie was a perfect host so much so I booked time to go back in October. I will try to stay here as often as I can when I come to visit my daughter.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is an awesome place! So clean! Plenty of room to just kick back and relax!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wish I could leave a bad review so no one else would book weekends at Annie and Javad's place ;) But I can't. They are wonderful hosts. Extremely welcoming, we feel like part of their family when we stay here. Communications is outstanding. Both of their places are comfortable, safe, very clean. You can tell they take pride in hosting. We'll definitely be back, even once our Coug graduates!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family stayed at the State Street cottage while moving our daughter in to WSU. I chose this particular rental because the Air BnB listing photos were so adorable. In person the cottage is even more charming than in the great photos!
The interior decor and furnishings were so pretty and cozy, and the entire cottage was spotless.
We love our game nights and the large dining room table was a perfect place to gather for board games and endless rounds of War. In the living room the comfy couch, chaise lounge, and big basket of throw blankets made for fabulous movie nights. The bedrooms were stocked with plenty of extra pillows and the bathroom had more than enough towels (they were very fluffy- seriously-what kind of magical fabric softener are they using?)
As an avid home “chef” ( I flatter myself), a well-stocked kitchen is a must-have. Our family loves preparing home-cooked meals, even when traveling. The cottage kitchen had everything we needed. It was amazing how the hosts fit so much into a small-ish space. And the spice rack….so many good things in there. Celery salt! Herbs de Provence! I’m a firm believer that you can tell a lot about people by the spices they keep. Our hosts are clearly exemplary individuals.
We had a few questions for our hosts and they were always kind, helpful and immediately responsive (special thanks for not making us feel like jerks for breaking a wineglass…. and for accidentally signing them up for Disney+ while trying to log in to our own account) Best hosts ever. Hopefully we will be able to stay here again during the next few years while we visit our daughter.
We were quite sad to leave Pullman at the end of our stay. Was it because we were leaving our firstborn at college or because we were leaving the perfect, adorable cottage? Hard to say…"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect place for us to stay while settling a student at WSU into her campus apartment. The location is so convenient. The home is very comfortable and clean. Everything we needed was included. We will definitely stay there again when in Pullman
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The State Street Cottage was a beautiful place to stay while we got our daughter settled in to her new home. The home was immaculate and I had everything I needed to prepare great meals. Annie was quick to respond to any questions I had and we’ll definitely be attempting to stay again!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host were great. She was very attentive and responded very quickly when you a question or problem Very neat, and clean home. Close to campus. Beautiful old home. We loved it. Made our stay to Washington very relaxed."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host and nice place
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,The state street cottage is a lovely place to stay. We were there with our two children and it was very comfortable. The host was a great communicator and quickly responded to all inquires. Check in and check out was a breeze. We would definitely stay again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,We have stayed in many Airbnbs over the years and this is our favorite! We hope to come back soon.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place rocks! Perfect distance from WSU and the downtown area. Gave us tons of opportunities to walk places to eat. Super clean and spacious! Will be come back :)
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Annie's home was perfect for us - it was spacious, spotless, comfortable, and in a great location that made everywhere we wanted to visit on the Palouse super accessible. It was also nice and cool for the hot summer weeks during our visit."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a really great place. The owners have made this house into an Airbnb sanctuary, complete with several personal touches. It’s comfortable, sparkling clean (and I have high standards), and a quaint place to stay on a quiet street. One of the best we’ve rented. We only wish we had more time to enjoy it!
I highly recommend and would stay here again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very comfortable and in a great location for walking downtown and around campus.

Annie was great at communicating, responsive to questions, and had helpful suggestions for our visit. We would definitely want to stay here again anytime we were in the area, and would highly recommend it to other guests!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Annie's State St. Cottage for three nights. It is a wonderful place. It had everything we needed. The house was beautiful and very spacious. It was just the right size for my husband and I plus our daughter and two grandchildren. There is also a nice patio that we did not get a chance to use. We thoroughly enjoyed staying there and would definitely stay there again.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really comfortable place with everything you might need and friendly hosts. The location is great and just a short walk to downtown.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Annie was an amazing host and her home was truly special for our families graduation weekend. The home is perfectly located with great & easy access to everything in Pullman. The furnishings are welcoming and inviting; not one thing missing or needed during our stay. There is no possible way you can go wrong with the home and Annie’s hospitality; our stay was perfect in every way.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Annie's place has it all! Comfort, easy to communicate, cleanliness, nice people and quick responses, everything you need, location! We will be back!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed upstairs and downstairs and highly recommend both places. They are fully equipped for one night or weeklong stays...all the comforts of home. Annie checked in on us to see if we needed anything which we didn't. Great location. Quiet area. Comfortable beds. We were happy to be able to celebrate our anniversay there.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! I really enjoyed staying here! Was comfortable and clean and in a great location in town. Would stay here again and again!
2021-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This is a very clean, nicely set up home in Pullman. If you are looking for an actual downtown location, this is not it, however, I am not sure how many options are available of walking distance of the downtown area. The hosts were great at communicating and having coffee and tea available was a nice touch. If you enjoy a proper tea, brewed with a kettle, you can get it here, such a nice thing to see. The only true downside is that the beds are listed as queens but they are not, they are full/doubles. Not everyone understands the difference so I can understand the mistake, but with 2 men over 6' tall, we definitely felt the the difference and did not sleep well as a result. If a queen/double difference is not a big deal for you, then this would be a great place to stay."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, nicely remodeled older home in convenient location."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sparkling clean! This home was more stylish and felt larger than what we could tell by the pictures. Fantastic instructions from the directions to the functions of the home. We also really appreciated coffee and filters! Hosts were great communicators and had good recommendations. I would highly recommend!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"State St Cottage is welcoming, comfortable and the perfect place to stay to feel like you’re home when you’re away. My family and I enjoyed the use of kitchen to cook our own meals, there was plenty of seating in the living room at night to read and watch movies and the beds were very comfortable."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My favorite place to stay in Pullman!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was exactly as advertised. Very clean cozy, comfortable, and reasonably priced to boot. Felt like home away from home, way better than springing for some chain hotel/motel. I really appreciated the welcome guide full of clear directions/instructions as well as great tips for what to do and where to go around town. Would definitely stay again."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Annie's place. The cottage is spacious and comfortable, and close to everything. Highly recommended!"

2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great little house. So cute and comfy, great location and great hosts."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pictures don’t do it justice. Very cute home, great location and friendly hosts. Loved the extra little touches like coffee snd soaps. Will stay again for sure."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Outstanding- Shelly and Bruce were outstanding. Bunkhouse was amazing.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I have stayed at both locations on Bruce's property. I like both for different reasons.
The Bunkhouse (this review) was more work friendly and had a little separation feeling more like an apartment. Plus you get a little locked in grass area perfect for your pet to wander around. I posted up at the table and felt very comfortable working all day. Plenty of plugs. No washer and dryer and more of kitchenette, but perfect for this stay.
The man cave (cant think of real name) has a lot more entertainment focus and has a bigger tv, a bigger comfy couch, and feels like a place to hang with the boys. Both are awesome. I would highly recommend both!!
Plus the monkey bread!! Its so good!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very clean and comfortable!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow, we've stayed at many Airbnbs and this one is at the top of our list!
It is even better than the photos suggest. Every detail is thought out and made to make one feel invited and comfortable. It's in a gorgoeus setting... very peaceful yet close to town. We enjoyed watching the goats, sheep and lambs play in the field next door. We travel with 2 dogs and appreciated the fully fenced yard - one thing we always look for. The hosts are very friendly and even provide homemade treats and slippers!
I can't say enough about this place...we can't wait to visit again very soon! Thanks Bruce & Susan!
🐾 ♥"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay at Butch’s Bunkhouse. It was cozy, clean, private, and quiet. And the yummy baked goods were so delicious! We will definitely be back. Thank you!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful hosts and charming cottage! The bunkhouse was tastefully decorated with a rustic western vibe, super clean, every amenity you could need and very dog friendly. Very private and peaceful. We will be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Bruce and Sue are the perfect hoss.. they think of every little detail and are very proactive, and allowing for our privacy in every way as well. they have wonderful accommodations that are very WSU friendly! Our dog, Luna, loved their fenced yard too!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our only disappointment was not finding this amazing place years ago!! Our son and daughter in law just graduated from WSU which is why we were in the area. Had we come across Bruce’s place when they started college this would’ve been our only go to place in Pullman! Bruce and Sue are phenomenal hosts. They literally have thought of everything to make it a perfect stay in the Palouse! Our youngest son is a high school freshman, if he ends up a Coug we’ll be spending our time visiting at Bruce’s place again! The sleep number bed, once we figured it out was super comfy, the slippers, snacks, coffee bar and OH the MONKEY BREAD!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Most excellent stay with Bruce and Sue as usual! We just love the Bunkhouse, and they truly go above and beyond with hospitality. Every possible amenity you could think to need, the fenced yard is great for the dogs, and we just love it. Can't wait to be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,A true home away from home. An extremely clean and cute place with every amenity you could think of. The best Airbnb Pullman has to offer. The host is responsive and kind. We would love to stay here every time we come and will highly recommend it.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Bruce and Susan are kind and responsive. We had a very peaceful sojourn at their cute and comfortable bunkhouse. Although the bunkhouse is located next to the main house, it is actually very private and quiet. The fenced yard was wonderful for our dog, and I loved the various sitting areas outside so that I could seek sun or shade depending on the time of day. At the end of a little culdesac with only fields behind and nestled in the trees, this was perfect for us! Clean and all the amenities one needs! We really enjoyed our stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying with Bruce and Sue. They are always such a pleasure to stay with.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Yet another GREAT(!) stay and experience at the Bunkhouse.
Bruce and Susan are the definition of Hosts. This place is peaceful, cute and offers a restful space with rejuvenation at the ready.
...not forgetting the delicious baked goods...mmm, monkey bread.
Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I've stayed at many AirBnBs over the years, and I don't know if any have topped Bruce & Sue's hospitality. The space is pristine, every amenity imaginable is available to you, and no corners have been cut - the bed is Sleep Number! From that to the fresh baked goods upon arrival, you're truly pampered here. The fenced in yard was great for the dogs, and sitting out on the porch is so peaceful. A short drive from downtown Pullman and campus, it's a great location - if you need a ride to town, the game, etc., I recommend College Cabs. Thank you and can't wait to be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I'm a return customer and as always Three Forks is amazing. The location is beautiful, and the accommodations are outstanding. Highly recommended."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay. The owners were so kind. They made bread, ice cream, and huge warm chocolate chip cookie for us."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best time at Bruce and Susan’s place, it was the perfect fit for us during our short trip to Pullman. The bunkhouse was amazing, it was beautiful, clean, and everything was well organized. The hosts, Bruce and Susan were kind and lovely, we were greeted with monkey bread and later with ice cream, which was so delicious! We could not have asked for a better place to stay, we look forward to staying again and would 100% recommend to everyone!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great accommodations with plenty of thoughtful extras to make the stay very comfortable!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Four adults and a dog stayed in the bunkhouse. We really enjoyed our stay. The bunkhouse was cute and very comfortable. It was lovely and quiet, felt like we were out in the country, yet a short drive to Pullman or Moscow. Bruce made us delicious treats and was very responsive to texts. Would definitely stay there again. And don’t miss the “big chair” that looks over the Palouse."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The Garage was fantastic! The setting with the Palouse in the background and furnishing in the room was beautiful. My family thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we are looking forward to visiting again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Bruce and Sue were so sweet and kind. They were helpful and responded to questions very quickly. We were invited out for s’mores, which our kiddo loved! Will be returning when we go to the Pullman area!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were very pleased with our stay at Bruce’s bunkhouse. The place was very well setup and accommodating for our stay. It is close to town but quiet and peaceful. The host was very easy to work with and went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. We hope to stay again when we go back to visit our daughter at WSU. We would absolutely recommend this place to anyone.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An adorable, clean, comfortable, place in Pullman with homemade monkey bread and homemade ice cream? On a farm? Yes please! We will definitely return to stay here when we visit our son at WSU. The owners are so nice and communicating was easy."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bruce and Susan were wonderful hosts. I was welcomed with warm Monkey bread that was delicious! I loved all the attention to details that were taken in creating this one of a kind home. As an WSU alumni I appreciated all of the crimson and gray within the unit. GO COUGS! I would definitely recommend their home!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really cute little bunk house on the edge of paradise. It is on the edge of town but felt very safe nestled in next to other houses. Amazing Monkey bread and our first (but not last) exposure to peanut and jelly ice cream. Bruce was very flexible and nice but also provided a feeling of privacy.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved Bruce's bunkhouse. It was perfect for our visit to WSU and to celebrate our son's birthday! The host was over the top friendly and even made monkey bread for us upon our arrival. Nice fenced yard for our dog too. Great place to stay. Excellent communication. We'll be back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin was extremely helpful and kind during the booking and stay. It is a lovely, bright, home."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy walking distance from downtown restaurants and shops and easy access to campus."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This unit was a perfect fit for our recent two week stay. This was our first time staying in Erin's unit and she was a great communicator and extremely responsive; when we ran into a very minor problem and contacted her, she resolved it within an hour by coming to the unit personally. The one slight drawback is that the refrigerator is small for an extended stay or if you have more than a couple of people staying in the unit, but we were able to pretty easily work around it. The unit is very cozy and there were plenty of linens and other supplies to make the stay that much nicer. The bed and pillows were really comfortable. There is a washer/dryer in the unit and a private entrance with easy access. It was easy to get to and private enough that we weren't bothered by traffic or noise. We will definitely consider staying here again. Thank you Erin!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute house it was perfect for my husband and I…close to Walmart and only 10 minutes to U of I
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Erin and team have been fantastic. Great communication and really nice place.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Perfect location for dropping off our daughter at WSU. The bedroom and pullout bed in the living room worked great. The kitchen and bathroom was very clean when we arrived. We had no problems with the other renters upstairs.
Definitely would recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay. Excellent host!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Great space. Great stay. Thanks!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Erin was a great host. Very available to our needs but at the same time gave us the privacy to relax and enjoy the space. Great host!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I liked it !
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I recommend Erin's place.
Pros: The interior was immaculate, and the furnishings were thoughtful and well put together. The kitchen was exactly as pictured. Proximity to downtown and WSU was perfect for our needs. There is plenty of space for a family of 4. Blackout curtains were very helpful as the unit faced the sunrise. We were very comfortable and enjoyed this cheerful, little unit. I'm looking forward to visiting again.
FYI: Exterior entrance to unit needs some TLC. All the doors were difficult to open and close, so expect to wrestle as they are out of frame. The unit is next to a garage, converted lower level unit. No one was renting the above unit at the time, so I can not comment on noise. Windows are in need of a solid cleaning but did provide views of WSU."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely lovely place. Very clean qmd comfortable. Erin wqs extremely helpful every step of the way. Would definitely stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at this cute hideaway — gorgeous view over campus and easy walk downtown. Very comfy chairs and the bed was super nice!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a lovely place. We enjoyed our visit.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and exactly as pictured. Place was furnished with everything we needed. Nice touch with coffee, creamer, sugar, bathroom essentials. No complaints about the comfort or cleanliness. There is only one negative thing I can really say, and I feel bad about saying it because the host really couldn’t do anything about it. We stayed in the downstairs unit, and there were also guests in the upstairs unit. I guess this is a little bit of an older house and therefore the floors were very squeaky. We could hear everything that was happening upstairs, every footstep, every door close, every burst of laughter. In addition, the stairway that leads to the upstairs door was on the other side of the wall from the headboard of our bed so sleeping in was never doable. If there had not been upstairs neighbors, this would have been a perfect stay. The noise did not ruin it for us, just made it hard to sleep at times. Everything else was amazing and would highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful view of the campus. Location was ideal for getting to campus or downtown. Street is quiet. Downstairs apartment is roomy with lots of sunshine. Kitchen is quite nice. Age of house easiest seen in the bathroom but very clean.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. The kitchen/living area is especially nice. We plan to stay again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice converted daylight basement unit with good space. Was a great space to stay for our weekend. Host was extremely helpful and communicated things well. We like trying new places but would return again if available.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 the best AirBnB experience I’ve ever had. Everything looked exactly as listed and described! So private & home-y!! And whatever issues or questions we had, Erin & Kristy were beyond great & responsive! Definitely would come back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Easy check-in.
Erin is proactive to email out instructions before the arrival day, and I appreciate the clear instructions on the wall.
Open space with nice kitchen."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"SUCH A STEAL! We looked directly at WSU campus. It snowed both days and watching it fall over my unobstructed view of campus was like a movie. Quiet neighborhood with ample parking and a plow kept the roads completely clear. This is the downstairs unit of a duplex and had out own entrance, parking and privacy.
Erin was the sweetest and always responsive. Never made me feel like a bother. We came in out of the snow to a warm, clean, fresh smelling home. It looked even more spacious than the photos.
We forfeited the sleeping sofa (no sleeping sofa is comfy for an adult) and just slept on the couch. It's big, fluffy and had plenty of blanket and pillows. My workmate took the bed in the room. very clean and clutter free. Black out curtains and the nightstands had built in charging.
Kitchen: Was stocked with so much supplies. It's a midsize fridge/freezer but we were only there a couple of nights so it worked fine for us. TONS of door dash options within 20 minutes delivery. 10/10"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cannot say enough!!
Fabulous place, much bigger than I thought! Beautiful view and owner very friendly and welcoming. No issues! You won’t be disappointed with this place!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This unit was just perfect for our weekend getaway. It was extremely tidy, cozy, and centrally located. We loved all the decorative touches and WSU memorabilia - very thoughtful design. Great natural light coming through the windows during the day. The space suited our family well and we easily hosted breakfast there in the mornings. Well stocked kitchen. Overall a great find for when we make our visits to Pullman."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Campus View is a great spot for visiting Pullman and the WSU campus! Historical photos of WSU and the area weee a great touch for a modern mid century home! We will be back !
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were up for WSU parents weekend and it was great the space it right next to campus so very easy to get around from.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, clean, convenient to everything in Pullman. Sweet photos of WSU through history around the house. Great place to stay for visiting family members. Go Cougs."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for a visit to WSU. Beautiful and bright views, and totally comfortable for four or so people. Felt safe and secure here! Close to the “downtown” amenities."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfectly peaceful! Wonderful place for our family to go for a celebration weekend. Highly recommend
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely time for my daughters graduation! The home provided a relaxing place to come back to after all the festivities on Campus.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing views, beautiful home, so peaceful and relaxing, super friendly, helpful and accommodating Host, lots of room in the big yard for the kids to play, lots of room in the house as well for the whole family to relax. Kitchen is beautiful and open views to enjoy the surrounding nature, cute friendly neighborhood cats were a bonus."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,My family and I couldn’t have loved it more. Matched the pictures exactly. Can’t wait to go back.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Stayed with Garth and Christi for 3 nights with a group of 4 couples. From check-in to check-out our experience was perfect. The home located just outside of town, seemed like another world in a beautiful peaceful setting. Yet so close and just minutes to town and WSU for our activities.
Garth and Christi provided clear information for our stay. They have thought of all the little details for their guests, from the welcome snack gift basket....to the extra amenities in the bathrooms. The kitchen is large and well stocked with all supplies needed to prepare meals for our group. The accommodations were very comfortable, clean and simple. Its was nice to come back to such comforts after a busy day.
This was truly a hidden gem in Pullman/Palouse. Garth and Christi were very welcoming and quick to reply to our requests. All in our group had a such a great experience. We will definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We booked for a Montana State vs. Idaho football game with friends. It beat all expectations. It was fully loaded with anything you need to assist in cooking at home, beautiful views and rooms, the kitchen was a dream. We couldn't have felt more at home and everything was laid out perfect for a quick weekend getaway. Highly recommend anyone to stay here. Close to Pullman and Moscow."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We had an amazing weekend on the Palouse. Garth and Christi’s home is perfect in every way starting with the location and the breathtaking views (the walking trails were an added bonus). Step inside the home, and it takes your breath away, it is just beautiful. The home was spotless, spacious, beautifully decorated, comfortable, and well appointed. Garth and Christi’s attention to detail is simply unmatched. This was hands down one of the best rentals we have ever stayed in, making it an unforgettable WSU Homecoming. We highly recommend this house to anyone looking to stay in a beautiful, well-appointed home close to campus yet just far enough away to provide peace and tranquility within the majestic rolling hills of the Palouse."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is unreal!! We had a great experience overall
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Really beautiful, quiet home just a few minutes outside of Pullman with stunning views of the Palouse, particularly of the morning sunrise. Beautifully designed kitchen and common area, with four generous bedrooms, one on the main floor and three downstairs. The back patio was great for dinner.
This is the perfect Pullman/Palouse home for a football weekend or any other visit to this beautiful part of the state. And it comes with a really responsive host in Garth.
Look no further...."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome - great host and loved the place. Thanks!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had this place for 3 weeks for work in Pullman, and it truly was the best accommodations for our crew to be away from home for that many weeks at a time. Everything about this place is well thought out to make you feel comfortable and relaxed with the amazing view and quiet, peaceful outdoors. It was very clean and well stocked and has everything that you could want in the kitchen. A luxury home that Garth is sharing with others to enjoy while in town."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I have experienced MANY airbandb properties over the years. However, THIS property was of the highest level. Gorgeous country views, immaculate, high end everything! The kitchen was high tech, fully furnished and expansive. We spent much of our time enjoying the two outdoor spaces. The owners of this property haven taken care to provide everything you could possibly need as you travel away from home. Our U of I graduation weekend was phenomenal as we celebrated our grad in this gorgeous home. We give the highest recommendation of this property. Worth every cent."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,As much as I don’t want anyone to know about this home I feel that it’s fair to Garth and his wife that I am honest. This place is well worth the money. It’s just a few miles from Pullman and sits off the highway in the rolling farm hills. The views are tremendous and the house is a Gem. There is nothing like this in Pullman and I would buy it if they would sell it. It’s Truly that amazing. It’s a brick farmhouse updated inside to look middle age modern. Imagine driving through the farmlands and you look off in the distance and see a beautiful farmhouse sitting off by itself in the distance. That’s what this place is!!! And just a few miles from town. It’s really that nice and very very clean. We are in love with it! PS I am not a friend or family member just writing this for them. Rent it and you will see! Worth every Penny!!! Troy C.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was spectacular and peaceful with the amazing surrounding hills of the Palouse. The house was perfect for our family of 6 celebrating our son's graduation from WSU. Close to town, easy off the highway. The bedrooms, bathrooms and the amazing kitchen were perfect. All amenities described in the rental description and more. Thanks to all the special touches from the owners, Garth & Christi. Highly recommended. GO COUGS! Stace & Diana"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the nicest, most well thought out, most beautiful Airbnb I have ever stayed at! It is secluded, but not far outside of Pullman. The property is beautiful. The house is spacious, comfortable, and has anything you could need while you stay. Every detail has been though about! We will stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is beautiful! The kitchen is absolutely incredible, the bedrooms were extremely comfortable, heated bathroom floors, tons of space if you have a large group with large open floor plan.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a perfect place to stay! Every little detail is so well thought out. The property and home were stunning and so close to Martian Stadium.

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"What a beautiful home. Garth's home is the perfect location combination - surrounded by the unique landscape of The Palouse's rolling hills, golden hills, and pretty sunrises/sunsets while being a stone's throw to WSU/Pullman. As for the home, it brings together the charm of a mid century architecture while having all the modern conveniences one needs. The multiple outdoor areas are very relaxing for a bbq or watching the kids run around the expansive, well cared for lawn. Inside, the main floor has an abundance of large windows reminding you of the unique beauty of The Palouse. The modern, spacious kitchen will give you endless ideas on how you want to upgrade your own kitchen. The downstairs has a fantastic entertaining room for watching movies, playing games, or just relaxing. Each bedroom was well appointed and beds were comfortable. You cannot go wrong with a stay at this beautiful home."

The kitchen was well-stocked with dishes and cooking tools and we felt very at home and comfortable there. THE BEDS - ahhhh so good!! Really terrific beds and great pillows, silky smooth linens, and fluffy bathroom towels. Great neighborhood close to nearby restaurants (it's Pullman, it's pretty close to everything!) and when we accidentally got locked out, Nathan immediately answered and got us back inside. There are views of those beautiful rolling Palouse hills outside the windows, and lots of lovely birds to watch and listen to in the little courtyard. So peaceful and comfortable!! A great find, we would definitely return and stay here again!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"As former Pullman residents, it was great to find this lovely Airbnb located on Military Hill that was just one mile from our family. We appreciated having flexibility knowing that Annie and Javad provided a cancellation policy that permitted us to cancel close to the reserved dates, especially when we know that March weather can change plans.
From the moment we walked into this one-bedroom, one-bathroom unit, we felt like it would be a pleasant stay. The home was impeccably clean and nicely appointed. Our sleeps were sound thanks to a great mattress and room darkening shades! Having ample windows for natural light in this lower level apartment was wonderful. We began each day with morning coffee with the Keurig and K-cups that Annie and Javad provided.
We highly recommend State Street Cottage. We look forward to future stays!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In the past we have stayed in the upper unit of this air bnb. This one has all the amenities of that one (super clean and nice kitchen and bathroom, comfy bed and couch, streaming tv and dvd player.) It is cozier as the ceilings are lower (you will have to duck momentarily under the bedroom doorway if you are 6 ft tall or over) and it just has one bedroom but it suited us just perfect for our Christmas stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Annie's place before and it's always just perfect. This time was no different. Annie was accommodating, flexible, and friendly. My daughter stayed there as she was moving out of her apartment and coming home after graduation. Thank you, Annie, for providing such a wonderful place to stay at in Pullman. Go Cougs!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We’ve stayed at Annie’s several times and we keep coming back. It’s a great deal and has everything we need for a weekend stay. Plus the bathroom and kitchen are really clean and inviting!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Annie is a host that reflects professionalism and kindness. The apartment was private, squeaky clean and demonstrated an overall pride in ownership. What I like about Annie most is her spot on communication and how much she cares about both her guests. Thank you Annie!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Annie's place was great for a one-night stay while we visited for business at the university. The space is cozy and close to the school. The bed was comfortable (a good medium between firm and soft) with plenty of blankets and pillows provided.
We didn't use the kitchen much, but having the fridge and coffee was great for an early start and late night with leftovers.
We went to Moscow, ID for most meals (Pullman is small and we weren't a fan of the restaurant that our colleagues/the internet recommended), which is a quick drive from Annie's place.
There were some people upstairs during our stay who we heard walking around, but it wasn't bothersome to us at all.
The shower had nice pressure and temperature (to note for fellow tall people - the showerhead is less than 5'10""). The whole place was nice and clean.
The outdoor sitting area was a great place to have a cup of morning coffee and the lights were lovely at night!
Thank you for having us, Annie!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Annie provided a notebook that contained all the infomation anyone would need. A first class operation. Highly recommended.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the model of what an Airbnb should be. Spacious, private, well stocked kitchen, nice towels, good shower pressure, clean. The only thing would be nicer was if they had cable or youtubetv , but that’s rapidly becoming the new normal. Just watched Netflix. Felt lucky to find this place"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Annie’s place was a wonderful place for us during our hectic move. Very clean, calm, and relaxing!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little hideaway downstairs cottage is well worth my trip. I had the privacy and amenities I prefer when I stay out of town. The access in and out was easy, Annie checked on me to make sure I had everything I needed, it was great. I highly recommend!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a nicely decorated place to stay for a couple of days. The kitchen was great with nice equipment and there was coffee creamer and sugar as well as pods.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I really liked the location and how Annie had the place fixed up. We were only there 1 night but if we were going to stay longer they had everything you would. I would recommend this place if you are visiting Pullman.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"State street cottage was a spacious, charming, private and quiet place to stay. It was local to everything. The description was advertised accurately.

I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend State street cottage."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Annie's place was very cozy in a beautiful town. I wish we could have stayed longer!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying here and it was so great to return and enjoy this sweet little cottage!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The time and effort put into maintaining this AirBnB is very evident--well decorated, very clean, and detailed instructions for making the most of one's stay. I'll also add that it is within walking distance of great restaurants, bars/a brewery, shopping, and the creek/stream. Lastly, the hosts are responsive and will go the extra mile to make sure things go smoothly."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Annie’s place was great in every way!
We will definitely stay again sometime if they will have us :)"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Clean and comfortable space with parking. I would recommend having a car in the winter weather as town is a bit of a walk and roads get slick. Once the new grocery store opens down the hill a car wont really be necessary esp in nice weather as grocery, laundry and restaurants are close. The kitchen has most everything you need. The bathroom has a great tub and shower. The bed is comfortable. This was not my first time here and I would come again."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I really loved this air bnb! It was super cute and very comfortable. Even though it’s a duplex it was quiet and felt very private. We’ll definitely be going back, it’s really a steal!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Pullman to watch WSU Volleyball. Annie's place was spotless and the perfect size! The place looks just like the pictures. There is a very close, off street parking spot with easy access to the private entrance. The keypad entry was a breeze using the messaged instructions we received a couple of days before the trip. This is a basement apartment and has people upstairs. We could hear footsteps every now and then but were not bothered by this at all. There are heaters in each room so its easy to stay toasty warm during cold winter months. The private patio is very cute . . . I wish we could have used it but the weather was too cold. We'll definitely be back! Go Cougs!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy and convenient space to work at during the week while we had an appointment for our dog at WSU’s vet medicine school.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The location was great - close to trails, WSU and downtown. Accurate description, very clean, and a cozy place to stay. Although on a somewhat busy street, it was fairly quiet, and I got a great night's sleep. I noticed it is on the busline, which would have been handy, if needed. The patio is charming and private for sitting outside. Really enjoyed my stay. Annie was really prompt with communication also."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A charming flat for visiting Pullman and the Palouse. Everything was super clean and comfortable. We highly recommend Annie’s pad.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I always love staying at Annie’s! She responds to inquiries quickly and is always happy to help. Clean, quiet home with a great yard for dogs! It’s a little hard to see when backing out of the driveway onto the main road, so head checking is a must!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, Great location,"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay from the minute we arrived. The cottage was clean and cozy and had a charming little fenced-in courtyard where we could relax and enjoy the great weather we had during our stay. The location was great for going back and forth to the WSU campus.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay! Very easy to find and very clean. We were mostly out and about and used the Airbnb as a place to lay our heads in the evening, but we really enjoyed how close it was to WSU. We also enjoyed having the kitchen for our morning coffee. I would definitely recommend this place and look to stay again when we were back in the area."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This bnb was super cozy and clean. The kitchen was stocked up with things like dishes and cookware. The hosts were super quick responders, nice, and accommodating. Part of the ceiling was tall enough for me (5'5) but too short for my partner (6'1). It is easy to bang your head into, so that's something to be aware of when booking as a taller person. Thanks again for hosting us!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"welcoming comfortable place to stay easy to access, really clean and comfortable bed."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a lovely spot. Very cozy!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had an absolutely perfect stay! The instructions to find the location were easy to follow and everything was clean and comfortable.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I would stay again. Home away from home.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fabulous and so close it it all.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is the perfect size and very well kept. The bed was comfortable and the bedding smelled freshly laundered.
For any remote workers, the Wi-Fi was strong in bothe the bedroom and the living room.
The kitchen is stocked with whatever you need to make a meal. I make my dog his food every morning and I had everything I need to boil, drain, mix, cut etc.
There’s plenty of TV apps to choose from and with the strong Wi-Fi , video can be easily streamed from whatever device you brought with you.
The AC works very well an d there’s a box fan in the bedroom, if you just need the air to circulate.
The outside space looks so nice with the outside lighting at night.
I was able to walk my dog anytime of day. In the mornings, we walked down to the trail and the afternoon to a little park (nice circle - walk to the stop sign, make a right- it’s on the left side walk to the back and that back road spits out to the driveway ).
Everything is within a 3mi radius, so perfect for Coug parents or football fans. #gocougs🏈
I would stay here anytime I need to visit Pullman!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything remains lovely with this place. It is a prime location- well cared for- the bedding smells so good — it has awesome blinds to enjoy the sun or keep it out, sturdy furniture and all amenities a traveler could need. If there is something else needed, the very kind owners check-in regularly to help where they can. 10/10 ⭐️"

We loved having A/C as it’s hot in Pullman in August. The bed is comfortable. We had fast Wi-Fi, TV with Netflix, etc., windows to the garden out front. There is a private courtyard with patio furniture which was nice to sit out in and have breakfast each morning.
We had busy days getting our daughter settled into her apartment at WSU and the enjoyable quiet and calm of the cottage was appreciated in the evenings/nights.
Thank you to our hosts! We will be back for sure."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sparkling clean, warm welcome with treats, any temperature control option you could want. This place was a cozy night for me with a desk I needed for work but would be very comfortable for an extended stay with spacious rooms. The perfect AirBnB. Highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay! It was the perfect size for my husband and I. The details in decor created a quaint feeling. The apartment was a couple of blocks from a park and just a few blocks from main street. Perfect location!

2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay in this cozy little apartment. The bed is very comfortable (that’s important!) and the towels were very soft and plush. We enjoyed the patio area, the TV-watching choices, using Alexa to play Amazon music selections and the functional kitchen. It’s nice that coffee, sugar, and even real creamer are provided. Annie is a good communicator, ensuring we were all set.
We ate dinners at places Annie recommended (Porchlight Pizza; South Fork Pub) and enjoyed both!
Being an older house, we could hear the guys upstairs above us sometimes (unavoidable), but it wasn’t an issue for us and they were great about respecting the “quiet hours.” We’d be happy to stay here if in Pullman again. It’d be great for those coming over for a football game. Go Cougs!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"A ""gem"" hidden in Pullman!!! True description ! Good size living room. Kitchen is fully loaded and ready to go!!! Bed is super comfortable.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My second stay at the cottage and still the most perfect place. It’s cozy and it’s homey and it’s well located to everything in Pullman and WSU. I’m sad that my son has graduated and our visits here will be fewer. But Annie’s place is always ideal if you’re coming to Pullman.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay when visiting WSU. Quiet, convenient location. Very thoughtful & comfortable touches throughout the home. Would happily stay again!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, super clean and great communication!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a lovely cottage! It was cozy and quiet, and having access to a yard for my dog was fantastic. The bed was very comfortable (great for bad backs!). As advertised, the place is better suited to people < 5'10"" as the door frame, shower head, and bathroom mirror are a bit low. And if you have a wide vehicle, parking is tricky. Communication and check-in were outstanding. Highly recommend!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice clean comfortable place to stay we will be back for sure
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super place to stay while in Pullman ... pretty much centrally located to great places to eat, short walk to a supermarket ... as well as the WSU campus.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a cozy, clean and quiet property located near downtown with great parking. Even with snow, my entryway was shoveled before I awoke. Thoughtfully furnished for my every need and spotlessly cleaned. Lovely hosts who communicate well and quickly."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Annie was an ideal host. Her Airbnb was comfortable, clean, and we felt right at home. Can't wait to come back - highly recommend!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, warm cozy, just like home. Natural light in every room. It was just like shown in the pictures and it was spotlessly clean. The kitchen is well curated if you want to cook. You can easily walk to Dissmores, the local grocery store. And the bus stop is right out in front! Annie was very attentive, even though we did not want for a thing. The check-in and check out was hassle free. I definitely look forward to staying here again. Once you have experienced this you will never be content with a dreary hotel room."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Annie and Javad were wonderful hosts and they have thought of everything. The cottage was clean, comfortable, and convenient--the perfect place for my stay in Pullman!"
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect location for WSU Stadium and campus, a quick 3-4 minute drive to the parking lot of the Stadium. The apartment was clean and VERY comfortable - but as the hosts state in the listing, and I'm reiterating, if you are over about 5' 9"" I would not recommend this place, as the ceilings are VERY low and door jams are even lower and there is a slight step up into the bedroom area, making the door jam even lower than the kitchen.
Great little bright basement walk-out apartment with everything you need for a relaxing place to land, and a cute private paved patio to enjoy too. A bit tricky to find in the dark the first time, but after you know how to find the narrow side driveway to the apartment, it's super easy thereafter! It doesn't appear there is street parking and be mindful there is only one parking place for this apartment.
I would not hesitate to say here again. Thanks Annie!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Romantic. Clean. I felt like I was staying at a friends! Very homey.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is wonderful and charming! It was spotlessly clean and exactly as described in the listing. I felt immediately at home and had everything I needed for my stay, including food, coffee, and a lovely trail within easy distance. Annie and Javad were rapid and clear communicators - the entire experience was easy and seamless. I can't say enough good things!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Annie is one of the BEST hosts we have encountered. Why?
1. She is very thoughtful and has added all of the touches that you would need. She is a great example of EXCELLENCE in a host.
2. She provides 5-star service, but still gives great value and doesn't gouge you with cleaning fees, (unlike other hosts that charge cleaning fees and want you to do half of the cleaning) etc.
3. She is very responsive to any questions.
4. Everything is labeled clearly and the cottage is modern and well taken care of.
Airbnb should probably hire Annie to train other hosts on how to run a great operation. She is that good!
Wish I could give 7 out of 5 stars!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay here. The place was very centrally located, super clean, and had the amenities we needed for the night. Annie is a great host and communicated all the necessary details ahead of time which made checking in easy!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This cottage is just as described. We found it to be a comfortable and very charming space for the two of us. But with the sofa bed, I can imagine it being cozy for two couples or a couple with small children. We enjoyed taking advantage of the private, fenced in courtyard in the evening. And our little dog liked it too! The cottage is in a good location, close to downtown Pullman and WSU, but in a neighborhood, so there is enough separation from both. We will definitely look to stay here again the next time we visit the area!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The cottage is lovely. We had a wonderful stay! Thank you for your hospitality!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best place we ever stayed at in Pullman! Great location, very clean and comfortable, well equipped kitchen and nice outdoor patio. Will definitely stay here again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing! I’ve stayed in many places and this one will definitely be one I’ll return to. Absolutely perfect,"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was wonderful. It’s clear there is a lot of love and effort into hosting the space! Very cute decor and very clean. If you are booking with an animal however, know that pets shouldn’t be left alone without you there. ( it states in a book upon arrival)
Wonderful air bnb however be weary if you are 5.9 or higher. My boyfriend, being 6 feet had to duck under the door frame to the bedroom… ( but that’s a little sacrifice to make to stay at a cute space like this :) )"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything is great at Annie’s place. Highly recommended!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a very pleasant stay! The space was very clean, peacefully minimalist, but included thoughtful amenities like tea, coffee, books and several streaming options. Online pictures are accurate to the experience. We stayed in summer and it was quiet. Nice to have reserved, off street parking! Annie was friendly and quick to answer any questions we messaged about. We’d definitely stay again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Annie and Javad are great hosts. The place is placed close to downtown Pullman and is good for travelers with kids. The kitchen has everything you need and bedding is plentiful. Recommended!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There is so much to love about this cozy cottage! Location is ideal and the cottage has everything you could possibly want for a short or a long-term stay. We enjoyed the living room and Netflix in the evening and had meals on the patio. There is lots of room to spread out in the living and sleeping areas and the kitchen has everything you could want to cook at home. The Palouse is one of the most scenic areas have ever been and we enjoyed hiking and exploring. There is a thriving restaurants scene in Pullman, even post pandemic, and we had some great meals. Highly recommend Pullman and State Street Cottage."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely place - just as described and close to downtown and the trail - loved it. Good mattress and shower!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot. Love the blackout curtains in the bedroom. Stays cool in the whole apartment even without ac. Hosts were great about communication. Would definitely stay again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Annie’s house is amazing! Great amenities, really nice location, and beautifully decorated. If you or someone accompanying you is on the taller side, keep in mind that the doorframe to the bedroom is a bit short, but overall the house is lovely, a very serene getaway :)"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is really perfect. It’s a 1 bedroom apartment. Kind of a basement but not fully below the ground. Bathroom is really nice, bed is comfortable, has a bunch of streaming options, WiFi works great, coffee bar, really everything was great.
Doesn’t smell like other peoples animals, like some air bnbs do that allow pets. 5 minutes to the WSU vet hospital and right near everything that’s fun to do. Walkable if you like hills, but we went in June and we’re able to find parking easily.
It does have a low doorway but my husband is 6’1 and was fine with it."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely one bedroom in Washington. Super cozy and clean. I definitely think this is a great place to stay for short trips for sure!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect base for exploring the Palouse and very convenient to anything in Pullman or Moscow. Would definitely stay again.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean, comfortable and inviting. The patio was a great addition, it helped us enjoy the spring weather in Pullman.
We would definitely stay again"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Still my absolute favorite place to stay in Pullman!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little spot - we stayed there twice while visiting ou daughter at WSU!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot recommend this space more! It has everything you could need, and lots of personal touches to make it feel like a home. The porch is really cute, too! Annie & Javad were quick to respond, and it was obvious that they wanted a great stay for their guests. Will definitely recommend to friends/family that are in town to visit."
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable space. Host is very attentive. This unit is the lower unit so when there are renters above it is noisy for the bedroom."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an adorable place to stay within walking distance of many fun places to eat. Spotlessly clean with a cute relaxing outdoor patio. Easy parking and check in. Loved my visit!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great little place, perfect for a weekend away! My very tall (6’3) husband hit his head on the bedroom door frame a few times but other than that, our stay was perfect. The bed was particularly comfy and we loved the homemade touches everywhere."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a nice, cozy spot close to WSU and great hosts!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You can't go wrong staying at the State Street Cottage. The space is comfy and beautifully appointed. Annie and Javad are wonderful hosts and very responsive. We had a wonderful time there and will return.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it so much we came back for another stay. The State Street Cottage is conveniently located with everything you need. It’s the perfect place to stay in Pullman.

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, very clean and will return again when back in Pullman."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay when visiting Pullman.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would very much recommend this apartment if you are planning a stay in Pullman, especially if you are ""vertically challenged""- I am 5'4"" and didn't even notice the low doorway that is mentioned in the host's description. The kitchen is well-appointed, the bed is comfortable and I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. Looking forward to visiting again!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The State Street Cottage is perfectly charming. It was just the right space my daughter and I needed for a quick weekend visit. We both agreed we could easily live there full time.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Austin’s place was great and his hosting skills are even better! 10/10 would stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place! It was so peaceful and clean. We felt right at home the moment we walked in.

The neighborhood seemed very safe and family friendly. We would definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love staying here! Large living space and stocked kitchen which was great for hosting a luncheon. Lots of comfortable seating in the living room. Nice comfortable bed which felt like heaven after the long graduation and moving days we had. There was a pull out sofa, but we didn’t use it. Lots of extra towels if you need them. Overall, I would stay here again anytime!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Austin and Lindsey were very welcoming and responsive hosts. The place was clean and perfectly appointed for our stay. Easy access to parking and in the center of town, so close to everything in Pullman. Highly recommended!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's a 10 out of 10. The amenities, the esthetic, and the neighborhood were all wonderful. It's exactly as you see it in the pictures. Plus, Austin was very helpful and quick with communication. I would definitely recommend this place!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay while visiting our son at WSU. Location was great and located close to everything in Pullman. The space was excellent. One thing to note beyond the ADA comment in the unit description is that if guests have any mobility concerns, the path to the door of the unit is along a mildly sloped grass area or steps, depending how you navigate to the door around the back of the house. This might be a challenge for some who have difficulty walking on uneven ground during winter/wet weather."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great experience here. The area was super convenient, the space was very clean and cozy, and the price was a great deal. Would recommend to others!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far one of my favorite places to stay in Pullman thus far. Super clean, comfy living room, free of clutter, and great location. Loved it."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"So friendly and accommodating, nice quiet neighborhood. Very clean and comfortable. Very at home feeling. Would definitely stay with them again. And refer them to others."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Austin's place was just as beautiful in person as it was in the photos. He was very prompt and responsive to my many messages! I learned that I need way more layers of clothing in the PNW than in AZ! Austin was very helpful with adjusting the heat settings for us! There's even a working fireplace in the unit - that I absolutely loved! I would definitely stay at Austin's place again!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We loved being so close to campus.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed it!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10 would stay here again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,needed a place to stay while visiting WSU and this place was perfect. For some reason it has been a long time since i had been in a recliner chair and almost instantly fell asleep when I sat down 🤣
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Austin’s place was perfect for our weekend visit for a football game in nearby Moscow, ID. It was very clean and comfortable and had everything we needed. Austin was a fabulous host and very quick to respond to questions, although we had very few since his instructions were so clear and concise. Checkin and checkout were an absolute breeze. And although this was a basement apartment in Austin’s home, it was private and surprisingly quiet! If we ever return to the area, we will definitely stay again. Thanks so much Austin! Go Griz!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another perfect stay at this cozy spot; we were here visiting our daughter at WSU and this was perfect for our family to stay, relax, hang out, cook food together, and watch movies. A very comfortable, surprisingly roomy spot, with a well-stocked and organized kitchen (that island is perfect for cooking while folks are hanging out!). Very quiet, very easy to find, and very lovely and helpful hosts. We will be back as often as we can, and this is our first choice to stay when we're in town. Thanks for a wonderful stay, again!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here for almost two full work weeks (not including the weekened) and it was just as advertised. Austin was super fast with responses and was even kind enough to store my frozen goods over the weekend while i was gone so they wouldnt spoil since i couldnt take them with me.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Pullman! Clean, nicely decorated, well stocked with extra linens, very comfortable bed, and comfy living room furniture as well. Austin was very communicative and a great host."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love staying here! This is our second visit. Very close to the college. Super quiet and comfortable. Very nicely decorated. The host is very accommodating.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable space! We felt right at home! This would a wonderful place to stay for a long term rental. It is important to note during this excessive heat warning time this unit was a comfortable temperature even without air conditioning!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay in a very serene, peaceful spot. Excellent spot for hanging out and relaxing while we were in Pullman getting our new Coug settled into her dorm. Comfy, clean, fluffy towels, excellent linens, great bed, in a lovely neighborhood. Stayed nice and cool during the PNW heatwave, and one of the best beds we've ever slept in."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. We were not at the place much as we were busy getting our son situated at WSU for his freshman year but it was nice to have 2 nights in Austin's comfortable place. It was nothing fancy but very nice and comfortable.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very comfy cozy place. The bed is comfortable and the towels are thick and fluffy. The kitchen and living space are also very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an unexpected and unique set up. This Airbnb was amazing, spacious, clean, and a true gem! It made our stay feel like we were right at home."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here. Very close to the university which made it easy to get to the orientation. Super cute and cozy place to stay. Bed was really comfortable. We liked it so much I am rebooking for next month.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was my first experience staying at an Airbnb and it was very good. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Austin, the host, was very responsive when I had questions. There was street parking and the neighborhood was quiet and safe. It is a basement apartment so the floors are squeaky. However, overall it was very quiet."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very comfortable and spacious basement apartment with a nice yard outside the door. Everything we needed was provided. The hosts were wonderful-very communicative, quick responses, very accommodating. I would gladly return."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow... I've stayed at a few vacation rentals and I will have to say that Chad and Sarah were one of the most responsive hosts I've interacted with. Their place is in a great location in Pullman and this was a perfect spot for us to crash when I took my son to visit WSU and the Palouse. The house is clean, uncluttered and as described. I will definitely be putting them on my short list of properties i will revisit. Thanks Chad and Sarah for helping us to have an amazing visit to Pullman and WSU!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chad and Sarah were great host. The location is perfect for anyone visiting WSU.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Home was spacious, clean and on a quiet street with a nice view of the town. We would definitely like to stay over if visiting Pullman again."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"The home is better than the photos! Very spacious with plenty of room. We hardly left the recliners in the living room because they were amazing! The coffee bar was the best part for our young adults.
Beds were soft, with clean linens and soft blankets. Bathrooms well stocked with towels and TP.
Chad & Sarah were very responsive whenever we had a question. Check in was simple and easy.
If we ever need to come back to Pullman, we will definitely be reaching out to Chad & Sarah!
Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you... Respectfully
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chad & Sarah's house was a perfect place for us during parent's weekend at our son's college. It's right in town and close to campus. The house was clean, organized, and we felt like we were in our own home. The welcome basket was a nice touch! We will definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for our needs. Was nice to have a relaxing space for dinner after a long day of travel. Excellent coffee bar for morning coffee lovers. Always had parking after being out and about.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chad & Sarah’s place was just an excellent location for a Gameday weekend! They were wonderful hosts and I will absolutely rent from them again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, clean, and quiet!! We were welcomed with a couple of bottles of wine and treats!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A fantastic find for visiting WSU. Very spacious and homey. It's in a quiet residential neighborhood just from campus. It extremely clean with amenities for cooking and dining.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Nice place to stay
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts, excellent location comfortable and had everything we needed. Chad and Sarah were very responsive and made every effort to ensure a great stay. Would stay here again!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable! Perfect stay and location for WSU Graduation. We walked everywhere and didn’t need to worry about parking.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely stay here again. Loved being able to walk to restaurants downtown. It was quiet and comfortable. Sheets and towels very soft, and loved the late check out of noon!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second visit to Erin's place. It is cozy and in a great location to walk around Pullman. I have stayed at the places when this place was booked up, but it is by far the best stay in Pullman!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin's place was perfect for our stay of 2 couples. Kitchen had everything we needed, beds were comfortable, bathroom was clean with lots of towels. Nice location within walking distance to everything downtown. Would stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute tucked away location that was easy walking distance to shopping and restaurants 😊
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I have stayed here many times and will again. Proximity to town and parking are a plus.
You definitely hear the upstairs people walking but otherwise unit is quiet.
Shower is small but efficient for a basement unit. Don’t expect lots of light.
This time of year Pullman is more expensive due to football. Most other times of year more affordable for work."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Erin continues to be an amazing and accommodating host. Appreciate her so much.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin was very proactive from start to finish. We did not have any problems but she would send notes ahead of check in and checkout as well as during our stay.
Excellent location to restaurants
Much appreciated
Henri"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,all good in general
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very nice place to say. Very close to pretty much everything!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As advertised ... thanks Erin!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication and location. One thing to know is it is in a basement.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was a nice place to stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed Erin's place. It was comfortable and near all the wonderful restaurants in downtown Pullman. Erin was very responsive whenever we had any issue. We would gladly stay here again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We really enjoyed staying at this location and the care that the host put into making sure we had everything we needed, including cooking spices, plenty of cookware, towels, extra blankets, games, laundry and dish washing soap, and many more things that made our trip a breeze. The place was quiet and private and walkable to everything in town. We will definitely book again next year!"
2023-05-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Host was great to work with, quick to respond and very friendly.
There was no toilet paper when we arrived so we had to go buy our own, and we also had to unload the dishwasher. Windows weren't locked when we arrived, and two of the windows don't seem to be well attached to their frames so it didn't feel very secure. One of the bedrooms has a thin door that separates it from a common area outside the apartment, and the living area isn't big enough to sit 4 people. A towel rack in the bathroom is being held together with duct tape. The place was clean, otherwise, and well stocked with coffee, which was nice, and the beds were very comfortable. I do appreciate working with Erin, I just think the apartment wasn't what I was expecting; I didn't realize it was a basement apartment."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great experience staying at Erin’s house for WSU commencement weekend. She put up a graduation decoration and left a bottle of wine and some goodies for us when we arrived which made it feel so much more special! The house was in a great location right in town and we enjoyed the short walks to coffee spots and good eats. The house itself felt very safe and was very cozy for our family. Erin made sure to leave us everything we would need like toiletries and extra bedding, and she also responded very quickly to any questions we had. Everything went perfectly and thank you for giving us a great weekend!! Go cougs!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Wish the bathroom door was more private
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin was amazing. Everything was as listed, easy process as always with Erin. Highly recommend."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Erin was very communicative and the property was exactly as described. It is an older unit and shows signs of its age but it was very clean & cozy. We paid an inflated rate for the unit as it Mom’s weekend (not worth the $650/night, including taxes & fees) but it was the going rate for the weekend… the things we do for our kids!!
It was a great location- walkable to downtown restaurants & coffee shops. Also walkable to campus if a bit of distance & a few hills don’t bother you!
I appreciated the complimentary bottle of wine as the list of activities Erin left for us.
I would definitely recommend & would return again on a non-Family weekend at a non-inflated nightly rate."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin was a great host. Very responsive, so helpful, and so kind. Thank you very much!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I traveled to Pullman to check out WSU as a possible school for her to transfer to next fall. Erin's Downtown Charm 2 was centrally located, clean and quiet. Initially the parking situation seemed onerous, but in a short time it was a non-issue. The place was comfortable and contained all of the amenities that we required. If Erin could do something about the Pullman nightlife that would be something. I would definitely recommend this spot given its location to downtown and a short 5 minute drive to WSU."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My daughter and grandkids came for the weekend to visit my other daughter at WSU. Erin’s house was a perfect place to stay and visit for the weekend. Plenty of room for all of us, well stocked, great directions and the porta crib was a great touch since we forgot ours. I would definitely stay here again when I come to visit."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very nice location.
Very responsive host.
I highly recommend it to people who want to be close to the center"
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Erin's place was great to stay in. The bed with the headboard is super comfy and the pillows were also great. The location is close to downtown and only took us about 3-4 minutes to get back to my daughter's sorority. One caution if you yourself or a guest is tall.... the ceilings (and entry) are a bit lower and there might be several places you need to duck down. This is just an FYI. The stay was still great.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a well located place. The apartment has everything needed for long or short stays. Hose was easy to interact with and very helpful. Parking is a little tight but we got a long bed crew cab tacoma parked east enough. Close to WSU and Pullman and about ten minutes to university of Idaho.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Great location and walkable to everything in town. Walked to Dom doughnuts and they are amazing!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable basement apartment is in a good location that is within walking distance of restaurants. My stay was during cold days when it snowed and rained. I had access to the furnace controls and heating is quick. I'll choose this place again for a future stay.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Great value. Location was perfect. Will definitely stay again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great basement apartment in the greatest college town on earth! Perfectly located downtown, this is an excellent host and excellent apartment!! ❤️❤️❤️"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Downtown Charm 2 provided a lovely stay. Having lived in Pullman, we were familiar with the location of this charming stay. It was perfect for visiting our family and enjoying downtown Pullman. Having a full kitchen and two bedrooms were bonuses for us. We will have this Airbnb on the top of our list for future stays."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a cute and comfortable Airbnb rental and so conveniently located! We could walk everywhere from there!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice clean home in basement level, which stays very temperate during the summer heat. Definitely arrive during day light as drive down to parking is very tight."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best location for walking downtown
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot! Quiet, very close to WSU and walking distance to DT restaurants. Has all the amenities, very comfortable. Everything listed in the listing was perfect, great wifi as well. Will book again.
For those of you with large vehicles:
The parking for this unit is accessible via narrow driveway. However I was able to get my big truck (dodge power wagon) down it fine with a little room on each side. Once you reach the parking area, it’s big enough to turn your vehicle and back into the space. Going out is a little narrow. Just watch your sides!"
2022-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a little dumpy and definitely dated. (Kitchen cabinets from the 1950's) One of the bedrooms is separated from the common area by a thin closet door and no dead bolt. It didn't feel very safe. On the plus side; the apartment has a great location, and the beds were very comfortable."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a fantastic place to stay while visiting my niece! Great location to get to anywhere in Pullman. I really appreciated the forethought of having a fan available during the hot summer days. The host is an excellent communicator!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this quaint apartment. The beds were very comfortable and the home was well stocked. We hope to reserve each time we come to visit.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was great and everything was there that we needed. You may want to check in during the day due to the driveway hard to find at night though.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin was great as we needed too make an adjustment to dates. Easy to communicate with, responsive, and kind. We would happily rent a place she manages again."

2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"nice beds
old basement apartment
Very clean
not enough sitting space in living area for 4 people"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect space and location for us to stay for our daughter's graduation from WSU. It's very clean and has all the necessary essentials - i.e., coffee, coffee maker, dishes, hair dryer, etc. The owner provided very clear instructions to find the place and parking space. There is also ample parking on the street if you have more than one vehicle. It's right downtown so an easy walk to downtown shops and restaurants, but far enough to be very quiet and private. I highly recommend if you need a place for any WSU events as it's very close to campus as well."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great little place and fantastic location!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, super clean, comfortable, quiet and walking distance to great food and pubs"

2021-11-01,3,Stayed about a week,"Great location for WSU campus and downtown things! Very accessible to everything. walking distance to all the good food (though that does depend on how much walking you'd like to do)
overall I think it's exactly as listed. it is a basement unit so the chill from outside seemed to linger a bit longer but nothing cozy blankets won't take care of.
I stayed for a week and the location was perfect."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location of Downtown Charm is great--we really appreciated being able to walk to restaurants, coffeehouses, and campus, and the easy access to surrounding area. The rooms are comfortable, clean, and well-equipped, as was the kitchen (with the exception of a good pair of kitchen scissors!). The heat in the main room was not working but Kristy had provided with space heaters in advance so all was well! Parking would be a little awkward if you have a larger vehicle but worked fine with our small sedan."

2021-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Thanks
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our host Kristy was awesome, excellent communication, offered helpful tips and reminders. Downtown Charm 2 wasn't fancy, but was very clean and comfortable. The beds were really nice, 2 firm and 2 soft pillows - I wish hotels would consider that! Slept like a rock. A few minutes walk to some good places to eat. Parking was a little tricky to get into and people with a large vehicle might consider using one of the public parking places about 2 minute walk away. We were in a mid-size SUV rental and had no problem parking. Other than that no other concerns. We would definitely stay at Kristy's place again."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location next to downtown Pullman!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. Very homey and comfortable. Kristy is a great host and responded to messages quickly.

Hosts are easy to communicate with. Wi-Fi works great and kitchen is well appointed.
I’ve stayed here many times and will definitely again"

2020-01-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Comfortable space, close to main streets with coffee shops and restaurants. Bus stop to the college is a short walk around the corner. Taxis are not easy to get and there is no Uber only Lyft.
Kitchen is well appointed with most everything to cook meals. Living space is roomy. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was an odd configuration with a tight shower but did the job. Quiet neighborhood. I would stay again."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful experience! Great host!
2019-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,It is very clean with an old fashioned feel which is cute. If you have elderly even though you are on the ground floor there are still steps. Also there is a high cleaning just keep this in mind and you still have to take out your own garbage and do dishes so just keep that in mind.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,It sparkles and perfect for our needs

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay. The house is in a great location and easy walk to campus. Loved all the mid-century modern furniture and decor. The host also had drinks, hummus, crackers, chocolate, spices, butter… and everything we needed!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was a throwback to the 1950s, in all the best ways. The decor was lovely mid-century modern, and it was everything I hoped it would be. Patrick did an amazing job restoring and furnishing this gem to its 50s glory, down to the 8-track tape player and console stereo. I wish we could have stayed longer."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in Patrick's lovely home. Very comfortable and relaxing. In fact, we spent both evenings at the house rather than going out at night because we enjoyed being there so much.
Very clean and well appointed home. The views from the kitchen, dining room and living room windows were beautiful, especially after the snow fall. It snowed during our arrival and Patrick stopped by to shovel the stairs leading to the front door, which was unexpected and appreciated.
The house is within walking distance of Beasley Coliseum (and the football stadium) which made travel to and from the basketball game very convenient.
Thank you for your hospitality!!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Patricks home was beautiful and nestled into a quiet neighborhood close to the university. He was very accommodating to my group - would stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We actually didn’t get the chance to stay at this AirBnB because Pullman had a major natural gas leak and the house didn’t have hot water or heat this weekend. However, when I contacted Patrick after learning of this issue (prior to traveling to Pullman) he was gracious and helpful and offered us a 100% refund. We’ll reschedule our trip in the spring and see if the house is available, for sure! Thanks Patrick!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Beautiful fall view and amazing vintage accents you make the trip a memorable experience.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed Patrick's home. It was quite stylish and very comfortable, and had a lovely view of the neighborhood. Patrick was kind and responsive, and he included some good recommendations in the house guide (who knew there are grizzly bears on view in Pullman???). It was a great place to stay whilst visiting my son at WSU. He was able to escape the dorm for a few nights and enjoy some home cooked meals and sleep in a comfy bed."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Everything about Patrick’s mid-century home was wonderful. The house is spacious, comfortable and has what you need for a great stay. The view is terrific.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fun to step into a 1950s home at Patrick's place. The design is great for gathering to talk, play games or just eat together. Thanks for the extras -- cards, Scrabble, wine, snacks, books -- that helped to make for a comfy stay."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Very pretty house and great location. Definitely worth the price.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This mid century home is a gem with excellent period furniture and decor throughout.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay that felt like walking into my grandparents house (in the best way)- they really embraced the 50's vibe. Great linens. It was nice to have a smattering of things we needed like dishwashing detergent, laundry pods, foil for cooking and plastic bags for food storage- it was nice to not have to go buy all of that for a few day stay. View was terrific. Patrick was a helpful host and terrific communicator. We will be back!"

The kitchen was well stocked with every gadget, cooking vessel and utensil you could desire. We especially enjoyed the electric percolator with an amazing coffee blend. Thank you! You made it a wonderful weekend!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Patrick’s place is spacious, clean and beautifully decorated in the mid-century style.
The expansive windows in the living room let in considerable natural light. Although my visit was during sunny days, I can imagine how effective these windows would be on a cloudy Pullman day.
The kitchen is amply appointed. We (three) did a single load of dishes after 3 nights of stay as we never ran out of plates or silverware.
The front porch and the backyard are nice places to enjoy a quiet drink or coffee while listening to the magpies and other birds in the trees surrounding the property.
I hope to return to this nice house."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the mid century modern style and attention to detail. Very clean and comfortable.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay. I have stayed in many places in the area and this one was fun. It takes you back to the 1950’s. The little details they took the time to incorporate made it more than a 5 star. Very communicable host, lots of ideas for things to do in the area. Comfortable no matter which room you were in. It was stocked well with the little things you may need. Definitely worth every penny and will be booking anytime I am in the area!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful host, beautiful home!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, loved the retro decor, and super close to campus. My teenage daughter even commented about how cool she thought the house was."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect house to visit WSU with my child. The house itself is super-cute, comfortable, and had absolutely everything we needed and more. Beds are comfortable, kitchen is well stocked, and it is full of nice decorating touches - we felt immediately at home. The location is ideal - an easy walk to campus and back (people in Pullman talk a lot about all the walking and hills, but it's really pretty easy). Patrick is a great host: friendly, communicative, and accommodating. Looks like we'll be visiting pretty often over the next four years and will definitely make this our Pullman home-away-from-home. Thanks Patrick!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A nice surprise! This house was an experience—the retro style was fun! The turntable and games made for relaxing evenings. The host had a basket of treats and wine for us and the beds were so comfortable, that we ordered the same pillows for our house!"

Great location to walk to campus and catch a football game. We walked everywhere except Walmart.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was clean and inviting, with fresh flowers and snacks aplenty. We slept well and enjoyed the quiet, which was amazing given the fact that it was commencement weekend. If we ever had the occasion to stay in Pullman again, we’d book this property."

I arrived late at night which made it a little tricky finding access to the house according to the photos but once in it was a perfect place to rest and recuperate from a busy weekend attending graduations."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is ideal for all your WSU visits. Its in a close enough location to campus and downtown for convenience while still being far enough away for ample street parking and quiet. The bedroom is at the back of the unit, up against a bermed hill, so its incredibly quiet. Plus, Michelle is a wonderful, thoughtful, and communicative host.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice easy stay. Michelle took care of everything. Water, snacks just sufficient and right. Very comfortable bed. Cozy place, a bit tight. Queen bed only, difficult for a second guest unless sharing the queen bed. Couch wasn't comfortable for my son to sleep in.

It is located behind another house, although they are attached, and would be ideal for someone who likes privacy. It is within very easy reach of central Pullman and the university, but far enough away to avoid any student noise or rowdiness. There are restaurants within walking distance and even more within an easy drive. Michelle is a great hostess."

The bedrooms downstairs were very nice as well and had great storage in the closets, very easy to get situated! There was plenty of room so no one was in the way of another.
Having stayed in other BNB's before, the kitchen was thoughtfully appointed and they had everything we needed for entertaining a group of 10 guests over the weekend. This home has everything you would need in a kitchen and to have it all there is not normal. It made for a very enjoyable weekend!
This is a perfect landing pad for everyone as we had family members in other hotels nearby, this home allowed for us to gather without any fuss! Memorable weekend had by all."

Highly recommended."

It’s very chic inside and is spotlessly clean. Perfect stay with thoughtful amenities. Finally, Emma is a wonderful host, a lovely card awaited us and she inquired about the best time to take care of a landscaping issue as to ensure it wouldn’t inconvenience us. She’s thoughtful and really went above and beyond. I can’t say enough about this home, it’s very special."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had such a wonderful weekend at the McKenzie BnB. The house is clean, comfortable, and cozy with everything needed. It is also a fantastic location! And I love all the improvements and small details throughout the home. I will definitely be back!!!"

It had everything we needed and more”. You will not be dissatisfied."

We couldn’t have had a better stay!
Highly recommend Emma’s spot!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a business trip, two colleagues, three bedrooms. This is the cutest place! This is a wonderfully restored bungalow. Lovely aesthetic, spare, clean and comfortable. Pretty wooden floors, graceful archways, plenty of natural light, and peaceful unadorned walls. Bathrooms have been modernized and have gorgeous tile work. The kitchen is well stocked and we cooked each day. A high point of the stay was the bed linen -- ACTUAL LINEN sheets and pillow cases, I mean FLAX Belgian linen. In all my AirBnb stays, I have never ever had linen linen. Such a treat. Great location for access to CUTE Pullman downtown and to WSU campus. Neighborhood is walkable with pleasant hills and grand trees. I have already booked another stay in August."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Emma was an excellent host she provided quick responses. We were visiting to photograph the Palouse and upon returning from our days photography outing to edit our images in the evening it was nice having the coffee station while we edited and discussed our days shoot. The beds were clean and very comfortable overall great experience and would definitely stay here again when visiting Pullman. Thanks Emma!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as prefect as it seemed online. Emma was the most thoughtful and gracious host. The home was super clean and so very comfortable. My husband said the king bed was so cozy that he wanted the same linen bedding! The location and Emma’s recommendations were the best. In fact one of her restaurant recommendations is our favorite restaurant in Pullman and we now have a wonderful coffee shop to add to our best-loved places to visit while we are rooting on our Coug. We are definitely looking forward to staying at Emma’s again! GO Cougs
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect! It’s a very cute, nicely updated house right in the heart of downtown Pullman and exactly where you want to be if you’re visiting WSU.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fantastic spot! So cute and comfy. Emma went out of her way to help us with anything we needed, which wasn't much because she has thought of everything. The photos don't do it justice and very well priced too. Would love to stay again."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Emma's place was perfect. It was everything she described right down to the cozy beds! The home has all the charm of an older classic styled home. With all the great upgrades of a modern day home. The photos don't do the woodwork through out the home, coziness of the beds and linens or the fabulously unique shower ""room"" justice !! She really thought of everything, even having spray and wash in the laundry room. Which came in handy with a 2 year old. Also should mention you can walk to local coffee shops and restaurants as well."

I am usually exhausted after driving a long distance for a weekend, but the apartment was so calm and the neighborhood was so quiet that I feel refreshed and ready to tackle the week. I wish I had heard of Pups and Cups before my last day. It's a downtown coffee shop that allows dogs and has an off-leash area! we loved having breakfast there."

The patio is a nice spot to play cards and soak in the beautiful weather. Idah and Logan were helpful and affable, they offered great suggestions for places to go within Pullman and Moscow.

Board games were included which we took advantage of! Bed was very comfortable. Owner was very communicative and friendly on the app. We really appreciate the pet friendly policy. While you could hear folks walking around upstairs and sometimes heard the little dog upstairs, it was very low key and did not bother us at all. They were respectful of our presence downstairs. Close to downtown Pullman and WSU. If we had the opportunity we would stay again!"

The apartment is cozy and comfortable and the backyard is great for pets. It was a great experience."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a great place to stay while in Pullman! It was clean and comfortable and the hosts had little touches that made the place feel homey (coffee, fun mirror light, cute decor). It is a basement unit in an older home that shares a backyard. I had no issues checking in- the photos the hosts provide showing where everything is located and having labels inside were helpful. I interacted with the hosts a few times, they were very friendly and always checked in to see how my stay was or if I needed anything. Since this is a basement apartment, the hosts do live upstairs, but they are very quiet and respectful. I never had issues with noise or had any other complaints during my week long stay here. I would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a fantastic place and I'd give it 10 stars if I could. So cute, very clean and comfy, everything one would need.

The bed is huge, slightly firm, and we slept well. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be booking this Air B&B in the future!"
