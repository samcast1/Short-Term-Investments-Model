2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Cute place.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect example of what Airbnbs should be. The house was safe, clean, organized, and immaculately decorated. We had everything we needed and then some, including a lovely welcome gift of wine and chocolates, bathrobes, tons of towels, and three super comfortable beds. It was the perfect stay for our girls weekend, a half mile walk to the lake and zoo, and a bit more to the lovely Racine downtown. Dustan was super responsive for the few questions we had, and the hot tub was fabulous and very clean - as well as surrounded by a tall privacy fence so we weren’t worried about being seen by neighbors. Fantastic stay 10/10."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"GREAT Airbnb, comfortable beds, exceptionally clean, hot tub, well provisioned kitchen, easy entry, able to park in driveway, lots of light, very responsive and gracious host; lovely accommodation."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the Clementine Cottage! Everything was clean and tidy, and exactly as described. We would definitely stay again when in the Racine area."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for sharing your cottage with us! The video was very helpful with instructions for entry, lights, and hot tub. It was everything we expected and more. Very clean, and we had everything we needed. Fully stocked kitchen, linens and bathroom. What a cute place!! We loved the hot tub and the privacy in the backyard. Can’t wait to return in the warmer season to experience all Racine has to offer."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I enjoyed our stay. The weather got chilly making it perfect hot tub weather. We spent most nights in w my niece & took advantage of the spooky seasons scary movies. We stayed comfy & cozy on the sofa.
The shower head is a bit low for my 6’4” hubs but that is a typical theme in our travels.
The house was VERY clean, as were the linens & towels. The robes came in handy w the chilly weather.
Lastly, this is hands down, the quietest place I have ever stayed. Very relaxing & would give 5 stars!!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dustan had excellent communication skills throughout the booking process, our stay, and post vacation. He perfectly summed up the location of the cottage and the amenities it offers. He even dropped off an extra bike for the 4 adults so we could ride out and about to Zoo Beach. He also sent a text with a neat activity that the four of us could attend. Overall a great experience and person!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was a great place. We were visiting my in-laws for a week in Racine and I don't think we could've found a more suitable place. The thing that impressed me the most was that it seemed like Dustan had thought of pretty much everything that you might need during your stay: for instance, I haven't been to a single other Airbnb that had luggage racks, which can be very useful.
The only issue we had with the place was that the mattresses weren't the most comfortable, although you only start to notice that after 5 or 6 days. They're really not all that bad, but my partner and I both have back issues and by the end of the week, both of our backs were clearly not super happy with the mattresses. Also, let me clarify that we need mattresses that are on the firmer side, so others might be perfectly fine with these."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is right in the neighborhood I grew up in! Very nice setup! Basement is a vibe ! Along with the upstairs bedroom!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Clementine Cottage is a home away from home! The pictures doesn’t do this home justice. Ideally, I’d stay here every trip to Racine. The small attention to details (i.e. variety of cooking seasonings, lux soaps and lotions, throw blankets, and coffee station, cozy and comfortable beds) are what do it for me!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We cannot say enough good things about Clementine Cottage and Racine as a whole. We had a long term stay at the cottage and loved it. We both work from home and there was ample room for both of us with desks and computers. My husband loved working upstairs in the ‘nook” as it was cozy and comfortable. We watched TV in the evening down in the basement with the big TV which was great. The house is well cared for and loved by Dustan. The hot tub was clean and inviting to get into.
The town of Racine is wonderful, a nice walk or bike ride to the water where there is a great walking path. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful with great sidewalks to run or walk. A short 10-minute drive and you are in the center of restaurants and stores. We loved our stay and can’t wait to return."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our first time visiting Lake Michigan beaches; loved it! We chose Racine and were lucky to find this perfect cottage. Minutes away from the beach and zoo, it was the perfect location. We loved the decor and amenities, including the hot tub! They’ve thought of everything here, even parchment paper to heat up your Kringle (official pastry of Wisconsin…you will love it)! Pro tip - we preferred Bendtsen’s Bakery over O&H and loved the Pecan and Cherry Cheesecake flavors. We plan to return next year and want to book another stay at this cottage!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice accommodations. Comfortable, cozy and clean."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was very clean and everything was as described. We were very comfortable using the kitchen to make a few meals and had zero issues with this rental. The hot tub was also very clean and the distance to the waterfront was easily bike-able with the provided equipment.
Dustan was very responsive to any questions/requests and provided plenty of info pre and post stay. There isn't much else to say, we had a great stay and would gladly revist if we end in Racine again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,House was exactly what we expected! We loved the clementine theme. Dustan was very responsive and easy to communicate with.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Could not ask for a better 3 days in Racine and a big part of it was this awesome home. Dustan was great to work with. His instructions were very clear and his responsiveness to any questions was always quick and courteous. If you are looking for a great home to stay close to Lake Michigan and easy drive into Milwaukee this is the place.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, exactly as shown in the listing. We enjoyed all of the small design details, Dustin is a great host; very helpful. Great location, just a 5 minute drive to the beach."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The places was an amazing get away! Not far from the beach at all it was calm and peaceful
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Clementine Cottage! The place is so beautifully furnished and maintained. So many welcoming and cozy details! We all slept well in our comfortable beds. Overall, we spent a lot of time in the yard, enjoying the hot tub and grill, and just being outside. We also appreciated the bikes. Our kids enjoyed riding to the lake front and around the neighborhood. The proximity to the lake is ideal! We walked along the beach every night and spent a wonderful day relaxing and swimming in the lake. The neighborhood is easy to walk in and restaurants and beach are a short car ride away. The cottage is just so lovely and relaxing. Dustan is responsive to messages and easy to get a hold of. A great getaway for our family of four!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The Clementine cottage was beautiful and cozy! we had an amazing honeymoon thanks to staying here. The hosts are so polite and accommodating. You would not be disappointed staying in their residence! They go above and beyond to make your stay perfect!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clemetine Cottage is a gem, I am so glad we found it. We stayed here five days in June while visiting family, and enjoyed every minute of it. It was clean, quiet and spacious and looked exactly like in the pictures. We felt very safe in the neighborhood, and Lake Michigan wasn’t far (I went for a run along the Lake every morning, the route is beautiful and safe along the shore/beach). The hot tub was clean and very enjoyable! Our son enjoyed the bedroom in the attic! We hope to come back one day (we came all the way from Germany 😊). Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very tastefully decorated and designed. Very clean!! Super comfy! Had everything we needed in the kitchen and a gas grill! We loved the amazing hot tub! The wine, the chocolates are a great surprise! We also enjoyed the bicycles and rode to the Lake with them. Thank you for making our stay a wonderful home away from home!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My 2 best friends and I loved everything about this place!! It was clean and cozy and we so enjoyed walking to the lake and sitting in the comfy hot tub!!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED this place. Came to get away for the weekend. It was on a nice quiet street only about 5 blocks from Lake Michigan. The house itself was quaint with fun mid-century modern decor. All the amenities you need, including a set of robes in each room for the hot tub with private fenced yard. That was the most relaxing part of our stay. It was well maintained and clean, Although there is only 1 small bathroom, it was comfortably clean and crisp and had soap/shampoo/conditioner for our use. There was a closet in front of the bathroom with ample towels for use. The coffee maker was nice and clean. We appreciated the welcoming wine and chocolates. All the extra blankets were nice to cozy up while watching shows on TV with included Netflix. The first night we went to the Reefpoint restaurant for dinner, I would recommend it. The 2nd day we went shopping in the shops downtown on mainstreet. The owners created a great place to stay. We hope to be back in the summer!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an absolute gem in the town of Racine! Dustan was honestly one of the best hosts I have ever used and I have been using Airbnb for years!

Will definitely stay in any future trips back to Racine!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is adorable. Well-appointed, clean & comfortable. Some of the most comfortable beds that I’ve had outside my own home. The hot tub was sparkling clean. Racine is a great location as it’s close to Milwaukee, Kenosha & Lake Michigan. I’d definitely like to come stay in the summer as I hear that the nearest beach is one of the best freshwater beaches in the country."

Nice quiet neighborhood, can’t wait to come back."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at Clementine Cottage and can’t wait to come back. It was one of the cleanest and most thoughtfully decorated homes we have stayed. We especially appreciated the thoughtful touches like robes for getting to and from the hot tub and popcorn for movie night (with wine for the grown-ups). A rainy weekend meant we had time to explore Racine’s art museum and the dinosaur discovery museum in Kenosha. We can’t wait to come back!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was amazing! The pictures did not do it justice. I have stayed at airbnb's before but this was first for my husband. He absolutely loved it!! We immediately felt welcome, the little touches added made us feel very comfortable. The beds were very comfy, the kitchen and living room were well equipped with everything we needed. My husband loved the loft area. I had to work so unfortunately did not use the hot tub but I did sit in the area in the backyard and enjoyed my morning coffee. Plenty of parking for our two vehicles and close to several restaurants. I highly recommend this place and would be honored to stay there again.

The downstairs had 2 pack n plays and perfect for the little ones. The beach is a block away and beautiful! I grew up in Illinois, but this beach was awesome! Great experience. Thanks Chris!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great Host & awesome location for Racine's July 4th festivities. Within walking distance of the zoo, North Beach & downtown. House was very comfortable, more than sufficiently appointed & clean. The bedroom options were diverse enough that we were able to comfortably accommodate the two small/young families, couples & singles we had in our group. Some issues to just be aware but not bad enough to affect our rating:
(1) Steps leading to the front porch have a slightly higher rise than normal & the landing after the 1st set of stairs is noticebly slanted away from the house. Made it difficult for older folks, but using the stairs leading to the back yard (back doors) at the top of the driveway was a good alternative.
(3) Driveway has fence & is narrow. Great for small cars; so-so for minivans/SUVs...
(2) Basement is much colder than the main level of the house. Just be prepared to use extra blankets or put the warm-blooded individuals in your party downstairs... :)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was a good fit for our large family. It had absolutely everything you could need and I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a place to stay. Christopher went out of his way to add extra touches to make the home welcoming, it is so appreciated"
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Easily one of the best airbnbs I have stayed at yet. Felt right and home and the host went above and beyond to make every guest feel welcomed. Beautiful area with the lake right out front, every amenity/utensiles you could need and then some as well as a beautiful home with tvs in every room also 2 washers and dryers for larger groups. Not a single complaint would recommend to anyone!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house. We had everything we needed to cook all of our meals and bake brownies. Plenty of space for our teens to spread out. Board games and a Foos ball table were Appreciated by my teens. We had movie nights. We loved hearing the waves of Lake Michigan and crossing the street to the beach. The Racine zoo is within walking distance and we went to the Halloween lights at 9pm and the next day went back to the zoo.
Enjoyed the snacks and Welcome Kringle was such a nice touch. We will be back!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Eight of us, my wife and I, our two children and their spouses, and our two young granddaughters, spent two nights at Christopher’s house. Christopher was a wonderful host. He responded to all of our inquiries and provided excellent recommendations on restaurants. We appreciated such thoughtful touches as the personal welcome sign on the kitchen counter and the snacks, water, bottle of wine and delicious Kringle that were provided. The house is across the street from Lake Michigan, and the beach and a large playground, which my granddaughters loved, was a short walk away. Several good restaurants are also close by. The house was quite clean, roomy, the kitchen was well equipped and the beds were very comfortable. We would definitely stay if we visit the area in the future."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sparkly clean and newly done place, right by Lake Michigan! Beautiful and comfortable decor, with space for many people. We have rented many airbnb's and this one is a favorite. Highly recommend it!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is gorgeous! We needed a place for my son’s college graduation and this place was perfect. It slept all 11 of us, and offered a chic and cozy place to celebrate and eat together. No need to fight the crowds for dinner or split up into multiple hotel rooms.
The host, Eric, was extremely responsive and took care of all my questions. He was a delight to work with from start to finish!
5 stars!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely beautiful lakeview home somehow exceeded my expectations. Very spacious 3 story home with immaculate finishes and amenities. We will definitely be coming back thanks Eric!

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This is an amazing location with a perfect view! You almost don’t even want to leave! The property is very clean and has great amenities! I would highly recommend this airbnb if you are looking for a place to stay in the Racine area!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this location for a commercial shoot that our company was doing, but also as lodging for my colleague and me, as we traveled in from out of town. I worked out a lot of details prior to filming with Eric, who was incredibly responsive and accommodating. The place was exactly as described and one of the coziest and most beautiful places we've stayed in and shot at yet! The attention to detail was incredible and far exceeded expectations. We would absolutely stay there again and I wish we'd had more time to enjoy it further.
I love the feature that logs out your personal accounts for streaming after your stay automatically, such a cool detail. Everything was very clean and we felt right at home. The shoot turned out beautifully as well and the entire crew was impressed with the house.
There are a lot of great features about this house, but the one thing I must mention is the mattresses. Though we didn't have a ton of time to sleep - when we did, it was superior!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,SO appreciate staying at Eric's home. The house is beautiful and spacious - perfect for our Leadership Team retreat. The view of the lake is spectacular. Thank you !
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house was perfect for our family weekend getaway for a wedding. It had everything we needed and the quality of the items in the house added a nice lux feel to it. Great space with the rooms including 2 family rooms. Loved the open kitchen for meals and catch ups with the family. Great location with beautiful views. Each guest of our group mentioned how great the house was and kept thanking me for finding it. From the amazing views of the lake to the balconies to the rooms. My kids loved the 2 different staircases - one from the main area and one in the back part of the kitchen! Host was friendly and responsive as needed throughout the stay. Ran into some neighbors as we were leaving our stay and we recommended it to them for any family coming into town. I would definitely book this place again. I really think the place added to our vacation in so many ways…I’m so thankful that we booked this particular house!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We had an amazing stay at Eric’s home. Home was very clean and met all of our expectations. We loved the location. We were able to walk to the downtown area of Racine.

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is absolutely gorgeous and has a great view. All of us want to come back and stay here again. The host was very responsive. The amenities were excellent and the coffee bar is such a great touch. The third floor is absolutely the vibe we needed. We had a few family members over and watched movies and played board games. This was a fantastic house and a wonderful stay with my sister.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Eric’s place was just as described! The house was clean and the beds were so comfortable! The kitchen has all you need and even has a coffee bar! The sunrise in the morning from the lake view was stunning! I would 100% recommend staying here.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Eric's place was exceptional. The entire home was impeccable, well-stocked and thoughtfully appointed, with a level of consideration for guests that is quite rare.
Eric’s fast and thorough communication set a new standard for responsiveness. No matter the question or request, his replies were incredibly swift, reflecting his dedication to ensuring an outstanding experience.
The entire home and views were fantastic, but the third-floor was noteworthy, as it’s like a penthouse suite where our family enjoyed the sunrise in the morning, had a tranquil space bathed in natural light during the day, and come evening, it served as a cozy family room for games and movie nights.
Combining the charm and views of this home with Eric’s hospitality, our stay was not just a visit, but an experience we’ll treasure. This is truly a place that invites you back time and time again, and we’re already looking forward to our next visit."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved everything about our stay! Beautiful house and a gorgeous view. Had everything we needed and more for a weekend away with 6 adults and 6 kids under 5 years old. Kids loved the top floor living space. The master bathroom was also a highlight! We loved the large kitchen and table, there was plenty of space for our large group throughout the house. Kids are already asking when we can go back! Eric was a great and responsive host. Would definitely recommend this home to anyone."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I can't possibly say enough good about this home! The location is wonderful, the home is absolutely stunning, and the communication was always quick and helpful. I am trying to find a reason to be in this area again because I want an excuse to come back!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Eric was a great host. He communicated well, was flexible, and very nice to work with.
The house was squeaky clean, very spacious, and provided a wonderful retreat for our family for the holidays. The kitchen is very large so we were able to cook many meals, while looking out at Lake Michigan, and have tons of space in the fridge/freezer for everything.
Bedrooms are generously sized, bathrooms are very nice and clean, and laundry came in very handy with our infants.
We will definitely be back."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely recommend this spot,
It is a beautiful house, spacious, comfortable and has all the amenities to have comfort and well-being, it is a very well equipped house; the kitchen has all the utensils, condiments, etc. The beds and pillows are comfortable, the bathrooms are spacious and the amenities are of good quality.
The decor is modern and in line with the house.
It's a place that invites you to share with family , and we had an amazing Christmas.
It has a beautiful view of the lake, the street and neighborhood is quiet.
Eric is a great host, attentive to us and with an immediate response to needs.
I could say that in 10 years of visiting several places in the world, through airbnb; this has been one of my favorites.
100% recommended."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is truly wonderful and you should stop your search and book it immediately.

We’re already looking forward to our next stay at this amazing house."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"I've been trying to find the words that would accurately describe this home and its simply impossible. Even had I tried, I couldn't find a negative thing about this place, process or interactions with the owner. This home was warm and inviting, decorated beautifully Comfortability cannot be measued. Everything was simply amazing! As a guest you need not bring anything except your willingness to relax and have a fabulous time. I cannot say enough and the beauty, location, comfortability, security and process. Trust me, you will not regret it 💯 we will be rebooking very soon!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eric’s place was beautiful - just as described and in the photos! My guests and I felt right at home; the house is nicely decorated, the fireplace/living room area is perfect for winding down and relaxing, and the views were incredible. Eric was proactive to send communications and check in instructions and the welcome book was a nice touch with good recommendations for places to eat in Racine. Will be returning again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eric’s home had everything you’d ever want in an Airbnb. It was more like a home than an Airbnb. Sunrises over Lake Michigan were breathtaking! The master suite was incredible, pure luxury! The home was beautiful and had everything needed for a relaxing getaway for our family. We hope to use it again the next time we are in town. Thank you, it was phenomenal!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay. Spacious with a large table for everyone to eat. Bright rooms with lots of windows and plenty of closet space. My husband loves to wake early and run along the lake. The road in front can be a bit busy, but the driveway is easy to pull out of with the stoplight at the end of the block. We would stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great host and amazing location right beside Lake Michigan .
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay. Unique charm of coziness, very clean, near the shore. Wonderful walks were with us with children. The hostess was very attentive. The kitchen is well-stocked, all the details, everything is there, it is important for us...as it is necessary to cook breakfasts for the family. I definitely recommend this place. Thank you!!!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice house. When we were guests, the basement was just remodeled, so not usable for us. But that wasn't bad, the upper rooms were absolutely sufficient for us as a family. Opposite was a public parking lot where we could park our big camper, which was great."
2024-04-01,3.0,Group trip,"The host was very responsive.
The house is old and has an old musty smell. There is construction going on we were not prepared for until day of arrival. Very outdated everywhere, including decor, other than bathroom."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jamelyn was a great host and the house was awesome to stay at for a weekend getaway!
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"The host is very responsive and responded to our questions.
The house looks much bigger in photos than reality.
The house seems a little worn and properly maintained, cracked walls, worn complaints.
The house was under construction at the time of our arrival and it was not planned.
The host asked us for the contractor to pick up things during our stay, which we accepted then she asked us if she could come and clean her construction site in the cellar, under construction... 🚧
In the end, I am moderately satisfied that I chose this place that I was hoping for from another standard."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had s few hiccups at the beginning of our stay with some ice/renovation debris but Jamelyn was very quick to help us out. Great stay for the price, only downside was the blinds in the main living room, very see-through at night. Jamelyn was also very helpful either suggestions of activities and places to dine in the area. I look forward to seeing the pending renovations to the basement."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jamie was a very kind host! We loved our stay at the lake house. My family of 5 stayed and were able to manage the one bathroom, and it was plenty of space otherwise. The lake view was lovely, and there was a park nearby with a nice trail. Would definitely recommend!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing house that’s accessible to the lake. The house inside was nicely cleaned and has such a cozy living room.
Spacious for having guests."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great time in Racine. The host came by to help us light a fire in the fireplace within just a few minutes of our asking. They were incredibly responsive and very friendly. The house was clean and cozy. Thanks for a great weekend!

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was clean and cozy. Jamelyn was helpful and very responsive (even sending over a screwdriver within 5 minutes of asking). There is ample space for lounging and gathering together for a meal. The beds were all comfortable and well appointed. We also really enjoyed the upstairs bathroom amenities. Our family Christmas gathering was perfect here.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Was a great spot to stay. you can see the lake from a few of the windows. it's on a cross-street that terminates on Lake Michigan but it is behind one other house so it's not a completely un-obstructed view. still super beautiful spot. 3 minutes from all the downtown Racine spots. Very roomy house. beautiful bathroom. Beds were super comfy, lots of amenities, washer dryer, fully supplied kitchen, working fireplace, very homie. we spent Christmas here and loved it. Would stay again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed our stay. Jamelyn was very responsive when I had questions. A Christmas tree was provided for us which helped us have Christmas feel while we were there celebrating Christmas with family.
The walk to the beach was refreshing and would highly recommend."

Great Location ….and my grandkids had a ball in the kids toys room… We will stay again!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Had a great stay in Racine! The house was within walking distance of the lake and the home itself was spacious and well decorated. We particularly enjoyed the bathroom with the luxurious bath tub!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, we enjoyed our time spent at the home"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home thank you so much!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay at the July House! Beautiful view of Lake Michigan from the living room window and easy to walk to. The kitchen is well stocked for cooking and the upstairs bathroom is incredible (amazing shower!). A charming house that easily accommodated the six of us.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay. Great location, close to water. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home that’s just a block away from Lake Michigan. A quick ride away from lots of places to eat and beautiful views. Nicely renovated bathroom is a plus! Quick to respond and very thorough in communication to you. Sketchy-looking house next door, and on a busy street as notes in the listing. Grill listed but not available."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were in town for an event at the DeKoven Center which is walkable from this house. It was a cute old house with a modern kitchen & bathroom. They had plenty of items for kids including plates/cups/cutlery and toys in the finished basement. They also had the best selection of spices for cooking of any Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. The host was responsive & helpful. My family would stay again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,The house is very clean. Neighborhood is quiet and safe. Just a few steps away from Lake Michigan.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome Place! We loved the place and had a a Great Time!
Jamelyn is an Amazing Host!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,My friends and I had a lovely stay!!
2023-09-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Instructions were clear and initial how to check in was accurately described. Unfortunately, upon arrival, there were 15/20 quarter sized spiders and associated webs around the front door/entrance area. Additionally, there was a very noticeable smell in the home which did not create an environment where it was sustainable for us to stay multiple nights. The home was close to the water which was nice, however, between the home and the water was another home that was boarded up and in very rough shape. Unfortunately we did not find this property to be one that was as described or one we would visit again in the future."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, homey feel, and responsive hosts. Would go again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was really nice. Our whole sailing crew of 5 had great things to say about the house! Very comfortable-we all felt right at home from the minute we walked in. The host was excellent-thank you so much for a memorable stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A beautiful home away from home with spectacular water views! Very walkable city. Hosts were super kind and quick to respond to my messages. We had all we needed and more in this cozy home. It was the perfect place for our family to stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect for what I hoped :).
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You could tell they cared about not only their property but their guests.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Easy stay, great views, comfortable setting. No issues at all"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved our stay at the July House! The house felt a lot bigger than the pictures. We had plenty of room for the 9 adults that were staying there. We absolutely loved the bathroom (the coolest room in the house). Jamelyn was very proactive and clear in her instructions for us during our stay. We also loved being just a short walk from the lake. I would recommend this house for anyone looking for a small town beach getaway.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodation is a stone's throw away from the lake, the view is pleasant, and it is very convenient to get around.Laundry equipment is relatively old, I won't use it, the host also drove a car to guide me to use it, very warm!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loved our stay, had a great time with my friends. Host was very responsive and helpful!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, luxury bathroom, very comfortable bed, well equipped kitchen. Jamelyn is very generous, she has stocked everything that you can possibly imagine, (even floss, baby diapers, etc.), beautiful scenery near by. We had a great time there. We will definitely come back if we ever get in town.
If I must mention anything downside, it might be the noice, the street are very busy, noises from the loud powerful car engines can be heard inside, even when all the windows are closed. Also since AC unit is inside of the main bedroom upstairs, it made some noises too. But if you are not a light sleeper, these will not be a big problem."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The July House was perfect for our family vacation to Wisconsin. The place was very roomy. As many have said, the main bathroom upstairs was incredible. Although the toilet in the basement is no where near a 1/2 bath it was a GREAT bonus! We used it a lot and was a great! There were many added necessities, included box fans which the kids loved. The beds were also comfortable. The only thing we wonder about was why the TV was not in the living room upstairs. We would have enjoyed having a TV on the main floor. Places we visited while in the area: North Beach (amazing!!), Root River Environmental Center (rent kayaks on weekends 1 hour $10), Reefpoint Marina (great restaurant & shop), Mulligans Mini Golf (tough course & great area), Milwaukee (30-45 min drive), Divino Gelato (downtown), Racine Zoo (cute), Windpoint Lighthouse.
We definitely recommend this place for a visit to the Racine or Milwaukee area. Great communication."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jamelyn's house was charming inside, extremely well thought out design, and very tidy and clean! We enjoyed the many thoughtful extras like beach toys, and extra cozy blankets! The location was different then we expected, as we thought it would be overlooking the Lake, but it is a side street, so it overlooks a large Private School and parking lot with the view of the Lake through the neighborhood. There was a house under construction next door, but we couldn't hear any noise from it, but the many vehicles sometimes could be hard to see around when pulling out the narrow driveway. It is an older home, so they did have a portable air conditioner, and many fans that we just shut off at night and it stayed cool enough for us. Overall we enjoyed the house, and would recommend it to anyone wanting an extremely clean house near the Lake!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family had a great stay in Racine. The location was perfect. Right by the lake and close to beaches and restaurants.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place. Beds were great, bathroom was incredible. Hosts were very helpful. Would recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay and the grandkids really had lots of fun in the toy room down stairs… beautiful lake view from the upstairs room enjoy seeing the sunrise as well…. thanksJamelys for responding right away on my questions very nice Host !!! We will stay again!!!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We very much enjoyed our stay. There were 9 of us aged 14-65 and we were very pleased with the accommodations.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Right on lake Michigan and its a beautiful home. The bathroom is something special. And if i could stay there again I would do it every time!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family had a great stay in Racine thanks to Jamie and her team!
She was very responsive, offering up neighborhood suggestions and activities, along with helping us setup a crib and high chair for our toddler. The space was clean and comfortable, especially the modern shower/tub features in the bathroom. Check in/out and communication were easy and responsive. It was also nice to wake up and see the lake a half block away. Beautiful views. We recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to the lake and marina. Great neighborhood.
Well equipped house."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent accommodations!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful area to stay, right in my old neighborhood. Really good size home to entertain your guest. Really pretty much everything you need in the kitchen. Thank you."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful places! Fun things to do, but still private for some time alone!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay. Exactly like the listing showed. Perfect for our short stay with 4 adults. LOVED the bathroom. Great blend of old and new. Lots of options for seating that were comfortable and felt homey. Beautiful view of the lake and a short walk to the beach.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Don’t let the unassuming exterior bother you- once you step inside, it is a charming, comfortable, clean home. We especially enjoyed the dining room with its big round table for family meals. The living areas were comfy and the lack of tvs were a welcomed absence. The bathroom is beautifully updated and the bedrooms are decorated uniquely with comfortable beds. The only con worth mentioning would be the road noise. We stayed on a weekend and there was a lot of road noise (revving of engines, loud vehicles) in the middle of the night. The hosts are great and put a lot of extra effort to making sure their property is a great place to stay at. Definitely recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Medium house, 3 bedroom, close to beach walking, great views, kids playground on basement, incredible bathroom, easy parking lot.
Unfortunately doesn’t have bbq zone and backyard, but in downtown have a lot of places with great food. Maple table Racine have a best breakfast!
Thanks!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jamelyn was very responsive to the questions we had, which made us feel like we were important. Super accommodating!
I wouldn't hesitate to book again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was all pretty good, I loved everything, especially the bathroom and bedrooms. I really liked how the bedrooms had like a nice theme and you could darken the rooms a lot with the nice bedside little lamps as well"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Great and cozy place I felt like home.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, really enjoyed spending time with family in Racine! The house was just as described and very relaxing."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great and the host was kind and responsive. The view of the lake was beautiful and there were plenty of local restaurants that were delicious within walking distance (10 blocks). There are many historic houses around the area that we're neat to look at, too. There was a park close by and we walked along the lake at sunrise. The house was very clean and had everything we needed. can't say enough positives about it. Thanks for the stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Would definitely stay here again! It honestly felt like home!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jamie’s July House was a good place to go for a getaway! Walking distance to the lake, and a little bit away from the town, but still less than 15 minute drive if needing to go out! We went when it was warming up and even had some windows open! She has most things needed for cooking and the bathroom, which is always a plus!
Just a little criticism and something for other guests to consider: make sure you pack some extra blankets/hoodies and layers because some parts of the house were cold and some were warm, so just be a bit prepared! :) No biggie though, we accommodated just fine."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy home and felt right at home to relax and have a girls weekend
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home with plenty of room for everyone. We felt at home and had everything we needed. It looked just as good in person as it did in the pictures. The youngest ones absolutely loved the play area downstairs! We definitely will return whenever we need to stay in the area.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The July house is a wonderful, comfortable house with lots of amenities. Kitchen is extremely well stocked even with cooking essentials like spices and oils. Bathroom was luxurious with a soaker tub and beautiful large shower area. The street is a bit busy but not terribly noisy.
Overall we were completely satisfied with our stay."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here, the place was very clean and the neighborhood was nice and quiet, which offered us a great getaway from city life!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very at home. And the shower was amazing.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jamie was super kind and flexible with check-in. We loved having a view of the Lake while sitting and enjoying our coffee. It is noisy at night from traffic, but if you sleep with a fan like we do, it isn’t too bad. Overall, a cozy getaway for our baby-moon."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very relaxing stay. It ended up snowing a bunch (which we weren’t totally prepared for), but that gave us an opportunity to enjoy the house and the tub and watch movies in bed. Kitchen had everything we needed, and we also enjoyed the games. Jamie was super responsive and helpful! Thanks again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a fantastic stay at this place. The location was perfect, the space was clean and cozy, with a great view and the host was incredibly welcoming and helpful. I would highly recommend this airbnb to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay in Racine. Thank you Jamelyn for making my trip so enjoyable!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was spotless and the hosts were very responsive with our questions. Beds were really comfortable. Love that there is a real fireplace! Would definitely recommend to a family or group wanting to get together and have really nice views of Lake Michigan!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host Jamelyn was very nice and peaceful the home was very clean with a excellent modern bathroom
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing Location and Host! The bathroom is amazing, the beds were comfortable, it felt like home to us and made it hard to leave! Don't miss out on the chance for Lake Views and comfort!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved my stay here. Such an inviting and homey atmosphere. Very well decorated and had every amenity needed. Would 100% come back again and I definitely recommend this beautiful home to everyone.
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Made us feel at home!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jamie was a great host! We had an unexpected family emergency come up and needed to make some adaptations to our stay and Jamie was very kind and gracious in working with us. Enjoyed our time there as well. Loved waking up and seeing the lake from our bedroom window. Great place to stay!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Love the home, love the space.
Unfortunately, we had a little one who wasn’t used to traffic noises. That was totally our fault. We should’ve looked into a more secluded place. But aside from that, we loved it."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place just off of the lake (one house away from being in the lake) with parking for 2 in the driveway. Amazing bathroom upstairs, but it's the only one in the whole house, so consider this if you have a lot of people staying. Listing says it sleeps 10 but that's if you have multiple people in the 3 beds upstairs, the two uncomfortable hideaway beds, and 2 air mattresses. One air mattress was a twin and inflated great, the other was a queen and the pump was dead. Great kitchen. Partially finished basement with a smart TV. Overall great place to stay and was a great rate!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jamelyn was a great host, very responsive to questions and gave detailed instructions. The house was exactly as pictured, very clean and the bathroom was amazing!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charming home! Loved our stay.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked this stay last minute and had a great experience. It was a wonderful option for us given it's central location, child-friendly amenities, and Jamelyn's prompt communication. Thank you!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay!
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"My group and I had a great time here! The home was very cozy and the view of the lake was amazing. The house had everything we needed and more. The hosts were very kind and responsive, we definitely plan on staying here again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time here! The house was perfect and right near Lake Michigan. The hosts were incredibly accommodating and communicative and they made the stay very enjoyable. Would stay again!
2022-10-01,4.0,Group trip,"It was great stay.
We got lucky with the weather and had a chance to explore the lake area around the house.
Host was responsive with nice communication.
House is exactly as on the pictures. Nice and cozy. Would’ve been great to have a backyard. However, there is a small grill right at the back."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is where you arrive and are at home. Very lovingly, comfortably furnished. Great communication and everything as it was described can be found."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay here!
After an unexpected change in travel plans we needed a last minute place and our hosts got us approved and checked in in just a couple of hours. Despite this, the house was already completely prepared and ready for guests. There were also lots of extras like kitchen supplies that we really appreciated since we like to cook when we are staying somewhere. The house was lovely and super close to the lake. It would probably make a perfect summer stay, although we were there in fall. There were just three in our group, but this would be perfect for a larger family or even a few couples looking to enjoy time together since there is so much space at the house. It’s really a lovely option and one I would recommend to others. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed if you choose this spot!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Visited with a group of friends while attending a wedding at the Racine Zoo. This spot is perfectly located as it’s walking distance to downtown corporation and right by the lake! The interior was nicely decorated with all standard amenities and comfortably slept 7. The only downside is that there is just 1 bathroom in the house but scheduling and coordinating schedules made it all work out fine!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay was very relaxing. We didn’t experience any noise whatsoever. The home was cozy. Unfortunately my child shattered a glass. So the only feedback I would give is maybe consider having some small plastic cups for the kiddos. The play area for the kids was perfect! It kept my little entertained at all times. Thank you!!! We would definitely return.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay was flawless. So perfect for my family. Hosts were easy and very quick to respond. We will be back!
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was everything we could ask for, the view of the lake, games, books and beach supplies. The soaker tub is better than some spas. Great hostesses. Would come back for the summer since we're so close to the beach. You can sit out in front and just look at the lake it's so close."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jamie's place was so cozy and inviting—the perfect location for a fall writing retreat. Everything was clean and orderly. A short walk to Lake Michigan, the location is difficult to beat. The few times we had to contact the host, she was quick to respond and happy to help. We would absolutely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Returning for a second stay at this location made for an excellent trip. Clean, quiet, good communication from the host, and an easy experience from booking to checkout."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Super clean
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place for a small get-together with friends. Walk by the lake, dinner for 6 around the table, or just chill in the living room enjoying conversation and a view of the water."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house is exactly as described. It was our first time traveling and staying somewhere as a family of three (we have a two month old). The lake views were really nice to take in from the living room! The bathroom did not disappoint! I took two baths in three days and even my husband took a bath :) We ordered some fun pizzas from Toppers on doordash and I got coffee from some different local spots every morning. Great stay and great communication with the host!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely time! Every thing we needed was provided!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you for Sharing your beautiful home with us.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The location is great, about a 15 minute walk from the downtown area, a short drive from the public beach, but almost right next-door to the lake with a view from some places in the house. Everything was clean and waiting for us when we checked in, and we didn’t have any needs while we were there. As mentioned in the listing, just make sure you’re aware that the bathroom upstairs is lovely and does have two sinks, but then there isn’t a bathroom on the main floor. The bathroom in the basement isn’t fully finished but totally workable as a back up. There were plenty of boardgames and beach supplies available for our use and we had a great weekend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully decorated~cozy, homey, and inviting! Complete with a comfy entertainment room perfect for movies with the family."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect house in a great location! Seeing the sunrise over the lake was spectacular! Perfect accommodations for my family while we were in town for a family event!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a nice time.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great stay for our family of 4 (kids 1 and 5). The house was easy to find and our family enjoyed seeing the lake right from the house. Jamie was easy to communicate with and we found the house matched the listing. We loved being able to use the beach supplies and visit North Beach. Our kids also enjoyed the toys and kid friendly supplies in the house.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice house. Close to lake.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a wonderful stay! Jamelyn was helpful and very responsive. We loved the view of Lake Michigan!
2022-06-01,4.0,Group trip,Good stay.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was older than I expected based on the pictures, but it’s still a beautiful home full of charm and comfort - especially the amazing soaking tub! And you really can’t beat the location! Jamie was an exceptional host with great communication and definitely went above and beyond to make my stay as relaxing as possible! :) I hope to visit again!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great time everything was smooth house is older but huge 👌 lake view is amazing 👏
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay. Many bars & restaurants near by. The beach is only 5 minutes away. The house was very clean and Jamelyn was very accommodating.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jamie was a wondeful hostess and very accomodating. The home was exactly as expected in the photos, very child friendly. The bathroom was amazing! Definitatly enjoyed our stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a lovely stay! House is super cute and clean, and there’s more than enough of everything that you need. It was the perfect spot for my friends and I to escape to for the weekend. The only thing I’d be aware of is the walk to an actual beach. Lake Michigan (and a walking trail) is steps from the front door, but if you’re looking for actual sandy beach where you could swim, you’ve got to walk up and around a block of houses. Not an issue for us though! Everything else was fantastic(:"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a lovely stay! The place is exactly as advertised. The refinished bathroom with the shower/tub was *muah*!
Definitely check out the things to do in Racine before your stay. The goal of my stay was an introverted, book-reading time, so I unfortunately can’t comment on the things to do around town.
In commenting on the noise, I’m from Chicago, so the noise was not bothersome to me, but I appreciate the host being transparent about it!
If you happen to be a plant-based eater like me, I found 2 restaurants within about a 30 min radius that were delish! Twisted Plants (in South Milwaukee, so a little hike) and Blue Bear (in Racine). Other than those, you’ll need to get groceries and cook."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great old house with character and some modern updates. Plenty of space and convenient. Sunrises over the lake can be spectacular but so can watching storms roll by. Would stay here again and recommend to anyone needing accommodations in Racine.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home to watch the sunrise over Lake Michigan! The July Home was so clean and comfortable! All the info is exactly as the home is described.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My stay was absolutely lovely. The views of the lake from the bedroom and living room was pretty special at sunrise. The Host was available for any questions or concerns. The location was great even though it can be busy in short intervals. But who doesn’t wanna drive pass the lake on there way to work . In the summer it would be the ideal rental with having a beach literally right across the street. I highly recommend staying here.
Cheers"
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Just beautiful!!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is amazing! The view of the lake from the sitting room and the bedroom was perfect and it is well-stocked with everything we needed. It is conveniently located a few minutes from downtown so meeting up with friends who live locally was very easy. I highly recommend it.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was the perfect fit for our needs - kid friendly, clean, and close to the lake. The host communicated very well and was very friendly. We truly enjoyed our stay in this lovely home.
The listing mentions street noise but I was surprised at how much of it you could hear - lots of cars coming around that busy corner and so many with loud exhaust. Luckily it didn’t bother us much, but if you’re a light sleeper I highly recommend you bring ear buds. Other than that, I can’t imagine how anyone wouldn’t enjoy staying here."
2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can sum up our stay as “fine”.
The listing was as advertised and we didn’t have any issues. You can truly only see the lake out of one corner window. Again, just “fine”.
I echo the other comments about the state of the furniture. The King bed was AWFUL. That thing needs to be thrown away. The second bedroom was better, but just slightly.
If you’re a person who’s sensitive to dryness, I recommend bringing a travel humidifier. This place is BONE DRY. I ran the shower multiple times for some moisture.
My biggest complaint with this place are the “House Rules”. They’re excessive, unreasonable, and I flat out refused to do it. (My partner didn’t care and was the one who ran around) If I wanted to take out the garbage and strip the beds, I could have just stayed home 🤷🏼‍♀️ I’ve never stayed at an Air BnB who asked so much of their guests.
After re-reading the previous comments, this place feels like the owners are trying to bring in extra income using the least amount of effort possible, and it’s leaving a bad taste in my mouth.
All in all, it’s not the place for me, and I won’t be returning."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, less than a minute's walk to the lake. We stayed here for two nights for a mid-week birthday get-away to the lake. The kitchen was well-appointed, the bedrooms were tidy, and there were plenty of board games. I would stay again for the luxury bathroom alone, honestly."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home great location the fishing wasn’t the best this weekend but we still had a blast with friends and family
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jamelyn was very communicative and accessible and her home is lovely for a quick getaway :)
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect getaway. Our hosts, Jamelyn and her husband were incredibly receptive and unbelievably quick to address any issues or questions we had. The location next to the lake was perfect. The house itself was everything we wanted and more. A kitchen with a lot of space, dining area … living room area - the first floor was fantastic. The second floor was even better - charming rooms (with sunrise views of the Lake)… very comfortable beds and spacious. The bathroom became perhaps our favorite room. A shower and an AMAZING tub that were collectively the best of either I personally have ever experienced. I teased my daughter and her friend on the fact they both took 2 baths and a shower in less than 18 hours. I took a bath and a shower in the same time frame. Just a great place to get away."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We chose to stay here as a cost winter escape. Somewhere with space to relax and recline, enjoy views, space to cook and an area that we could explore, if needed. We were really happy that Jamie’s Airbnb delivered.
It was a huge space, we felt instantly relaxed and we’re able to truly kick back. The updated bathroom was particularly nice and had a definite spa feel - decor, furnishings, etc. We took great comfort in the King bed, also. We genuinely caught up on much needed space.
Off road parking was ideal. We spent most of our time curled up in the front room space and enjoying the view. With it being a cold Jan weekend, the area and adjacent road were very quiet and had no impact on our stay at all.
Make sure you buy a Kringle when you’re in Racine, too!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time will be booking this home again sooner then later
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an excellent retreat with a wonderful lake view!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My daughter and I enjoyed a most lovely girls only trip. Jamie’s home was very clean and comfortable, and thoughtful details make it obvious the owners take great pride in their accommodations. Jamie was quick to respond to my questions and provided helpful suggestions for dining and enjoying the area. Highly recommend this host."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent space and a great host! Jamelyn was very responsive. The bathroom is like a spa!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect, a place to be comfortable and relaxed. Enjoyed not having a TV in the main living area."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Good view. Spacious house. Bathroom is clearly the highlight of the place. Place will be great once the rest of the house catches up to the bathroom's modernity. Good communication. Area felt safe.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice little house - not 1st row to the lake front but all 3 rooms enjoy a good view ! Very clean.
The JohnsonSC HQ which are just nearby were closed due to COVID"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very easy walk to the lake, and had everything needed for an enjoyable stay. I would recommend it."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great for a girls weekend. We always had something to do, like exploring the downtown area to just staying in this relaxing and cozy place."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our visit, I got to wake up looking at the lake & it was perfect! Jamie has a beautiful home and I loved that she decorated for Christmas, the tree was pretty and made it feel warm & cozy. I appreciate that she was easy to talk to and was close by if we needed anything. We are looking forward to visiting again in the summertime."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay here! Waking up to look out the window and see Lake Michigan was a treat. And, the host had put up a Christmas tree, along with other pretty decorating touches around. The space was perfect for us, and the neighborhood is lovely. All in all, a fabulous place!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What an amazing host. Very detailed and organized. The home was absolutely gorgeous and within feet of Lake Michigan. It was such a treat to sit by the lake in the morning with a cup of coffee. There are many amenities and others have been kind enough to add to the kitchen pantry. If you are traveling with kids this home will surely keep them entertained. The bonus playroom downstairs was super helpful while I was cooking.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very gracious host communicates and responds immediately her home is beautiful and was more than clean with all the essentials you will need for your stay very peaceful and quiet area with amazing views and perfect if you have children. We couldn’t have asked for a better stay ❤️🙏
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space for a family getaway. Plenty of room. Play area for kids downstairs. Lake/beach in walking distance. Beach toys and towels provided. Great restaurant options in nearby downtown. We enjoyed our stay here.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was exactly what we were looking for for a quick getaway. The view of the lake was outstanding and you’re a quick walk to several parks and the downtown area. Jamelyn was very responsive and the home was well equipped for our stay! Thanks again!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful property right near the lake. We had a great time walking by the lake and in the neighborhood-and spending time in this lovely home. The kitchen is very well equipped, and home is beautiful inside. The bathroom is like a spa! We hope to return with more time to spend enjoying the space."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great girls' trip! Beautiful home, beautiful location."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great location! Very comfortable home and gathering space. The weather, water and people were awesome."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jamelyn was very accommodating and speedy with her communication! Everything was clear and the house was exactly as described. Great house for families. The toy selection was great for our two year olds and walking distance to lake views was very nice!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very charming space with many thoughtful extras to make your stay memorable.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house and location were great! Walkable to downtown and beaches—and also a good location for smaller excursions. We were able to drive to IKEA and Tenuta’s Deli which is amazing and worth the drive. The house is super spacious and that huge standalone tub is one of the best parts!
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful place! Host was very accommodating! Highly suggest!
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful place!!! Will definitely stay again and recommend to
Anybody."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Oh so so charming and comfortable!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Racine. The house is so clean and comfortable and is very close to the water and the downtown area. Very nice place to stay!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful house and location! Looking out onto the lake at sunrise was lovely. The bathroom is truly incredible and very much like a spa. Racine is a great city with excellent food, parks and trails. Highly recommend!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay with a lakeside view. It is and older house that has been fixed up. It was very clean and had lot of seating for our family to sit around and enjoy time together.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect stay for all ages. The home was cozy and clean. The home was great for young kids as well. We loved the bathroom and kitchen. Anyone who stays will enjoy the home and close proximity to Lake Michigan
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The July House was a perfect place for our group of 10. Plenty of beds and bed space. The location is very very close to the lake and has great views of it! We appreciate Jamie’s quick communication with us and accommodating to our requests!
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice location, clean house, but some furniture needs updating."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Another awesome Racine trip in the books. We stayed at their other property before and this home/experience was no different. Home was clean, comfortable and we loved the lakefront location. The kids and grandparents loved walking along the lake and collecting sea glass. 3 Kids, 2 grandparents, 4 adults and a baby all fit comfortably and 1 bathroom was not an issue for us. We hope to visit Racine every summer and will definitely book with Jamie again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great experience. Cozy kid friendly house and we enjoyed going to North Beach which was a very quick car ride away. Jamelyn was very accommodating and easy to communicate with.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were communicative and offered great information about what to do in the area. House was as listed and no issues at all.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jamelyn was a very attentive host and we really appreciated the beach chairs and toys for our children. The home was cozy and the beds we’re comfy. We slept extremely well and appreciated the extra fans to help circulate air for warm summer nights. We’d absolutely stay again and highly recommend.
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Such a great stay. So close to the lake and relaxing!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and vacation spot. All the sheets were cotton and very comfortable. The home was very kid friendly. The perfect mix of an old home with modern updates. The host were great and had everything ready for us. We grabbed the beach bag and left. Everything was well thoughtout.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, comfortable master bed, and easy access to what Racine has to offer. It was great that beach towels were provided!"
2021-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"Very nicely appointed rooms and living area was so cozy and bright. Comfortable for 5 adults but 2 shared the king size bed instead of using the trundle bed, too difficult to get in and out without disturbing lower bed. New bathroom is great! Loved the round dining room table for long conversations and lingering after a meal. Literally less than block from lake and so convenient for taking walks. Lower bathroom in basement is unfinished but usable."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The hosts are just fabulous! They even brought us a Kringle for our extended stay! Very attentive in responding to questions, etc.
We had our family of 7 adults stay. The place was nicely kept and all our basic needs met. It in off a fairly busy road, so in the morning you will hear some cars/trucks… but otherwise, quiet (ie no “people” noise). We walked across the street to walk along the lake.
Recommend Ivanhoe’s Pub (try Kilkenny beer), Petrifying Springs Park (beer garden is great & has live music), & North Beach )offers a concession stand, volleyball, park, etc)
Nice Lake view. Definitely recommend!"
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"First I’d like to say I don’t regret the experience it was actually quite nice and the house is beautiful.
The following is where I believe there were an accurate representation or problems:
There is either no central air on the second floor or it works so poorly that it was almost unable to sleep at night. In fact it was so bad that even on the main floor where there was central air the and lowest it got to was 76° between noon and 8 PM. However most of the time it was a 77 or 78° on the main floor. I did talk to the host and they offered to attempt to get HVAC in however the first day we were there was an observed holiday and quite frankly we didn’t want to have an HVAC appointment in the middle of our vacation so we opted out.
Additionally it was advertised that there were three fans upstairs and we found two and then there was a ceiling fan so I assume that the third fan was the ceiling fan however that room was hotter than the other 2 by far.
Next we were told about an air mattress and we attempted to use it however after trying on several plug-ins we could not get the actual compressor to work therefore we were not able to use an air mattress. It is completely possible that we didn’t do it right however being 47 years old I’ve used one or 50 air compressors in my life and never had such trouble. Again the host did reach out and offer solutions for the next day however the next day we did not need it due to the person using it was not going to be there.
Next there was one garbage bag in the entire house and we searched high and low For more and simply could not find more. It’s possible that there were someplace but we checked everywhere to no avail.
Additionally the lengthy house rules was quite long and somewhat complex and in those house rules were certain rules that said that we had to strip bedding and carry it to the basement. While we are young enough for this to not be a problem I would hate to be somebody with bad knees or a back I guess they would just have to choose not to rent this location.
And finally there seems to be a bit of a spider problem at this location because we found at least five quite large brown spiders probably the size of a quarter or maybe larger. The house is not dirty in anyway and I’m sure that it’s just an issue local to this area however it was noticeable and a little bit disturbing.
I will tell you the owners were extremely responsive and I’m sure had we not been a bigger group they probably would’ve not had nearly as many issues ran into but at over $800 for two nights I felt like it was nothing better than a three out of five. Additionally we originally booked for eight and at the last minute had to add three small children and the owners were super receptive to that and flexible so I believe that it’s fair to be sure that I tell both sides of the accurate picture.
I unfortunately would not rent this location again. Mostly because of the heat at night on the second floor."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a perfect location! Our family walked to downtown during First Friday, walked to the beach and looked for fossils and sea glass, watched the sunrise every morning and we had a beautiful well stocked home to return to each day. And that bathroom was AHH-mazing!! Not to mention, our host, Jamie was kind, gracious and made sure everything was perfect for our arrival."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice location, enjoyed the lake views!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jamie’s place was perfect for a weekend get away! Close to the Milwaukee airport, nice beach at North Beach and a calming clean space to stay in!"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This place had a beautiful view of the lake. The bathtub was dreamy! The beach chairs and packed beach bag was a bonus. Host was friendly and easy to work with. Highly recommend!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is in a great location with a lovely view of the lake. There is no bathroom on the ground floor, but the amazing one upstairs makes up for that. Clean and comfortable."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time here! The proximity to the lake is awesome, less than a block. The house was very clean and the hosts were easy to get in touch with. The only thing different than the listing was some of the furniture was a bit more worn than the pictures, but nothing bad. The small park to the south is good for sea glass, but go earlier in the day before it gets busy."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful stay. Loved the unit and the nearby views of the lake. Would happily stay again!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house! AMAZING bathroom! The details in decor, cleanliness and in anticipating what a visitor would want were amazing! Beach bag with supplies already packed, bug spray, lists of recommendations, etc. It’s the perfect stay! Great location and lovely hosts."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jamelyn's communication is timely, friendly and very considerate. We had an unexpected change of plans and her flexibility allowed us to benefit from the reservation. The place is lovely, clean and beautifully located on Lake Michigan."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovey home with particularly beautiful master bathroom and kitchen! Hosts were excellent, responsive and gave great local recommendations. A few downsides: the house is on a busy road so there was some traffic noise and there is no bathroom on the main floor, but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives. Overall a great experience."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice house right on the lake front. Perfect for our stay.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was beautiful and so was waking up to the lake every morning and going for walks by the marina. There are quite a few stairs in the home, more than we expected but I’m recovering from bilateral knee injuries and did ok getting around.
Due to the pandemic this was mostly a staycation and they had most things we needed right in the home. A kitchen fully stocked with pots, pans, dishes and utensils. Added bonus was the spice rack and crockpot which we made country ribs in! The tub and shower were perfect for our spa/treat yo self night.
Jamie and Gabriel were very responsive with any questions or concerns we had which we truly appreciated."
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,very accommodating. love this house it’s so cozy and beautifully decorated!! the view is AMAZING!!

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cute little historic home with a beautiful view of the lake. Plenty of space to spread out in the house. Fantastic bathroom with soaking tub. Toys provided for kids is a bonus. Would book again.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cutest Airbnb right by the water! While there are a ton of sleeping arrangement options, there’s only one bathroom on the top floor and a toilet in the basement, which is why it was perfect for our group of two but may not be ideal for a huge group. For the two of us it was perfect - super cute space with everything we needed plus a fully equipped kitchen perfect for staying in and cooking. It’s a 20 minute walk from downtown Racine which is absolutely worth going to and checking out. We did an escape room in Racine too that was awesome and we highly recommend!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house, very clean and family friendly. We have four kids and they all had a comfortable space to spread out as well as time together."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This house was lovely. Location is great right near the lakeshore, with an easy walk downtown to several great dining options and shop. The house decor is boho chic, cozy and full of fun art and furnishings. There are several thoughtful touches like toiletries, hair dryer, games, dishes, etc. and they provided an awesome list of go-to restaurants. The bedrooms are comfortable and the bathroom is made for relaxing in the gorgeous tub. Excellent getaway house!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Really cozy feeling stepping into the home. The owners were attentive and super generous over all throughout the trip. The lake being right down the street is a huge advantage!

2021-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our “ladies spa getaway” stay was a lovely escape from the city (Chicago) and a comfortable place for my family to visit together and do a bit of pampering. The bathtub was such a treat and the kitchen was nice to cook meals together. The natural light in the house is amazing in all the rooms and the view of the lake is gorgeous. Despite the snow, we still managed to go on a nice walk towards the lake and we were already thinking about plans to return in warmer months. 🙂"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful and relaxing stay!!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We really like this place and Lindsay as host, especially since some recent experiences at other Airbnb's have been less positive, for what was got vs. what was advertised, and the lack of responsiveness of the host.
So, for that reason, plus this great place and Lindsay as spot-in Hostess, it was great.
We discovered that wifi was not connected when we checked in. Lindsay happened to work nearby and came over within an hour to reset it, and solve it.... which was great..."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, great apartment that was clean and tidy. Lindsay is a fantastic host and extremely responsive."
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was clean. The stairs are very steep and could be issue for some when carrying luggage to the second floor. I was unable to get the TV to work. The building that the apartment is in is quite old so one may need to take that into consideration when deciding whether to stay here.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed at the gate house for our wedding. Super cute place and the grounds were amazing. thank you ❤️

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Would love to go back in the summer when things are in full bloom. Steep stairs to get to the apartment but that was in the description and wasn't an issue for us. Place was spotless and the kitchen was well stocked with items you could use. You could see the waters of Lake Michigan from the window. Hope to return in nicer weather and highly recommend this spot to other travelers.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a fabulous location. I’m from Racine and I have always loved the Dekoven center. Lyndsey’s directions for check in were very clear and helpful. GPS took us to a wrong spot and in the dark we found it, with some trial and error, due to her clear instructions.
The location is amazing. The place is comfortable. It is an old building and so you will hear the other tenants. They wake up about 7:30am. They are quiet at night.
I would like to stay here again when I’m back home, seeing family."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay, especially if you have an event at the DeKoven Center."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,If you’re looking for a peaceful respite this is the place. The short walk to Lake Michigan for sunrise never disappoints and the grounds at Dekoven are magnificent. Don’t forget to walk the Circle of Peace labyrinth. Communication with Lindsay was always quick and helpful
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nicely kept up apartment with easy access in a lovely spot. The Dekoven grounds are pretty in a charming spot by the lake. I would stay there again.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property was very clean and comfortable. However, the stairs leading to the apartment are very narrow and steep, almost akin to climbing a ladder. This may be important when considering whether or not to stay at the property and something to be prepared for."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place ….it is comfortable, safe and cozy.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our son had a piano recital in the chapel on site. This is a great location, with Lake Michigan across the road. There is trail along the lake that my husband ran on every morning. The apartment was quiet and clean. It is an old building and some things, like the windows, are original. I like old buildings, so I thought this place was quaint. The host is very responsive if any questions arise."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and unique little spot! Close to downtown or just a nice place to stay in and relax!

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We rented apartments 5 & 6 for our wedding weekend at the Dekoven Center. We were so impressed with the accommodations and the amenities that were provided in the apartments! They were very clean and inviting and made our wedding weekend that much more enjoyable. Being within walking distance of our wedding venue was unbeatable and the historical nature of the apartments was awesome for my wedding photos. Would definitely stay here again!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked our stay here for our wedding onsite. The place is very cute, clean, and modern. Great wifi, smart tv, and probably the comfiest bed I’ve ever slept on. Highly recommend!"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is very nice. The stairs are real steep going up to the living space. I’m 6’1” and I had to duck going down, but as long as you don’t mind that it’s great. Very modern, well kept, and even wine for the room. In a great, quiet location that is easily accessible and the directions on how to get there are very clear. Would definitely recommend. Lindsay was great with providing all the information that I needed and I never felt like I didn’t know what to do."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy space in a beautiful location.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This area is quiet and right on the lake! Be sure to read the listing because the stairs are quite steep and may be hard for some to navigate.

The bed was comfortable and I got a lot of rest while staying here. I will definitely be back!

Close to some fun restaurants and scenic lake views.
Pleasant church bells on Sunday mid morning.
Highly recommended."
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place. The steep steps are definitely concerning if you aren’t young and agile! We did not find the Queen bed comfortable but we only stayed one night so it was fine.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So great to be able to stay onsite for our sons wedding! Coffee pot didn’t work and within an hour of notification, we had a new coffee pot delivered! Only drawback was the steep stairs.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay in apartment #6. It's spotlessly clean and well stocked with more than just the basic kitchen essentials and a super-comfy king bed. The surrounding buildings and grounds are beautifully landscaped and make a peaceful and relaxing environment perfect for a wedding or event. Just a short stroll across the property reveals beautiful views of the lake. There was even an unexpected gift of red and white wine for us to enjoy. Lovely place!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and organized apartment. The location couldn't be better - it's right on the Lake! Very quiet and peaceful area. Would definitely stay here again.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything exactly as described. The apartment was very comfortable and in a lovely setting right across from the lake shore. It was about a 20 minute walk into town -- or a short drive, but we were happy to walk and admire the houses along the way."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was wonderful. We stayed for 2 nights. The apartment was clean and uncluttered. The grounds on which the apartment house stands is a 5 minute walk through lovely neighborhoods to Lake Michigan. We walked to a tasty Italian restaurant closeby.  Easy checkout process. AND, when I had a question, I got a response within the hour."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The historic Gatehouse 6 stay for a fifth anniversary celebration was a beautiful quiet retreat. There is no place like De Koven, with our spectacular Lake Michigan views. We'd absolutely do it again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’m so happy I booked this location!! The bed was incredibly comfortable, so we both slept so well. It felt very private and safe with two key codes before you enter the apartment. The grounds are absolutely beautiful. We drove to the far side of the Dekoven Center and watched the water for awhile in the morning. It was quiet and peaceful. If we come back to Racine we’d happily stay here again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute apartment with nice amenities and lake breeze. Nice walk by the lake and a short drive to restaurants.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My stay was wonderful and honestly exceeded my expectations. I loved being able to explore the grounds of the Dekoven Center which includes a chapel and other old Racine College buildings with architecture from what I imagine is the late 1800s/ early 1900s. And the campus is located right by Lake Michigan. I greatly enjoyed my stay.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was stylishly updated and sparkling clean!!! The bed was very comfortable. Lots of nice touches like complimentary Kuerig and there was even a couple of bottles of wine. Ceiling fans throughout and right on the lake!!

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful and relaxing place to stay. The bed is very comfortable, kitchen stocked with everything you need except some basics like salt and pepper.

2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The area of the Dekoven center is beautiful, quiet, and very safe. Their welcome book is a great touch, providing wonderful ideas on places to visit.

We felt completely prepared for how to check in and out. Overall our stay was lovely and their effort to provide a clean and worry free stay was appreciated."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication from very accommodating hosts! Never met Jenna in person but she was very responsive to my questions & needs. The Dekoven Center is itself lovely, the grounds are peaceful, and the short walk to the lake (even worthwhile in sub-zero temps 🥶) offers magnificent sunrise views. Super comfy bed, for those concerned. I recommend for a week visiting town, a business trip and/or a night passing through Racine on a long drive."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful venue! Old historic buildings. Deeply quiet retreat setting. Beautiful lakeside location. Accommodations are very nicely updated.
We had a very enjoyable stay!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The apartment was very clean and cozy. The lake view driving in was beautiful! The DeKoven center is comprised of beautiful buildings. It was snowing so we couldn’t walk around much but none the less what a unique stay. There was wine available both red and white. The white wine had a great taste. We did not try the red. There is a downtown area nearby where we grabbed dinner. We also visited the Racine zoo which was a lot of fun. Can’t wait to come back in the summer.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay here! It was a perfect location in Racine that offered a quite stay with great access to Lake Michigan. The space was perfect for two people as well. Big kitchen and a small work station allowed me to work during the day. I would highly recommend staying here and will look to book next time we are in town.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dope spot!

I highly recommend this location for people who love historical places and beautiful sights of Lake Michigan! Jenna was extremely responsive and accommodating. Thank you again!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Apartment 6 at the historic DeKoven Center had everything I needed to enjoy my stay in Racine. Jenna was very accommodating and an excellent host. She answered my questions promptly, and when the coffee maker in the unit malfunctioned, she was there with a replacement in no time.
The apartment was clean and comfortable and the internet connection was fast and reliable, making it easy to call in for work meetings. The grounds at the DeKoven Center are beautiful and relaxing, and the proximity of the apartment to Lake Michigan definitely added to the experience!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The place is excellent for social distancing, great for morning/evening jogging/running. There is no washer dryer, so plan accordingly. The pictures are very accurate."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a cool space right on the lake! The apartment was a great size and met the description perfectly. The amenities and features exceeded our expectations. It was a nice, quiet getaway for the weekend. The grounds are beautiful and we enjoyed walking around, checking out the scenery.

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, cute, and clean place to stay! Would definitely come back!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Airbnb at Dekoven is a modern space in a historic setting. It is clean and nicely furnished and extremely convenient to events at Dekoven and for travelers exploring downtown Racine and the lakefront.
2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The DeKoven Center is a beautiful and historic location in a peaceful landscape with excellent views of the lake. The apartment itself is clean and well-furnished, and the bed was extremely comfortable! However a few additional details could improve the experience for the frequent AirBnB guest who is used to the following:
- Give the guest the host's direct cell in the event call forwarding malfunctions
- Rig the exterior lighting on a timer or motion sensor to guide guests up the stairs at night
- Check all lights are in working order (again, the interior stairwell was dark)
- Add a real coffeemaker (eg french press or pour-over cone) instead of a keurig machine
- Provide a tea kettle (and a selection of teas would have been nice)
- Stock the pantry (eg. olive oil and vinegar, a couple spices, basics for simple cooking)
I would have given 5 stars were it not for these overlooked details plus a check-in snafu. I'm a pretty low-maintenance guest so I was able to manage, but I imagine an older or less able-bodied person might have found the darkened stairways challenging, which is why I mention it. I otherwise had a wonderful stay and look forward to returning again!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was clean, modern and cozy. The location was fantastic and convenient for our wedding at the DeKoven Center. They were wonderful and accommodating. I would highly recommend."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful hostess and a cute little place that is very accurately described. Short walk across the street to Lake Michigan. We enjoyed walking downtown which was a mile or so. Easy access to the unit and just a nice little place.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute. Quaint. And when I was there (middle of the week) quiet. Lots of interesting history and building architecture and serene woods surrounded. Responsive hosts as well! Beautiful lake view across the street.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean! We were greeted in the kitchen with wine that was left for us. Large bed was super comfortable. It was in the high 60’s and we were coming from 90 degree temps, so we were a bit chilly, and the boiler that puts out the heat in the building was not yet on. After sending a quick message to Jenna, she brought in a portable heating unit, which worked perfectly. The location was great! We walked the grounds in the morning before departure and found the labyrinth...first timer. Then took a walk right outside the grounds along Lake Michigan. It was lovely!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"lovely scenery, and even lovelier hosts. very private and comfortable."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything in the apartment was new and impeccably clean. The apartment is located in a beautiful spot with a great view of Lake Michigan. The neighborhood is nice and quiet yet extremely close to downtown Racine and all of the amenities you could need. It’s a not far drive Milwaukee or Chicago but you get out of the hustle and bustle of the city. We will definitely be back!!!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Job expertly done to hosts for this fabulous boutique-chic bnb! Has everything you need, beautiful, clean, simple, presentation in each room. The Dekoven Center campus is a wonderful place to host this property. We were very happy to be surrounded by its serenity. Property is pretty much as described. About 1.5 miles from Main Street activity and acroos the street from Lake Michigan. Plenty of free parking spaces on property. Host sent campus map, and photos of actual door, make sure you go around the bulding (closer to the treeline), and look for door labeled ""5 6"". Please note that there are two flights of stairs, the second flight in-unit is quite steep. Apartment is newly appointed, super clean. They did a great job rehabbing the unit. Everything is brand new, and tasteful. Two in-window AC units, and radiated heat. Our stay called for little AC, as it was lower 70's in late August. I cannot speak of the radiated heat, but we were VERY comfortable. Plenty of towels, blankets, pillows, and basic bathroom amenities. Pleanty of hot water for long-shower-takers like myself. Wifi internet tested more than 50mbps, with barely any interruption. We were grateful to have such good access. This booking was of great value. Host left us some welcome gifts, which is rare to see thee days. KEURIG equipped with assorted selections. Jenna had exceptional communication protocol to ensure seamless self check-in. This listing is fantastic, and we had an exceptional experience! We highly recommend for guests requiring peaceful stay with modern conveniences."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"we Had a wonderful time staying at this Place, it definitely felt like Home, warmer, Cleaner and a Beautiful Space for a Family vacation .
the Hosting Team were Very Helpful and responsive on time and professional
wonderful experience"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cisco‘s place was exactly what we needed. It is a downstairs unit so you can hear people walking upstairs, but other than that it had everything we needed and plenty of space. Very cute as well!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay! We would highly recommend! Extremely accommodating!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best places I have stayed, with a great and flexible host!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, historic home! Had such great character and charm. Loved that it’s on one of the last original brick paved roads in Racine. Beds were so comfortable, and each room had its own unique design and feel! Would highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"First time ever renting a Airbnb, He and his co-host were so helpful! The house was beautiful in a very quiet neighborhood! Beds were amazing and everything was very clean! Will definitely be back for our next trip ! Thank you"
2024-03-01,4.0,Group trip,"Thank you for your hospitality! Your local agents were very responsive. Only issue here was that the cleaning people didn't appear to do a great job around the dining table area. Otherwise, everything was good and clean."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A great location, a beautiful apartment"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cisco was a great host. Always responsive and helpful. The house was very cozy and beautifully appointed. The beds were super comfortable and the house had all the amenities we required to enjoy our stay. We recommend!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Hello I had a phenomenal time at Cisco’s Airbnb!!! Easy check in , nice and spacious clean home. I had troubles with the hot water my first shower there was pretty cold but was perfect there after … maybe too much hot water was being ran at once within the units :) Only thing I missed out on was the beautiful fire place I spoke with a Co-Host she definitely tried to help instruct me to turning it on but I just gave up wasn’t trying to catch on fire trying to light a fire lol , she again offered to swing by but seeing it was our last night there I just passed on it being fixed!!!! Thanks for having me and my little family 🫶🏽 Also my family brunch/dinner turned out perfect in the Lovely Kitchen … oh and be careful for the stoop around the fire place it will break a toe literally 🤣 I myself got one … kidding stubbed theirs a few times as well … but overall Your place is wonderful warm and cozy could use more than just at the 1 tv in the living room area"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Came for a girls weekend and we really enjoyed the Flat! The space is well decorated and very comfortable. The neighborhood is charming and walkable, with the lake only a block or two away. It was also close enough to Milwaukee for a day trip! Just a couple of small things, we couldn’t find any wine glasses and the upstairs neighbors were a bit loud late into the night. But that’s what comes with an apartment so I know there’s not much that can be done about that. Overall, I would love to come back and stay again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were always quick to respond, and very helpful.
worked with me on needing to alter reservations.
ran out of toilet paper in the place, asked if there was any more stashed in the house somewhere, there wasn't. then they had some on the doorstep within a few hours.
definitely went above and beyond with that one if you ask me."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was as beautiful in person as it was in the pictures. Close to the lake. The beds were extremely comfortable: maybe the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. It was a perfect location and so cozy. The flooring is beautiful.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our 3rd stay at this Airbnb - within sight of Lake Michigan. We always compare all our Airbnb stays to this Historic Flat...it is by far the most restful, beautiful, and family-friendly place. We can't wait to come back! Cisco & Jamylyn are gracious and thoughtful hosts. If we could give 10 stars, we would!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy, and spacious."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful older house with lots of architectural features. We actually extended our stay and Cisco was super responsive and helpful with that. Would recommend and we will stay here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was beautiful inside and out, it had so much character. The beds and pillows were comfortable, the neighborhood felt safe. Many extras were included. I appreciated having a yoga mat! We barely heard the upstairs residents. We couldn't get the large pocket doors on the bedrooms to close, so we just left them open. There were several stairs leading up to the entrance, which was unexpected and difficult as I had rented this first floor unit with my 80-year-old mother in mind. However, we loved the house and the amenities."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best Airbnb I’ve ever booked! Impeccable cleanliness, cozy atmosphere, spacious rooms, and it looks exactly like the pictures. We’re grateful for the pack and play and the children’s toys – they made our family’s stay here truly enjoyable."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great space with nice finishes. Perfect for my stay. Responsive and accommodating host.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Lots of noise in
The upstairs part outside the house on the walls
There were a lot of spiders down the stairs a little flavoring. Thank you"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! I was so impressed by the condition of the property, and the architectural details in this home! Cozy, well kept, and the beds and linens were so comfortable! Would absolutely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, location and amenities. Would stay again. Hosts very responsive and thankful for off the street parking."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cisco's home is probably one of the most beautiful homes we've stayed in. He has renovated an old home in a tasteful, practical, and inviting manner. The kitchen has everything one might need plus a washer and dryer! The living room is spacious with plenty of seating and amazingly tall windows. Each of the bedrooms has comfortable beds, pillows, amazing windows and blackout curtains. The bathroom is spacious with an wonderfully powerful fan to keep to moisture down... The view from the living room does include a hospital, but just a few hundred feet from the property is the lakefront with a beautifully grassy incline. We loved watching how the mood of the lake changed over the days. The neighborhood is filled with lovely older homes, most fully renovated. Walkable area.
We did not need any assistance, but Cisco preemptively shared phone numbers if we needed it.
If you like Indo-Pak food, the Kabob Grill on Washington is AMAZING!
Overall, a great trip and place to lay our heads."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The house itself was great and very close to the beach!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simply put, this place was incredible. The living space felt so much larger than what was expected due to the thoughtfully designed layout. Everything in the house was high quality. The beds, the appliances, and the furniture. We were a short 1 mile drive away from the beach and a short walk away from a beautiful view of the water. It was very easy to access and felt very private even though it was in close proximity to other houses. I will definitely be coming back to this Airbnb for our trip next year. You will not be sorry if you book this Airbnb."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot looks exactly like in the photos. It was very clean, and the sheets and towels smelled great. The kitchen was loaded with spices and had a lot of equipment for us to use when we didn't want to go out to eat. Overall, it was a very nice place to visit!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If your looking for something close to the beach this is the place literally 6 minutes away. Neighborhood was quite and we felt right at home , beds super comfortable and everything was stocked towels, toilet paper, etc. I would definitely rent this Airbnb again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved how clean this place was! Cleanliness is really important to me so that’s one of my top favorite things about this place.
The beds were very comfortable! We all slept so well. There was plenty of room for our family of 7. (We used the blow up mattress).
We loved the sand toys and beach towels! We flew from Idaho so we didn’t bring those things. It was so nice for our kids to have them. They were used a lot.
We also appreciated the crockpot. We loved that we could throw stuff together and head to the beach and come back to hot food.
The large washer and dryer were perfect for our large family.
I have no cons to this house. We loved it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect house for our family trip. Very close to the lake and beaches. The house was beautiful and we had everything we needed. The hosts were really helpful! Highly recommend!

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice and clean. Matched expectations. Recommend this place if you need a place to stay in Racine.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an adorable apartment just minutes from a lake path, and on a brick street or gorgeous old homes. A 20-min walk to marina and downtown area - not a ton of shops and restaurants, but very accessible. 5-min walk to SC Johnson your start.
The apartment has everything you need for cooking family meals, and appreciated the extra towels, blankets, and beach gear. Charming decor."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Very clean! Very nicely decorated. In a great location near Dekoven for a beautiful wedding.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very clean, comfortable, and the beds are fantastic! Walking distance to Lake Michigan, great restaurants, and cute boutiques. Hosts are quick to respond to any needs. Traffic can be slightly noisy at times. Overall great experience!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"After 12 hours of traveling, all we could think of was, ""We finally get to stay at our favorite Airbnb!!!"" We love this place in Racine...close to all our family & friends, beautiful, comfortable, clean...this is the gold standard for all our stays (""Was it like THE Airbnb in Racine??!!) We can't wait to come back! - Gabrielle & family"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great! We've always had hosts that communicate well, but this was top notch communication! Check in was super easy, recommendations of restaurants and things to do were spot on, the loft was amazing! Definitely 5 stars all around"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Based on the descriptions it was exactly what we expected. A minor WiFi issue was resolver very quickly. Very nice!
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was so nice to be able to stay in a beautifully decorated and maintained historic home. It was fresh, clean, and very comfortable. We loved how much of the historic design elements were preserved in the home but it did not feel old or outdated. The instructions for the home were very clear and everything we could possibly think of needing was provided. We never had to reach out to the hosts because they had proactively covered and provided everything ahead of time. It was February so it was cold but we would have loved to be able to enjoy the lake that was within walking distance from the house. Our visit was short but we hope that we can stay here next time we're in town and explore the lake and the charming neighborhood a bit more. Overall, a great place to stay!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was really nice and as advertised. I would definitely stay there again.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful place, so comfortable. We were able to make a large family dinner and relax all weekend in comfort. Beautiful area, with a lot of options of places to go and things to see. Hosts were very helpful and available at anytime. Check in and out were super simple. We will be booking this flat again!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home. Great communication with hosts. I absolutely love the kitchen! Really appreciated the coffee. Home is very clean. would definitely stay there again. My only complaint was like others stated about the upstairs neighbors, I wish there was a way the hosts could tell them to walk softly because you can literally hear every noise that they make upstairs."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family absolute enjoyed our stay at Cisco’s property in Racine! It was a great location and was a short drive to anything that you might need. We also enjoyed how close it was to the water!
The apartment was very pretty, and well decorated. Our only concern is that the upstairs neighbors could be quite loud. At one point, they were having a very loud get together and we could hear their conversations. Even so, we’d return!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were going to rent Cisco’s place with another couple, a family emergency for them caused them to cancel. Cisco was very kind and understanding regarding this situation. Our stay was very comfortable and we loved the comfy beds! The location was perfect for our needs. Access in and out was easy and we appreciated the parking space in front of the garage. You can tell that a lot of thought went into making customers feel comfortable, even providing items for you to use if your headed to the beach! We would definitely stay at Cisco’s place again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was perfect.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved staying at Cisco’s place! It was clean and it was even better than the pictures. The beds were comfy and they had everything you needed at the house. We travel to Racine at least once a year and will look for his place in the future!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place & great location!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is beautiful and very clean. The location is close to the beach and to restaurants. I like the use of non toxic cleaning products and personal care products. Tastefully decorated and had everything we needed for our stay. The only negative was the noise from the units above. My husband and I had difficulty sleeping. We are light sleepers and it was the weekend. The noise above may not bother you, but it’s something to be noted. It could potentially be a problem or not."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Ciscos flats were beyond our expectation. We rented the 1st and second floor for a family reunion nearby. It was tremendous to have all our out of town family members together at Ciscos flats on a gorgeous brick and tree lined street by the lake. The units were spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. They were also stocked with everything we could possible need including a full laundry room. Cisco and co-hosts are very quick to respond to any need or question.
2022-08-01,4.0,Group trip,Great nice and neat great neighborhood
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely flat, clean and spacious. The beds are so comfortable! We especially enjoyed the use of the chairs to sit by the lake. Highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cisco’s listing is a fabulous place to stay while visiting Racine. Highly recommended!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cisco's property was absolutely amazing. The beds had extremely comfy mattresses, pillows and bedding! House was very clean, plenty of extra towels and even had beach towels. Also had brand new extra large washer and dryer! Location was a block from the lake and close to everything. We had a wonderful time and were very comfortable. Would absolutely rent this property again next time we're in town."
2022-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"The house was immaculately clean. The finishes, decor, & furnishings we're not only pleasing to the eye but were also good quality. They thought of the little things like a cooler, toys, & beach towels to take to the lake, plus a fan which provided some white noise.
Really, the only bad thing we can say is that the upstairs neighbors could be a problem if they aren't used to being above people. We were there 5 nights & 2 of them we didn't get much sleep because of people walking around on the second floor.
The neighborhood is beautiful! Walking distance to overlook the lake & the surrounding buildings were quite a treat for an architecture geek like me."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had such a great time there. The place was very spacious for a family of 4 and was really close to downtown and the beaches!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very welcoming 1st floor apartment. Clean, very spacious, super comfy beds, delightfully bright with giant windows (with room-darkening curtains for sleep!) and beautifully designed plus well-stocked kitchen.
The location is great in that it’s a short 5 min walk to the lakefront, but it is on a fairly busy street. We also heard the neighbors in the flat above us walking around, even into the wee hours of the morning, although by switching to a different bedroom the next night the sounds were sufficiently muffled.
The design/decor is a wonderful mix of historic charm & updated convenience, and the whole flat is just a very inviting space to be in. It was super CLEAN and the managers were very responsive to our every inquiry.
Overall a wonderfully charming & comfy place to stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Exactly as advertised. Clean, lovely, made for an excellent girls weekend away from home."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved this place and had a great family time! The dining table was perfect for our family game playing, the bedrooms were wonderful and we really appreciated how close the lake was. The kitchen had everything we need plus many perks. We really appreciated having the washer and dryer.
Cisco was very responsive to our inquiries. That makes staying here so much better.
We would stay here again in a heartbeat!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice location, the pictures are truly what you get. Home is even more nicer in person. We enjoyed our stay. Thanks"

2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The house itself is great: clean, nice beds, nice amenities. Not a great deal around the house, but not a far walk to the beach. This is on the first floor and there are neighbors upstairs that we heard quite a bit even when we were trying to sleep."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this 1st floor flat vacation rental. The remodel and tasteful redesign of this old house is so cool and comfy, making this home away from home a wonderful foundation for day-trips around Racine and Milwaukee. The hosts thought of everything to make our stay absolutely delightful...complimentary coffee; the coziest beds, pillows, and bedding ever; shower toiletries and decent towels; laundry; and so many other special touches that you don't get with every rental.
The location is really perfect, felt safe, and just a little busy. We were only two blocks from beautiful Lake Michigan, several blocks from downtown Racine with great local restaurants, the marina, plus nearby beautiful, historical homes/manses.
Wish we would have stayed longer as we had many things on our to-do list. Highlights, if you have never been, are: the Milwaukee Public Market, the Milwaukee Art Museum, Wind Point Lighthouse, Racine's North Beach, Kenosha's Tenutas Deli. Dinner highlights were: Reef Point Marina and Brew House, George's Tavern, and Olde Madrid. We hope to come back again, AND we would certainly recommend to others."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spacious and stylish 1st floor apt in an old house. The 3 bedrooms we large and all had at least a queen bed. 2 blocks to the lake for morning sunrise or evening walk. 3 blocks to our tour at SC Johnson. Perfect location and great amenities. We will come back!
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Clean and comfortable! Great place close to downtown and the lake
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nice place to stay. Cool turn of the century house, lots of original details balanced with newer updates. Beds are very comfortable, house is very clean and neighbors were very nice. Hosts are responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful place in a great location! You can see Lake Michigan and we loved that they had board games. I would definitely recommend to all my friends.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house with lots of character. Located on a cool, brick street within a few blocks of the lake. You can actually see the lake from the front window. 3 very large bedrooms with lots of space for a family. The house has a great kitchen with everything you would need. Great rental!"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The flat was very nice and very close to the lake very handy for anything in and around Racine. We will be back next year!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Check-in couldn't have been easier or more pleasant--I was greeted with comforting lights on inside and out, and a coffee/tea station all stocked and ready for use, so I felt immediately welcomed. The kitchen was well-stocked and functional if you are looking to save money by eating in more than eating out, with excellent appliances to help you cook and clean up (specifically, we used the fridge, rangetop, microwave, and dishwasher, but not the oven). The living area was great for relaxing and socializing, and the beds were comfortable. Additionally, the beautiful wood inlay in the floors and other woodwork, like the sliding panel doors, were charming (just as advertised!) The neighborhood was great for walking to destinations like downtown, De Koven, and the Golden Rondelle (for all you Frank Lloyd Wright fans, the Johnson Wax buildings and a FLLW home are very close by). Highly recommend, would stay there again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house is so much bigger and nicer then the pictures.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We spent 10 days and enjoyed our stay. Very nice apartment and they provide everything, highly recommended."
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"A wonderful home with fast WiFi, quick hot water and a shower with incredible water pressure, close to the lake, shops, bakeries and bars - a wonderful stay!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I'm a travel nurse on crisis assignment here in Wisconsin. I bring my family with me. This was so much nicer and roomer than a hotel. In fact my favorite Airbnb to date. The king bed and room darkening curtains was perfect for working nightshift. It is an apartment building but its well insulated. The people upstairs didn't bother me at all. I didn't notice any outside noises either and I'm a fairly light sleeper. The fireplace was amazing. The house is well stocked. The extra towel cabinet was a nice perk. I loved having the washer/dryer in the kitchen. Beautiful location, we walked the beach for a few sunrises after I got out of work. I'm just disappointed it wasn't available my entire stay in Wisconsin. I would definitely stay again. Oh yeah and the property manager also has impeccable cleaning skills."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great couple days away. The weather was bad- but still was able to get in a short walk down by the lake. Enjoyed local restaurants. Really enjoyed the fireplace, playing games and watching TV. A quite place (there is some road noise but it is quite by bedtime). A great first experience in Racine Wisconsin"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was just perfect for our visit up to WI. The location from downtown was awesome; walkable and 2 blocks from the lake. Beautiful and clean apartment, with all the amenities you could need. We loved utilizing the gas fireplace while there and the heat in the house is very efficient for the cold winter days up here. We were visiting my grandmother in Kenosha and finding this place just up in Racine couldn’t have been more convenient to seeing her and then flying in/out of Milwaukee. Really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend the place!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was great. Nice place to stay. Great location spacious and clean. Enjoyed my stay there.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this location was delightful and really could not have gone better. Communication was prompt and helpful throughout the entire process and our hosts gave excellent recommendations of options in the area. Listen to them - they know what they are talking about!
The flat itself was lovely and as described. We really appreciated all of the rustic and homey touches and were really impressed with the integration of historic and updated elements. From the coffee bar in the kitchen to super comfy beds to the cozy fireplace in the living room - it was hard to leave to going exploring! The location is great as well. Two blocks to the lake and a super short drive into Racine proper. Also very close to the Wind Point Lighthouse and other attractions.
We would highly recommend this spot and hope to visit again at some point! Thank you!"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great about my stay at Cisco’s place. Close to the lake and decently close to downtown.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place for a getaway! Cisco's place was tidy and well-equipped, with lovely original hardwood floors in the bedrooms and a cozy vibe. The kitchen was well-stocked and a dream to cook in. Furniture was comfortable and well-placed, and it was a great place for a few friends to decompress.

2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a great area with a cute town. Just want you need for a little get away and walk to the water for viewing.
Came with essential to eat in and cozy for a warm stay in the winter.
Wish the bedroom fire place worked and that there was TVs in all the rooms.
View was not the best out of the rooms . Though was a middle location to different areas around in regards to skiing or a visit into Milwaukee."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend trip and stay here. Everything was very clean and our host was great communicating check in instructions, things to do in the area, and check out expectations.
The unit was really cute and very homey! It seems like maybe it is an older building so noise definitely travels, so if you are a light sleeper, like my husband, that would maybe be our only hesitation since it is easy to hear others in the unit. Really appreciated staying here and would book again!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very large with plenty of space. Kitchen was stocked with all the equipment you would need and plenty of options for coffee. The living space was extremely comfortable and made even more cozy by the fireplace. Bedding was comfortable. Design was excellent. Location was great - close to the lakefront running/walking trail and easy to get to downtown Racine. As with any older home, there is some mild noise from the upstairs inhabitants, but it was largely not a big deal. Would stay again."

My kids loved having the two rooms that were separate but connected by pocket doors. The beds were comfortable. The fireplace was great to huddle around.

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was phenomenal. There was only a couple things that weren’t exactly as stated, which was the working fireplace (we got it to run, but it’s a bit hard…) and there was no drinking station, but a couple of water bottles and 1/4 jug of spring water in the fridge. BUT, it was very cute, very comfortable, and the beach is in such a convenient location that it was our favorite pastime.
There’s great food all around the area, extremely friendly locals, and great views down the street."
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Expect cleanliness and accuracy to listing.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, large apartment so close to the beaches restaurants etc. Very clean, lots of amenities including a fantastic coffee bar, washer/dryer.

Better to drive the couple miles to north beach which is beautiful. Short drive to FLE's Wingspead home. Would stay again"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great choice if you want to have your cake and eat it too. Close to two major cities with all the entertainment and attractions, but set in a quaint lake town with a cozy Main Street.
The flat is beautifully renovated and has everything you and a few friends need for a comfortable stay. Convenient to shops and restaurants, or a lake front walk at any time of day.
This is a must-stay if you're looking in the area!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great weekend in Racine. The accommodations were very nice and accurately described. Newer remodel Airbnb in nice neighborhood just 2 blocks from Lake Michigan. A+ hosts - we would stay here again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Like Mary Poppins' bag, this house had everything inside it that we could possibly think of to make our stay enjoyable. We have often traveled and just made the best of uncomfortable beds, cramped spaces and random supplies. Not this house! Staying here was our best stay ever! We hope to stay here every time we visit our family. Thank you, Cisco and Jamylyn!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The rental was very clean, nicely decorated and well stocked. The management was great to communicate with and even brought over an air mattress at the last minute. It is 1 mile from downtown and just a few blocks from beautiful views of Lake Michigan. It is walking distance to the beach but you have to drive if you want a day on the beach. Highly recommend."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked with Cisco when another booking fell through. Even with the scheduling being last minute, the hosts responded quickly and allowed us to book. We needed an earlier check-in than normal and they were quick to accommodate our needs. They were also very friendly and suggested many things to do in the area. My family is larger than the average, but the home was completely perfect for all of us. The home was extremely clean with many things put in place for an accessible stay.
The beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms were amazing. Everything looked like the pictures. My kids especially loved that they had toys in one of the rooms. I'm also a pretty hefty guy and they offered a large-sized beach chair for bigger people.
I would definitely recommend this location to my friends and family. We would also book there again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi deserves the label ""super host,"" and we easily and quickly felt at home in the apartment. We are familiar with Racine (have family there and were there because two grandchildren were in a school play). It's close enough to Lake Michigan, and actually is walkable to downtown Racine with its restaurants, art museum, and local shops. There's a large community garden to one side of the building, and there were always gardeners at work in it.
We hope Racine will be able to develop its capacity, and the current mayor (we are related), council (mostly) and community leaders are working hard in that direction. It's a diamond still in the rough. Heidi's apartment is a diamond that's been polished and shines."

We think that we were able to log out from my Netflix account as your guest. If you find out that this is not the case and my profile appears there, please let me know.
I'm sorry if I left some things unwashed in the kitchen. We were running late.
THANK YOU!
Manolo"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re going through Wisconsin and need a place to call home for a night or a week, rent out this Airbnb asap!
My husband, and I wanted to do a little road trip in the Midwest with our 10 month old son. Never stayed in Racine but found this AirBnb and had to test it out as it’s close to Milwaukee.
Never rented a place as the first guest with no reviews, but it was a last minute trip and this place looked too good to pass up.
We were beyond happy that we rolled the dice and found this diamond in Racine.
Quick selling points:
It’s a stones throw away from Lake Michigan and you literally get to watch the lake from the living room couch.
Large beach area looks very well kept. Will definitely try and go back in warmer weather
Close walk into town to get coffees, baked goods, and a bite to eat.
House is huge and beautifully renovated. Impressed with all the thought from toilet paper (A+), bath towels, bedding and all decor and appliances. Literally a home away from home!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our stay at the Pink Lady! We were in town for a family wedding, so it was amazing that we could all stay at one place and enjoy each other’s company! Beds were comfortable and linens were clean. Plenty of bathrooms and towels. Everyone had their own little area! Great kitchen where people could gather. Wouldn’t change a thing, and would come back in a second!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing historic home with modern finishes. Had a great wedding g weekend with friends.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This property is charming and in great condition. The hosts were responsive and helpful. Overall, a wonderful location for a group gathering!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect spot to indulge with friends and families for an incredible Racine trip. Everything was luxurious and exceptional. It’s a magical space full of amazing details and history.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Pink House is a beautiful historic home in a great area near the water. It’s well designed, absolutely stunning inside. The stained glass windows in the stairs made for incredible pictures, and the bath tub is everything you want it to be. 🤩 Some small
speed bumps due to the historic nature of the home, but the hosts were very responsive. Furniture felt a bit delicate for some guests, but it was beautiful and the design of everything was so tasteful. Huge fridge and freezer was a great perk. Only recommendation is that the house needs a water filter option, as the tap water does not taste good. The air conditioners were appreciated!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Such a beautiful home! We Look forward to staying there again. Thank you for everything!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great and we felt very much
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"A beautiful Victorian home with both antiques and modern amenities. Great location (near the lake) and great communication. We needed a battery for a carbon monoxide detector and they were there within the hour. The master bedroom and bathroom are the stars of the home, but all the bedrooms and bathrooms have their unique charm. I went with four girlfriends and we had a lovely, relaxing time. If I were to return to Racine I would definitely book this place again. Thanks so much! We had a fantastic time!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Our group had a fantastic stay at the Pink Lady. Everyone was very impressed. I highly recommend the Pink Lady. We hope to stay again on our travels to Wisconsin.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved our stay at this home! It felt like you were staying in a beautiful castle. Each room was absolutely stunning and there was a lot of space to entertain! Hosts were super friendly and helpful!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great old house. We enjoyed our short visit and the host was very quick to respond to minor issues.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Incredible house. Outside needs a little more TLC to match the inside.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"A very large house for my working group, a lot of comfort. It's a spectacular house. I felt at home"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful old historic home. Fun to read about the history in the binder. Modern updates are tasteful and functional while maintaining the historic character. There are a few quirks with any old home, which seemed challenging at first, but we quickly settled in and enjoyed the stay. The back yard and general landscaping was not in the best shape, but by no means a deal breaker. The front porch is amazing and we spent lots of time out there. Not walkable to restaurants, grocery, etc, but very quick drive to downtown. Still fun to walk around the neighborhood and down by the lake. Host was very easy to work with."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The pink mansion is absolutely stunning! Lives up to the photos and feels like stepping back in time to the gilded age. The rooms are spacious and have the modern amenities you’d expect while keeping the period charm.
We hosted a baby shower, and had 8 immediate family guests stay for a few days. Jerry was super responsive, accommodating, and polite. He delivered new batteries when one of the remotes wasn’t working. One of the guests left an important ring in the bathroom and he helped to find and return it to her quickly via mail. Great hosts!
The pink mansion is really close to the Lake Michigan waterfront in Racine. Beautiful old houses and a gorgeous walk by the lake. There isn’t much by the way of attractions in Racine (limited restaurant, coffee shop, etc selection). Also, for anyone with limited mobility there is a flight of stairs to the front door, and another flight of stairs to the first bedroom. This can present a bit of an issue for anyone with a walker or cane."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stayed here with some friends and it was beautiful and peaceful. Easy check in. Plenty of space to lounge and play games, and the sun room looked like a treat if it weren’t snowing! It was close to the lake, and there was an Aldi within 10 minutes. Would also recommend Blue Bear for breakfast!
Two things to note that didn’t make or break the stay but are good to know—
#1 the dining room chairs, while beautiful and authentic were definitely wobbly. It had us worried at times if they were going to break just by sitting on them. The dining room was also short a chair, so we had to pull in a stool from the kitchen which was too high + uncomfortable for the table.
#2 in the kitchen, there was no salt/pepper/other spices, or oil for cooking that we found. However, there were a variety of appliances, such as a blender and crock pot which were nice!
With all that being said, though, I would definitely stay here again if the occasion arose! I would love to visit in the warmer months!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful Victorian home! My whole family enjoyed exploring all of its historical beauty and being able to experience it for the weekend. Loved how close to the lake it was and downtown Racine. It was such a special gathering space as we were all in to celebrate my grandmother turning 90!
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful house and well maintained. We truly enjoyed our stay.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Pink Victorian Lady is a beautiful house. We were in town to visit with family and everybody was amazed by this house! We can’t wait to stay again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jerry’s Pink House is very charming. It has plenty of parking, easy entrance instructions, very clean, fully stocked with all the necessities, fabulous kitchen with high end appliances, beautiful bathrooms and plenty of space for a company of 12 people. The host is very responsive and accommodating. The lake is two blocks away and the downtown area is close by. We definitely recommend this house."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jerry's Victorian house is spectacular. Has everything you need plus more. Very spacious, spotless clean, and updated with top notch appliances... It is truly a castle! Jerry's effective communication and flexibility was above and beyond! Gave us great recommendations for restaurants!!! We will definitely be back!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,She is a first-class hostess. He was always there to answer any questions I had. I am very grateful for the treatment and kindness.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice stay. Right in the heart of downtown Racine. Close to all the cool restaurants, bars, and other attractions."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot for a little weekend getaway. Lots of food options within walking distance!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay downtown. Loved the rental. Nice layout. Loved the game basket Angela was very responsive and kind. Nicer quality amenities. Felt safe with the hall cameras. Will definitely stay again when visiting.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect spot for the 2 of us. Easily walkable to dining, coffee, lakefront."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Angela was a great host, very responsive and accommodating. The place was very nice and in close proximity to great restaurants and the lake front."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay very clean and inviting Nice to have restaurant so close walking distance just be aware that there is a flight of stairs and no free parking until after 6 PM Will definitely stay again when in the area
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed getting away for a few very relaxing days. Tons of food in the area and things to do.
I still chose to stay in and instead burrow into the large amount of pillows. 😊"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot for a quick getaway. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay- great location
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is a great stay! It is on the smaller side, but for 1-2 people it can work well if you’re out and about most of the time. The kitchen, while small, did have nearly everything you’d need to cook in it. The bathroom was clean and beautiful. And keyless entry was very easy to navigate. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying at Angela’s and once again had a great stay! Perfect host, highly recommend staying here."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,very cute apartment.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Apartment was absolutely wonderful to stay at! Very clean and felt like home while we were there. Kitchen was full of useful stuff to use even though we didn’t cook there and the bathroom was excellent. Sheets and bedding were fantastic too! Had a little trouble because we went to the wrong white door next to the retail space but Angela was very helpful with directions. There’s a white door on the street that I thought was the entrance but you actually have to walk up to the door of the retail space and the door to the apartment space is to the left of that door not the one on the street. Excellent stay that we would love to come back to!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angela was super responsive from the beginning and let us check in early. The air bnb was just like the pictures. Clean and cozy. Brewery, Coffee shop and restaurants within walking distance. Parking was super close by. The parking garage’s gate that is recommend wasn’t working. But there was another garage within the same distance. There is a bar and a lot of night life right outside the air bnb. So there was some noise. There was a scary situation that happened outside during the night that was out of Angela’s control but she was quick to respond to us and went above and beyond to make up for it. Highly recommend staying here!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Angela’s place was extremely cute and clean. It is dog friendly so we decided to bring our pups for a little weekend trip. I wouldn’t recommend bringing dogs, there’s no grass really anywhere near the apartment and there was a lot of broken glass near the main entry outside, so it was a little inconvenient every time they had to go potty. Not a bad place though, a little noisy at night with there being a bar directly across the street but definitely wouldn’t recommend bringing a dog to stay here."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Good host, would recommend, a little confusing finding the front door inside the front store entrance of the lower floor, hard to see from the road."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is such a hidden gem! Angela is a great host, the moment I walked in I felt right at home. Absolutely loved staying here and can’t wait to book again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!! Very clean and cozy and perfect location to walk to restaurants!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay at, very comfy!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was just like the pictures very nice peaceful area for me and my boyfriend to stay at for the weekend
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time celebrating our wedding anniversary here. Felt like home.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly, one of the best AirB&B experiences. Instructions were super clear and pragmatic. The space was very clean, the bed wonderfully comfortable. Parking was close by, and the lake just steps away. Angela was responsive and accommodating. Wonderful stay."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Read some reviews about the noise, the bedroom is facing a not so busy road but the otherside of the building is a main/busy road. Had a small issue but Angela was quick to responsd. Bed was perfect, my husband has a bad back and he liked this bed. The bed is not too soft and not too firm."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Angela was a fantastic host. She was easy to communicate with throughout the rental process.
The rental was exactly what we expected, tastefully done with higher quality appliances and dish-ware.
We would absolutely stay at this property again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect like always! My second stay here now 😄
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was absolutely amazing! The apartment has everything you need. There’s tons of food options around. We really enjoyed staying here.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful apartment! Very simple with cute furniture. Only just Blocks from the water! Such a cute Downtown!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would recommend this cozy little place to anyone. Defiantly will be back! I got early check-in as well which also was a bonus!
Great host :)"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The location was central to lots of shops, coffee cafes, activities (ex. glass blowing classes, zoo, painting classes), restaurants, and close to the lake. Parking was easy and cheap. Angela was a great host that responded quickly. The place had all the necessary amenities. I would return."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place had a great location by the harbor and water which made morning walks so easy with my dog. I loved the decor inside and can tell it was updated so thoughtfully. I’d happily return to stay here!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment right on Main! Super convenient location for North Beach, the zoo, and some excellent restaurants! Highly recommend grabbing dinner at Butcher and Barrel and breakfast at Maple’s Table- both short walks away.
We brought our big dog and the apartment was great for us for a weekend away! Beautiful walks along the harbor with the pooch made a great start to each day. Would stay here again if ever back in the area!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Felt a lot safer having the two locks to get in the apartment. Very convenient make up wipes,shampoo,conditioner,and body wash. In walking distance of local bars and little stores around town."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was great. A short walk to the water and right by plenty of coffee and food options.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Nicely kept up unit with good amenities in Downtown Racine. Well maintained and smooth booking and check-in process.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Looks exactly like the pictures - so clean and has everything you can think of! Check-in was super easy and Angela was very responsive - she replied almost immediately! Highly recommend staying at one of Angela’s places if you are in Racine!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Angela's place! Her communication before we arrived was great. Check-in was very easy and she even let us check in a couple of hours early. It was very neat, very clean, and had everything we needed. Unfortunately, we ended up leaving early because of the very loud motorcycles and cars going up and down main street through the night. We were there on a Thursday night, so maybe it isn't as bad earlier in the week. Angela does have a noise machine, which definitely helped, but for any light sleepers, this is probably not the best place to stay. When I asked if there was any chance of getting a refund, Angela was extremely kind and refunded us one night (we had two more nights left and her policy clearly states that we should have only been refunded 50% for one of those nights)."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of our favorite Airbnb stays ever. The apartment is as nice and neat and clean as it looks in the pix. The place has everything you need and the location downtown is ideal. Angela was professional and prompt and attentive and the next time we’re in Racine this is where we’ll stay.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was very clean and up-to-date. You’ll have everything you need to enjoy your time in Racine.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay in the heart of downtown Racine, close to Lake Michigan. Noisy at night but nothing and noise cancel machine can’t take care of."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I came into town for a surprise 30th birthday party for one of our close friends. Angela gave precise instructions how to check in and where to check in at. She responded promptly, she was kind, but not invasive. The place was very clean, organized, and was just enough space for my husband and I. We appreciate her hospitality and would definitely rent from her again. Thanks Angela!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, I would definitely stay again. Angela is a great host!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,na
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, right on bustling Main Street. Easy communication with the owner throughout my stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and well appointed apartment in the heart of downtown Racine. Right across the street from a brewery and within walking distance to lots of shops and restaurant. There was quite a bit of street noise at night (Fri/Sat night) so bring something for white noise or ear plugs.
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean, beautiful apartment with anything you need for a home away from home. Being pet friendly was a plus as we brought our 2 dogs with us.
The building itself is quiet, but the insulation of the exterior walls/windows lacks any resistance against outside sound. It almostseemed like the windows were open for the level of sound that enters the apartment, but they were closed. If you have timid pets that are sensitive or get excited to noise, this is not the place. Lot's of foot traffic and vehicles coming and going due to the night life from local bar's.
We got a discounted rate for a booking error, so I don't have any complaints there as the host was also very professional and accommodating."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,my second stay was just as good as the first.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place loacted right in the middle of downtown Racine. Angela made my stay easy, will be staying again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing environment.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay at Abey's. My 14 year old and I stayed a night. A really quick trip.
I messaged Abey to let her know that we would be late to check-in due to delayed flight. She was so sweet and offered to order us in food. She really made us feel like welcomed guests in her home.
The place looks just like the pictures. Very cute. The town was great, too.
Place was clean and the bed was comfortable. Will stay again.
Thanks!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Abeys for two nights celebrating our 10yr wedding anniversary. It was a bit rainy so we enjoyed most of our time at the air b&b, playing board games and enjoying the gazebo. The back yard was serene and so peaceful. Host is great about checking in while still providing plenty of privacy. Would absolutely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was perfect for celebrating our 3rd anniversary, the setup was romantic and private, and exactly what we hoped to find!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Abey was a great host!! My boss really loved this home when he stayed!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I wanted a little get away to surprise my boyfriend with. The place was absolutely beautiful and Abey went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. I look forward to going back one day!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a hidden gem! I will definitely be back to visit again! A perfect little get away, that is just close enough to get to that it doesn't even feel like a trip, but once you get there you feel like you are miles away from everything 😄"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved it, highly recommend to anyone that wants a nice private getaway. The town is great with wonderful places to eat"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and Abey is very responsive as well as accommodating!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We booked this getaway for our parents’ anniversary which they absolutely loved! The place was beautiful and very accommodating. They especially adored the delicious mulled wine!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A amazing experience is all i can say.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Woooow a truly beautiful place!! We loved it was very nice to stay there, a beautiful place, a magical and comfortable place"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Airbnb was beautiful and abbey was communicating with me so well! I would definitely recommend it! It was a very romantic weekend for my girl and I.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a great day. My friends got engaged. Thanks to Abay for his hospitality, he set everything up for us and helped with the decor. He was very friendly and polite. It's an incredible place where you can hear the sound of the river and the house is cozy and beautiful. It was the best place to propose. I recommend to everyone ♥️"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Abey, the host, is one of the greatest people we’ve ever met. He set up a beautiful proposal for my now fiancé and I. He made sure everything was set up perfect for us and made that night one of the most memorable nights of our lives. His mulled wine that he makes is so delicious so if you get a chance to try it then definitely do. 10/10 would recommend this place. Salute Italian restaurant is some of the best Italian food we ever had so give that a try if you’re in town!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, very peaceful and cozy. Good location for things to do. Wasn't expecting to be below a house, but having a our own entrance into the place made it feel like its own place. Could barely tell the family upstairs was there, which added to its cozy/ peaceful feel."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The actual place was very nice. The advertising for this place was very misleading. Marketing this as secluded just feels off. This property is in a neighborhood with a woods in the backyard. Was it a beautiful view in the back, yes! Was it secluded, no! All of the pictures are taken looking at the back of the property so there isn’t anyway of knowing that this property is just in a neighborhood. Once we got over the fact that this was just someone’s basement in their neighborhood the place was great. It was beautiful and clean. Just think the hosts should be more transparent when it comes to location."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great spot for a special occasion. I was doing a proposal and setup which was prepared for us was exceptional. The outdoor makes you feel that you somewhere in a national park. The host is super responsive and helpful, his family did a good job to make you feel special."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Its was a great place and had a wonderful experience
Abey was a great host and always made sure we are comfortable."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Abey’s and Asha’s home was the perfect place for a little peaceful getaway. I decided to surprise my partner for our anniversary and loved that we were able to have the big space to ourselves and the gazebo was a great addition to our stay, I do want to thank both of the hosts for taking the time to fix it up and it was beautifully decorated. I also wanted to mention that I greatly appreciated their attentiveness, they always made sure to shoot me a text and make sure everything was going well! Thank you once again and we would love to come back in the future. :)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was an amazing stay, I will definitely be back again!!! I came with my wife for our 1 year wedding anniversary. Well worth the relaxation and peace we recieved."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolutely beautiful place. Everything was so thoughtfully done. We had a lovely stay, can't wait to go back!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay we got engaged here and it was beautiful!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Abey was an amazing host and this was an amazing place to stay! First of all, communication was fast and responsive. The property was easy to find with the instructions provided, and the space was exactly how I expected based on the pictures! Abey was extremely helpful with recommendations for local food and things to do, and even helped me figure out the heat lamps in the wonderful Gazebo on the porch! This is a perfect place to stay for a nice getaway, and Abey was truly an amazing host. Also there was a wonderful bottle of wine waiting for us upon our arrival!! Truly one of the best experiences I’ve had on Airbnb!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home, the view from the balcony(and windows) was amazing. only way it could have been better was if we stayed in the fall with the trees bearing autumn leaves"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I had a great stay here with my two boys and would definitely come back another time! Great host and experience.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay with a loved one. Very friendly and helpful owners! Loved the stay will surely plan another one
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great and accurate lovely location my only problem would be the cleanliness of the place mostly talking about the dishes and all the kitchen stuff and some of the bathroom . A lot if not most of the pots and cups were dirty some had coffee stain we had wash again and some parts of the bathroom were stained but apart from that the location and place was great
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would relive this day a million times over if I could and I owe all of it to these hosts, made my proposal so special"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Abey and Asha were absolutely fantastic they came downstairs on our last night and brought some of their excellent mulled wine 🍷 amazing..!!
Gave us great local recommendations and are super friendly
Couldn’t recommend highly enough to stay in their beautiful space"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great find! Spent our 3rd anniversary here and was able to make so many lovely memories! I absolutely loved the hospitality and warm wine!!! Definitely took advantage of the gazebo!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This stay was the perfect getaway for me and my husband celebrating his birthday. Abey went above and beyond to help him feel special from her beautiful dinner for two set up in the gazebo down to the handcrafted swans and rose pedals on the bed. The scenery was peaceful and serene. Though it is attached to their home, it was never a bother and they provide plenty of privacy while still making themselves available. Location is perfect, 5 minutes from a local grocery store and about 10 minutes from plenty of eateries. It was so cozy from the moment you walked in. We cannot wait to stay again!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a great place to stay for getaway. I highly recommend staying here as it was nice and cozy and everything was neat. Would definitely stay here again!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Abey’s place was nice and cozy! It is very clean and quiet! She also gave a great recommendation for a breakfast place not to far away.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Abey’s place was so cute. As soon as I walked in, I felt like it was home. The Christmas tree definitely made my stay, helped make things cozy, along with the fireplace. The wine was an extra treat! Couch and bed was comfy, shower was hot, what more could I ask for! I do wish I would have come in the summer so that I could explore the beautiful creek behind the place! I’ll probably be back! Thank you again Abey, for your hospitality."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an awesome find! A great weekend getaway to relax and enjoy beautiful scenery but is also a short drive to some great brunch places in town. Perfect place to celebrate our 1st anniversary!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is amazing , the interior is thoughtful to the details , everything was clean , it was comfortable to be in it, the terrace with a good view , very friendly hosts , from the vacation we were left under a pleasant impression, I recommend to everyone, I want to come back to such a place, thank you for your work and care for each of your clients ❤️"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We wish we would have arrived earlier in the day to experience the surrounding beauty! That being said, the place was spacious, beautiful, tidy, and inviting. We were able to use the gazebo for our anniversary dinner (curtesy of one of the food recommendations from Abey)
We will be sure to come back again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with great view.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place to getaway for a few days. It was super welcoming and private and felt like a home away from home. Will return again if in the area!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The photos do the place no justice although they are beautiful photos and very accurate. Staying at this property was all we wanted and more. Abey went out of his way to make it so special to celebrate my birthday and our anniversary! I will definitely stay again and at their other locations. Abey is so responsive and gave a great dinner recommendation and talked with my husband and I as well, and although it was a romantic getaway he gave us great conversation and met all of our requests. If you are looking for a romantic environment this is the place! Abey we will be seeing you again and hopefully in Italy not this year, but next!!!! This was an amazing evening that we will hold close to our hearts!!!! With Abey ask and you shall receive to make the night whatever you need."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay! The place was amazing, clean, and very cozy. The host was super accommodating and made our visit extra special with good recommendations."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great experience. Loved the location and the privacy. Most things were explained when and how to do things. I use this as a getaway from Milwaukee for my girlfriend who also was celebrating her birthday. She was so exited and in aw with the place. She really loved to view and nature life out back. Was surprised by the shower. Not that it was bad but just didn’t match the rest of the house. Still and all it was very clean and did its job. It was also explained to me why and I loved that from the host. I was so upset with myself because I hadn’t gotten any decorations because of time. I work a lot and Abey said let us take care of it. I ordered the special at the last minute and when I say the last minute….. but it was no problem for Abey. They did a really great job on it. Only other thing wrong was my timing. Should’ve done this earlier.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We decided to spend our five year anniversary at Abbys place and it was really nice and cozy. Everything was as described surrounding, was really beautiful. We will definitely come back during the summer time."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our brief stay here. The owner's longer description is accurate - read closely. Because you are below the owner's home, you will hear normal sounds associated with a private residence, and will interact in one way or another with others. If you are looking for a total retreat from society, this may not be the best choice.
The above aside, we found this to be a fantastic, affordable getaway. The hosts were absolutely kind to us, helpful, and respected our privacy. Various welcoming touches clearly communicated that the hosts enjoy hospitality and wanted to maximize our experience.
The shared, rear gazebo by the small ravine is definitely the highlight - the photos are true to life. The apartment itself is mostly updated and tasteful, with a DIY modernity that is charming in its own right, even if it stops short of architectural perfection."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Abey's Wisconsin Treehouse Getaway was nothing short of amazing! Abey was a wonderful host, very responsive, and caring. The place was very spacious, well decorated, and peaceful. Absolutely perfect for a couple's retreat. If you're thinking about adding the romance package, we highly recommend it! Thank you Abey for making this proposal experience one we will remember forever!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful energy, privacy and nature, the perfect combination!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very relaxing few days here! The area is beautiful, and everything is very easy to get to!
The space was very clean and inviting, however this is not a treehouse as advertised. That was our only disappointment."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I surprised my partner for his 40th birthday with a stay here. We both loved it! It was so peaceful and quiet even though you are in a neighborhood. We were able to use the gazebo which made for a romantic dinner. The house was very welcoming with tons of blankets and pillows, which had a very comfortable feel. I highly suggest staying her for a nice getaway!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! A home away from home. Hosts really made you feel at peace. Beautiful place, would recommend to anyone!!! Had a really nice conversation with the host. Thank you so much to the host for going above and beyond to make out weekend getaway a romantic, peaceful time. We will definitely make plans for a return!!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great place with lovely hosts :)
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My fiancé and I spent our 10 year anniversary here. It was very cozy.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our treehouse getaway was great! Despite the cold and snow, it was an unforgettable experience with roses, champagne and candle lights in the gazebo. The host was extremely responsive and checked on us. We definitely recommend this for a couples getaway. The Chai latte is the best we’ve had. Definitely a must try. We cannot wait to be back. :)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a magical place, perfect for anyone who likes a private place to connect with nature. Such a beautiful hidden gem that I can’t wait to visit again.
Abet was amazing at communicating and an overall amazing host."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I were in town for my Nephews Graduation from the Navy and after a long trip from Texas, Andy’s porch was the perfect place to unwind and recover from the journey. Abey was very communicative and responsive with any questions we might have had but didn’t have to ask many questions with his proactive approach. One of the smoothest checkins and checkouts because he gave us all the information we needed before hand. Our highlight of the stay besides unwinding and reading in the porch nook and listening to the peaceful environment was Abey’s mulled wine and company. It was like meeting an old friend! 10/10 recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great for our honeymoon! Thank you again! Hot tub would take this listing to an another level.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A gorgeous space with a beautiful view of the creek and trees. Such a peaceful oasis. Abey is so kind and responsive. Left a bottle of wine for me and my fiancé to enjoy upon checking in which made our evening very special. Thank you for the great stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Abey is an amazing host ! Very responsive and we enjoyed the Chai she made for us in the morning. Would def recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay at Abey’s!! I absolutely love it!! It’s truly my escape from reality to enjoy nature and decompress. They’re very attentive to needs but not bothersome and everything is so perfect and inviting it has a spa feel to it & romantic. I never want to leave when I’m here & I will stay again ❤️
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for providing us with such a warm welcome! The space is beautiful and very peaceful.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We used abbeys place to celebrate a birthday….it was absolutely awesome the scenery was breathtaking… the amenities were very comfortable and homely … abbeys place absolutely felt like being at a secluded private resort except it also felt like u were in the comforts of your own home … there were so many restaurant options that were within 10-15 minutes of their location … dinner at sunset in the gazebo was breathtaking depending on the time of year u can use their provided tower heater which was an absolute bonus that was tastefully provided … all in all abbeys place is the escape, adventure or even the reset u need … I highly recommend this place hands down …."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Abbey was an amazing host! The home was so beautiful, just like the pictures. The Chai tea was one of the best teas we’ve had. Asha was so kind to prep this for us. Overall, this was the best treehouse ever. We can’t wait to return for our second visit. Thank you so much Abbey!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were traveling to Wisconsin for our 25th anniversary, and found the space cozy and inviting, along with some very sweet personal touches from the hosts."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a blast and the place was just as we accepted definitely coming back soon and Abey we really enjoyed the home made tea you offered thank you for everything
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Abey was super kind, and very responsive! We had a nice little getaway for a night. The rose petals and ambience was great :) the extra romance package was worth it :) good atmosphere to spend our anniversary on :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a lovely spot to unwind! Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and beautiful getaway.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You wont know until you get to the back yard area and everything changes into a very beautiful scenery and quite home that have been set
for you. We enjoyed staying here and the host was so kind and always checking on us to make sure we are doing well. its worth the money we spend at this place.
Thanks for creating a beatiful place for us."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy and relaxing stay. Felt like we stayed with family because they were so welcoming. We opted in for a decorated gazebo evening that will always be remembered. A very unique and gorgeous stay in Racine I highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had the most amazing experience here! Abey was not only very welcoming but also gave great recommendations for things we could do around the city as well as having a beautiful gazebo set up when we got there to spend time outside. Everything inside was even more spectacular! Will definitely be staying here again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very nice stay 😊loved it definitely will be coming back . very peaceful place
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We got engaged here and the hosts were very accommodating and amazing in helping with setting up a wedding proposal. 1000000% recommend
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time here for our honeymoon. The place was very well designed and the hosts were incredible. They provided us with many special details to make our stay feel very customized and celebratory of us. There was even homemade wine and chai tea. The space itself was very nice and had everything we needed. You should be aware that this is not a completely separate unit, if you are looking for total privacy. The family was very kind and respectful, but you are aware of the fact that a family is living upstairs during your stay. This suburban home is close to the beach, and being from chicago it was very nice to be on a beach that was easy to get to and not overcrowded. Would stay again"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Abey’s space was magical, therapeutic, and relaxing. All details are very thoughtfully attended to, communication was top notch, and they were extremely pleasant and gracious hosts. We thoroughly enjoyed the homemade mulled wine offered to us… it was the very best mulled wine I have ever had! We wish we could have stayed for more than one night. We hope to return back! Thanks for an amazing stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The best hosts we have ever had. They are amazing! The creek and porch are so peaceful. The bed was super comfy. We love having out in the gazebo and Abey made us the BEST mulled wine.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charming
After camping the previous couple nights, we had a delightful stay at this incredibly cozy residence. Not only did our hosts make us delicious chai and recommend a great spot for dinner, but Abey was kind enough to share her chai recipe upon request. We’re so glad to have had the opportunity to relax at the Treehouse and connect with such warm individuals. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,First time ever staying at an air bnb. It was a really great experience.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We went here to celebrate our 15th Wedding Anniversary. We had such a wonderful time. The place and the view was exactly as described. It was very clean and decorated beautifully. We definitely recommend.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,was nicely decorated and peaceful. We loved the note and wine the left for us. Only recommendation is to bring your own amenities.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"excellent place to stay as a couple, enjoy every minute of your stay, you must take into account that it is their basement so do not expect 100% privacy because they live there but they do not bother or anything on the contrary. They are super attentive and pleasant. I only mention it for those looking for something more private, but I loved the place is peaceful and very magical"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time nice and peaceful and a beautiful home with plenty to do all around with a fresh cup of authentic Chai tea to start the day hope to be back next year thanks again 🙂 .
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here for one night. It rained almost the whole day, but spent inside most of the time. Beautiful overlook and gazebo. Clean place and they responded within thirty minutes to any questions. It was a lower level of a bedroom, bathroom, dining room and living room. I thank them for their hospitality. I enjoyed the morning chai."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a great stay, didn’t have to interact with anyone and just had a great space all to ourselves."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time at the Treehouse and we will be back again soon!
Abey and his wife are amazing hosts along with his two kids who became fast friends with my daughter.
The attention to detail was everywhere; the towels were done like a hotel, there were new areas and new things (like the fish) and the ravine is always beautiful.
This is an unique getaway for couples or a family; and it’s less than 90 minutes from Chicago.
We are already planning our next trip back this fall!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,the place was wonderful and host was very communicative and helpful!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Abey’s communication is 11/10. Amazing place with a great community around. The perfect weekend stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we checked in the layout was very beautiful and the host even had a bottle of wine waiting for us upon arrival. The outlook from the backyard makes it feel as if you're in the middle of the woods and seclusion, but you're right in town. There were a few issues which the host happily rectified with no issues. The lights in the lounge area on the patio were out, and it was rainy during out stay, so we didnt get to enjoy the patio of firepit. We made a stop at the local beach area with some food options and entertainment. The location is also 3 minutes from a kwik trip in case of any late night needs. Beside those few hiccups we enjoyed our stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We’ve stayed here multiple times. Always a pleasure staying here. Beautiful little getaway! They are awesome hosts and go above and beyond!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing experience! I stumbled on this place by accident but definitely exceeded my expectations! The place was so peaceful, and the host was attentive! My wife and I just got married on Saturday and traveled cross country. The host added some very special details, like giving us a bottle of champagne and decorating the room and the tree house!
If I am ever in Racine or around this area, I will definitely be staying here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay at this amazing treehouse getaway! Abey helped make an amazing experience a 1 of a kind experience. Would highly recommend to anyone trying to really add a special touch to a special occasion. Thanks Abey for letting us stay in your treehouse!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place, beautiful scenery, Great host. Everything is as described, book this i promise you won’t regret it."
2023-07-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"This review is difficult because the hosts are nice people. It is in a busy neighborhood buzzing with kiddos. We got caught in an unwanted, long conversation w/the host each time we left or returned. Not expecting a hotel, but annoyed at the lack of respect for our time&privacy. Loud neighbor. Not worth the EXTRA $100 for wine&roses to dine in the gazebo. We laughed at Cheeto crumbs from a previous guest. Brought our dinner. Not included in fees. Behind is a hidden 18-hole golf course. Noisy golfers & carts early a.m. and the crack of the ball. Low ceilings. Boyfriend 6'0"" kept bumping his head. Space is in the basement & smells of cooking. Bad bathroom. Standing water in sink. Left Draino outside for us to fix. Didn't try to fix when we were out. Toilet kept running. Shower door is half the size of a standard. No handheld as pictured. Corner shower. I am 5""1' & was claustrophobic. Mold on door&tiles. The ""Treehouse"" & space look much better in pictures. Misrepresented & Disappointed!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a nice, relaxing stay. The stormy weather prevented us from using the outdoor space, but that is obviously out of anyone’s control. Abey was very accommodating and made sure to check in with us during our stay to make sure we were comfortable and had what we needed."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Remember ""Edward Scissorhands"" where a strange mansion is at the end of a suburban development? Well, this isn't a strange mansion, it's a totally surprising, fun, & romantic private apartment facing a deep forested ravine, and it's only steps from a very typical suburban scene with 1970s ranch houses. Visiting this may be as close as you ever get to walking into the wardrobe in ""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe."" It's actually not a treehouse. It's a deck, built out over a steep slope so you're up among the trees. The ownder built the deck around one tree, and right next to others. The most magical thing for us wasn't the sweet gazebo with its candles, but the view from the bedroom window, which is an uninterrupted forest, seen from close up, and high in the trees, like a bird might. The host is a total sweetheart, and the place is a gem."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,They really add the extra touches to make you feel welcomed in a calming romantic getaway!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a bargain. I was looking for a quiet, peaceful evening. It delivered. The whole experience was simple, straightforward, and pleasant. A++"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Abey was such a great host! She had everything set up so special for us to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. We will be back and would also like to check out their other spots they host at. Thanks so much again!!!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The airbnb is exactly as described and pictured. It’s a beautiful spot which is incredibly cozy and tastefully decorated. The host is lovely and accommodating, and they even left a bottle of wine for us. There were little touches that were so appreciated like a specific cloth for removing makeup.
One thing of note: I’m not sure it was worth the price overall. I’ve spent less on ocean front airbnbs in much more sought after destinations."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host! Nice and cozy atmosphere. 😊
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful time and hope to be back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Abey & Asha for the wonderful stay! Such a beautiful spot you have. This was absolutely perfect & just what we wanted for our small wedding ceremony/elopement. Hosts we're very kind & very communicative; always checking in & making sure we had everything we needed. The decorations were a nice cute touch too. Thank you again for everything! That will be a weekend we won't ever forget!
-Bree & Luke"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and peaceful. Stayed here for my partner's birthday and we played the new Zelda game looking out at nature ☺️. In the morning the host made us spicy chai tea while we drew/sketched in the Gazebo. Asha was a gracious host and checked in with us regularly to see if there was anything we needed. The location is easy to find and nearby great places to eat. We had a great time!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Abbey’s treehouse apartment was unique, charming, and tranquil. Check-in was a breeze and the apartment had everything we needed. Whether you’re looking for a romantic getaway or a relaxing getaway to unplug, this is a place to check out. My husband and I highly recommend!!!"
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Place was good but needs some maintenance and amenities as in the description
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Abey was out of town but Asha took care of everything. Her communication was excellent. It was colder than expected when we went so she brought my husband and I some homemade mulled wine and it was amazing!! She went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. I wish the weather would have been better so we could have used the outside amenities.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place for a get away with my wife for a baby moon! Def need to take Abey up on the chai tea offer! Deck is beautiful to hang out on and the stay is nice and private. We also opted in to the charcuterie board and wine - did not disappoint! We’d love to come back and explore more of Racine.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place os absolutely gorgeous. Just like the pictures. Its warm inviting, many thoughtful and intentional touches in the decor. Gives an cabin in the woods vibe while being extremly luxury on the inside. Peaceful and was perfect for my recharge staycation. Will be visiting again.
Host super inviting, gave privacy and even served a wonderful chai tea."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful space and responsive host. Feels like it is the middle of the woods despite being very suburban. Great amenities.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great getaway! Suprised my girlfriend for our anniversary here and it was perfect. Abey had communication with me via text and Airbnb the whole trip and was there for anything I needed. The gazebo and the charcuterie is a must!!! Such a peaceful + romantic touch, definitely what sold me. The daybed + chair by the private deck was so perfect to sit and enjoy coffee and the homemade chai that was offered. And the inside of the BNB was so luxurious and comfortable. I had such an amazing time"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I’ve been to many airbnbs this one has been my favorite by far! I am so sad I didn’t have more time here. Abey was the best host ever! I highly highly recommend this little gem! Thank you Abey for opening up your space for others to experience it’s beauty!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts! Communicated well and checked up on us to make sure our stay was peaceful and going smoothly. Made great chai tea for us both!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I felt so cozy and peaceful at Abey’s treehouse. It was so nice to sit out on the deck watching the birds and wildlife in the wooded area. Also a small stream running right below that give you so much to take in. Local restaurants and downtown area were great quality and unique!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at many Airbnb's and Abey was absolutely amazing with excellent communication, the treehouse was so peaceful and he decorated it absolutely beautiful for my husbands birthday. I highly recommend this place to anyone that just needs a stress free place to relax. We will definitely be visiting again.
Shanon and Marty"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough great things about my stay. Somehow, the space manages to have a lovely dose of the outdoors, elegance, coziness, and feel private even while part of the hosts' home - yes, completely separate entrance and total privacy, but still... it doesn't always go that way.
Abey and Asha are absolutely wonderful. The weather turned my first day and it was snowing and cold - they offered up warm homemade chai, though I was already off to one of their recommended brunch places, which was so amazing I went back the next day as well. I did take them up on the offer the second day, and the skies had cleared - sitting outside amongst pillows and blankets to keep the chill off and listening to the birds and total peace... it was truly wonderful.
The photos and descriptions are accurate; I had no issue with wifi on a video call. Comfy bed, great living space, and unique outdoor spaces. I will absolutely be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a fantastic stat, Abey was more than accommodating and even helped me with my plans. Thank you for the stay and the support."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The tree house getaway was just like how it's described and what's pictured. Waking up to the beautiful scenery made us feel like we were in a different part of the world. The trees, the little creek and the sounds of birds in the morning were so dreamy.

Abey was very polite and he checked in with us every day, making sure we were doing ok and asking if we needed anything. We checked in quite late and I was worried he'd be upset, but he was very understanding and was even checking in on us late at night to see if everything was okay. We also went for a birthday getaway and Abey was so kind to put up balloons and gave us a bottle of champagne as complimentary gifts. I was overwhelmed by his acts of kindness. ♡
After we left, I realized I lost my watch and he even went to look personally with his little kiddos to see if they could find it. I'm so touched by his kindness, I cannot thank him enough.
We will surely go again during the warmer season. ♥️"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay. The view is stunning and Abey was very responsive to our questions and requests!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very accommodating and cozy! Abey even put up a cute HBD sign in the gazebo.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Abey’s place is by far my top airbnbs that i have stayed in. We loved how cozy and warm it felt. Everything about it made it feel like at home but even better. The pictures doesn’t do it justice. The place is super cozy and warm and im definitely booking again. Abey and her husband are super responsive and accommodating. We loved the Chai they made us while sitting in the gazebo.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! We were met with roses, Prosecco, and a charcuterie board when we arrived and loved it! Being Wisconsin in March we had sunshine, rain, and also a snowstorm and there was a great spot for us to enjoy each one. The gazebo was magical and the heater kept us toasty into the evening. The daybed was perfect for an afternoon reading in the sun. And the sofa was cozy when the snow came! All in all, a great place to stay and close to restaurants and hiking trails. Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,abey was very friendly and responsive. beautiful place to stay great decorations.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time here! The views outside are absolutely gorgeous, and the inside was nice, homey and comfortable. I came for a mental break vacation for my brain, and I would absolutely come back again!"

The host was very friendly and responsive to my messages, and I appreciated the little touches like fresh towels and a welcome signs and decoration for bday was perfect and arrangements were thoughtful. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to other travelers!"""
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a nice time. The back deck is just like the pictures - it is very nice. The guest property has many details to make it a nice stay. The location is in the basement of a house. The stairs have been blockaded with pillows and blankets. We could hear the people in the upstairs of the house (of course, this is unavoidable), but it made the experience feel less private and relaxing. We had a nice time and did not regret staying there, but it was not a ""homerun"" for us."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a beautiful place and the host was very responsive and accommodating to all my requests :) would be a better summer or fall location, kind of cold to really enjoy the outdoor deck stuff"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It’s was awesome! Enjoyed every minute of our stay & they decorated for Valentine’s Day before we arrived! Definitely will be coming back!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Abby's tree house was an amazing and very relaxing experience for us.
Every detail of the decor and the gifts they have for their guests make you feel welcome from the minute you walk in the house.
The nature surrounding the place is beautiful, making it a very peaceful experience.
Overall, we loved this place and would recommend it to anyone looking for comfort, coziness, peace, and quiet.
Thanks Abby! ❤️"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The host was very accommodating to our requests. Beautiful place with great surroundings and layout. We felt right at home. Everything was set up perfectly to make it the perfect weekend stay.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience for my 21st birthday here. There were even personalized notes for me around the space and a little gift for my birthday! We were greeted with the BEST CHAI I HAVE EVER HAD in the morning, and if we had any questions Abey would swiftly respond.
If you are looking to relax over a beautiful view, look no further. The sound of flowing water never stops from the creek, adding in a beautiful white noise for a perfect night’s sleep. We were lucky enough to experience this in the rain too!
Thank you Abey- you made my 21st such a special occasion and I could not have picked a better location to celebrate!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I am a local who needed a staycation for a night to detox from the stresses of life. This was an absolute beautiful home with a lovely view of the woods and a small river creek running behind it. The view is absolutely stunning and the gazebo is wonderful to sit in at night. Wonderful hosts who are thoughtful, helpful and intentional. Will be staying again for sure!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Abbey made this feel like a real getaway. Always friendly and ready to offer help and hospitality.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My mom and I had a great evening. Everything was super clean and they included some cute gifts/personal touches. I let my mom take the bed and I used the air mattress that was provided. It was super easy to set up, comfortable and easy to take down. We used their Netflix account and had a great time hanging out and sipping on a few adult beverages."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful, peaceful getaway. The view is is beautiful - overlooking a creek and trees. The place was clean, cozy, and inviting."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Home away from home! It was such a beautiful treehouse and the sensory was so breathtaking. Will definitely be back!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Abey and Asha were AMAZING hosts! My boyfriend and I celebrated his birthday for a week at this beautiful get away. They communicated so well to us, made sure everything was good, and kept reassuring us if we needed anything to let them know. We were greeted with a bottle of champagne and cute notes! They even made some homemade, amazing mulled wine for us on a night that we spent in the gazebo. We had so many friends and family ask where this beautiful location was. We will definitely be back in the summer to experience the outdoors! One of the most relaxing vacations we had. They even had a small gift for us on our last day there. 10/10!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had rented this out for my sister’s anniversary. She didnt know where we were going on the drive there. While we were driving her to the location, her bf was making dinner for her, setting candles and such.
Once we got there she was extremely shocked once we told her she was staying.
I want to thank Abey for being an excellent host and not asking for my sister’s info and sending her stuff.
Its extremely hard to surprise her since she always finds out. Im glad we can finally say we surprised her.
Overall the place was really clean, up to date with the furniture. If I forgot to put something in my sisters bag then she was able to drive/walk to places(Walgreen's….etc)"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were fantastic and extremely responsive the entire time. We also received a long list of recommendations.
2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for sharing your space with us.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First of all thank you Abey for hosting us. This place is in a great location to get away from the city life. People from Chicago would love to here as it’s only an hour 30th it’s away. If you are looking for good calm and cozy, comfortable night out or two this is the place to be. Host are really nice and friendly people. They respond to your messages in a very timely manner (honestly didn’t expect this quick of a turnaround). Photos definitely do not do the justice to this place. You should experience it first hand and see it for yourself. Most of the places are closed on the Sunday so prepare for food options in advance. (Might be different in the summer).
However the property in itself is clean and spotless. Lots of cozy blankets to feel the warmth in winder weather and very comfortable sofa and bed. Be sure to experience the amazing gazebo to have a drink or just to experience the nature. Abey has done an amazing job at decorating the gazebo, lots of personal touches x"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The accommodations were lovely. Thank you so much for everything - we will definitely return to one of owner's other properties!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved this place!! So cozy and warm!! Perfect getaway from Chicago.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Traveled back home to have our daughter, this is probably one of the best Airbnbs in Racine. The location was perfect for us because we needed to be near the hospital. This place is private & gorgeous. The kitchen had everything we needed in order to prepare a meal. The welcome gift made it even more special. No detail was missed. Hosts are friendly and responsive. The view is gorgeous & it was a 10/10!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was everything that I needed. The scenery was so peaceful and beautiful. I couldn’t help but to sleep with the curtains open! The gazebo and outside sitting deck is just perfect for relaxing and eating. Thanks so much for sharing your space Abey and Asha. Thanks for the wine as well😁
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you Abey & Asha for welcoming us and providing the BEST Service ever! The spicy wine and the tea were so delicious. You truly put your special touch to make the experience more unique. We are excited to further connect and possibly
wolk together in the future! And we want visit your other AIRBNBs.
Best Wishes & Love

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was very beautiful! A nice overnight secluded area for my boyfriend and I.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time! Highly recommend staying at this Airbnb. Great amenities and very peaceful area.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was by far the cutest Airbnb we have ever stayed in. From the little patio outside the front door to the champagne waiting for us inside it was absolutely beautiful. Abey was so kind and made sure to make us feel at home! This is exactly what my girlfriend and I needed. If you are looking for a weekend getaway with your significant other this is your place!
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The views of the creek and cozy sitting areas were perfect! I think this place would be amazing to visit in the warmer seasons.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Abey was very responsive and was available when needed. He brought us mulled wine Friday night she chai tea the next morning. He was so friendly and accommodating!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I booked this to help with my friends proposal! The hosts were incredibly helpful and patient. They worked with all of our accommodations in order for the moment to be perfect. Beautiful location and excellent communication. Highly recommend.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here on our honeymoon and it felt like our home away from home! Beautiful scenery just outside our door and very peaceful. We enjoyed every minute of our stay. The mulled wine was absolutely divine. Thank you again for everything!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodation was magnificent! very romantic, the host was super welcoming on the check in, they were super kind offering us their homemade wine, and also we had an easy communication (but we still had privacy). Thanks Abey! We will be back!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Honestly the best airbnb experience I’ve had to date. The hosts went above and beyond to make our stay feel like home and the place itself is much better than the pictures - even though the pictures themselves are amazing - I feel like most of the time airbnb listings are made to seem a lot more than what they truly are. This location is everything in the listing and much more. I can only hope to be lucky enough to find this spot available again next time I’m in town. 10/10 would recommend.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay so much. The porch was lovey and felt very private! Many thanks to Abey for being a great host!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Abey was a wonderful host and they did a beautiful job on the space. We really enjoyed the restaurant recommendations he made and had a lovely stay!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I stayed at Abey’s place for a few days in November 2022. It snowed a bit throughout our stay, and with the woodsy private apartment and electric fireplace, it was the perfect way to spend a few days resting and relaxing. It was clean and tidy. The daybed made a nice addition - perfect for bundling up and having some tea and watching the skid fall on the creek. Abey’s homemade mulled wine was excellent, as was his timely responses throughout our stay. We will certainly be back soon!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home has a VERY special place in my heart. I travel quite a bit, but the calm and peace I feel here is unmatched. The place is well equipped as a place you never have to leave, but if you choose to downtown Racine is lovely and his recommendations for food are excellent. The italian place nearby has several options for handmade pasta! Abbey makes you homemade, out-of-this-world Chai Tea and mulled wine, with spices from India. They aren't just a nice touch, they are soul-filling."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is a sensational experience, besides the place that is beautiful, Abey is an incredible man. He would definitely choose them again"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space for a nice quiet stay. Get a sense of being in the trees with the beautiful deck and the hosts are hospitable and kind. They have prepared a comfortable elegant space for you to enjoy!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An amazing experience! Very warm welcome! Loved every second of our stay
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful place tucked away in the woods. You do not need a reason to spend a day here. The crisp fall weather, the delightful aromatic “elaichi” chai from our gracious host, made it one special day for us. Thank you for hosting us."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely location, very accessible host. Easy check in. Chai as good as promised."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great space to spend some time on the deck and enjoy the beautiful fall colors. Abey and family were gracious guests and the vibe was very homey. I was able to hear a bit of ambient noise from the floor above, but not enough to have a negative impact on my stay. Also, great hiking nearby and very convenient location to amenities/shopping and not too far from downtown!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful experience, and loved Abey and his family. We did cooking classes for an additional fee, which was great and tasty. We can’t wait to stay at the treehouse again! Super cozy, and great for a weekend trip for Chicagoans."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great! Thank you!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I enjoyed our time staying here! Such a beautiful view, it doesn't at all feel like you are in town.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a very relaxing stay!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great time staying here! It was a cool experience and a good location.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"aahhh The Treehouse was such a treat. The view from the lower deck was green leaves, tall trees and the creek. Quiet and private. The inside living area was comfortable, clean and spacious. I'm usually a bit wary about staying in a unit that is attached to the owners home. The space felt private and quiet. Abey is such a thoughtful and considerate host. Top notch communications, easy check in and check out. And we were fortunate to enjoy his delicious and wonderful Chai! Look forward to enjoying this space again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"amazing home, very thoughtful hosts. was perfect for a quick getaway!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend the treehouse Airbnb. The inside was clean and nicely decorated. The outside is bliss! The back deck has a fantastic view . There is a daybed that I used to read and relax. The gazebo is the gem of the rental , My husband and I enjoy having picnics in places we travel. The gazebo is perfect for a family meal or a romantic private picnic. Abey and Asha were perfect hosts, they checked in to make sure our stay was enjoyable. There was even a bottle of wine greeting us upon our arrival, I give this amazing place a 5 🌲 🌲 🌲 🌲 🌲 rating 😊😊"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying at their property -- I'll be back!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Spacious Apartment. Very well kept! Loved seeing the lake In the distance. Great location
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rick N Kristina’s place was breathtaking, classy, and relaxing. The hosts provided clear access instructions and guidance before check in and everything was clean and comfortable for our arrival! I spent the night there before my wedding and it was a perfect place to get ready! My husband and I spent our wedding night there together and were very happy to have found this spot. Close to everything and it was a perfect setting to start off our next adventure together! Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The location is great! The place was also really clean and spacious. Parking was awesome! Really enjoyed my stay here.

They make the whole stay pleasant and memorable! We will be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very responsive hosts, when we arrived the smoke detector battery alarm was beeping. We informed the hosts and they sent someone to take care of it right away.
The place is beautifully updated, comfortable and located in a great area of Racine with views of Lake Michigan. Highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely gorgeous apartment. Loved the calm and relaxing vibe. The secluded entry area made it feel like no one even know you were there. Definitely worth staying at.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful and quiet! Needed a quiet spot to focus on a few tasks and this was perfect. The Pub directly across the street did not generate any noise. Restaurant below the unit is closed, so that wasn't an issue.
Everything was nice and clean, appliances worked. Kitchen well-equipped.
Despite no operable windows, the unit was not stuffy-HVAC/ventilation work great! If a light sleeper uses the Murphy bed, they might want earplugs. HVAC blower was noisy in the main room. Bedroom was quiet.
Enjoyed the glimpses of the lake. New construction reduced the view but it's great to have Lake Michigan so close by for walking. The view of sailboat masts definitely signals a large body of water nearby.
Parking garage is now at $3.50 day per ticket pull, no in/out. Floors are numbered so one level is half/half, eg: 3S/4N or similar. The check in instructions cleared this up by noting the address to look for on the entrance door into the apartment. Three shallow steps to get into the unit."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I felt right at home. Everything that I have at my own home was available at their property…and some items were identical. Private, safe, and comfort is the best way to describe my stay. I have to say kudos to the decorum, it was spot on. Hopefully it will be available for the next I visit. I can not imagine staying anywhere else."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great place to stay!
I stayed here for several weeks while on a long work trip. I’ve stayed in a few other Airbnbs in the area and this was by far my factor. It’s Very private with direct access to main St. Not to mention the covered parking. Would stay again 👍🏻"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rick & Kristina were amazing hosts who communicate so well. Their place is set up perfectly, and such a well decorated place. This is a perfect place almost everything you need is in walking distance. We will definitely be back."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay at this location! It was one of those trips where we had a ton packed in and I wished we had had even more time to spend in the place itself. It was beautiful and pristine! I’d definitely stay again and would recommend in a heartbeat! The host gave extremely clear instructions for getting in and it was all so easy!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The unit was great and very clean. It’s in downtown so lots to do close by and you’re close enough to take a stroll around the harbor. Hosts were very responsive and made sure the instructions to get in were clear. I definitely recommend to anyone going to Racine.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the third time we have booked one of Rick N Kristina's places. We love staying in downtown Racine as everything is walkable--restaurants, bars, stores, pharmacy, outdoor bands/festivals. Plus the harbor has beautiful walking areas as well. R&K are extremely responsive to all issues, questions, any problems that arise. They are awesome. We even had a storm with power/internet issues this time around, and they kept us updated on that throughout! I have many physical challenges, and R&K accommodated every question and concern I had. This is why my husband, my family, and I keep coming back to them and will continue to come back to their Airbnbs. They keep their places in great shape, very clean, and again, are always extremely responsive and respectful to our needs. They are the top on our list of people we have rented from and we have rented many Airbnbs and VRBOs. Thanks again you two for being awesome this past week 👏--we had a great time!!!! Steve and Tanni"

I’d definitely stay here again."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment in downtown Racine was absolutely stunning. It was spotless upon arrival, had a ton of extra amenities, and felt so comfortable. The location was perfect to a lot of wonderful shops and restaurants. There was some construction going on in the building and the hosts were super responsive and apologetic though it wasn't anything they could control. I will absolutely stay at this place again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I have stayed twice more in this apartment, everything is very nice, clean and equipped spacious rooms, very comfortable covered parking and two steps from the apartment.
Close to shops, pubs, restaurants.
Highly recommended"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We loved our stay at Rick and Kristina’s place! The apartment served as home base for a couple of weeks as we caught some of our son’s games at Carthage. We loved its convenience, amenities and elbow room. It was very quiet - even over St Patrick’s Day! The beds are extremely comfortable, the kitchen is well stocked with essential tools for cooking. We will be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was spotless, gorgeous and had views of Lake Michigan. Will be booking this place any time I have family stay in town!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Clean comfortable apartment close to shop, restaurants and bar.
Excellent place to park the car...
I will be back"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an especially nice Airbnb! I loved the urban setting and the loft-like feeling of the place. The decor is smart and modern, it was absolutely spotless, the bed and other furniture are comfortable, and it is very spacious. The bathroom is fantastic: huge, stylish, great shower. The desk was perfect as this was a work retreat for me. It's a little bit quirky, which I loved: drive-up entrance, murphy bed, mystery door in the living room and windowless bedroom ... all add to the charm and fun of this space. I was traveling solo so didn't need the murphy bed but that is a much nicer option than a sofabed. I enjoyed my stay so much, I extended an extra day. I'd definitely stay here again the next time I need to be in Racine. This would be a perfect place for a longer stay. Thanks for everything!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always a great stay and Rick and Kristina’s! A pleasure to stay
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely space. We hope to stay here again some time.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at a couple of Rick N Kristina’s airbnb many times. We keep coming back because of the beautiful clean apartments at a very good price.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was our second extended stay. We had no issues or problems. Great location, can walk to restaurants and the lake. Already booked another visit. Is our go to place in Racine."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was SO pleased with my stay and Rick & Kristina’s! So accurate of description and very clean. They were so responsive if I had a concern/question. Went out of their way to make sure all was well. Definitely will stay again! :)

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed in the apartment 9/15-9/19. Very clean, well appointed and spacious. Great bathroom with lots of storage and shampoo, conditioner and shower gel provided. The bed was very comfy and lots of hangers provided in the walk-in closet. Having access to a washer and dryer was wonderful. Great downtown location near Lake Michigan, close to shopping and restaurants. Nice to get up in the morning for a walk to the marina and back. Or, walk down a few blocks to have breakfast at a restaurant in Monument Square. I will definitely stay here again when back in Racine."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had another wonderful stay here! It’s so clean and quiet. The hosts are great and there’s a very nice view of the lake. I highly recommend!

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I had an amazing stay with Rick and Kristina! The interior was fabulous and I was throughly informed and welcomed before as well as during my stay on getting familiar with the Racine area and if I ever needed a questions answered! These amazing hosts previously had guests that weren’t compliant with their no policies and Rick and Kristina were more than honest and accountable over the situation. Air filters were set up and I appreciated the concern shown over the matter. I was doing an extended stay and as a young women, I felt safe and had an amazing experience over all! I left wishing this could be my own place! Please give these amazing people your business, I have nothing but positive remarks!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Back for a second stay! Still clean, quiet, well located and spacious."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,All the necessary items of home. Plenty of dishes & cookware. The bathroom was like a spa. Loved being in the heart of walkable downtown.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I loved this place. It’s very nice and clean. Super easy to get to and in a very convenient area. The hosts were great with very quick responses
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Amazingly spacious unit with lake views and a snazzy large bathroom, newly done. If you have to work during your stay, the large desk facing the windows is both functional and pleasant. Location can’t be beat for access to great food and walks/runs along the harbor. Don’t miss the donuts at Main Street Bakery! Rick N Kristina provided everything one could need and were very responsive."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is outstanding, spacious and well provisioned. When you walk in the door, you will be like, WOW, this is an amazing space. There is an excellent work space, with fast WiFi and the cell service rocks. There is a well provisioned kitchen, and lights everywhere. Yet, just about all of the lights have a dimmer, so you can adjust the atmosphere. The bed is very comfortable, as are the couches. The shower has great water pressure, and no shortage of hot water. There is a great view of Lake Michigan (windows face east). I have stayed in countless Airbnb accommodations, and this one is perhaps at the top of that list. The host is exceptionally responsive and gracious."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a brief but lovely stay in this beautiful apartment right on Main Street. Would love to come back for a longer visit during the warmer months and enjoy walking along the lakefront and exploring the local shops and restaurants
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"great communication! Nice place to stay, covered parking was such a plus in the winter."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host clean and beautiful place for the price
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rick and Kristina are excellent hosts. Their places are exactly how they look on the site. They have everything you need and are easy to reach.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location and very comfortable accommodations. Everything we needed was included with the stay. Slept great. I enjoyed a morning jog along the lakefront, and walking to some local restaurants and shops. Will stay again!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a very stylish BnB in Racine and one I would recommend you don't pass up. The private entrance seems a misnomer because it is located in a public parking garage. But it's not. It is private and located feet from the door. I feel that the online pictures did not do the space justice. The moment you open the door to the space, you know there is something special. The light flower fragrance and beautiful hardwood floors greet you. High-end craftsmanship and luxury interior design are married beautifully in the newly, designed bathroom and throughout the space. The bedroom is designed to be truly a retreat for sleeping and closets have plenty of space for luggage. There is an extra bed in the living room for more guests. The kitchen is well stocked to meet your everyday needs. Appliances are functional and contemporary. The long bar countertop space comfortably sits six for eating. The living room with high ceiling is perfect for relaxing and watching TV. This space is well-priced and better than staying in a hotel."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was our third time staying at this incredible apartment. Rick and Christina have included so many thoughtful touches to make the apartment feel like home. They are terrific hosts and quickly respond to any inquiries. As the winter weather approaches we really appreciated the ease of covered parking ($2) right outside our door. Highly recommended.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rick N Kristina’s place is awesome!!! It is well laid out, well decorated and if your looking for a place in Racine/Kenosha area, it’s perfect.
They communicate well and are great hosts!!! We spent the weekend and will definitely come back."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it was our second time here and it was just as amazing! the place is beautiful and the hosts are great!

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the place was soo beautiful and clean! they were super nice and quick to respond! I'll definitely stay again!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved this unit. I loved the proximity to the lakefront. Main street has so many wonderful shops and restaurants. We were in town for a wedding but this also turned into a very peaceful and relaxing getaway simply because of this apartment. We may stay here again even though we have family here and typically don’t have to rent. But this unit is so amazing and so worth it.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic spot amazing view! Top notch hosts…

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Airbnb's that we've stayed in. It's very clean, and modern yet homey. Great location and you can tell that the hosts go out of their way to give guests a wonderful stay. Located by lots of restaurants and just a quick walk to the water. Racine is a city with very sweet, laid back people."
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My visit was for work, I had a great workspace, full kitchen, comfortable bed, Rick and Kristina were very responsive. perfect hosts!!!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Condo beautifully and thoughtfully outfitted! Instantly responsive hosts.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in this lovely apartment. It was immaculate, it had everything you could need, it was in a great location and was decorated so nicely. There are great restaurants and shopping within walking distance. There is a grest Mexican restaurant right downstairs that we really enjoyed. The pictures of the apartment don't do it justice. I am very picky about the places I stay, and I was very pleased with this apartment."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect accommodation description, nothing was left out. If anything, we believe they undercharge and understate their property. Communication was always less than 24hrs when not on property and less than an 1hr during our stay.
Would definitely recommend."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space is amazing! I enjoy seeing the lake when I’m in Racine and although this doesn’t sit on the water I still could look out the window and see it. The host’s have thought of everything and the pictures do not lie! Definitely will be back!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect, modern apartment. Love the entrance from the parking garage. Great view of the lake"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my time there. The apartment was comfortable and clean. Great location. Everything was good.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The space was wonderful. A lot bigger than expected and the view of the lake was a wonderful surprise. It was my first time back in town after my parents sold the home I grew up in and it was nice to have such a homey place to stay.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great hosts! They responded in a very timely manner to our questions and helped with suggestions on things to do!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was great! Very cute, good location, and had everything we needed!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is absolutely amazing. The location is great; really close to the beach! Rick and Kristina couldn’t have been more helpful. They contacted us back immediately when we had questions. I can’t say enough good things about our stay. We were extremely happy!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb was absolutely perfect in every way! Beautiful, spacious space with incredibly thoughtful touches (coffee pods, popcorn bags, chargers, water bottles, shampoo/conditioner/body wash, etc..) - the bed is also unbelievably comfortable. The bathroom and shower set up felt like a spa, and the location couldn’t be better for the area. The taco spot downstairs was great, and being able to walk to the lake and marina was perfect. Very appreciative for our mini getaway and beautiful space to enjoy!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was the perfect anniversary getaway. Right in the action downtown with restaurants and activities within walking distance. Even though it was an added cost, parking in the ramp gave us a nice sense of security in an unfamiliar town. The apartment was as advertised and was extremely well appointed. We were especially grateful for the technology upgrades, including the cell phone charging pads. There were a couple of minor hiccups, but Rick N Kristina were very prompt in responding to texts and getting things resolved. We wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking for a room in Racine!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding quality and value. Very safe neighborhood with coffee and taco shops right on the block. The beach is outstanding and you can walk the shoreline in both directions. Fabulous hosts.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing hosts who thought of everything for us. They went out of their way to make us feel welcomed into the space. The place was gorgeous and we felt very much at home there.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location and
plenty of space."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great spot for a weekend get away. The communication was awesome andthe place was clean and beautiful. I would recommend this spot to anyone and would highly go to this spot again.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is in my top ten AirBnB’s. Beautifully decorated, well furnished kitchen, lots of outlets for electronics, and comfortable beds. Bonus: the triad of living room windows, providing beautiful views in any weather and streaming sunshine on clear days."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was such a great place had a wonderful view and the furnishings were fantastic and clean. And communication was great between us and the owners upon arrival. We loved it and we will recommend it to friends and family!

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean, awesome home and friendly hosts. Couldn’t have chosen a better place to stay!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rick & Kristina's place was all I could ask for. It was comfortable and quiet, private but convenient. Thanks so much!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is an incredible apartment right on Main Street. It is larger than some Airbnb houses that we have rented in the past. It is outfitted with upscale furniture and linens. The large desk is perfect for work-from-home and the kitchen is outfitted for preparing full meals (if you wish). We stayed for almost three weeks and were sad when we had to leave our home-away-from-home. We hope the apartment is available the next time we come to Racine.
Rick and Kristina are very easy to communicate with and were quick to respond to our questions and any issues.
When you stay at the apartment don’t miss out on some wonderful Racine restaurants. We had fun and great food at Amos los Tacos. In addition to tacos there is a bowl option that worked out great for our friend who prefers low carb. On a Saturday evening we had an outstanding meal at Butcher & Barrel. Ribeye for my husband and an incredible pork chop for me. Yum!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very nice, clean, and spacious place! Stayed for a few weeks due to temporary work in the area. Set up was perfect for my needs. Rick was very quick to respond to questions."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The apartment is beautiful, but the attention to detail is outstanding. You can tell that the hosts value their guests experience. W
e will definitely be staying here again!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great unit, great location, great value! We've used Airbnb enough to know that the units are rarely, if ever, as nice as the pictures and/or text would suggest. Rick and Kristina's place blows the listing out of the water. Parking really is steps from the front door and a ton of stuff is walkable. Everything in the unit is done really well and it was super clean.
The only knock is that there's a similar unit that shares the living room wall, and the wall is thin. We could hear the TV and people talking when it was quiet in our unit. It wasn't an issue when we were watching TV.
Note that the queen bed in the living room is actually a Murphy bed -- a nice surprise. The king bed in the bedroom was super comfy, too. My wife, daughter, and mother all slept very well the night we were there."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hands down one of the nicest airbnb's I've stayed at. Rick was very fast to response to all questions as well. Would highly recommend to anyone traveling in the area
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,If you are in the area stay here for sure.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed due to inclement weather on our way back to Chicago and Rick was super communicative and flexible with our stay. Handled everything with quick responses. Since the weather made it impossible for us to leave, we relied on the apartment to keep us cozy and occupied. It was wonderful! Cozy and stylish :)"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous place with beautiful decorations and finishes. Apartment sits on the 2nd story above a restaurant and in front of a parking garage so the entrance is a bit unconventional through the parking garage, however the space is wonderful and the lake is so close!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent Airbnb Experience! The Rick and Kristina are great communicators. This unit has everything you would need. We really liked the private entry and the super comfy bedroom. It’s better than my own house!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay. they even havepots and pans for you if you wanna cook
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I Returned for the third time can’t wait to come back!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is spacious, has everything you need for a comfortable stay and is located in a part of Racine that is within walking distance to plenty of shops and restauants. We willdefinitely stay here again in the future."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. Good view of the lake. Close to some good food and tattoo shops! Only things we didn't care for and these are small things that are probably personal preference. But the lighting wasn't the best. Girlfriend couldn't do her makeup in the bathroom. Some of the switches wouldn't work right away and had to mess with it till it turned on. That being said still a great place and not going to take any stars away for the small issues.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ive stayed multiple times and will be staying again. Rick is a great host who has gone out of his way to make sure all arrangements are correct.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy check in process. Beautiful apartment! It was a lot bigger than expected and the photos don’t do it justice. They made sure that we could have everything we possibly needed and then some. I felt like I was at home in Rick and Kristinas place. The town was nice and lots of things to do within walking distance. I highly recommend staying here!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the second time we've stayed at this location. The communication has always been excellent and the weather was nothing short of phenomenal.
if you're looking to explore the area this is a fantastic location. Great restaurants are all within walking distance. The unit is clean, quiet and fun to hang out in. Don't think about it, just book your reservation. Trust me, it'll be the best decision you've made in a long time."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ive stayed multiple times here and have run out of nice things to say. This apartment is hands down the best in all of Racine. Rick is a great host with awsome communication and respone time.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Its an amazing place to stay at, especially for long term stays. Very clean, homie, and feels very welcoming. The entrance is located in a parking garage, so easy access and very private space. With a beautiful lake view."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment was sparkling clean! We could tell there was a lot of thought put into it—everything from having nice, soft towels to having a variety of coffee and tea options. We’d stay here again in a heartbeat! Overall great experience!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay at in the downtown area. It is well thought out and easy to feel comfortable in for vacation stay.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Thank you guys so much. As you know, you are doing a great job. I love the place and wish I could rent it out monthy! It’s much bigger than I thought it would be.
The view, smart tv, the decorations, the furniture, dishes, the small things I never realized I needed in the kitchen and house, and the quick responses and recommendations were stellar. Everything seemed brand new and perfect as if no one else used it before me. The carpet was perfect and my feet were in heaven! The bathroom was exceptional and the details.
The only thing I didn’t like about the place was accessing it. But it did allow me to feel more safe knowing that people couldn’t find it easily. Also the walls are extremely thin. The neighbors across the hall woke me up early every morning because the bedroom is right by the door. I could also hear everything they were saying in their apartment unless they were deep in there. So I didn’t feel as much privacy in the bedroom or bathroom.
Overall I loved it and recommend it 100%
Thank you thank you thank you!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This apartment was perfect! It was much larger than expected. The communication was above and beyond! Perfect location and lake views!

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was great, very cozy. Definitely plan on staying again. Could even see myself living in a place like this. The two entry doors gave me the feeling of being locked in, but the decor and layout make the place feel really welcoming. Every so often you may hear hear various noises from the hallway but it wasn't a big problem. Overall would recommend staying here if you're planning on staying in the area."

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully renovated and decorated accommodations in downtown Racine, walking distance to the shore, shops and restaurants. We were impressed with its spaciousness and quality of the furnishings. Great bathroom, living room, full kitchen, dining area and laundry facilities. Immaculately clean with numerous amenities such as wireless charging stations, Keurig and regular coffee makers, kitchen supplies, extra stock of paper supplies and the list goes on and on. Photos can't capture how nice this place really is.
Communications were prompt and check in and out were super easy.
We would recommend Rick N Kristina's place to everyone and we'd enjoy staying again the next time we are in Racine."

I would definitely recommend staying here, great owners as well who were very helpful and very quick to respond to messages!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent four nights nights in Rick and Kristina’s lovely condo. It is beautifully decorated with every amenity and convenience you could ask for.

We will definitely book again when we visit Racine and will recommend this condo to our friends and family."

We will never stay elsewhere in Racine, and look forward to our next trip there."

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rick N Kristina's place is one that does not disappoint. They have nailed all the details! Location, view, comfort, cleanliness, communication and things you dont even think of... You pause, and think ...hmmm I wonder if there is.... and there it is!!! This stay was far beyond my expectations! I can't wait to have another summer break at the beach. Nicely done!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is beautiful! Spacious apartment with a view. Very quick to respond and provided great recommendations for things to do and places to eat.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Rick N Kristina's place while I was in town for a course for a week and really enjoyed it. It is a very nice place and very close to many amenities. Check out Butcher and Barrel for some great food and an extensive bourbon/whiskey selection. :)
The entrance to the apartment is in a parkade, but dont let that throw you off. It is pretty straight forward you can park right near the entrance, and the parkade parking is only $2 a day!
If I am back through this way, I will be staying here again."
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place looks like the pictures and so much more. It is easy to find, conveniently located and check in process is super simple.

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Aside from it being a very clean and a beautiful space, it was perfect for what we were looking for. The shower was AMAZING and then the bed topped it all off. We will definitely be back!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was above expectations. The kitchen looks like no one has used it,the house was immaculate clean, every detail on the decoration was well plan with sophistication. The only thing to keep in mind is that if you are traveling with elderly the bathtub downstairs is too high and slippery and the stairs are too steep . We love body wash and the sunrise views from the room upstairs is breathtaking . The location was accessible to everything that we needed to do , and we felt safe at all times. Luke was attentive and quickly responded to my inquiries . We hope our next trip to Racine this unit is available for us to stay. Thanks Luke"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,everything about this was exactly as described! Great place for a family with young kids. outdoor activities within walking distance. Luke's was very responsive leading up to and throughout the visit. Highly recommend renting from him! Thanks Luke!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay was 10/10 at the lake house! It is beautifully decorated with many thoughtful touches. It worked perfect for us and our twin toddlers. We can’t wait to stay again in the near future!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Luke was a great host and the house is on point in every aspect. It was a great stay for us for the Racine Mixed Curlimg Bonspiel.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and Luke was very responsive. The home is very well maintained and clean.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very cozy, well-equipped, and looked exactly like the photos. The property is across the street from Lake Michigan with great views from the bedroom upstairs. We prepared 2-3 meals daily and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed. There are several grocery stores nearby also. I highly recommend this property and look forward to a future stay during the warmer months."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Super clean. Everything feels new and well maintained. Would definitely book again. :)
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My extended family stayed at the house which was perfect for them! Comfortable and very clean accommodations and Luke was very friendly and helpful!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Luke’s place was nothing short of all the previous reviews set before me., 3 of us who were there to celebrate our December birthdays had already declared walking in the door that we’d definitely like to be welcomed back for years to come! Everything he was conveniently located surrounding the home. I appreciate Luke’s clear instructions and house rules that were seamlessly put together ., I felt we were left with nothing to ask, because of how thorough,clearcut and concise! Everything we think we would need was readily available. we shopped for food, cooked and cleaned with ease. Luke gave us his favorite recommendations for dinner dining., unfortunately we didn’t get a chance to go to the one place we were interested in which was “the corner house on the lake” due to a schedule conflict, but I definitely will be back just to get a chance at it since it isn’t a far drive. I just want to lastly say that I appreciate Luke’s generosity during our stay with checking out. I loved it all."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for all the help! Great place
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our stay at Luke’s place! It was such a pretty location and stunning Airbnb. Luke was communicative and helpful throughout. The Airbnb itself was very clean, comfortable and beautiful. Also the location is so convenient with the lake nearby!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have given 5 star reviews to other Airbnb rentals, but this one has set a new standard for me and my family. We stayed here for a short weekend trip to visit family in the area and have nothing but positive things to say: remarkably clean, awesome decor, comfortable bedding, great location near Lake Michigan and incredible value. Our only regret is that we didn't get to stay longer. My wife and I commented a number of times throughout the weekend that this was the nicest rental we had ever stayed in. I would stay here time and time again and would gladly transport it to all of our future vacation destinations. Thank you for thinking of everything that would make a family feel right at home!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Our stay at Luke's places was amazing! The house was clean and had everything we needed.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Luke is a gracious host who is very welcoming and responsive. Comfortable beds, high end finishes, great location and Luke even offered for us to stay later on check out day. 5 stars all the way!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was lovely, especially the kitchen with new appliances and generous extras such as ground coffee and olive oil. Nice welcome bottle of wine and extra goodies. Bathrooms were modern and provided lots of extras. Very quiet neighborhood and great view of Lake Michigan. Luke and his family very accomodating and flexible."
2023-10-01,4.0,Group trip,"Overall we really enjoyed our stay. There are a couple of negatives worth mentioning (and I will) but first my compliments. The home is beautiful, excellently decorated, high end appliances, and VERY well stocked. They weren’t cheap with this place and it really is gorgeous. They left a bottle of wine, a welcome note, and very detailed instructions. That being said.. I would add a warning to visitors that this place may not be well suited for small children. My 3 year old niece tumbled down the stairs and had to be taken to the emergency room. She navigates NORMAL stairs just fine and has never fallen before. These stairs however, are very steep and quite dangerous. I felt like I had to chase my daughter every time she moved because I was so afraid of her going near the stairs. I personally wouldn’t allow small children to play freely here."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home just steps from the lake. Accommodations exceeded my expectations. Beautifully updated, and sparkling clean!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! The house felt like a quaint ocean getaway. It is beautifully designed and was perfect for our weekend away. Everything was as described but even better in person. It felt so luxurious. The location was perfect. Make sure to get yourself to the beach and soak up the surroundings! So amazing we have this in Wisconsin. We loved the downtown shops and restaurants we went to in Kenosha and Racine. Both have lots to offer. Luke was incredibly friendly and responsive. We loved all the pampered touches. Definitely recommend this home! They definitely are passionate and care about their guests. Thank you!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great home, very clean, convenient location, and great communication by the hosts. I would definitely book again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a fabulous time at Luke’s place! Awesome location to North Park. Loved being so close to Lake Michigan. Very clean home with attentive host. Highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lukes place is beautiful! Everything is exactly as shown in the photos and Luke was quick to respond any time we had questions. The beach is a 2 minute walk! There is a park near by, a path along the lake to walk or run, and sand volleyball courts on the beach! My friends and I had a great time and would definitely recommend Lukes place if you are looking for a quiet beach getaway!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was delightful! Beautiful design, spacious layout, and such a comfortable setup - all steps away from the lake. Luke was always prompt with getting us check-in and checkout instructions, offered a list of restaurants in the area, and ensured we had everything we needed while we were there. Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Where to even start…
Luke’s home is simply perfect. To say that I am a particular guest would be an understatement and this property checked all the boxes for us. It was a great size for our family of six and Luke provided all of the basics that one would need for a stay. The location is walkable to a great playground as well as a beautiful beach. There’s plenty of parking on the street and the neighbors were friendly and helpful. I sincerely cannot say enough good things about this stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at this air bnb! The place was stunning, brand new and very clean. I think it was the cleanest air bnb I have ever stayed in. We traveled with three children - ages 5, 4, and 2 and they loved that Luke's place had books and toys for them including a little reading nook/children's reading place upstairs. We also liked being so close to the beach and the children's playground across the street. Luke also had some good recommendations for things to do - we enjoyed the Racine Zoo, had lunch at the marina, and we painted rocks at Northwinds Gallery. We went to dinner at Jaramillo's Home Cook'n, it was very tasty. I would absolutely book this place again and also mentioned it to my friend who lives in Kenosha. She is interested in it for when extended family comes into town."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! The house was beautiful, clean, and very well maintained. There was attention given to little details that made the stay even more enjoyable. There were books and games that our children enjoyed as well. Luke was very friendly and kind, quick to help with a question or a recommendation. The house is a very short walk to a great beach, and you really can hear the waves through an open window! Our favorite part of staying here was watching the sunrise over the lake each morning from an upstairs bedroom. We highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved this home so much! A newly renovated house top to bottom that exceeded our expectations, which was impressive because the photos set a high bar. They have a lot of small touches that were luxurious like the amazing smelling shampoo/soaps in the shower and the brand new appliances."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay here was incredible. This house is gorgeous inside and out and in a perfect location. The beach is a two minute walk and very clean! The hosts are very responsive and welcoming. We will definitely be staying here again. 10/10
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This stay is a stellar find & deserves all the high praises of the previous reviews. It is steps away from Lake Michigan & Racine’s North Beach Park, a relaxing place to enjoy the beautiful clear lake. Luke is an incredible host, from his text & call responsiveness to his detailed recommendations about Racine. The home itself is curated down to the golden cabinet knob detail in the kitchen - it is a GORGEOUS space both inside & out. It has all the amenities you could ask for (coffee & tea, soaps & shampoo, etc), and the hosts even left a welcome package on the kitchen island! Honestly, it exceeded my expectations from the photos & details, which were already well-provided. I would 100% stay here again, and I would encourage anyone else looking for a prime Wisconsin Lake Michigan beach stay to snag this spot up without hesitation."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Six woman biking through Wisconsin. Lots of space. Super clean and cute. All new appliances. Luke great communicator. Home completely renovated. Easy walk to marina and town with lots of restaurants.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Luke was a great host for our trip to Racine. His home was beautifully appointed. It was located near North Beach and the Zoo. Walkable to a few local bars, but not in a noisy area. The home itself was spotless and fully remodeled. Luke was a very responsive host and we had no issues. I would definitely stay in this home again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing and relaxing g stay! Would definitely recommend.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House was very nice, clean and spacious. The location is perfect for easy access to Lake Michigan. The host was very nice and readily available when i had any questions. The only issues we had was the one upstairs bedroom and while it had a great view of the lake there were no window coverings so making it hard to sleep in past 5am each day, and I do wish check out time was not so early even 11am would have been a little nicer. Overall great stay and would stay again as long as window coverings were added to the one room upstairs."
,,,"Lack of communication, a very bad host"
,,,"I booked this space for my husband as a little getaway to be alone in a treehouse in the woods to be able to meditate in silence.
The morning of his arrival, we received directions on how to access the space - it was a basement apartment. The description is deceptive, this is not a treehouse getaway.
When he arrived in the afternoon, he could hear the family above walking, talking, and later in the evening, a piano lesson for their children. He spent the night and came home early in the morning, cutting his trip short.
The family seems really nice, but the description is not accurate."
