Thank you so much for having us in your home!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Overall an amazing experience to stay at this house. Cheaper and much nicer than a hotel. House was spotless, everything was in great condition. It was a great place for the entire family to stay, and being able to cook and grill meals was amazing. Kitchen has brand new pots, pans, and anything else you would need. Coffee machine with pods was amazing and was just what we needed during our stay.
Host was very responsive and made the whole stay pain free with no issues. I can't say enough how beautiful and what great shape the place was in. If we ever travel to this area again this will be the first place we look to book."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"These hosts are two of the nicest I've ever had on airbnb! I rented this place for one week to scope out the area before committing to a long-term rental for my contract. I ended up booking one of the other apartments in the house, because I preferred it's particular ambience despite fewer amenities.
The Rose Room features a full kitchen, a spacious living room area, and lots of storage in the bedroom. It's very good for night-shifters because the bedroom does not have windows - close the door and it's almost black-out dark. I slept extrmely well through the hot days thanks to the dark room and the powerful a/c unit in the bedroom. There are string lights in the bedroom to give you some soft warm lighting. On my days off, I could still enjoy natural light from the vaulted window in the living room. The shared hot tub is huge!
You can text the hosts for anything you need! They brought me brand new tubberware in varying sizes within an hour of my requesting it"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I forgot to read the email about where to park and which unit was The Rose Room but the host quickly responded and helped us! Very welcoming and clean. We slept so well and felt at home.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Host was very nice and responded quickly. The only issue i had was it was cold i didn’t see a heater(i had a 4mo old with me), the lights in the living room didn’t work either. All is well, it was a short stay. Very clean easy to find no bugs.. she also had an ice maker! So neat."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a quick overnight at Melisa’s spot. Very easy to get to and I had a chance to meet her and her husband in person. Really nice folks as we chatted for a bit.
Spot is certainly cozy and exactly what I needed to crash and get back on the road.
One thing I should note that’s not easy to tell from the listing, but there are quite a few tall ledges getting into the room and down the bathroom stairs. Not a big deal, but can definitely throw you off in the night if you’re not aware.
Would definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Cute place and very convenient location. Caretaker very responsive. Would stay again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Good vibes great location we can be a little much hopefully they let us stay there sometime again

2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Thank you for a great stay!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Honestly, was one of the easiest places to get to. It was not to far from restaurants, or our destination for the reason of being in Hobbs. The price was not bad at all, especially for just two of us. I would most definitely be interested in staying again when I'm in that area. My recommendation is a 9 out of 10, only reason for the living room area just needs a small heater for the person sleeping on the futon."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,In a peaceful place of town. Good nearby food and stores.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was just what we needed for our stay. Cozy and quiet. I loved the hard wood floors, washer and dryer was a plus having the family with us. We will definitely be booking again when we are back in the area. Thank you 💕"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Warmest water of any air bnb I stayed at in Hobbs. I enjoyed my time.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,I had a great stay. Longest trip I’ve made in an Airbnb so far and it was the right place to do it in.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place would be sufficient for a work trip, not so-much a weekend get-way. The house is nicely decorated but there is room for improvement to make it feel more cozy. Would be nice to have easy use of garage. Back yard wasn't usable. Good for a quick trip but a hotel probably would have been cheaper."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great Airbnb for my travel assignment. Would recommend Kamie as a host to anyone needing a place to stay in Hobbs!
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"The place worked out great for me. I was there for 12 weeks and not once did I feel unsafe. I was there alone and the neighborhood was great. Also, the house was the perfect size for me and had everything I needed."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife, daughters, and myself enjoyed the stay. Will definitely use again in future visits"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Home needs a little TLC before rented next.
2021-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean and the check in process was smooth. Before my last night I had planned to give this place 5 stars but then I found a scorpion in my room at 1am and that almost made me want to leave right there and then. However, I think they are very common in NM and I would still recommend this place for an affordable and comfortable stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, and a great place to stay for the price! Communication was great and Check-in was easy!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kamie’s home is the perfect place to stays and very affordable. Her description is accurate, stocked with all the essentials and then some :) . Neighborhood is beautiful & quiet. I look forward to booking with Kamie for all my future Hobbs visits!"

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,very comfortable and roomy three beds apartment. Close to shaping center.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect house just minutes away from Walmart and restaurants. House was perfect for my family of 4. Clean & tidy Rodney welcomed us with open arms as our host. Comfortable beds, well equipped kitchen and great lounge area. Ideal for just chilling after a long day of work. We will definitely stay here again. Thank you for sharing your home."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This home is a very nice place and I would highly recommend. Rodney and Laura were welcoming and responsive. The home was nicely appointed and had everything needed without excess. Our mattress was comfortable. The kitchen was amazing. We enjoyed having the fenced area for our dog.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We were in town for a funeral and had to find the perfect place quick and this absolutely was a perfect place just like the name. We will be booking this bind again and again every time we come to town! Thank you for everything!!
2023-02-01,4,Group trip,"It is a lovely place, but it is not equipped to host the number of guests that are allowed. There was only one dish towel and only one hand towel in each bathroom. The kitchen had only 3 coffee mugs, 6 plates, 3 wine glasses. We had to purchase mugs which were taken home by family members. Rodney kindly responded to my request for dish towels and hand towels. Compared to other Airbnb experiences this lack of some of the basics was disappointing."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great place! Rodney was very helpful, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Rodney and Laura’s spot was exactly what we needed for our week-long stay for the holidays. The house was clean, spacious and inviting. The detailed touches made it feel like a home away from home.
The location was quiet and close to local restaurants and shopping areas.
Rodney and Laura were proactive with check-in details and were quick to respond to our questions. This made it a worry-free booking with my busy work schedule.
We very much appreciate their attention to detail and their efforts in making sure we found it easy to check-in and had everything we needed.
We will be looking for availability again for our future visits to Hobbs."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super clean, super nice place."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We couldn't have enjoyed our stay here any better, truly! It was warm and inviting with great space for our holiday gathering with 4 adults and a toddler. We loved having an unexpected but handy high chair! Kitchen was updated and well equipped as were bathrooms. Signs throughout were funny and amusing and helped set a tone that was a relaxing getaway from home. Only suggestions would be perhaps to provide tissues, more wastebaskets in bedrooms, more clothes hangers and maybe more washcloths. The tile floor did make my barefooted husband's feet dark, so mop more thoroughly for bare feet. You really have the place very well appointed in every way. Thank you for a fantastic stay. We would love to make this an annual destination."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely a great place to stay! Hosts are wonderful and we will certainly stay in this house again!

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Very clean and cozy place. 10/10 would recommend this place to anyone! Will definitely stay here again when we’re back.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place worked well fur our group.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This was a beautiful and very clean home. Easy to check in. All three beds were VERY comfortable. Plenty of space for the six of us to move around. Neighborhood was quiet. It is very close to a Walmart for all those little things you may need. The hosts were very responsive, which is a huge plus.
If you want to sit outside, you will need to bring your own chairs, as there is nothing to sit on at the 3 patio spots.
Very minimal amount of supplies for our stay, but that is an easy fix, so I’m sure the hosts will have that taken care of.
It was nice to be able to park your vehicle in the garage as well as on the street in front of the place."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Couldn’t have been happier with “our perfect spot”. My dog was right at home with the dog door. The place was clean and simple. Everything worked as it should. Will stay again!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for our crew
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"We would definitely recommend Rodney and Laura's townhome. The beds were very comfortable, towels nice and fluffy, and the home very clean. The location is superb! I walked to Starbucks every morning with my dog. If you do not have a car, everything you need (restaurants and groceries) is within walking distance. And we really enjoyed the quaint neighborhood.
Cortne Martin"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"you won't find better hosts in the Hobbs market. we keep returning as they are consistently 5 plus 🌟 star. thank you Rodney and Laura for sharing your homes with us. they are all beautiful and up to date with both furniture and appliances. They have invested in excellent, comfortable mattresses."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place and good location. Good communication. My only suggestion is to plan to shop for anything you need while there (e.g, shampoo) in advance. Walmart is very convenient and has everything."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This house is AMAZING. I love it. The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet. It’s conveniently located behind Walmart and places to shop. It is very clean and nice.

Hosts very responsive and made check in, extension of stay and check out extremely easy. would love to be able to return for future stays."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great service. The hosts were gracious, quick to respond, the check in was easy. The location is great, very near shopping and other amenities. Nice neighborhood. Fairly kid friendly, a few things weren't as ideal for our 10 month old, but with kids older than 2 this wouldn't even be a question of kid safety. The bathrooms were very nice and the kitchen is updated nicely."

2022-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous! Plenty of room for a family of 5. The yard is tidy and well kept. However, it is smaller than pix and than we expected for kids. No lawn furniture either. Luckily we had some folding chairs in vehicle. Super quiet neighborhood. However. Joe Harvey is a main thoroughfare and there is a fire house right there. So lots of traffic and sirens. Lovington Hwy is right there too. The hospital is out that way. So lots of big trucks and siren noise. Walmart is 5 minutes away as well as numerous restaurants. Hosts very receptive. We will definitely stay again ."

Nicely located near a park. Communication was quick and responsive from host Hector. When had questions about grills and lighting, he was quick to respond. Will definitely stay at Green acres again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I go to Hobbs to visit family a lot. I usually rent 2 hotel rooms, and even 3 one trip. I found Hector's place by chance and it was comparable to the 2 hotel rooms I was looking into. I have had a couple of bad experiences with small town airbnb's pictures not matching reality. I'm so glad I took the chance. It was me and my daughter and 6 yr old grand daughter. It was so much nicer to be in a home with amenities and the best part was the time we got to spend together in a beautiful home that is loved dearly. The kitchen was great. All you would need including spices, and various other items you don't usually see. The decor is stylish and some really thoughtful pieces. He has a patio and fire pit and grill. This home food not disappoint and the host was just as great. We will be skipping hotel separating stays, for a place together, to just spend time enjoying our getaways with each other. If you want a quiet, private and peaceful place this is it"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely spot, just bring your own cutlery! Lol"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was nice and clean when we arrived. Location is great with fast food restaurants at a walking distance.Hector allowed us to check in a bit early since we overlooked the time zone difference from Dallas to Hobbs and ended up up arriving an hour early which was nice of him. The house was decorated with nice Christmas things which made the house feel homey. The two things that could make the house a better experience would be to add tvs in the rooms or at least in the master bedroom since there’s only one tv in the whole house located in the living room. We also saw quite a bit of roaches which is something I really don’t like, This should get handled before it gets worse with time. Overall the experience was good for the price"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Hector was very helpful with arrival. My phone network is horrible down there so I wasn’t receiving his messages regarding entry. He answered my calls and was able to get us in over the phone. Their home was beautiful and clean. I need to know where you got some of that decor lol. We also loved that we were able to bring our furbaby!

This is the 2nd Air BnB that I have rented in Hobbs. I loved this one because it has a private back yard, and the neighbors aren’t so close. Everything you need is provided. This house is right across the street from Carters for weekend groceries. Lots of fast food restaurants around. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. This was just an all around great experience.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great! The only complaint I had, is of no fault of the owners. The neighbor’s dog barked nonstop until late evening. That needs to be addressed by neighbors, I don’t see how they could listen to that day in and day out! The toilet was a little wobbly in the master bath, but not an issue. Otherwise, it was a perfect place for us to stay while in town for a few days! If we are back in Hobbs, we will definitely stay here again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and great host!
Highly recommended"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"First time staying in Hobbs, New Mexico. We got here at 3:30 in the morning and arrived at our cousin’s place. The lovely hosts let us check in 3 hours before the actual time, which was very convenient since all of were very tired from the 9 hour drive from Denver.
The house was just as described and very nice, comfortable, cozy, warm, lovely, and just right for the family. Rooms were spacious for the amount of luggage that we had. The shower was just right and super warm. The kitchen was clean and comfortable and amazing to cook in. Wow, the closets were huge and great.
The host was very friendly and welcoming. We didn’t get to meet them, but were very responsive when I had a question or comment. I would definitely recommend this lovely place. If we come next time, we’ll try to reserve this place again. 5/5
Thank you so much for your patience and understanding. And just thank you for everything.
Love from Denver, Colorado."

My friend and I stayed here for six weeks and they accommodated to our needs whether it was helping put a lightbulb, dropping off the garage remote, or lending us the mailbox key. The place was perfect for us since the kitchen and living room separated the house and made it feel like we each had our privacy yet we could still share when we wanted to. Having a washer and dryer also came in handy, they kindly left tide pods and dryer sheets. There are pots and the basic kitchen essentials as well. We needed to study during our time here and they set up a desk. It was definitely used! Thank you to the Palacios team for making us feel welcome and helping accommodate to our needs during our time here."

No filtered water or ice from equipped fridge. There are no night stands or bedside tables in the guest rooms, except for one on one side of the king bed in the master bedroom. The living room could use an additional sofa and it also has absolutely no side tables or coffee tables. Nor does the living room have any lamps; only very bright overhead lighting. There are also no seats on the nice outdoor porch, so no seating at all available outside. The bedroom television remote did not work. The master bedroom main light did not work.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean and had all the necessities to call it home for a few days. We had no problems with the neighborhood and felt like it was close enough to everything we needed. Not being from NM, our 2 little dogs didn't like the rock yard (it was a gamble) or the large aggressive dogs next door attacking the fence if our dogs and theirs were out at the same time. (they were otherwise quiet and never an issue unless you have a dog out at the same time)
We had a great trip and the pictures and description is accurate and worth a stay for sure."

House looks like a fixer upper bought to upgrade a few things then rent out. Outside was not in good shape or clean. Inside was clean and tatseful. Beds and mattresses were not comfortable. This place wasn’t worth the upfront interrogation or high fees. Also had someone banging on a bedroom window it the middle of the night then people yelling down the street along with sirens. Will be looking for a hotel next time."
