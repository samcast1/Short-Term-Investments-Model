2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for a weekend get-a-way. It was far enough out of the city to be very peaceful and quiet but close enough to Sioux Falls so we could easily get to all the amenities there. Tanya was an excellent and responsive communicator - she gave us a couple recommendations (Memorial Day Service and Good Earth State Park) that we followed and very much enjoyed what was recommended. I didn't make time to sit in the steam room until the morning that we left -- but that was a mistake on my part -- If you like steam rooms make that part of your everyday plan!! Also, appreciated the Noon checkout ... so many are moving to the 10:00 AM checkout which does not give time to go have breakfast and leisurely pack the car."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tanya‚Äôs place was great!! Took advantage of her kitchen. She had everything I needed Easy to find. Very close to Good Earth state park and some great hiking. Convenient to all things Sioux Falls. I can‚Äôt remember if that steam shower was in her description, but you she definitely use it. A great place to stay along our way."

Kitchen was well stocked, good coffee and tea and cold water in the fridge. The steam room/shower was amazing!! Great communication with Tanya and we saw squirrels, birds, turkeys and even a deer ran thru right outside our window. Would certainly stay there again if we get to SF again."

Beth has thought of everything to make staying here perfect - comfortable beds with beautiful bedding, a fully stocked kitchen complete with a Keurig and coffee pods, a beautiful dining room with the table set with lovely dishes and cloth napkins, and a tastefully decorated and comfortable living room for relaxing in the evening. I was here with my college aged daughter helping her move into her off campus house.

I will likely make several visits to Sioux Falls over the next few years, and I would love to stay at Beth's place every time!"

The house is very private, convenient and well equipped with what you should need for your stay. Beth has fun and decorative lighting ideas in the house. The beds make you never want to get up, very comfortable. We enjoyed dinner on the deck a couple of times while there. To be able to wash clothes was very helpful for our journey to Sioux Falls.

Beth was quick with any questions we did have, but there were not many, the house is well set up for a traveler's needs."

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very roomy living space,clean,many amenities"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect 'home away from home' and a comfy and convenient place to stay in Sioux Falls. Nice to have a real house to stay in instead of the limitations of a hotel. The house is an older home in a safe residential area. It was very clean, as well as odor-free (except for a tiny bit of 'old home smell' when you first walked into the front door foyer area). I'm very chemically/odor sensitive and I had absolutely no issues at all. The home was spacious, very quiet, and full of quaint details. The larger bedroom bed was just a little too firm for my preference, but bed firmness is such a subject thing so others will be totally content. Still, I slept well. The tenants in the basement level and the attic level were totally quiet. No issues. It's location is perfect for everything Sioux Falls has to offer, and as a single female traveler, I felt completely safe day and night. I did not get to meet Beth directly, but she was so notably personable, responsive, and prompt with her communication. Seems like the type of person you could be friends with. Thanks, Beth."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beth's place is comfortable and centrally located. Not sure what she used for bedding but it was very comfortable. We slept well.

The house was absolutely charming and her attention to detail was evident in every area of the house. Everything was clean and well taken care of. The beds were quite comfortable-we had a very good night‚Äôs rest! Also, I loved that bath robes were provided as well as big fuzzy towels! We felt right at home at the Summit and we will definitely be staying again the next time we visit Sioux Falls!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First of all the owner, Beth, was outstanding and went out of her way to make sure our stay was the best it could be. The night we stayed there was a weather event that affected our reason for being in Sioux Falls and Beth braved the unpleasant elements and spent extra time to get our questions answered and make sure all was in order. She is obviously someone who loves what she does and cares about other people. The house is welcoming, comfortable, spotlessly clean and is filled with charming touches like arched doorways, vintage furniture pieces and beautiful corner windows above the sink in the kitchen. The bathroom is small, but very functional and features a good-sized cupboard filled with useful items like shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, blow dryer, curling irons, etc. There are plenty of extra blankets and sheets in the hall closet. There were many extra touches like beverages in the fridge, a Keurig machine, super comfy bed linens and comforters, a large sitting room with TV and a fireplace, and an adorable kitchen with a pass-through to the dining area. There is even a large outdoor deck in the back yard that we weren't able use because of the weather, but would add even more pleasant living space to the house in warmer months. In the future, we will always check into availability at The Summit house whenever we need lodging in Sioux Falls. A great place to stay at a very reasonable price!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cottage has lots of great character and is very cozy. Beth is a great source of recommendations, and also provides travel guides for the area. The electric fireplace is cozy for a relaxing evening. It‚Äôs a great place, and I highly recommend it! This was my first Airbnb and I will definitely try it again!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was really awesome at Tommy's place! I really enjoyed the location by the lake and easy access to main roads. The place was very clean and had everything I could possibly need. My dog was able to stay there and be comfortable while we visited family. I would definitely stay here again :)
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre in Sioux Fall area, this should be your go-to place to stay. Incredibly clean, beautifully appointed and so comfortable.
We had two adult couples stay for a family member‚Äôs graduation weekend. It was great to have a place to stay out of the way of the graduates family but close enough to enjoy going to their home to visit.
The attention to details was awesome from check-in to check-out. We hoped to sit on the patio but unfortunately the weather was too windy.
The window shade on the living room window was pretty awesome for privacy without sacrificing the view of the pond across the street. Fun to watch a few geese hangout!
Even better, we were able to use the garage and it gave us peace of mind during the Saturday night storm that our vehicle was protected.
One of us ran in the neighborhood and a couple others walked. Felt safe and enjoyed the pretty landscaping.
Great host and home. I‚Äôll be trying to book it again on our next visits to family in the area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying at this awesome property and we just love it! Perfect spot for us to visit friends and family and get our work done during the day, as we both have remote jobs. Our pugs love the fenced-in back yard and we love how perfectly cozy, clean and well-maintained this property is. This is our go-to option when returning to SFSD, so much so that we planned our trip around its availability. Thanks again, Tommy & Cory, for a great stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a lovely stay in Sioux Falls. Tommy was quick with his responses and even offered to bring us an iron board. The location has easy access to the interstates and the airport. Close to shopping and a variety of restaurants.. The home was spacious with all the comforts of your own home, fully equipped kitchen for your own cooking and a grill. The back yard is fenced in adding extra security to the home. We had access to park in the garage with the use of the garage door opener. The best part for us, the BnB was only a half mile from my brothers. We will defiantly stay again. Thank you."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely home, clean and comfortable, well stocked kitchen and bathroom. Great fenced lawn big enough for dog to run around and play in."

We loved the fenced in yard for our pup. And, we slept great! The beds were very comfortable. And, we were happy to find out we were about 10 minutes from downtown Sioux Falls which we loved. We will for sure be back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice newer place. The neighborhood feels safe and secure.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was our first time in SD and picking a safe place to stay was my first concern, especially in this day and age. I can reassure everyone that this location felt very safe. It was nice to look across to see a peaceful lake as well. We came with our two dogs and I am so grateful to Tommy and Cory for allowing us to let them stay at their place. It was a plus that they had a small gated area for our dogs."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Tommy‚Äôs place was perfect for a one night stopover. The backyard was great for my dog, the garage was nice to be able to easily load and unload our stuff, the beds were comfortable, and the place was well stocked and clean."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay here. It was bigger than anticipated! The yard was great as we were traveling with a dog.

Our two little Yorke's loved the backyard and it worked great for them. Going forward we will always stay at ""The Marybeth"" rather then a hotel.
Thank you for the memories,

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was great. The place was cozy and clean. Great location. It is walking distance from the downtown where there are great restaurants and bars. I loved the decor and feel of the place. Being that the home is historic and older there are some creaks and noises that happen, but it was not an issue for us. We arrived in the evening so I was a little nervous about the area at first, but when I woke up and looked around the neighborhood I saw how charming the area was and my nerves disappeared.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely Victorian house in an historic neighborhood. As an old house it has the idiosyncracies expected in such a building - squeaky floorboards, small bathroom. The unit was very clean and welcoming. As the weather turned cold during our stay, we found the heating system more than adequate, making the place very comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped and quite roomy. The neighborhood, including the upstairs tenant, is very quiet and beautiful to walk through. We would caution those with mobility issues about the bathtub. It is a clawfoot tub with relatively high sides and there is no real grab bar available. It was not a problem for us but getting in and out could be for some. Very comfortable place in a terrific location. We would stay there again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would stay here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a sweet old house! Cute, convenient, clean. Great squeaky floors. Tiny but comfy clawfoot tub."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming historical area home within walking distance to downtown. Lovely tree lined street, and very quiet neighborhood. The living room furniture was very cool mid century modern style, the bed was very comfortable, and this home had everything we needed for our stay in SF. This is a victorian era home with all of the usual idiosyncrasies of an older home such as squeaky floors, shower water temperature changes when the toilet is flushed and the like. I love old homes, so I see this as being part of the charm of this house, but for those who like everything new and pristine it might not be the right place for you. But if you love vintage then this home is for you. Thanks for sharing your home with us."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Emily's place was great. It was very clean and nicely decorated too. Walking dowtown was safe and easy. The bed was super comfy. I'd stay again for sure.

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great historic home with many personal touches in the decorating. The art displayed throughout the home was very cool and creative. We thought the furniture had a great vibe too. The kitchen has what you need although we didn't use the facilities much as there are alot of great restaurants in the area. This location is great if you are planning on spending time downtown and catching some shows at the Levitt, which we highly recommend. I would say the only drawback for me was the bathroom if you need room to spread out."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay for a quick weekend! A few outlets didn‚Äôt work but it was fine and close to everything!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute and eclectic little home. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed. We loved that it was within walking distance to downtown. We highly recommend MacKenzie River for dinner and Hello Hi for cocktails.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a comfortable place! You could walk to nearby restaurants and stores, wander the neighborhood and city, or just hang out. It was a lovely oasis. Emily was responsive and helpful (and we had questions!), making it all really easy. It might have been tight for four people, or if a large person needed to shower, but it worked great for the three of us."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the home and the neighborhood!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Emily‚Äôs Place was just like the photos. Clean, cozy, friendly decor. The bed was great for my back. Central air in an old Victorian was amazing in the warm and smokey air alert during our stay. Since the air alert forced us to stay inside, the temperature in the old house was excellent. Nothing fancy. No special modernization. Just a warm and safe atmosphere on a quiet street. Perfect for us after a long drive from the Black Hills on our way back to Minneapolis. Perfect stopover location close to Starbucks and other amenities."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home is lovely and great location. We especially enjoyed the artwork in the home. Nice place to stay for a night while driving through the area.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a comfortable, quiet, peaceful stay and would definitely stay again! Everything looks exactly like the pictures and we enjoyed walking around the neighborhood.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very interesting neighborhood and very close to downtown which is a really cool place to hang out. The duplex is charming with a lot of character.

Thank you!!!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable stay with a very responsive and helpful host!
Bed was very comfortable and house/neighborhood was quiet. Only a 5-min drive from Sanford Hospital, for those that might be staying here for that reason. My guest stayed on the queen air mattress, which was also comfortable and self-inflating. Kitchen had everything I needed. Parking was convenient and easy to get into the house. I loved the eclectic art and lots of natural light! Wi-Fi worked very well.
Besides the listing having exactly what I needed for my stay, Emily was one of the best hosts I have worked with. She was extremely responsive and gave very clear directions. Well worth the price and I would not hesitate to stay there again!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great stay!
2022-12-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Pro: this is a nice small place. It's located at a nice location, very close to downtown. It holds historical meaning as well. The place is clean. The neighbourhood seems safe.
Con: The listing says host provides tv. The host mistakenly took us tv was connected to their amazon account. But when asked, host said we would need to use to our own account. There is no cable or any tv service. The bathroom is quite unsafe. There is a hand real hidden behind the shower curtain. Bathtub is very small. One of us hid their head while taking shower. It's nice that there is a tree in the house. But the tree blocked the hallway. Near the hallway, there is a small tile are elevated from floor. Since the hallway is so narrow, we tripped by the elevated tiles. These two settings are dangerous for people who are unfamiliar with the house setup. The heater pan in the bedroom keeps closing when heater automatically turns on. It makes a huge noise whenever it closes. We didn't sleep well."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, spacious and still cozy. The little scavenger hunt helped us fully appreciate the space. I also couldn't help but fawn over the Viking stove."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place within walking distance of downtown restaurants. We were in Sioux Falls for less than 12 hours so didn't have time to take advantage of the space as much as we would have liked. Seemed like the kitchen had everything one might need. The space was comfortable and we slept great. Were well rested for our 12 hour drive. Suggest folks check out The Hello Hi tiki bar downtown. Just a 10 minute walk from this Airbnb.

The place was clean, cozy, and very welcoming. There was a huge value to price! We really appreciated having easy parking right at the location. We loved how quaint the bathroom was, but the hand held shower head was challenging for my injured husband and the mattress is very soft (not comfy for back issues). I loved the old house and would still come back again, despite these things. It is hard to find a place that has such a cozy feel, amenities, and location. It is a true diamond. I told my husband that is we weren‚Äôt married I would easily want to live in this place!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beth's place is just as described - a nice little spot for one or two travelers, and especially convenient if you'll be spending time around Augustana College or the local hospitals/medical clinics. Neighborhood feels safe and pleasant and street parking was abundant. Beth happened to be at the property mowing when I checked in and was super friendly.
FYI: Travelers with severe fragrance allergies or sensitivities might have some difficulty with the soft surfaces in the space (laundry detergent & a fabric spray, I'd guess, or perhaps lingering perfume from previous guests), but overall it was still more scent friendly than many options."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is so very obvious that Beth cares a lot about her cozy little suite.
The suite is beautifully decorated, fully stocked with everything you would need for your stay.
There is an obvious reason why Beth has a high rating. From the deck and lighting to the entrance to the very comfortable bed and futon, and so on, everything was perfect. The suite was spotless.
Beth was very quick to respond to messages and so kindly turned on the lights in the suite when she knew we'd be arriving in the dark.
All in all, I would recommend this place 100 times over.
Thank you Beth for everything during our stay. It was absolutely lovely üëê"

Even with the smaller space, there was room for two of us to work remotely - in the dedicated work space and in the living room / dining table area.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were in town for just a night but during the NXR (very busy weekend). We had originally booked a hotel room, our only options left were the lower end budget hotels, I randomly decided to check Airbnb and was super lucky to find this one. My daughter was running NXR and was relieved to have her own space to relax & sleep. There was more space than needed which made things even more relaxing. The home is tastefully furnished & decorated, and the beds incredibly comfortable. I am so happy I decided to cancel our not so budget, budget hotel, not just because the hotel was a little more than $100 MORE for the night, but also because my daughter was much less stressed knowing she wouldn‚Äôt be kept awake by hotel traffic & uncomfortable living space. Also, because it was such a busy weekend in Sioux Falls, it was incredibly difficult to dine out or even order in, luckily we had the convenience of picking up a few groceries & cooking our own meals, the kitchen had everything we needed."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was exactly as advertised and was spotlessly clean and very welcoming. The beds were super comfortable. The location is great for getting downtown in less than 10 minutes. The host was great at communicating and gave us a restaurant recommendation that we tried out and it was excellent!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderfully spacious home that allowed my family of 6 to spread out and each have our own place to sleep. It was clean and tidy, and we all slept wonderfully there. It did lack a little bit of instruction as to what was allowed to be used and how to control the thermostat. At times, I felt a little like an invader in someone else‚Äôs home than someone renting a place. With that being said, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay here again."

It's a quiet neighborhood but close to restaurants within 5-15 minutes drive. Grocery and gas is a five minute drive. The host was VERY responsive, which is much appreciated! Cannot recommend enough.

It‚Äôs a secure building both at the entry and into the studio. There are also security cameras outdoors. Sheva was incredibly responsive if I had a question.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a 5 day stay, and this was an excellent set-up for one person. The studio apt was exactly as described.

2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sheva was great with communicating with us . we decided to bring our pets last minute, and he was accommodating and charged us a 50 per pet fee. The place was super clean. It was a nice spot for getting around the city. There is tons of security around the place like cameras and two self check in doors with a code. However, the neighbors upstairs were very loud. we were in somewhat of a basement apartment, so we could hear everything. we wound up leaving a day earlier. Overall it was just ok."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sheva was a great host. My husband checked in in the evening, Sheva met him there and helped him into the building and into the apartment even though the codes were sent. My husband left the plug-in part of his phone charger back home and Sheva had an extra he gave him so my husband didn‚Äôt have to run out and find one. Communication was superb, the place was spotless and was just an 8 minute drive to my husbands job site. The only complaint would be, being able to hear when other people come and go from apartment complex."

There were always birds and their songs and we saw deer and various other wildlife as well. The home was very spacious and we enjoyed all the natural lights from the windows.

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lisa‚Äôs place is wonderful! We met our friends halfway from where they live and where we live. It was the perfect little hideaway, away from the city, but close enough to pop into town for dinner or to explore. We utilized the hot tub and sauna and it was a perfect room to catch up! My husband and I have a one year old- and there were toys to occupy his time. We loved being able to walk around the property and enjoy the nature. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a weekend getaway or a place to stay for a weeks worth vacation!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"My friends and I visited the Pine hallow Airbnb and we were very impressed. It was very spacious and beautiful! Everything we needed was available at the home!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The property is beautiful. As a single mom I couldn‚Äôt afford a beach vacation for my kids and I, so we drove an hour away to have a staycation at this beautiful home. My kids and I enjoyed the hot tub, outdoor fire pit and seating area, comfortable indoor living spaces, and the big yard where we played corn hole and tossed around a football. It was the perfect place to spend quality time with my kids and be get them off technology for awhile. There was nothing about this place that wasn‚Äôt perfect!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Ôøº Our stay, was a great weekend with relaxation in peace. Ôøº We enjoyed every aspect of the home and what it had to offer. Ôøº Lisa did an amazing job answering any questions we may have had before our stay. Ôøº highly recommend."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Pine Hollow! This home truly has it all.

We were able to work remotely with zero connectivity issues and were also able to disconnect and enjoy ourselves in this gorgeous house as soon as work was done. The hot tub and sauna were a major plus for the chilly weather. Thanks Lisa!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We went for a girls weekend to celebrate my birthday, I think what I wrote Lisa, when we were checking out and driving away, sums it up perfectly‚Ä¶ If you see drops of frozen water all the way down the driveway, those are our tears because we had to leave this fabulous space! We laughed so much and had such a great time relaxing in the hot tub. Hands-down, favorite Airbnb! Thanks Lisa!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was only our 2nd time using Airbnb. My wife booked the last one, so I had little to do with it (Beach condo), nothing too extravagant. I booked this as an anniversary surprise for her. Talk about impressed. From the booking process to the end of our stay was absolutely perfect. She really loved it. The price was just right, too. We really loved how everything was in its place and easy to find. Lisa sets her home up in such a way that everything you could think of needing, it was there (other than groceries, of course). We felt right at home, and any questions I had, she responded promptly and went above and beyond. The questions were only related to being out of town. I could go on and on about how great our experience was. The only thing I wish we could have taken advantage of, was the outdoor amenities, it was too cold. I'd like to visit again during the beginning of fall. It was amazing. BTW, if you're looking for a great dining, Morrie's Steakhouse. Pricey, but well worth it."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very clean, well appointed house in a peaceful location"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lisa was an amazing host and her place was the perfect oasis for a relaxing getaway. We would have stayed the entire month if possible!

The location is wonderful and peaceful and the house itself is beautifully decorated. The area is quiet but there are still restaurants and things to do nearby. We can't wait to go back in the Spring or Summer when we can take advantage of the outdoor area. Thank you again Lisa for such an amazing stay!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was a dream! There was so much space! It is 10 times better in real life! My teens absolutely loved being at this house. We have stayed at a lot of airbnbs and this one was at the top! We loved the property- the kids played soccer, threw the football, and we all enjoyed the outdoor fireplace area. Our lab also enjoyed exploring all the property. My daughter especially loved the hot tub area. She connected her music through the rooms Bluetooth and sang her heart out. Lisa was amazing at helping and having all the little notes around the house to help us know where things are/how to work things. I have no complaints at all and am already wondering when we can come back! Thank you Lisa! We loved making memories there!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was exactly what we were hoping for. The kitchen was well stocked and great to cook in. Everything was clean and beautiful. Both the home and outdoor space were peaceful and we could even enjoy a couple of rainy mornings from the covered porch and screened in deck. Lisa was a fantastic host. We arrived later than we'd hoped and Lisa very kindly turned all the lights on so we could find our way. She provided easy to follow instructions and it was nice to stay in a place so accommodating to dogs as well. The hot tub and sauna are great bonus amenities. This is overall a wonderful home base that feels private but with easy access to all Sioux Falls has to offer.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful, peaceful and quiet place for a perfect weekend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A great getaway for our family. All growing up in the country and now all living within city limits- we enjoyed the peace and tranquility. Great hostess!

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was one of the most peaceful and lovely stays I've been at. the house had gorgeous decor and setup. Every guest that walked in kept complimenting the whole property, and how cute everything was. The only critique I would have is that the bedroom situation was slightly awkward and not what I expected for a house that size."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lisa‚Äôs home was perfect for our return to SD to see some of our closest family and friends. We were seeking a large, comfortable, and private space that could accommodate our immediate family of six, and appropriate for a small gathering/picnic. Her home was perfect, secluded, and beautiful. It happened to rain for about half of the time we were there, but we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better view from the living area. The windows are ample, and the natural light is so lovely.
The kitchen and the living area are really the stars of the show. We had such a fun time cooking and entertaining in the kitchen. The gazebo is totally enclosed with a protective screen and a ceiling fan so you stay cool and bug free.
If you are looking for a place where you plan to spend and enjoy a lot of time in the peaceful environment, this is it. We drove into Sioux Falls for groceries, and to go downtown one afternoon, otherwise, we simply spent time enjoying the property. Thank you Lisa!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Lisa was a amazing host! When we first arrived we had issues trying to connect the WiFi and she was quick to response and even came over to help solve the problem!! Will recommend everyone to stay here!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay at Lisa‚Äôs home. The home was located in a private area with a large yard.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Overall it was a great stay! Lisa was very friendly and super responsive. You can tell both her and her husband care about the space. The place itself is gorgeous and makes you feel a world away even though you‚Äôre 10 minutes from everything. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about the property! The main highlight is when we were there we never logged onto the wifi and we never watched tv even though both are available. We didn‚Äôt want them nor need them, just had really great quality time as a family. It is where we want to stay each and every time we come back to Sioux Falls."

The hot tub was a major factor for us and it didn‚Äôt disappoint! Lisa was very good at communicating so you knew what to expect, places they recommended to see/eat, and she replied quickly if needed! I don‚Äôt have a negative thing to say. We will definitely want to return."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place to stay. Very private and cozy. The host was very attentive and friendly! Would definitely stay again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a nice peaceful stay at Lisa‚Äôs. Very private and secluded location, but close by to local attractions. The house was very clean and spacious. Huge kitchen with anything you need to cook. Fast internet. Lots of wild life, saw many deer grazing the yard throughout our stay. We loved the hot tub and the panoramic window view from the upstairs.
Lisa is very responsive and takes very good care of this house."
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The photos of this property, though stunning just don‚Äôt do it justice! The great room was very spacious, and everything we needed was on hand. Close enough to town for fun but far away enough that you feel you‚Äôve got your own hideaway. Just beautiful! Lisa was a wonderful host and was very accommodating. Would 100% recommend this stay!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The most beautiful/peaceful experience at Lisa‚Äôs Airbnb. She was very responsive, friendly and also made sure I was logged out of apps on the TV when I forgot. The house is so cozy and has everything you need! She also has extra dog dishes/collars if you forget yours (which I did so that really came in handy). I can‚Äôt wait to come back in the summer to enjoy all the nature this Airbnb has to offer!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Exactly as the description and pictures show!
Very clean, nice pillows, comfy beds.
A lovely setting.
We watched the deer meander through the yard while squirrels played tag in the trees.
The porch swing is a lovely place to have a cup of coffee or maybe a glass of red wine.
We will stay again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You can tell the moment you walk in the care that the host/s have for this place! A perfect weekend hideaway to escape life's noise. Thank you, Lisa, for providing such a fabulous spot!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Love this place and would definitely book again!
We"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This hideaway home was the perfect get-away for our family- far enough away from town to soak in the beautiful outside spaces, yet close enough to restaurants and the attractions downtown. We had excellent communication with the host, and everything we needed to feel at home. A few favorites were sunset dinners outside followed by fire-side drinks, the open floor plan and large indoor spaces, children's books for our toddler, and watching the deer who frequented the stream."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful to work with and our stay was fantastic!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our experience here was like one of the commercials! Amazing property, green hills surrounding you on all sides. Weeping Willows near the pond and the amazing outdoor gathering area/fireplace. Indoors was comfortable and decorated beautifully. This place is a place to make memories and also rest and relax! I stay in a lit"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lisa's place is absolutely beautiful! From the sitting area by the pond with they fire place to right infront of the house with the swinging day bed and gazebo, to the inside very spacious and well put together! You're only a tiny bit out side of town so still able to run and grab something quick if needing anything. Honestly, besides food of course, the place had everything you need. We had a small get together for my boyfriends birthday for a weekend and it was perfect. We even saw some deer on one of the days stroll right by us. Highly recommend if you're looking for a little slice of heaven!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lovely place to sit back, relax and enjoy nature. All types of birds frequented the feeders we placed out. We were also visited by deer, turkeys, squirrels and a woodchuck. Lisa is a great host and quickly addressed any issues that came up. We were here four months. It was our first experience with Airbnb. And we loved every minute."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Pine hollow is a one of a kind spot and was amazing the whole time we were there! We had a few things happen and Lisa took care of it all right away and her communication was exceptional. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a close to what you need kind of getaway!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My partner and I were here a little over a month. In that time, we encountered a couple hiccups with a leak and the fireplaces not turning on, but Lisa was always on top of it and so helpful and kind. All issues were resolved almost as quick as they occurred. They also kept to themselves which I appreciated as it made the stay feel secluded and really our own.
We loved Alayah, the willows, and the little pond. The landscaping and interior are just gorgeous, and we were thrilled to spend each day there.
Most people we encountered in the area were also very welcoming and kind. This town doesn‚Äôt get enough credit for how cool it is - highly recommend grabbing a slice and playing pinball at Bosses Pizza + checking out the downtown (Urban Archeology was my personal fav) + and staying for coffee and a caramel roll at Josiah‚Äôs.
Lisa mentions on the listing that the wifi isn‚Äôt great, which is true. My partner and I both wfh so we found ourselves working from Josiah‚Äôs and BWW (which has the best wifi in town btw) quite a lot.
Overall everything was great, and we look forward to coming back in the future!"

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice home with lots of personal touches. The kitchen is large and roomy and the best part - it has three full-sized ovens! This was great for me and my extended family who stayed over Thanksgiving. The sauna and hot tub were also very nice and I'd encourage anyone who wants a nice and relaxing place to stay to go here - Pine Holow Hideaway. It was snowing so we didnt get a chance to take in much of the outdoors, but the little bit we did, we loved. To include the gentle horse near the entrance of the druveway. Lisa is very helpful and quick to respond. Highly recommend"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pine Hollow Hideaway is a GEM! Close to restaurants and shopping, but still had that out-of-the-city, woodsy-escape feel. Peaceful, relaxing, cozy, clean, comfortable, beautiful. Sauna and hot tub are a huge plus. Outdoor space is delightful and lovely. Everything we wanted for our girls getaway!!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"When planning our annual girl's weekend we had many choices as to where to stay. When we saw this fantastic property we took a risk and booked it, hoping it would truly be as fantastic as it looked in pictures. And it absolutely did not disappoint! This property; the sauna, the living space, the hot tub and the beauty of the property all were just as promised and as shown in pictures. Additionally, the place was immaculent and the service was phenomenal; as any questions we had were immediately addressed. This place was worth every dime and offered a very relaxing stay. We were all very satisfied and memories were made as we enjoyed this property very much! Fantastic!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Pine Hollow Hideaway was a perfect place for our fall girlfriend weekend get away! There was plenty of room for the 5 of us.

I definitely recommend staying here!"

2019-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The property was amazing. It was quiet, relaxing and whimsical. We went away for a girls weekend and had a great time. There was numerous places to sit and chat/eat. Lisa was very responsive to question. We would definitely recommend this location and would love to come back again."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa‚Äôs home is an absolute gem, and the entire experience staying with her cannot be beat. She thinks of absolutely everything as a host, and every detail of the home is impeccable. I‚Äôm basically a Pine Hollow fan girl, and my family is obsessed too. We will be back!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was a piece of paradise! It is amazing out there with the pond and beautiful scenery! We enjoyed the fireplace outside at night under the stars. The screened porch was perfect for eating and drinking outside . The house is beautiful and everything was perfect down to every detail. This place is like no other place I have ever been to .
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are thinking about booking this place, do it NOW! It is just as pretty if not prettier than the pictures! Wow.. we had our mini moon here and it was one of the best decisions we had for our wedding. Dream home goals right here!"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing spot! Nice and secluded yet close to good shopping, restaurants, park etc. The place was sparkling clean and had lots of nice personal touches. Would absolutely recommend!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have stayed at several Airbnbs and Pine Hollow is by far my favorite! I came from the busy east coast looking for peace and serenity.....and I found it! From the pond, to all the amazing wild life, to the small details within the home and throughout the property....for five days me, my kids and my father lived in a second home. A home so welcoming and comfortable, our expectations were met and by far surpassed......THANK YOU!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Lisa‚Äôs place was very clean and nicely decorated. We felt very at home and had an amazing family vacation.

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was very stylish and could easily accommodate a couple having a romantic getaway or a large group of friends or family. There were lots of spacious sociable areas to relax and dine inside and out; and the garden and pond area were beautifully landscaped with an amazing outdoor fireplace. My husband and I spent two nights there for our 30th wedding anniversary but wished we had time to stay longer as it was so peaceful and relaxing.
Julie & Nick"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful property not to be missed! The attention to detail in design, especially with thoughtful seating vignettes throughout the home and outdoor space was gorgeous. Our families were able to relax and unwind near the pond, roast s‚Äômores by the outdoor fireplace, then curl up with good books on the porch swing. Pine Hollow really feels like home away from home, but with much better decoration and amenities (three ovens and a hot tub!)."
2019-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house was a gorgeous place for a bachelorette party! It did get a bit hot in the main living area of the house as there is no central air, however it was VERY hot the weekend we went. Other than that we loved sitting in the hot tub/sauna and enjoying the scenery!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was the perfect space for my family to enjoy time together. Between the stylish touches, clean rooms, spacious bathrooms, beautiful pond, and more, my family was able to spend time indoors and outdoors comfortably. My nieces loved searching for the wildlife near and in the pond and saying hello to Alaya (the horse). There's enough table space to eat inside and outside! There were a lot of extra pillows and blankets for those of us who slept on the pullout or an air mattress. My family had a couple questions throughout our stay and Lisa was quick to respond! We couldn't recommend this home enough. We will be staying here again!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Pine Hollow Hideaway is an absolute gem. It offers impeccable views of the South Dakota country side. It is secluded and provides lots of privacy. The amenities are abundant. If you are considering a weekend away with the family, friends, or just a significant other, this is the place to be! It feels familiar and homey from the get go. Lisa is an amazing host. She communicates directly and responds quickly. We feel so lucky to have created such incredible memories at this property. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2019-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Lisa provided us with the most stunning location for a bachelorette party! Pine Hollow Hideaway was a sweet little surprise right outside of Sioux Falls for a weekend getaway for us girls. We loved spending time outdoors and just exploring the property. We will be back for sure!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lisa is super sweet omg , and the house I can‚Äôt tell you enough you will have to come see for yourself. Even my family that visited me there for a birthday dinner was so amaze by the decor and cleanliness of the house.."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This location far exceeded our expectations...we used it for a stay-cation and it was perfect. Super clean, amazing design inside the home, lots of well thought out spaces to relax, good beds and rooms, has much more space than we thought due to the layout and yes, the fireplace area is absolutely worth the cost alone. The host was very responsive and thoughtful of our needs. Five stars all the way and we will be coming back!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay at PineHollowHideaway was amazing. We were in town for a wedding and wanted space for my whole family to stay and booked. We found a place where we were able to grill out and hang by the pond, play ball and trivia pursuit and rediscover our extended family again. It was the first time some of us had seen each other for 5+ years. It was just wonderful."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting, great hospitality and a very comfortable stay"
2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful place, fabulous amenities, great for a weekend getaway! Very quaint and private. Plenty of space for activities - games, chatting, relaxing. It was perfect!"

2019-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We highly recommend you staying here. The pics are truly realistic but more. We were in town for a wedding so we didn‚Äôt get to enjoy all the amenities since our days were pack filled with busy stuff but we can‚Äôt wait to come back so we can. All the extra special touches were so sweet! My mom made the statement..‚ÄùI have worn the same socks since we got here and there is not a speck of dirt on them‚Äù...it was so clean and cozy!! We are from Tennessee and our son lives there in Sioux Falls and we will be disappointed if we can‚Äôt stay here again when coming to visit. We highly recommend this perfect place!!
2019-03-01,5.0,Group trip,We have found our annual girls weekend destination! So cute and cozy :)
2019-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was the absolute best place for our girls getaway! We got there early and she was so flexible with letting us check in early. We were blown away with how amazing the house looked. The chocolates and robes provided were a perfect touch. The pictures do not do justice. Sadly it was a very cold weekend so we did not get to enjoy the outdoors much but made s‚Äômores with the provided supplies indoors. The hot tub and sauna were perfect after skiing at the suggested resort that was a quick 15 minute drive from the place. Due to the expected bad weather, she even provided a few extra items of food in the pantry just in case we would have been snowed in! I wish I could give more stars because this place deserves it! We will definitely be coming back."
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were so beyond pleased with our stay!!! Lisa was super fast at responding to any questions we had! House was very clean and comfy!

2019-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house was absolutely astounding!! It exceeded all of our expectations! We had 10 adults staying for the weekend for a Bob Seger concert and it couldn‚Äôt have been more amazing! The space, the detail to the home, the bedrooms and bathrooms - we had more than enough space for all of us! We definitely made use of the hot tub more than a few times. Everyone in the group have already talked about booking a summer vacation there! I would highly recommend this Airbnb. Lisa responded so quickly and was so accommodating. I could go on and on about how impressed we all are! Thank you so much for letting us stay there Lisa!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing. Pictures are awesome, and even they don‚Äôt do it justice. Nothing disappointing about this house whatsoever. And the host is great!"

2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lisa is a GREAT host! She is incredibly accommodating and is extremely fast at communicating! I had to reschedule my stay with Lisa due to unforeseen weather conditions but she was very understanding!
2018-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Lisa and her husband have a lovely home and it was a great place for my family over the Christmas holiday. They were more then helpful and even stopped by to help get the fireplace up and running. It‚Äôs a beautiful home and propert. I would highly recommend!
2018-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay! Lots of space, fantastic hottub, and cute atmosphere! We already want to book for our next teipüòä"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location - you would think you were in the black hills! Very scenic location, lots of trees, a great pond and a beautiful outdoor fireplace. Indoors is spectacular as well, very nicely decorated and a lovely indoor hot tub with great outdoor views. It snowed while we were there and what a treat to soak in the tub and watch the snow come down. We will be back!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to have Thanksgiving, close to shopping, so cozy, and comfortable! After driving all day the owners were fine with us checking in early. They also
allowed us to check out a little bit later too. They had fixings for s'mores and chocolates in the bedrooms. The 3 ovens are full sized. Its clean and beautiful inside and out! Our family felt so fortunate to be there together! It was fun!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Group trip,It was a great weekend and we enjoyed both the indoor and outdoor living spaces. We would love to go back!
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Lisa‚Äôs beautiful home and everything was so great. The setting was beautiful, felt like we were in a private park and the home was spacious, and beautifully decorated. We had to plenty of room to be together, or spread out if we wanted to. The spa room was fun. The beds were super comfy and the linens were amazing‚Äîeven had flannel sheets on the beds. Lisa left s‚Äômore fixings to use at the outside fireplace which was nice, and the pond, and the friendly horse, made us feel right at home."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were BLOWN AWAY by the space and the hosting. Lisa added extra thoughtful generous details of wine and chocolates for our anniversary getaway. There was so much there to do rest and relax. We've never had such a pleasant stay at a public or private space....I'm not exaggerating. So many thoughtful details about the sauna, spa, bathrobes, carrots for feeding the horse, etc. So many spots on the property to enjoy nature or comfort. Definitely want to stay again!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Country living at its finest. Absolutely stunningly beautiful set back in hills with nature abound..pictures shown on site show just a small part of this true gem..from the moment we stepped in the house we felt like we were home.....fabulous place for our family to gather and celebrate my sons wedding.....memories made here for a lifetime!!
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Lisa‚Äôs place for two weeks, and it was perfect! The property is so beautiful and the home felt so homey. We also really enjoyed the Spa room! We will definitely be back!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa was wonderful to deal with and the home and grounds were truly lovely. We enjoyed the outdoors so much, I would highly recommend this property. It‚Äôs great for a family with all the special touches but I would also book it for a girls weekend. Very comfortable and peaceful."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pine Hollow Hideaway went beyond our expectations! Lisa was very communicative and flexible. The house looked like it was straight out of Pinterest and we soaked in the hot tub every night. Cell reception was weak but helped everyone log off and really enjoy our time. 10/10 would recommend
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful place. Captures South Dakota at its very best. Lisa was the best hostess. The house and the property are amazing....will be booking next week for our next summer vacation!!!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Pine Hollow Hideaway far exceeded our expectations! Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer. Lisa was such a gracious host. She was responsvie, attentive, and genuinely cared about making our stay as nice as possible.
We loved all the little ""extras"" especially the bathrobes and chocolates/ mints that awaited us in the bedrooms upon our arrival! We felt as though we were at a spa!
The deck adjacent to the kitchen was a wonderful spot to enjoy morning coffee and breakfast. In the evening we sat waterfront and enjoyed a relaxing fire and Smores (Lisa provided all of the supplies!).
The beds and linens were too notch. We all left feeling well rested.
We have stayed at many vacation home rentals and this one was far and away the best! Lisa really raised the bar for a restful and relaxing getaway! It was the perfect place to recharge and spend some much needed time with old friends.
We are looking looking forward to a return visit the next time we pass through Sioux Falls!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, unique property in a country setting. Out of the way place, yet convenient to Sioux Falls attractions. Great for a peaceful getaway with the hot tub, tree house fireplace, and other amenities. Guests must be ready for composting toilet, steep ladder to bedroom, and other quirks, but well worthwhile."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place to relax and get away. Would recommend!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about our stay in the Loft Treehouse! It was so beautiful and relaxing, and Alannah's instructions made everything a breeze. We enjoyed a concert in Sioux Falls, exploring the Falls Park Farmer's Market, lunch at Sanaa's and The Homestead brewery (great recommendations, thank you!) It was just what we needed to relax and unwind. The pictures and description were exactly what we found. The treehouse was clean and had every single thing that we needed. It did get a little windy and we could feel a tiny bit of swaying, but it was not concerning at all. Alannah was a fantastic communicated and had so many thoughtful touches throughout the treehouse. The location is so beautiful and peaceful. Thank you so much. We hope to come again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super fun place to feel like a kid again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little overnight location!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place to spend a chilled out evening or if your looking to stay somewhere quirky
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a treasure it was to escape my real life and spend a night on the plains. The views are beautiful, the space is comfortable, clean, and well appointed.
10/10 would stay here again if I had the opportunity."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I had a fantastic stay! Alannah was a great host, and the treehouse was amazing!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What to say? The tree house is an oasis that I consider a must stay. It has it all - it‚Äôs peaceful, serine, beautiful views, sunrise in Minnesota, sunset in South Dakota, views of Iowa to the south, a fire table, a hot tub, and 360 degree views from the bed! Cannot fault a single thing - even the composting toilet was no big deal (and I was scared about this!). It‚Äôs cozy and calm - perfect for a private and relaxing getaway but close enough to Sioux Falls with several restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. There is a house beyond the tree line that‚Äôs close but we did not see a single person or hear a single noise all weekend. The hosts were incredible, kind, and exceptionally responsive to questions! You must stay here for a get away - you will thank yourself after! We will be back!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent stay! Absolutely beautiful location. The tree house was so cool and well designed! Alannah was incredibly responsive and provided everything we needed for a relaxing getaway.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse is great get away. If you‚Äôre looking for things to do you will have to drive as things are not that close. The host house is closer than I thought from the pictures, and we were able to hear them in the morning. Surrounded by farmland but was very muddy."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was beautiful. The weather was a little wet which made the roads muddy but no problems getting there. We did hear the baying animals which was cool. It was a wonderful getaway.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a fun and unique place to stay! It was quiet and peaceful. It felt like we were sleeping in the clouds. We loved every detail from the robes to the outdoor lights!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at the treehouse and it was just as spectacular as the first time!! The hosts are super friendly! The treehouse is an amazing space and a perfect, peaceful getaway!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very unique experience! Great 360 view through all the windows. Small space but everything we would need. Puzzles, guitar, snacks, robes for the Hot Tub. Very peaceful and enjoyable. My wife says it was magical."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A unique place in the country! Peaceful, beautiful scenery, relaxing. A bit like glamping with the compost toilet and small shower, but we enjoyed it anyway. Loved the hot tub!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Outstanding! Alannah offered to reschedule because of the weather and then checked in on us after we arrived. This is the PERFECT kid free weekend getaway! Will be making this a yearly thing.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great place to come and relax away from the busy-ness of life. I love how we actually can live in a tiny space! It inspires me to live more simply in life.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great host, unique and peaceful setting, clean, fun hot tub and firepit, not far from Sioux Falls SD!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay at the Loft Treehouse! The structure swaying in the wind surprised us initially but we always felt safe and secure. Such a fun anniversary trip hot tubbing and grilling too. Looking forward to coming back!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed my stay a lot. Description was accurate, you are pretty close to the hosts house but still have enough privacy. Only complaint would be cost definitely seems a little steep for what you get. But if money isn‚Äôt an issue it‚Äôs a great stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although it was pretty cold during our stay, we didn't feel the cold at all inside. It was a very warm and cozy atmosphere!"

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cool little place out in the country. Host was great and responsive. Hot tub was nice and relaxing and the fire pit area on the second level would be great on a cool evening. Got really windy one day and the tree house was a swaying a bit, not too bad, and we felt very secure and safe. The composting toilet took a minute to get used to, but added to the experience of a tree house. the view from the bed was cool too, 360 degree views!
It's close proximity to Sioux Falls and some of the other small towns add to dining experiences.
Overall a neat place to checkout if you're in the area, we'll be back for sure!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had the most fantastic stay at the lookout treehouse. The hosts were EXCEPTIONALLY kind and quick to respond to questions/any issues that we had. Such a lovely, private location but also being so close to Sioux Falls is convenient. Several people have reached out after seeing our pictures of this place, and we would recommend it 10 fold!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little treehouse cabin, enjoyed how peaceful it was, and it‚Äôs not too far from many things to do and see."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Hands down the best overnight getaway! We live very close but wanted something special and private. Alannah was very informative of how to get there as well as having everything prepared including the hot tub! The treehouse was very clean and stocked with items we would need such as a fully stocked kitchenette area! The views were so amazing! Alannah was quick to respond to any questions we had during our stay! 10/10 highly recommend a stay! We will be back! Thank you again!!!!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Do yourselves a favor and book this treehouse if it‚Äôs available! An amazing little weekend stay!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was nice
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I am a travel nurse. I was headed back home to south, central Iowa from NW North Dakota. My spouse and I were pleasantly surprised‚Ä¶.no, make that wowzered! The little things made this stay so nice. From the fire pit to the hot tub to the 360* view of sunrise while lying in bed. One cannot beat this! The toilet was not an issue. In fact, I am proud of this young couple. There is recycling going on as well as water conservation, which we have an appreciation for. You will NOT be disappointed by staying at this bnb. This has been our favorite ever since we started travel nursing."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was so peaceful and secluded! Felt immediately at home and cozy. Would totally go back!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alannah‚Äôs treehouse was the perfect getaway for our girls weekend ~ cozy, comfortable and serene. For a small space it is exceptionally well appointed! So many little extras and we couldn‚Äôt get enough of the 360¬∞ peaceful view. The sunsets are amazing as are the sunrises.
I would definitely return ~ thank you for sharing your special space!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay. Nice views and close to Sioux Falls.
Extras in the fridge were a nice surprise."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a cute small treehouse, perfect for 2. I really liked the hot tub and the views from the top bedroom. The sunrises are amazing! I enjoyed the kitchenette and the provided utensils/skillets, spices so we had less to pack. We also drove to check out Beaver Creek Nature Area while here. I would definitely come back in the future."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely stunning! Loved the hot tub & various views from different levels of the tree house. Easy to find & such a unique place to stay! Have ZERO worries in regards to the toilet- you cannot smell a single thing!!!! Super clean & bed was cozy & comfy! Host is super responsive & even helped get back my belonging I accidentally left behind! 10/10 recommend & would stay again! ‚ù£Ô∏è
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was a very windy night and cold. Wish we were there a night to enjoy the extra amenities a little more. The wind chill was so cold out that we stayed inside for the most part. We attempted the hot tub, but we had to be under water most the time and the tub lost the heat way too quickly. No fault if the owners, just a bad time to go."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Lookout Loft Treehouse! Such a cozy, peaceful, inviting place‚Ä¶we didn‚Äôt want to leave! The space is small but so well laid out, Alannah had thought of everything we could need! The views, the windows, the hot tub, the fireplace was such a hit! Loved having the futon and comfy place to sit while enjoying the fire and watching the snow fall. We highly recommend staying here and plan on coming back! Thanks for your hospitality Alannah and Mike!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to stay during the South Dakota portion of our honeymoon! The views were great no matter which direction we looked. Even though the tree house is close to the owners house, we still felt like we had complete privacy. I was a little nervous about the toilet at first but it ended up not being a problem whatsoever. We loved our stay and didn‚Äôt want to leave when it was time to check out. Truly an amazing place!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this is a beautiful place to stay. everything is well kept. there are so many nice touches and a breathtaking view no matter which way you look.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay! Alannah did a great job making sure everything was laid out very clearly and made herself available if questions or concerns were to arise. The Lookout Loft is such a quaint cozy place with great views and a peaceful environment.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Treehouse was perfect! We loved our short stay. It was cozy for the windy/ chilly weather we had. We made use of the hot tub right when we got there which helped us relax and settle in after our drive. The next morning we played cards and didn‚Äôt want to leave! We stayed right up until our check out time to get as much out of our experience as possible. We would love to come back again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very beautiful venue! All of our needs were met, and the host was very gracious."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Place you won‚Äôt be disappointed
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You never know what autumn weather will bring and for us, it was high winds and light rain. We would have loved to take advantage of the patio on the mezzanine and the ample outside space, but that wasn't in the cards. Instead we stayed nice and cozy by the pellet stove and cooked a nice dinner. A tiny kitchen, as you'd expect, but equipped with just about everything you'd need to make a nice meal for two. (if you use both ranges and the toaster oven at the same time, the breaker is on the power-strip ;))
The space is very sturdy, clean, and looks very new. In high winds it sways slightly. The host understood that this might be a little scary, so they offered up a guest room in the house, which we appreciated, but were enjoying the rain on the metal roof as we slept. The bedroom is lofted above the living area so it's just the bed up there, which offers an amazing 360 view of the farms and turbines. An amazing sight to wake up to."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a serene beauty! And a hidden-gem! We thoroughly enjoyed EVERYTHING about our stay and experience! Highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A unique way to experience all that rural South Dakota has to offer. This space is eclectic yet functional and will leave you with a true experience vs. just a regular old Airbnb.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay in a very cool tree house! It was so much fun being in there during the storm!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Exactly as advertised. The sunrise was stunning from the house! Alanna was an amazing communicator and very kind. Looking forward to booking again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very clean and cozy. beautiful view. It was well designed and built. lots of little details. very friendly hosts. Would definitely recommend for a quiet and unique stay. wish we had an extra day there! Overall awesome experience!
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful and unique stay in a treehouse, I recommend to ALL!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a cool place! We absolutely loved the view and the house itself. Everything was so clean and kept up well. We wish we could‚Äôve stayed a few more nights here to really enjoy the area! Alannah was great at communicating and was watching the weather for us prior to our arrival. We would definitely go back but stay longer next time!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was amazing, peaceful and lots of fun. Thank u for a unique place to stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great spot! Quiet, cozy and peaceful. Views are great, amenities are just what you need. What is worth noting is how close you are to so many great restaurants, wineries, hiking, etc. Great place to stay for a perfect getaway!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I celebrated our 27th wedding anniversary at Alanna's treehouse. It was a dream! We enjoyed the location, the peace, and even a rainbow that stuck around the entire evening. The place is so much fun and well worth the experience! Thank you so much for a memorable anniversary!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful Treehouse amongst the farmlands. Great views from the upper bedroom and deck was perfect for afternoon and morning coffee. It was kitted out with all the necessary amenities for a very comfortable stay. Wish we stayed longer. Definitely recommend.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a lovely stay in the tree house. What a unique experience! The views were great and we enjoyed the fire pit and hot tub.
2023-09-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"By looking at the pictures, we thought the tree house would be more secluded as we booked it for a romantic getaway. But the main house is 20 yards away from the main house.
The toilet situation was a problem, especially for the price. would have been nice to know prior to booking that there were no flushing capabilities
There were so many flies at the time we stayed there that it was absolutely impossible to enjoy outside. Especially the hot tub. Within minutes of getting in, we had lots of dead flies in our drinks. It would have been also nice to have a place that is comfy to sit down at. As the bar stools were uncomfortable to sit in after a while, we ended up sitting on the floor at times.
we did leave early, booked 2 nights, and left after the first. We asked for a refund for the 2nd night, to which we received a 14% refund, which we appreciated"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very fun and appreciated close proximity to our current location.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This treehouse was so much fun! Great views, comfortable spaces, responsive host, private setting, most unique Airbnb we‚Äôve ever stayed in!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was perfect AFTER the construction equipment left. It would have been nice to be notified that they had shown up and we would have delayed our arrival.....hard to enjoy the hot tub and outdoor space with the noise...
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really unique place! Treehouse was fun and the hot tube and gas firepit/grill level is an awesome added touch. Really enjoyed our stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host was responsive and catering. It was our first time to the treehouse and our first trip together. The host was super sweet and had a bottle of wine waiting for us. Everything in he tree house was prepared and organized perfectly.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay, Alannah was a great host!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing views from a really unique space! Comfy bed and thoughtful touches. Morning coffee in the hot tub was perfect.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a wonderful experience, should I ever go back I would love to experience this place in fall/winter."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were in the area for a concert in Sioux Falls. It was a super easy drive to town but so nice to be away from the hustle and bustle to unwind. So peaceful!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The hot tub was so nice. Beautiful treehouse. A nice place to get away from home!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a few questions before we arrived and Alannah was very responsive. When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised by a bottle of wine and chocolates. She remembered it was our 25th wedding anniversary and went out of her way to make it special. I rented this tree house for my husband as I don't like heights, however it didn't bother me and the views were absolutely worth it. Beautiful sunsets and being in the treetops with the birds was awesome. We did have a storm while there and watching the lightning show was amazing. (Alannah did text and tell us we could come to the house if we were uncomfortable being in the tree house). There is a hot tub and numerous places to sit outside to enjoy the weather and views, which we didn't get to enjoy due to the weather as it was 100 degrees. We would definitely go back. Thank you for the incredible experience! Ernie and Jo from Iowa"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was like something out of a movie! Such a gorgeous property with rolling farmlands and beautiful views all around. We were very comfortable, and Alannah provided everything we could need. It really was the most relaxing and enchanting stay. The welcome gang of kittens with their mama pushed this place over the top!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This treehouse is super special. We loved everything about it from the moment we saw it peeking out above the trees as we drove in. The little touches like Led lights in the bedroom to the Christmas lights that wrapped the porch and came on at dusk, it was lovely. We watched the sunset on the deck and then the morning fog. Perfect night."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is an amazing stay and we felt very welcomed but private. It‚Äôs truly a one of a kind experience and we loved staying here!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved the stay at Alannah and Mike‚Äôs treehouse! It was everything I expected and then some. I thoroughly enjoyed the few days spent- from being able to sit in the hot tub and drink a coffee at sunrise and hearing the birds chirp to sitting outside on some comfy chairs overlooking crops grow. It was truly an amazing experience! Will definitely be coming back- amazing hospitality and experience.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed for one night and enjoyed our experience. The view is beautiful and it was very peaceful while we were there. The treehouse is a little closer to the host‚Äôs residence than what we expected but ultimately it was not a problem for us. They were respectful of giving us our space and privacy. The host was very accommodating. We especially appreciated the snacks and water that was available. We enjoyed some time relaxing in the hot tub once the sun went down and it was a great way to end our day. The sleeping area was a little tricky to get to get to a comfortable sleeping temperature. When we arrived it was pretty warm so we turned the air down and the fan on. When we climbed into bed the temperature was comfortable. During the night, the ceiling fan got to be a little too much even at the lowest speed so we turned it off and opened windows and then it was comfortable. We lucked out with a cool July evening. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would come again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a treasure!! Thank you so much for your creativity and sharing with the world. This place is awesome! If you can stay more then one night do it! Hubby and I stayed for a few nights and was recharging and uplifting. No worries on the weather, the hosts are awesome and let you know before it comes in and you can go to the main house to wait it out. We had a storm one night but we decided to stay in the treehouse and we were safe and sound 70 mph gusts‚Ä¶ if you are on the fence about this place just do it it‚Äôs so awesome!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a wonderful time at this treehouse! It was very quiet and peaceful. Had a smooth check in and out process, and would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a slice of paradise!! We loved watching nearby fireworks from the top level, soaking in the hot tub with the string lights (and fireflies) creating the perfect ambiance, and sipping on coffee the following morning with incredible views! We feel refreshed and WILL be back! Thank you Alannah! ü§ó"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay. We loved the covered middle deck area. It had comfortable chairs to sit in. While on the deck, we were fortunate to have a nice breeze and enjoyed listening to the birds.
Inside there was a kitchen table and chairs but there was no other comfortable seating options due to the lack of space. The bed was comfortable. Inside it was quiet and peaceful.
Overall, we enjoyed the unique experience of staying in the loft house."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was cozy quaint and simple. Our visit was fun. We had storms that night with 60 mph winds and could feel the tower structure move/sway. Construction was happening during visit which was noticeable. but understandable.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everyone needs a weekend getaway here! This treehouse is a fun and beautiful place to stay. Not far from the city where you will find lots of delicious restaurants and beautiful nature walks, but just far enough that you feel like your all alone. The view from the balcony was beautiful, especially at night with all the fireflies lighting up the feilds, and we could see so many stars! If you are looking for a beautiful, serene, and unique place to stay, this is your place! I will also add that Alannah was a fantastic host! We will definitely be back."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had such a great stay! if we're ever in the area we will be back! Thank you Alannah!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Peaceful!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We live only a few miles away, but we couldn‚Äôt resist checking this place out! The space was so clean and unique. We definitely enjoyed not having anywhere particular to be and nothing particular to do. It enabled us to really take life slow and enjoy the surrounding views. The hot tub was definitely a staple in our morning and evening routine. We made sure to take advantage of having a grill and a fire pit as well. There was not much missing from this place besides maybe having the capability to connect wifi or airplay to the tv. The bed was very comfy and the bathroom is easy to get used to using. Couldn‚Äôt of had a better time. Thank you!!"
2023-06-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The sleeping quarters were much smaller than expected and it was 90 degrees up there...far too warm for a comfortable sleep. We were not aware the bathroom had a compost toilet with limited water, much less room for a shower. The firepit wasn't functioning, the hot tub was dirty and half the outside lights did not work. Also the structure ""moved"" more than necessary in the wind, even walking around in it. We did not care for the homeowner doing his yardwork in the evening. We did not even stay our second night that we paid for."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a beautiful place to stay for a peaceful getaway!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great place to escape the noise of the city. Nice place to unwind.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the treehouse! We were in the neighborhood for a long weekend and thought it would be fun to try something new - and it was. It had everything we needed and the view was fantastic. We thought it would be an amazing place to see a good thunderstorm roll in, but alas Mother Nature wasn't cooperating. Good for watching pretty sunsets though!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed our stay, very peaceful."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an amazing property. 360 degree views, listen to the birds, very peaceful. Enjoyed the hot tub and the home is well stocked, and super clean. Unique treehouse might not be for people with trouble climbing, but well worth it! Thank you Alanna!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful treehouse so serene. It‚Äôs ideal to decompress. Exactly as described. A little slice of paradise. Hosts are wonderful
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very beautiful experience. Only thing is that there is carpet in the Tree House so if it rains, it will be muddy so be careful going inside the tree house. Other than that 100% I would recommend."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very unique place to stay. I rented it for my parents who are in there late 50s and the stairs up to the bed were getting to be a little steep for them. If you are older than this, the stairs to the bed might be too much for you. But it is a very cool and unique place to stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was a great, close-by getaway just to relax."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had the best time celebrating our wedding anniversary. Such a beautiful place to be!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really unique experience. Highly recommend this place. Peace and tranquility abound!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Alannah provided great instructions and we enjoyed our stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a fun getaway and so unique !!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A much needed, relaxing night stay at the loft treehouse! The hot tub was perfect during the cold, windy night and we warmed right up in front of the fire! Alannah was always quick to respond to any questions or requests. She was an amazing host, as well as her husband who offered to sand the steps due to the rain, wind and low temps! Also, thank you for the wine!
Beautiful place! Thanks again, we hope to be back soon! :)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! The weather wasn‚Äôt the best, but Alannah gave us a little more time on our final morning so we could enjoy some of the amenities before checking out. We will absolutely be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cool and cute place to stay, very unique, if you venture into Valley Springs everyone is super friendly and Alannah was lovely and responsive to our questions!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This high-up air bnb is unique. We were scheduled to come during a blizzard and host was receptive to rescheduling a couple days later. Just the last mile of road is dirt/gravel and was extremely muddy and snow drifted but host was responsive via messages, text and calls and offered to plow it right before we came and make sure we could get through alright. This ""treehouse"" is actually in the side-yard of the host's residence, which allowed for easier assistance and access than the pictures led me to expect. They left towels and robes for hot tub use, which was thoughtful and enjoyed. The space was clean and the carpet was comfortable to sit on by the fire stove. The steps up to the top level of windows/bed is quite steep."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a peaceful place to stay for a last minute getaway. If you want to disconnect from the business of life, this is a great place to do that. The attention to detail is apparent. We definitely recommend staying here."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alannah‚Äôs treehouse was absolutely beautiful. We had the best time here, it was cozy and comfortable! Plus, she was a great host and made sure that we felt invited and taken care of. I would definitely recommend."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place for a winter getaway. We loved how peaceful and relaxing it was.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Relaxing getaway for a couple, Sioux Falls is very close by for all types of dining. Thank you Alannah and Mike!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Such a fun thing to do. Soaking in the hot tub while it was cold out was such a treat. The view from the very top was so beautiful to fall asleep to and then wake up to! A great experience over all
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely PERFECT is what we experienced ! Everything was SO organized & accessible to us . Alannah & Mike showed such true , genuine hospitality & made us feel so welcome . Their place is a hidden paradise that we are going to go back to for years to come .

We THANK YOU Alannah & Mike with all our hearts !"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a fun and unique stay in winter! We enjoyed the hot tub immensely. The space was cozy and the windows everywhere made it feel spacious. The host was super responsive and helpful. This place would be great to stay at in all seasons. Our 3 nights flew by.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This treehouse is the perfect place for spending a few days in the Sioux Falls area! The location is both convenient for getting to the city while also remote enough to have some privacy and country feel. we especially loved the fire pit and hot tub access. Alannah was an excellent host and great communicator. I highly recommend this stay and will be back the next time we are in the Siouxland!
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely little loft!! Great views and the privacy was great as well! Lots of little things that made the place super welcoming!! The hot tub was not ready for use, which was a bit of a disappointment since we only stayed for one night, but Alannah made it right for us with a little refund without us even asking!! Would definitely recommend this wonderful place üòä"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at the treehouse. The views were incredible and it was just peaceful. Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better getaway!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A perfect unique get away for two. As outdoors people we loved the connection to being aloft over the trees and farmland. The balcony is lit with white lights at night The hot tube is lovely even in a chilly evening. A quiet secluded location just 20 minutes from town.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I celebrated our first anniversary at the tree house and we couldn‚Äôt be happier we did! The views, amenities and hospitality were outstanding. Everything was clean and organized. Watching the sunset and sunrise from the deck was beautiful but with windows on all sides you could get the same views inside in colder months. Can‚Äôt wait to be back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Simply a wonderful, unique experience! We found the treehouse had just enough to make our short stay perfectly comfortable without cluttering the cozy space. We never found ourselves lacking any of the comforts of home. Alannah has thought about the details and it shows. The views are amazing, and watching the sunrise from the upstairs bed is such a cool way to start the day. This is such a neat, unexpected find, nestled amongst the corn fields. This is a stay we would highly recommend and we hope to be back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a wonderful time celebrating our 1 year wedding anniversary in the TreeHouse! We would highly recommend üòÄ
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The treehouse was perfect! Everything was immaculately clean, it was super peaceful, and had panoramic views of the sunrises and sunsets. Hot tub was very relaxing!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, unique and quiet space. The hottub was great after a long day of driving. Thoughtful touches and great communication from host. Most environmentally aware Airb&b we‚Äôve stayed in.‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful, relaxing little hideaway minutes from the city!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in the tree house for two nights. While we were there, temperatures were well up in the 90's so the indoor air conditioning during the heat of the day was wonderful, and opening the windows in the evening brought in a refreshing breeze. We hiked in nearby Blue Mound State Park, visited Luverne, also Souix Falls. Everything about the tree house is designed for efficiency especially their attention to water usage. Alannah provides clear guidelines on how to live comfortably in this small and very interesting space."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here! Very clean and organized! Loved the views and peaceful atmosphere! Communication was great and very welcoming!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is a great place to get disconnected from the world! Much needed peace and quiet. You feel like you are up in the trees with birds and can hear their little chirping talks from even closer... :)....God's fingerprints are evident all around; in the beautiful landscaping, corn fields as far as eyes can see. Watching all this from the wraparound deck and basking in the warmth of the sun....and at night perfect silence watching millions of stars in the sky...Amazing experience!
Thank you Mike and Alannah for sharing this beautiful place with others."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing stay and amazing tree house! Everything was well cared for and Alannah and Mike were so thoughtful with items stocked/supplied. We had a great time and highly recommend staying if you have the chance.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A magical place to get some R&R. The views and amenities are amazing and Alannah was communicative and friendly. I'd love to stay here again someday! As a side note, the treehouse does require climbing stairs including a step ladder to the bed in the loft. Unless you have mobility issues it's worth it so don't let it scare you away! Also the compost toilet was no big deal either. :)"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay here very much! The treehouse is exactly what I was looking for and as described. I like to find unique places to stay with my 9 year old grandson and this was perfect for his age. The hot tub, fire pit and patio areas are very nice. The views are spectacular from anywhere in and around the treehouse. Thank you for sharing this amazing space. Our time here will be a cherished memory."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is such a cute and relaxing place to stay. The hot tub was great for unwinding after a long day.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sunrise and sunset lovers paradise! Extra amenities like fire pit, hot tub, deck chairs for relaxing summer nights.
Experience the sounds of the country while waking up to a stunning sunrise from bed. Everything is as described. Great host- responsive to our questions and accommodating. Close to several state parks. Highly recommend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We decided to give this place a shot to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary and we could not have been happier. Alannah and her husband were great! Check-in was easy and being greeted by the amazing smell of smoked meat made me know right away that this place was for me. We went into this trip with no plans and found plenty to do that is not to far away. Definitely check out Devils Gulch, area farmers markets and even though you probably do not have children with you, Dave & Busters in Sioux Falls. (Guilty pleasure and now officially a tradition.) The first day was in the upper 90's but the treehouse felt great. The a/c and both ceiling fans put out plenty of air. On the first night we were hoping for some lightning shows or a nice sunset but it was too cloudy for a sunset and the storm may have been far off but it gave great views. The LED light strips made up for the lacking storms and was a nice touch on both levels of the house. The windows all the way around on both levels provides many different views. We really enjoyed sitting on the top deck with the solar lights enjoying the silence of the evening. The bed was very comfortable and we could have laid there all day. The second day was much cooler out and we were able to use the hot tub. My wife did not have water to her knee yet when she stated ""I am not leaving this for a few hours"". With the strong cool wind whipping through, it could not have been much better. We did not get a chance to try out the fire pit on this trip but hope to make it back in the cooler months. That evening we had a wonderful sunset that you could see from 3 sides of the house. A storm rolled in around 11pm and seemed to last until morning. The lightning lit up the bedroom while the sound of heavy rain and thunder was better than any sleep music. (There were a few that startled me up.) Even with flash flood warnings being issued the walkway to and from the treehouse was well sheltered and not to messy. The main living area of the house was very clean and inviting. If you are used to lounging on a couch the chairs may not be your thing but do like we did and make a spot with out extra blankets and pillows on the floor. It worked just fine. The coat hooks on the back of the stairs was a great idea to utilize the space. We had a much needed wonderful time and we truly hope to make it back as much as possible. Do yourself a favor and book yourself some peace.
P.S. Do not let the toilet scare you, it is not anything that you will even think about after the first use. No smell and not what some may be picturing. The water lasted fine for us and if you follow the guidelines you should not have any issues."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alannah‚Äôs place is something special! It is a beautiful hand built treehouse loft that includes a nice hot tub, beautiful middle level deck with grilling supplies & outdoor furniture & the top level with a wrap around deck and a safe and cozy loft! The string lights around the house are beautiful and the sunsets are beautiful! My girlfriend and I loved our 4 day trip here and will definitely be favoriting this listing!! We loved the hosts too, they are so welcoming and helpful!! 5/5 stay"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There isn't enough space to include all the things that made this stay so incredible. The construction is very impressive. The setup is perfect for 2 people looking to spend time together in a setting that is so peaceful and relaxing. The views at sunrise, sunset, and during the night are beautiful. I would rate our experience well above 5 stars if it were possible. Absolutely exceeded expectations."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Adorable little treehouse with an amazing view. The sunsets were gorgeous from the top deck!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a unique place to stay! You can relax on several patios and enjoy the view for miles. Or sit in front of a fire outside. Enjoy the sunset or sunrise in the hot tub. The 360 view from the bedroom all the way at the top is the best. We loved our stay and our hosts were so great!
