2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"1st things 1st my girls were happy from the start! House was a warm comfortable fishing cabin, but that is kind of a understatement. The view from the back towards the lake was amazing! And at night you could see the bright LED lights from the UTVs cruising around the lake and people just enjoying life. During the day the restaurants in Zapata were perfect! BUT our host Tony was a all around life saver! I wasn’t in town for fish, I was there to do work on our dear lease in Falcon. Camping just wasn’t a option for my girls especially in this heat in Texas, but nonetheless I had work to get done. During our adventure miles from the nearest highway 83 I had a blowout in my 4x4. I was able to get the spare on and get back to the main road but wasn’t feeling comfortable with the old wanky spare. So I reached out to Tony just for a recommendation. Holy smokes the people treated us like family replaced 2 tires and got us back on the road. Couldn’t have gone any better. Thanks Tony! HERO!"

Really didn’t spend much time in there other than just showering and sleeping."

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good for guys fishing Falcon. Gate is pretty narrow to back a boat in, but doable. Furniture is old but comfortable. Showers ok, but could use some maintenance."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bring your paper goods and zip locks bags.
Bring your can of propane for the grill.
Bring some kitchen linens for washing dishes. Bring a 12 cup coffee maker,coffee, creamer, and sugar if you have more than 1 person. A/C and heat worked great! TV was great! The awning with lights was great for rigging baits and doing boat stuff at night. The gate is a little tight for a 21ft bassboat but we got it in there. We had a good time and will come back. Just make sure if you use the ramp in town that when you go to the main channel go around the red things. Either on left or right. DO NOT go between there is a bridge underwater about a foot you can’t see!!!"

I was extremely tired and destined to find a place in McAllen. By chance I checked James listing and it was cheaper than places in McAllen. So I booked it and I am so glad I did. The place was absolutely gorgeous. Super clean, super comfy. It is based pretty much on a river and it was easy to access. I didn’t get to meet James but he was there to help me with any questions I needed. Thanks James!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I travel for work and usually try to get an Airbnb whenever I’m out on the road just for more privacy and to feel as if I’m in a home away from home. This one is perfect. Being close to a grocery store, restaurants and gas stations was very nice especially since they are on the route to the Airbnb when traveling from San Ygnacio. Also, it is very quiet inside of the Airbnb too.
I am looking forward to staying here again for another long term reservation."

Driveway access super easy and you’re right there in the middle of town. Couldn’t have had a better stay here in Zapata. Thank you Noe!"
,,,"Over $100 a night for this was way too much! A coffee maker is provided but no filters, cups, or coffee available. The music at the bar was so loud both Friday and Saturday nights the building we were in was literally shaking. This went on until well into the early morning. The bed was comfortable and the split air/heat unit helped to drown out the loud music."
,,,I don't recommend anyone to book this place too dirty lack of towels TVs without audio window that don't close animal nests lack of light you can't enter the shower due to the black encrusted sun loungers broken without internet I recommend you look for another place to stay unformal people
