It was furnished with anything that you would need. We enjoyed just relaxing and taking it easy. The cottage was so cozy and I loved watching the hummingbirds. We took our boat but the river was too high to fish so we just enjoyed riding on the river. Our grandson stayed part of the weekend and he loved the playground. Troy and Leslie were quick to respond and we will definitely book from them again.

It‚Äôs super cozy, comfy, accommodating, perfectly located & well wired
All the things you want when you want to get away, but you don‚Äôt really don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúget away‚Äù. üòÇüòÇ
Being a stone‚Äôs throw from the river, a beautiful playground, and one of the area‚Äôs best steakhouses, in Benton Lee‚Äôs, is just added benefits. .

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was beautiful and in a great location for the time and travel of my needs. It‚Äôs a peaceful, relaxing, well cleaned and stocked environment. It looked exactly as the pictures online and was even better in person.
The host responds back to your messages in a timely manner, and I appreciate that very much. Would like to keep this a little secret from others (lol)
Would certainly return and recommend this home to those that needs to relax
Thank you"
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,"I dont remember the listing describing
There would be a detached structure on site that would be occupied. There was also a lot of flies that would get into the house most specifically the kitchen area so that was a nuisance, but other than that, it was very accommodating and fairly clean."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,The home was spotless and had everything we needed
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The Home was beautiful and in a great location. It was so relaxing and much bigger than we expected.

It looked amazing in the pictures online and was even better in person.
The host responds back to your messages in a timely manner, and I appreciate that very much.
Would certainly return and recommend this home."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We came up for the Vidalia Onion festival and air show. The house was clean and well stocked. The coffee bar was over the top. Great location, close to everything."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We traveled 4hrs with a toddler and 4 weeks old for a wedding in the area! The house was perfect for both ages, super clean and spacious. The location is perfect too!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Felt right at home the moment we walked in. Home was beautiful and super spacious. Close to restaurants and shops which was convenient. Definitely staying here again when back in the area.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We had a last minute, two night booking and checked in around 9pm. The front door key pad wasn‚Äôt coded correctly, so I had to message the host to be told that the car port door was the one coded (even though the listing instructions said front door too). Not a huge deal, just a little inconvenient when my family is all tired and cranky.
The home is tastefully decorated and clean. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen had a basket of snacks, which is a nice touch.
The neighborhood is ok. I didn‚Äôt realize the house had another occupied dwelling right on the property, with a shared yard.
I was surprised to see that we were expected to do our own dishes (wash, dry, and put away), strip the beds and place the linens next to the washing machine, collect and place the bathroom towels on the bathroom floor, and remove the trash bag after paying a $125 cleaning fee."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,had a good stay at Jae's home. Jae is very helpful and friendly. house is located in a quiet area. good beds and comfortable home. will book here again next time.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Jae‚Äôs place was exactly as described. I found the beds comfortable and the home was clean. The kitchen was well stocked. Jae was always very responsive to questions or issues. The only negative about this home is the location. It is on a very busy side street with an ambulance that seems to cover the entire area. The traffic noise can be a little intrusive. Of course, I work night shift and sleep when it is busiest. Other than the noise, the location is convenient to everything in Vidalia. I will definitely stay here again because the home is well taken care of and the price is fair."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I could not have been happier with my stay. Not only was everything as described - it was super simple to check-in and out. The dishes stocked in the kitchen we're perfect for a small or large family, which was nice. The neighborhood was super quiet although walkable to near by convenience and fast food locations. The place was clean and Jae even provided snacks and water, which was perfect for the first night because we got in later than expected and didn't make grocery store hours. We will definitely be staying again!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I come to Vidalia semi-frequently for business, and have never really found the hotels in the area to be that great. This was a serious upgrade. The house was spotless, with a large, fantastic kitchen to cook in and very comfortable beds. On several occasions during our stay I forgot temporarily that I was on a work trip....we felt right at home. Definitely recommend."

I recommend staying here if you get the chance to visit Vidalia."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family visits this area quite frequently. Very small towns with not a lot of options we like close by.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! The host was very responsive with requests, and the amenities and space were as nice as depicted. If we had the option to stay another night, we might have considered, but they were already booked :)"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,It was evident that Jae put a lot of work into this property. My mother loved the house so much she wanted to purchase the property. This was my first experience using a AirBNB. This experience changed my perspective about staying in these types of homes.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in Vidalia to visit family and had our two kids with us. The house was easy to find and access, there was plenty of space for the kids to sleep and run around, and the house looked exactly like the photos. Clean and very comfortable!

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Jae's place is a newly renovated older ranch home. Jae did a fantastic job with renovations and furnishing. The home looks professionally decorated. Everything in the home is new. The kitchen is stocked with enough dishes and pots and pans to cook your meals. The home does not have a dishwasher but everything is provided for handwashing. The beds are comfortable and the baths are furnished with lush towels and upscale bath products. The area is quiet except for some morning traffic. Jae follows up to make sure you have everything you need during you stay. I would highly recommended Jae's home for your future stay.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place!! 5 star me and my family love this place!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable house in a private setting perfect for relaxing. The house was very clean and decorated beautifully. Beds were so comfortable with luxury bedding. It can be a bit tricky finding the house but Mark gave us his cell number, answered right away and sent a google maps link that took us straight there (we were using Waze). I would not recommend trying to locate at night as it is a bit secluded.
Would highly recommend and will rent again in the future.
Catherine Martin"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place. We absolutely loved Marks cabin . Short drive to Vidalia, Reidsville and only around an hr to Savannah. We had loads of fun in Savannah. Enjoyed the Vidalia onion festival and spent a ton of time visiting family. Great week and this cabin made it so enjoyable!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This airbnb was PERFECT! The house was clean and made you feel like home. We loved the added touches like a box of spaghetti and sauce on the counter and the keurig coffee machine and pods. The view from the back deck is so quiet and relaxing. What a great porch to sit on and bbq with family. We were so lucky to find this airbnb in an area that you wouldn't expect to find many options. It's also close enough to day trip to Savannah and not pay the expensive Savannah lodging prices! If you're looking for a quiet peaceful setting to relax and recharge your soul, this is it!!!!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mark's place a wonderful quiet retreat with a modern and relaxed country vibe. Mark was super accommodating and his property managers take excellent care of the home and guests alike. The sofas and beds are extremely comfortable and every room is equipped with a smart TV. But nothing beats the serenity of sipping coffee on the deck and watching the birds and occasional deer come through the yard.

I had asked Mark prior to arrival about fishing, and when we got there he had 2 brand new poles for us to use and even offered me use of his personal tackle box.
The property was exactly what I was looking for private, quiet and peaceful. A few times while my boyfriend and I were fishing at the pond, I stopped and whispered, ‚ÄúListen to how quiet it is out here‚Äù. And, not a creepy quiet, a calm, peaceful quiet‚Ä¶.Yes, there is a difference. üòâ
Mark was my first ever Airbnb host, and I was a little nervous about the whole process with it being my first time and all and Mark couldn‚Äôt have made any easier for me. He responded quickly and NICELY. Check-in couldn‚Äôt have gone smoother or been easier."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Mike‚Äôs cabin was great for our short getaway. Would definitely stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place was wonderful! Very private, clean, and beautiful location. We rented kayaks and went down the river that's right in front of the cabin. The fire pit was perfect for an outdoor activity as well. As a few 20 year olds, we wanted to get away from the city and relax in nature. We felt very safe at this location, great prices for everything. Also, the neighbor who is next to the cabin helped us load up the kayaks and drove us down to a spot on the river in his humvee. His name is Storm, he showed us his goats and chickens they had as well! Very personable and friendly. This was the perfect week stay as a vacation, we hope to come back soon! The only downside we found was the road that leads to the cabin itself. If it rains, it gets pretty flooded. I would recommend a SUV or truck to get to the location. Or I'm sure the neighbor Storm I mentioned could help with that. You could use a car but would have to proceed with caution. Thank you again we hope to be back soon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place in the woods on the river. Enjoyed the porches and the dirt road takes me way back to my younger days. I don't think it lacks for anything. Thanks

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying at Mikes place. My friends and I loved it and so did the pups! Spent a few days in nature soaking up the sunshine and relaxing. Highly recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My best friend and I came for a weekend getaway. Mike's cabin was perfect. Far better than the pictures show. The private beach was a perfect place for morning coffee or just enjoying the sun. Loved the fire pit in the evenings. And the kayak trip down the river was incredible! Thank you Mike and your friendly neighbor Storm for everything!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Mike‚Äôs cabin! Great spot, the beach is 20 feet from the house. We took kayaks and were able to put in from the beach. Would definitely recommend using Gogle maps to get to the house- Apple Maps will not take you to the right location. We‚Äôll definitely be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mike is an outstanding host! Very helpful, great communication. Went above and beyond to deliver a wonderful stay! The cabin is so beautiful! All the creature comforts of home and then some! Mike and his wife definitely went above and beyond! Highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutley loved it! Was looking for a private, peaceful place for a short weekend and we found it - right on the river. Mike was quick to answer any questions we had before we got there. The kitchen had everything we needed, a wonderful grill/griddle and fire pit! Thank you Mike!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect private get away. During certain times 4 wheel drive is definitely best to get there.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an amazing stay! thank you mike!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely charming cabin and the surroundings were peaceful and quiet, perfect for our getaway weekend. Mike was very helpful with directions getting there and recommendations for where to kayak, and even surprised us with fresh eggs from his chickens. Dog friendly was a bonus and our two pups also gave a 5 paw rating. Highly recommended and would definitely return."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a good time, gonna come back when it warms up so we can get in the river."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic secluded cabin perfect to get away and enjoy the peace and quiet.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and peaceful. The cabin was immaculate.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful and peaceful spot for relaxation and kayaking or canoeing right on the Ohoopee River. There is a great sandbar that you can stake out as your private beach, which our dog loved. The water is very clear and flowing - perfect for a float trip. The house is lovely and comfortable with room for a family group. The kitchen was fully stocked and there is an overflow refrigerator on back porch. If you need supplies, Lyons and Vidalia are about 10 to 14 miles away. There are some lovely independent restaurants there as well. I needed to work a bit while there, and was able to just set up on the back porch and overlook the river - not a bad office. There is WIFI - but I used my own. Also a TV for college football. I am so glad the cabin is dog friendly so I can take my travel companion with me. We would love to stay there again and take better advantage of the kayaking and canoeing opportunities. Thank you Mike"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a 10/10. Wonderful and cozy location, perfect access to the river. Just the kind of relaxing and beautiful weekend I needed! We will be back üòä"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Looking for a nice, relaxing, and affordable get away? Look no further!! The cabin is SUPER nice and has plenty of space for you and your family. With a covered porch complete with a grill and skillet, you can cook up a good meal while enjoying the relaxing sounds of nature. We were fortunate to get some good weather, and some not so good weather. But the not so good weather was welcomed as the sounds of the thunderstorm and rain on the tin roof made for a PERFECT half day. For the first part of the day, we explored the Ohoopee River where we were able to catch some pretty decent sized bass! The part of the river directly in front of the cabin is really shallow, but if you walk down further, wading in the river, you can find some deeper water with fish! The fire pit was also a nice touch as we made s‚Äômores each night we stayed! We drank our morning coffee on the dock overlooking the river and it was just perfect. Mike was super responsive (whenever we got cell service) and friendly. Once we connected to the Wi-Fi, there were no issues. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the appliances, dishes, bakeware, silverware, pots, and pans you might need. Bring your beach umbrella and chairs and sit by (or IN) the river and enjoy your dogs and/or kids playing in the shallow water. We will for sure be back!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved this little cabin on the river! My friend & I took the pups for a weekend getaway and couldn‚Äôt be happier. The dogs loved playing in the water and exploring. The cabin had everything we needed and we felt very at home.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a great time!!! Such a beautiful place, it is even more gorgeous than the pictures. Private and quiet! All of the neighbors are extremely welcoming and friendly when we went for a walk to explore! Our dogs had an absolute blast running around and playing in the sand and water. Mike was super helpful and we are so thankful he let us stay at his little slice of heaven! We hope to come back soon!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was amazing, we hated to leave. This was a rare case where the pictures do not do the property justice. We had access to everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. We loved swimming in the river. Everything was super clean and the kitchen was well-appointed. We had. Nice evening out in Lyons but otherwise stayed in. The beds were comfortable and extra cozy with soft sheets and blankets. Mike was very helpful, responsive and friendly. Thank you Mike! We hope you will let us book again soon!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to get away to. The river was wonderful and our dogs had so much fun playing in the water, we enjoyed splashing around with them too. The house is very comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed. The freezer was full but we were able to make it work. Overall it was fantastic! The owls are crazy creepy in the middle of the night, it was awesome. Will highly recommend to everybody."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was absolutely gorgeous! My whole family including our dogs enjoyed the water and the cool sand and the weather was not too hot for us! We will be coming back!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place for some quiet. The river is pretty shallow in this area, but that was perfect for my kids and dog to be able to play in. This is an awesome cabin to stay at! Very clean and beds were comfy. We had a lot of fun!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! Beautiful property
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this place. It was nicely tucked away, quiet. Highly recommend booking here."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Ohoopee hideout is the perfect name for this place. You can‚Äôt help but feel like you‚Äôre part of a secret club out here buried in the wilderness right on the river. His neighbor Storm was great and saw me wondering around looking for a signal - he introduced himself, showed me around, and let me in. My 2 dogs absolutely loved being able to run around leash free all week, jumping in the river, chasing lizards and squirrels. The seclusion is 10/10 and Mike‚Äôs cabin is very nice to retreat to after a full day of hanging out on your own personal sandbar or waking the 3/4 mile trail down to Opal Island Sandbar. Comfy bed, nice furniture, and top grade appliances. Even though the catfish weren‚Äôt biting - the whole stay was exactly what I was looking for. Mike truly has a slice of paradise here and I for one am very grateful that he is willing to share it at such a decent rate. Coming back home to south Florida is like culture shock after hearing nothing but birds, owls, and the sound of running water - I already want to go back! Thanks again Mike"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful place. Secluded, yet only a few minutes to numerous stores and restaurants (about 10 minutes). Huge rooms and very clean. 5 stars all the way. A wonderful experience. Very peaceful!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We absolutely loved Stacy‚Äôs place! The boys enjoyed playing outside and even found blackberries growing nearby! They thought it was so cool to pick blackberries and me make cobbler out of them. The owners were so quick to reply to any of our questions and the balcony was so peaceful!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beds were very comfortable, Wi-Fi worked very well, cell service was great at this location also! Close enough to town or the dollar general if you need to grab last minute items, we stayed here for a wedding, the location was perfect compared to where the venue was located! We ended up cooking a couple meals during our stay, the kitchen was equipped with the basics! We missed this on the listing, but there is no microwave which ended up not being a big deal since we were in town just for the weekend! This airbnb was awesome! The property was very peaceful and quiet, you feel like you have your own little slice of heaven here!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a wonderful stay. Easy booking. Host was responsive and kind.

The place was very clean and exactly as described in listing. Would definitely stay there again."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely BEAUTIFUL Cabin. Home was exactly as described. Everything was clean, Instructions for check-in and check-out were very clear, and the atmosphere was peaceful. Lots of open space inside and an actual yard. Entertainment was easy, as the tv was a roku tv, and all we had to do was log into our streaming apps. The upstairs balcony with rocking chairs was a wonderful touch and where me and my sister had our coffee and girl talk. We had a great stay, and I would definitely recommend. Thank you for hosting!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,An awesome stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Stacy was a delight. When we arrived he met us with the key. We learned we were his first guests. He is still working out the kinks in getting started but we were pleased. This is in the country and very quiet.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place. What you see here is what you're going to get there. It's a nice and cozy place to stay during your visit to Vidalia. I stayed for eleven days and was more than ready to call it home, especially after my 13+ hour drive from up north. The cleanliness is emaculate. I had no yucky feelings that I needed to wipe anything down before settling in. This place is clean to the point where you're comfortable about cleaning up behind yourself without the feeling that you're cleaning up after a previous guest or a lazy housekeeper. I am definitely adding this to my ""Repeat Stay"" airbnb list!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Amazing host!!!
2022-11-01,4,Group trip,"Our family was in the area for a reunion the first weekend in November and wanted a house that had multiple bedrooms/bathrooms so some of us could stay together instead of booking separate hotel rooms.
The location was close to the reunion location and had 4 bedrooms and a full kitchen which allowed us to make breakfast together and prep food to take to the reunion. Having only a bath and a half was a concession for us, but we managed. The half bath is incredibly small and is located in one of the bedrooms off the hall, but we were thankful to have it with a full house of people. We are a close family so it worked out okay to share it.
We all thought the ""bee"" theme was so cute! They've done a nice job decorating and making this older house feel homey. Everything was clean. üôÇAlthough we saw that some of the dishes still had tags on them, and we didn't really want to take time to wash them before using. There is not a dishwasher. Dish soap, sponges and towels were provided.
Unfortunately, the AC wasn't working for us during our stay. The weather was warm and humid and the temperature in the house got up to 80 degrees overnight. Communication with the owner was excellent! She was very responsive and had her husband go and take a look on Saturday. It was most likely low on Freon and they weren't able to get a repair company out to fix it until Monday, after we left. She was very apologetic and gave us a 10% refund for our inconvenience.
The beds were comfortable and having ceiling fans helped with the AC issue. The 3 bedrooms off the hall are very small, with not much extra space, but the closets could be used for luggage.
The kitchen was in good working order with a full size fridge/freezer, stove, microwave, toaster, as well as a Keurig and drip coffee maker. She provided coffee filters, some coffee and little creamers, which was very nice. It would have have been helpful to have some measuring spoons and cups, a couple of mixing bowls and a non-stick pan. After my suggestion she said she would add them.
There are steps inside the house to access the bedroom off the kitchen (probably used to be a carport/garage). This was important to us as we had a special needs child in a wheelchair. We managed, but that room was the best room for him, because he had to sleep on the floor (since he didn't have a bed with rails like at home) and it was the only bedroom with enough floor space. He's an 80 pound 5 year old, which is a lot to lift! üòä There is an exterior door in that room, which was nice to be able to roll his wheelchair in, without having to go up and down the front steps.
The guys had fun watching football on the big tv!
There were a few things we noticed that might be an issue - in the bedroom with the half bath there is a wire sticking out of the wall outlet and a cable poking up out of the floor.
The caulking around the tub/shower doesn't seem to be sufficient and the shower head is very low. That's fine for us short people, but was a little challenging for the tall ones. But, we really appreciated having plenty of hot water for showers and washing dishes.
Despite a few issues, we enjoyed our time in Vidalia in this cute house and were so thankful to be able to stay together. We wish you all the best!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great home!!! Lovely Host!!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We came in town for my son's wedding. The house was absolutely perfect for four adults to have space for themselves as well as elbow room. They thought of everything you would need! Hosts were very communicative and very responsive. Highly recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend this property. It was clean, well appointed and enough space for everyone.

The entire house had nice custom made labels on cabinets and drawers to let you know what's inside.
Located right in the heart of Lyons shopping and great restaurants just down the street.

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,wonderful place I will rent again
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice home, great communication"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was adorable and very clean. Host was wonderful, understanding, and responded quickly."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,"Mel was very responsive, checked on us by text during the rental, and was easy to work with. The instructions for the stay were clear, and the check out procedure was simple, logical and also clear.
The property is easy to find, and convenient to everything. There was plenty of perfectly acceptable parking off the street. When we arrived, the house was sparkling clean, no dust, no dirt, and a faint smell of bleach, which I personally like, but those of you with sensitivities should contact the host.
My group of 5 changed to 3 then expanded to 6 after we arrived, and the host accommodated the changes without any problems. We were very comfortable in the amount of space the home offers, and I was especially glad I could offer the space to the family--their reservations got messed up...and mine didn't.
The living room space is so wonderful that families and friends will want to gather. The furniture is modern and clean and the decorations not overbearing so that you can still use the coffee table and the end tables as tables, with some holiday appropriate touches, which was nice. The climate control worked well, and everybody stayed very comfortable with the temperature in the house.
Every bedroom has a TV, everybody was happy. The rooms are generously sized, each with a window. The beds were comfortable and the white sheets and blankets clean. The beds have fluffy clean white comforters.
A single bath made us anxious on occasion, and the kitchen cookware would not support cooking for 6, but there is a generous list in the welcome book of choices for take out and eating out just beyond the driveway. The amenities for bathroom and coffee service were lush. There is a Keurig and a nice selection of coffee, tea and hot chocolate. The bathroom reminded me of a hotel, with some items offered in case you forgot or in case you flew in and couldn't bring everything with you. There is a shower dispenser with your basics, some tooth brushes and tooth paste, and plenty of fresh white towels and wash cloths. Again, very clean.
Thanks again, Mel. We appreciate your obvious extra efforts during COVID and give you 5 stars. We would definitely choose your home for a repeat stay."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and lots of space. I would stay here again.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a great place for our team to stay!

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank You Mel for the great stay. It was may more spacious then I thought and was perfect for my family that dropped by to spend time with me. I love the location and would most definitely book again next time I‚Äôm in town. Mel you were great I really appreciate your hospitality.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This past week was my 2nd time staying in Mel‚Äôs beautiful home. I recommend this AirBNB to anyone coming through Lyons. I promise you will not regret it!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and cozy home conveniently located off of 16 in Lyons. It was very clean and had a lot of nice touches. The bedrooms were large and the living area was spacious. We would definitely stay again when we are back in the area.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would rather stay at Mel‚Äôs place then to stay ANYWHERE! From the cleanness to the nice decorations to the location. I have never felt more at home and more comfortable then I have here. PLEASE do not think twice about staying here. I promise you will not be disappointed at all.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For the age of the house they did a wonderful job updating the house. The house has the home feel, the beds are very comfortable and the house is spacious. The area had a water issue earlier in the day before we arrived. Mel informed me of the issue and provided bottled water for us incase the tap water still had issues.
We arrived later than intended so it was dark by the time we arrived in Lyons. We kept missing the house so I messaged Mel asking for landmarks, she responded very quickly and we found the house. It was one of those times when you're over tired and can't find the glasses on your face."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great! Very clean, comfortable and great hospitality! Will be back!"
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,My family's stay here was awesome! The attentive detail to an away stay was superb and appreciated. This was definitely home away from home!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house really felt like home!
Our visit was to spend time with family we don't get to see often. This house was perfect for young cousins to enjoy a sleepover with the grandparents. It was like walking back in time to summers at my own grandma's house. The stoop was my favorite spot to hang out.
Our grandkids loved being able to play in their own space, yet still be right next to us.
The local park/ playground is fantastic! Lots of different activities and great playground.
We also enjoyed the short walk for brick oven pizza and authentic ice cream shop for dessert. Popsicles on the stoop made the stay even more special
The beds were so comfortable, I slept all night for the first time in years!
Yes, there is traffic noise but it's faint and didn't bother us a bit.
Overall, this place is clean, well decorated, and the little extras add that special something.
We will definitely be back."

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is old but has been remodeled nicely, with cute vintage touches. Check-in is easy and there are security cameras around the house. The bed I slept in was very comfortable, and there were Roku tvs throughout the house which I liked. There is a lot of road traffic being right off 280, so know that before you rent. The house was clean, but there is an issue with some pests that hopefully will be taken care of for future renters."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great privacy
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Mel's place was simply amazing. Just enough room and privacy we needed. Just a beautiful place to stay.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a cute vintage house located off Hwy 280 in Lyons. It has been ""modernized "" with Roku tvs, Wifi, central heating and air, etc. The house has three bedrooms and one bath. The bed I slept in was very comfortable with super soft white sheets. Overall the house was very clean and well-kept. I could hear road traffic at night, but that was mentioned in the listing. It's obviously hard to avoid given the house's location. I felt fairly safe during my stay. I would definitely recommend the house and look forward to staying again in the future!"
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"Thank you Mel for being a great host. I love the place and will be going back again. It was clean, comfortable, and includes all the necessities. It is truly home away from home."

First, the cabin itself is beautiful‚Äî even better in person Than the pictures reflect. The rooms were spacious, clean, and the serenity of the place alongside the view of nature from every angle made this just the place for my family and I to unplug from the city. Our hosts were so lovely: kind, open-hearted, and warm and just the kind of welcome my family needed for a first visit. We‚Äôll definitely be coming again.

We had made weekend plans to visit our daughter at GSU and wanted to have our own space. and enough space in case she wanted to stay a night or two with us and not sleep in her dorm. The property is easy to get to and somewhat remote, but the it is very peaceful and quiet at the home. The view from the living room/kitchen is awesome and you can see most of the fenced-in property from this location....plenty of sunlight shines in to the area. We were very comfortable staying here and found the home to be very organized and clean. We'd definitely consider staying here again when we are back in town for a visit to our daughter."

The Christmas decorations were very nice and warm which made us feel that we spent Christmas at home."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Steve's treehouse was great, quiet, and had everything we needed. Steve was a wonderful host and communicated well. The place was exactly as pictured which helped us plan for children. Because our 2.5 year old loves stairs, we brought a safety gate to assist with keeping her away from going downstairs since the living area and kitchen are located on the 2nd floor. Overall this is a wonderful stay in a relaxing area with plenty fenced in yard. Enjoy the scenery and get away from the busy city with this stay!"

The room was clean and the bed was super comfortable. Nice touches like coffee, a nice space heater (it has central heat, but some times a space heater to knock the chill off is nice) tons of towels, and even a burger off the grill was nice. It has all the amenities needed. Thanks for everything. I‚Äôd definitely recommend staying here and when I come back I hope the unit is still available.
My only sort of negative comment I have would be to make sure and bring a computer or tablet. There isn‚Äôt a TV. For me I travel with an iPad Pro so it didn‚Äôt matter."

I would definitely stay again."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Josh was a great host. I was in town as a traveling nurse helping in the covid crisis. Josh was very understanding and allowed me and my dog to stay there for over a month (which he NEVER allows dogs) because he knew I was going to be away from home for a long time by myself.

2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Josh's place is centrally located in a very nice, safe neighbourhood in Vidalia making it easy to get around the city and giving access to anything you may need. The suite is located on the back of the house which is where you park so you need to use a different address to find it but Josh gave us great directions and we were able to locate is quite easily and get checked in. Josh was a gracious host upon our arrival and we had a chance to sit and have a visit and get to know him. He was very helpful giving us directions around the city and offering suggestions for restaurants and shopping excursions. We were visiting from Canada so it was nice to have a chance to talk to Josh and ask questions about the area and learn a little bit about Vidalia and Georgia.
Josh was quick to respond to any questions we had via message or text. We had no issues with the suite, it is a clean, comfortable place to stay and we plan on staying again in the future. Thanks for the hospitality Josh!!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved it! If you are looking for peace and quiet, privacy and or boating this place is perfect. If thats what you are looking for you will not regret staying at Jills place. Loved sitting on the covered back porch having lunch and cofee looking at the water with the ceiling fans going kept it cool and any bugs away. Everything you need for cooking a meal is available. Jill is extremely responsive. All furniture was comfortable. Place smelled fresh and clean when we got there. Nicely decorated.Also 2 things I really appreciated was that there was a tv in the bedroom and there were plenty of washcloths and towels. Now just a heads up be careful by the edge of the waterbank, mud is slippery."
2023-05-01,2,Stayed with kids,"I'm just gonna be honest about this place. The manufactured home is on a beautiful piece of property with a river right in the backyard. Very peaceful and private. Inside the house the beds are comfortable, bathrooms are acceptable, the house is equipped pretty much with everything you need. But if you want a clean place this is not for you."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,So relaxing and clean my kids loved the back yard leading right to the river! We will stay with Jill anytime we are working in the area!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We‚Äôve stayed with Jill twice now. We enjoyed the campfire, the front deck, the peaceful privacy, and the nice soak tub.
The bridge over to the island is very serene. This would be a great place for people who love to go fishing or just be on the river. We travel for work.
Jill‚Äôs furniture is beautiful. She has decorated very nicely. The kitchen is very well equipped.
Most of all, Jill is one of the kindest hosts we‚Äôve encountered in over a decade of traveling. She is very responsive and accommodating!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cozy nice home. It does not look like a trailer on the inside.
We had all of the essentials we needed. We did bring a full size coffee pot because we needed it. Jill has a keurig.
The porch was great! We enjoyed the fire pit, the smoker, and the charcoal grill!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved this place! We had an amazing stay! Everything was clean and tidy! She had everything that you would possibly need for your stay and more! Loved the bridge that went down to the water and all the little extras! It felt wonderful to bring our fur baby with us! This was his first holiday and he loved walking on the paved driveway and down to the water and back! We will definitely be back!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Super cozy place that allowed for a comfortable stay while the men hunted in the local WMA. Overall a wonderful stay with beautiful views!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice
2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great place , very peaceful location on the river. House is very comfortable and relaxing , certainly met all my needs.. would gladly stay there again ..!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Owner is very responsiveness and nice. We were here for a few days having evacuated from Florida for the hurricane. She was very nice during a difficult time. The property is beautiful and peaceful. This is a VERY remote location so if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for, this is for you! WiFi is a bit spotty, as is cell service. If you book here, do not click on the ‚ÄúDirections‚Äù link in the Airbnb app. It took us to the wrong address. You‚Äôll want to type in the address in the listing. If you do that, you‚Äôll have no problem. The sunsets on the river were really something to see. Location is pet friendly which was great."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Talk about a hidden gem! I would like to kept this little secret hidden for myself! The home was more than expected. Very clean and comfy! But let's talk outdoor living.... sitting on the fully stocked back porch grilling & chilling, enjoying a fire by the river, wetting a hook while your feet are in the creek water or playing family games in the green grass between the house & water... you‚Äôll enjoy each & every moment. Believe me when I say the pictures just don't do the beauty of the property justice. We have definitely found our little hidden gem in Uvalda."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the most relaxing and best place to stay! The location was perfect and having access to the river and being able to have our boat on the bank was our favorite! We especially loved grilling on the back porch and watching the river. House was stocked with all essentials plus more! We will definitely be back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my first Airbnb experience and it was exactly what my family and I needed. The home was beautifully designed and the area was very peaceful.
