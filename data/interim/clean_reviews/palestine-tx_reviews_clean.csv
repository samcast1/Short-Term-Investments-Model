2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We rented both houses and both were equally charming and very clean. The houses are exactly as described and Susan was a delight to rent from.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We rented both the Ruby & Sapphire cottages and they were perfect for our large family. The property is absolutely beautiful with many amenities and the cottages were very nice, clean and had everything we needed. We traveled with 7 adults and 7 children and there was plenty of space to house us all comfortably. It was perfect that the houses are close together with plenty of parking space. The kids had such an amazing time fishing, playing on the property and getting cozy by the fire. Susan, the host, was responsive and beyond accommodating, we truly appreciated her hospitality. Our family will be planning another trip to this property and we cannot wait!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A little hard to find, but worth it! We rented both cabins for our stay to ride the Polar Express on the Texas State Railroad. These cabins were super cute, extremely comfortable and the grounds are like having a private Sumer camp. The kids(adult kids too) had SO much fun. Next time we’re in the area, we will DEFINITELY stay here!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,The cottages were perfect for my family to stay in while in town for Thanksgiving. Both of them had completely different decor and were charming in their own way. The grounds were nicely kept and we wish we had the time to be able to sit outside and use the grills.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Just spent the weekend with family. We all had a great time from adults to the kids. There was plenty to do for everyone. I highly recommend staying here. Susan was a great Host!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were looking for a quiet little place to retreat and enjoy our individual hobbies-fishing for him and quilting for me; Lake House Cottage was a win for both of us! My husband fished daily off the upper and lower decks and I sewed in the spacious and darling sunroom. From both of our vantage points, we enjoyed a beautiful panoramic view of the lake. In the evening we enjoyed Malbec by the fire pit and in the mornings we shared coffee and mimosas in the sunroom. In addition to a beautiful sunset tour of the lake, Richard even helped us unload and bring our things into the cottage. The kitchen was stocked with snacks and things for us to enjoy for breakfast, Richard even had worms for my husband to use for fishing! Richard and Judy are delightful hosts and we will most definitely be back to enjoy all of the wonderful amenities Lake House Cottage has to offer!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the best AirBnB ever! Beautiful setting and hospitality above and beyond! The place was stocked with everything you could possibly need. Just bring food and relax. Everything was spotlessly clean, comfortable and welcoming. The bed was super comfortable and the room darkening shades made for a very peaceful nights rest.
Richard is very attentive, friendly and helpful. We will definitely return to this AirBnB."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow!! I don't even know where to begin.
This place is incredible. It's peaceful, it has such personality, it's home away from home. The views are breathtaking. The inside is so clean and has anything you could possibly need to make a comfortable, easy stay. The owners have literally thought of every single thing/detail to make a stay perfect.
The bed was so comfortable, the shower had amazing water pressure... these are a couple of my favorite things on a vacation.
The owners are amazing. They were so kind to our birthday girl and very helpful with places to eat and things to do.
Will 1000% stay here again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was my first time to book an airbnb. Richard went above and beyond to make our stay special. We will definatly be back if our schedule allows.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beautiful. I spent my birthday weekend quietly paddling the lake, napping in the sun, meditating and taking in the incredible panoramic lake views. The house has so much character and feels very homey. The indoor outdoor space is super unique and I enjoyed listening to the lake sounds in there. The kitchen and bathroom are perfectly comfortable. I decided to have a quiet recovery weekend here but it would clearly be awesome for groups and celebrations."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific hosts, beautiful accomodations, and great views. Relaxing and peaceful, just what we were looking for. Highly recommend this property for a perfect getaway. We cannot wait to go back!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Richard is a stand-up gentleman. In the midst of a family emergency he was extremely understanding allowing for a last second cancellation. We will book again for a visit as soon as possible. Thank you!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We gave a 5 star rating, because there isnt a higher rating but they definitely deserve all five stars. This place is peaceful, beautiful and relaxing, allowing us to recharge our batteries. The owners were angels who welcomed us with open arms the entire time of our stay. We look forward to returning as soon as possible! It was a blessing to stay here."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the best place ever!! Good fishing and the best host ever. He and his wife went above and beyond to make sure the experience was amazing! Even got a view of the whole lake on the hosts private boat! I appreciated the chance to go out on the lake and see all the beauty of lake Jacksonville! Was not expected and was a great experience! Will definitely be back. Price was less than you can get hotel room for and far better than any hotel I’ve been to! 5 stars for sure! If you could give more I would top it out! We will be seeing them again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place on Lake Jacksonville was a great place to stay; right on the water with a wonderful view. If you love staying on the lake, this is the place for you. It is conveniently located just a few miles from town. It had great amenities and so clean! Richard and Judy were great hosts and I hope to stay on their property again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we had an excellent weekend in Richard's beautiful home.
richard was very friendly, very responsive, welcoming and invited us on his boat.
the house is very nice with stunning views of the lake and with a very comfortable balcony to enjoy the sunset at the corner of the fire pit.
everything has been thought out so that visitors feel at home and don't miss anything. it's simple, if you need something, it's sure you'll find it in one of the drawers of the house.
we also enjoyed finding some treats in the house and fridge.
the possibility of canoeing and fishing is very appreciable.
i also really liked the little wood stove in the veranda.
i would have liked to have stayed longer
i would be happy to come back. thank you
Richard"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best Airbnb we have stayed at and we’ve been to a lot! So peaceful, quiet, total relaxation. The hosts were over the top. Genuine caring and so hospitable. Left food, bottled water and snacks for us.
Truly a place I hope you get to visit.
We will be going back❣️"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There's a reason why I'm a loyal airbnbist and Richard's lake house defines it. We felt like we had come home right from the start and appreciated the stocked kitchen and comfy furnishings. The authentic 60's Texas lake house vibe brought back cherished memories of summer trips to my grandparents' home. The sunroom on the deck with its fireplace and panoramic view of the lake was perfect for domino playing. Although the grandkids were not with us this trip, we'll keep it in mind. The lake house is kid friendly with games and fun stuff for little ones. Jacksonville is only a few hours from Dallas, but it feels like another world: heavenly. Thank you, Richard, for being a wonderful airbnb host!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"That was an amazing experience for me, the cottage has a beautiful location and views, it feels like you home, Richard and his wife are really nice people thank you for this great hospitality. I sure I’ll be back here soon"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful, charming & peaceful destination for a private retreat!
It was magical to walk in and be able to see straight back to the lake. The house was clean & smelled good.
The weather was a bit cold and rainy so I spent most of my time in the sunroom, cozy and warm with a gorgeous view to soak in.
Richard and Judy were so welcoming and helpful. It felt like I was staying with family, not Airbnb hosts.
Can’t wait to come back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for the mother needing to recharge or a romantic getaway for 2. This place was rustic lake house charm that will surpass your expectations. Secluded yet close to town, nestled in Sleepy Hollow windy roads and a kitchen that inspires French cooking. The 2 level deck beckons you to enjoy the provided toys and amenities but also summons you at dawn with gourmet provided coffee to watch the sunrise or sunset with your favorite Shiraz.
The hosts Richard and Judy are amazing, super accommodating and an absolute pleasure. I’m booking again before this place becomes too popular, you won’t regret it. They’ve thought of so many awesome details (chilled wine glasses) plenty of throws and propane firepit for chilly nights to enjoy that amazing view!!!
I can’t say enough! Pack a duffel and get lost for a few days. Phenomenal… 😘"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Richard was fantastic! Their place is on the water and so beautiful!
Looking forward to staying again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family had a amazing time Richard and his wife were so nice to us even after my son broke something very important to them they took us on a boat ride around the lake before we left on our last day and it was so beautiful and they made us feel right at home
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a weekend getaway or longer stay. This time of year offers the much needed peace and quiet from the business of day to day life. Owners are adjacent to the property should any questionsor issues arise. Great Communication. Awesome accommodations and very clean. Don't hesitate if you're looking for a quiet, stress free getaway. Look no further."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Host was incredibly accommodating and flexible. Place was peaceful and had plenty of activities to do. Will definitely be back!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great place nice people
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A stay on the lake in colder weather was such an unexpected joy. The view was stunning; especially at sunrise. The two fire pits made early mornings and evenings extra cozy. Richard and Judy are exceptional hosts. They are warm and friendly and very helpful all while giving you full privacy. Taking walks on this out of the way road is peaceful and serene. The rolling hills provided just the right amount of challenge for me. I am looking forward to coming back this summer to take advantage of all the sun chairs and floats I saw downstairs. This Lake house is a hidden treasure!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing for a couples getaway. Beautiful view. Richard was amazing and gave us a late check out which was perfect! Thank you for sharing this place!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Richard and Judy are the best host and hostess. Their Lakehouse cottage is right on the water with amazing views even when it was cloudy.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Richard and Judy’s place has an absolutely gorgeous view. It is a very well remodeled older place with little hints of nostalgia. They are very welcoming and when you get inside you literally feel like they have left you in their home to enjoy EVERYTHING.
Bathroom and Kitchen had the comforts of home (the snacks from Bella and Dakota made me chuckle) the converted boat house downstairs made for an awesome place to sit with my morning coffee.
Be aware there is a sloped walk to the house but with a wagon it was not a problem at all and Richard was more than willing to help us unload when he showed me around. We are already looking forward to another STAYcation at this beautiful peaceful home."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is great! It is perfect for a smaller family or a couple. The property is really nice, and the lake view is beautiful. Communication was prompt and helpful. The fishing is really good right off the back deck/dock. I caught 5-6 largemouth bass. We would definitely recommend this place, and would stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This lake cabin is our favorite Airbnb we have stayed at, ever. This is a destination, not just a place to stay. Richard was very responsive and helpful. The check in / check out were extremely smooth. The cabin was spotless. The place is exactly as it looks in the pictures. The cabin is stocked with everything we could possibly imagine and more. Richard has thought of everything needed from the kitchen to everything we used in and on the lake. We cooked on the outside grill several times. The Wi-Fi was excellent. Most days we spent hours fishing from their private pier, on the lake in the kayak, or swimming in the lake. The outdoor lights are beautiful at night. There are grocery stores a few miles away. There is a lot of outdoor space. The balcony is HUGE. The location of the house on (and over) the lake makes for amazing views from upstairs and downstairs. The air conditioners work great. The vibe of the whole lake cabin is awesome. We absolutely recommend staying at the lake cabin."

The basket of snacks was a hit with my children and a very thoughtful gesture. Although sad to leave, one of my favorite things was the Edgewood House book. A nostalgic gesture in which you can read and write the experience of your stay. Thank you Suzanne, your home is perfect and can’t wait to visit Texas again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I really enjoyed the stay at the Edgewood House. Suzanne is amazing she left us plenty of snacks. Everything you could need in a kitchen is there. The house has surprisingly good internet for it being outside of town. 5 stars, stay at the Edgewood House!"

Mrs. Sue left a homemade loaf of pumpkin pecan bread waiting for us sitting in the kitchen that was SO yummy! We accidentally damaged one of the blinds in the bedrooms and she was more than forgiving for my clumsiness🫶🏻 There’s a security camera at the front door for safety but the back porch is completely private and a perfect spot for your morning coffee from there coffee bar! They even gave us a late check-out! This is definitely a property I would recommend🤩

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Edgewood House is a gem of a place in the east Texas Piney Woods, just a few minutes' drive from the Texas State Railroad depot in Palestine. We immediately felt at home. Our host Suzanne was welcoming, attentive and kind. It was easy to communicate with her.
This house is even nicer than the photos. The location is serene, beautiful and quiet enough to hear the wind in the branches of the trees. The porches are great! Front porch has rocking chairs, and the back porch with grill is a perfect place for outdoor dining.
The kitchen was beautifully and generously equipped. Everything listed on the AirBNB amenities is here. Suzanne and Richard have included anything you might need to prepare a family meal. It's clear that they have set everything up with guests' comfort in mind.
Bedding and linens were ample. Baths were spacious and pleasant. There's a great selection of games. We didn't have children in our party, but the room with bunk beds was neat and inviting.
Everything was clean when we arrived. Checking in was easy. Overall a very pleasant stay!"

Laying in bed at night, the peaceful place is so quiet, that you can hear some cars drive down the road, but they are not loud or disturbing. We slept great."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, Very helpful and checked in to make sure all was good. Nice extras and very comfortable. Would stay again."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clara's Cottage is a cute place, very very very clean, and peaceful. The queen bed was comfortable. Only downside is if you are a light sleeper, you hear the highway traffic and that can keep you up. Also, if you have someone else in the other bedroom and they snore, the walls are very thin and you can hear everything.
The first day, my husband took a shower and the water smelled like sulfur, but later in the day it was fine and remained fine for the rest of our stay.
A really great place especially if you are not a light sleeper."

We got there at night and the little picket fence was lighted and lights on the porch and in the house made us feel welcome and safe. The house has a very cozy charm with antiques throughout. In particular the towels and sheets were SO SOFT and comfy! The beds were good and my friend and I slept great! Wyma even provided some snacks and candy, as well as coffee and tea and ice in the freezer (which was most appreciated!). There were comfy places to sit and a full-sized dining table. We didn't cook other than the microwave, but it looked like the kitchen is fully stocked. The cottage is just off the highway, so it was easy to locate and also easy to hop into Palestine for dinner or head to the area state parks where we were hiking. Wyma made some local suggestions for us that were fun and helpful. Don't miss Braly's ACE Hardware! Hope to stay here again!"

We both very much enjoyed our stay and can’t wait to return."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house itself was great! It was very clean and and well taken care of. The only issue we had was finding the house. The address did not work right, but we eventually found the place with the help of the owner. Would recommend this Airbnb to others."

The home was sparkling clean,she even had snacks available when we arrived. The beds were so comfortable, it was hard to get up. My sisters and I will be coming back. Everything we needed was attainable. Restaurants, gas, shopping were right down the street. If you want to book this place, you had better hurry, cause I will beat you to it.

Perfect nighttime air. Kitchen was well stocked and clean. Communication was excellent. Wi-Fi worked great. And Tanya even went out of her way to make sure we were well informed about the traffic and community information prior to the eclipse. I would have maybe liked to see a TV in the space, but not a deal breaker since we had our iPad and could stream. Looks like it would be a beautiful venue for a wedding, but we also enjoyed a quiet one night stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! My sister and I stayed here for a weekend sister's getaway and we couldn't have been happier! This is the cutest little place in a beautiful area of land! Tanya helped me several times throughout my stay. She helped me over the phone to get me on track when gps was failing me. Later on, her husband brought us LED candles when the electricity went out in the entire area. On the last night there, she made recommendations for other activities. I would absolutely recommend this little house to anyone. And, Tanya was a splendid host!"

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great for what we needed. There was literally every dish and utensil aside from a can opener and cutting board. It's possible we just couldn't find them. On the day of checkout, the entire community lost water pressure, and Tanya communicated that quickly and had a resolution for showering. On check out, my daughter forgot her glasses, and that was also communicated quickly before we had gotten too far out of town! We appreciated the little cabin, and it met our needs. We would definitely stay again!"

Tonya and Bryce have a wonderful property that we were able to enjoy all to ourselves, as it is a wedding/event venue. We enjoyed walks on the property, sitting by the pond, cooking breakfast and trying different restaurants in the area. Marios and Rump's were a definite win!
Bryce and Tonya were very accommodating and responsive. I highly recommend staying on their property and we look forward to our next stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Tanya's tiny home was perfect for our family of 5. Our 3 teenage children really enjoyed the loft. We were greeted by a very sweet dog which was an added bonus. The pictures of this tiny house are an exact match of the location. The surrounding grounds are absolutely beautiful, and it is quite peaceful in the area. We felt completely safe and enjoyed listening to the sounds of the country. The privacy, quiet, and price sure beat a hotel room. We could not have chosen a better spot for our family trip!"

There was so much fun stuff to do, we never needed to leave the property! We fished; we canoed; we hung out; we cooked; we had campfires. It was just wonderful. And Patty and Joe were easily the most responsive and helpful hosts we've ever encountered. We had a fantastic time!"

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house and property was beautiful. Very peaceful and secluded. The house was very accommodating for my large family.
The lake is more like a large pond, but fishing was good. The canoe and paddle boat were both in bad shape. The house was freezing down stairs but the second floor was to hot. We had to go buy a fan to help push some cold air up from below. The internet is horrible. Couldn’t get the bedroom tv to work and I think they finally got something to come on once on the tv in the living room. Cell phone reception is bad also. Seemed like for the price we paid I expected to not have any of these issues."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The property was exactly as shown and listed. I would recommend to anyone wanting to just away from it all into the quiet and peaceful setting. We really enjoyed our time there.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Patty accommodated our large group at the last minute. Our other reservation fell thought and we were absolutely thrilled to find another location. A thunder storm knocked out power for a few hours and out host brought us candles.
The house was beautiful and well furnished. The view was amazing. I contacted the host to see if a store was nearby and she immediately responded with directions and letting me know where find best burgers.
Beds were comfortable. Everything was clean and well taken care of. I highly recommend staying at this location 😊"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very neat and clean. Recently
Updated and everything worked as mentioned. Loved that you had hot tea for an oddball like me.
Not far from small store to get items - or bring shampoo and toiletries.
Towels were still new and everything felt fresh.
Wish there was a welcome or info book as the TV was a little tough to figure out
Beds were comfy and house was quiet
Driveway is a little tight off the road if you’re in a big vehicle - passable but pay attention.
Super soft water and shower pressure was great.
Great fenced in yard plenty of room and space
Sekt safe and secure no issues at all
Perfect For our trip will come back next year"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really liked this place - I found myself wishing we could have stayed longer! We are city dwellers and the amount of stars out at night out there is just awesome. It’s super private. We had brought kayaks with us and I always worry about them getting stolen or messed with if we don’t move them from the rack…but definitely no worries in this place! Totally private and secluded, we didn’t even touch them when we got out to head in the house.
The house is exactly as described and pictured. So well decorated inside, very cute. And SPOTLESS!! The bed in the master was an awesome memory foam mattress that was so comfy. Everything we needed was easy to find. We didn’t use the kitchen or laundry, but everything seemed to be in working order. Shower in the master worked great and had a nice shower head.
We were really happy with our stay and would come again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"James was very respectful and made sure we were accommodated. We had to leave our stay early and instead of keeping our money for the extra day we said we would stay, we were refunded for our Sunday stay. James your integrity does not go unnoticed. Thank you."

Susans husband was very kind, helped us fish, helped my little girl with her little fishing pole, my older daughter was excited to catch a big catfish! He built us a fire to enjoy in the evening. We have zero complaints."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here was the best ever! Name a better place that makes you feel just like home. A home away from home.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an awesome spot! Great plot of land with beautiful acreage, pond, and tall trees. Nicely set back from the road. Wonderful, friendly, responsive host, and enjoyed meeting her hubby, too. Awesome set-up where our close friends could rent the house next door (well, a short distance away - not RIGHT next door, but a short easy walk). I'm already looking ahead to other getaways with close friends and family to share this beautiful spot with. Good space outside for the kids to play. Awesome firepit areas to hang out around and grill dogs and roast marshmallows. What a gift!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Susan was really helpful and responsive. The house and property were perfect for us. The house has everything you need and is just like the pictures. The fireplace and big screen tv were a plus. We loved looking out at the big pond and watching the other guest's kids fish. The other house is far enough away that you forget they are there but it's nice to know they are there too. We are looking forward to coming back and staying longer so we can fish, roast s'mores, and use the outdoor grill area. The Bird Egg Cafe nearby was excellent for a home cooked breakfast."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We needed a place to stay while in town for Polar Express. This was a great place to stay with grandkids. Felt very secluded and safe.

The pond is so relaxing to just sit and enjoy the weather."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Hands down one of best Airbnbs that I have ever stayed at! The house was pristine and they had everything we needed on hand. My favorite part was the scenery. I felt like I was in a Christmas Movie. The view from the bedroom and the living room was so picturesque I wanted to move in. We had coffee in the evening and watched Christmas movies by the fireplace then hung out outside and enjoyed the full moon and stars. During the day my husband and daughter did some fishing while my son and I napped on the comfy beds. Susan was the perfect host! We are definitely going back!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time!!! Everything was clean and neat, easy access and peace of mind because we had everything we needed just as we were back home.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was my first ever stay at a Airbnb and let me tell you, its gonna be hard for anyone to top this! We had a small little family vacation over the weekend and everything was just perfect.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We found this place to be very clean and very well appointed. The kitchen was very well equipped and the outdoor grill worked perfectly. The Texas heat was intense but we were cool and comfortable in the house. It's dark enough at night to get a very good view of the night sky. Numerous deer were on the property in the early morning including some very small spotted fawns. All in all it was a great stay and me and my wife enjoyed it very much.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We very much enjoyed staying at Susan’s place. It’s clean, comfortable, well stocked with all the necessities and we couldn’t have asked for more. Thanks Susan!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband has wanted to fish Gary Yamamoto’s bass ranch in Palestine for years. I reached out to Susan to inquire about how far her property was from the ranch and she answered super quickly! He and his brother said check-in was so easy, the property was clean and comfortable and felt like home away from home. More importantly, they caught more fish at the private pond than they did at the ranch! They said their favorite part of the stay was the serenity and wildlife and the air bnb! 10/10 ⭐️s."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wish we could stay longer! It was nice to enjoy the peace, and serenity of this place- away from the city lifestyle. Home was lovely and comfortable, exactly what we needed for our visit with family. Thank you for having us!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came to celebrate my birthday, relax, and enjoy some fishing and nature. This vacation rental did not disappoint. The setting is serene and beautiful. The home was adorable, clean, and very comfy. The hosts did a great job at providing everything needed in a vacation home. We should know because we travel a lot and have seen it all. It was truly perfect in every sense. We also had the pleasure of meeting and getting to know the hosts. Thanks to them, we had a lovely vacation and formed memories that will last a lifetime. They truly outdid themselves in terms of hospitality. We hope to come back someday because it is a fantastic place to stay and fantastic people."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is truly a home away from home. From hanging out with the family at the fully stocked pond making once in a lifetime memories.

This property is really a hidden Gem you will definitely enjoy it!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home and property is beautiful and well maintained. All outdoor areas are well lit and have everything we needed from the firepit to fishing poles.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Susan was a wonderful host! Very responsive! We loved the house and how peaceful it was. Our sons had fun fishing off the dock and seeing how big the catfish were. Definitely would recommend this little peace of heaven to friends!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I have stayed here a number of times. I was going to get a hotel room instead of this place and my kids were really disappointed. They were looking forward to staying in the country and my son said, ""Dad, I want to bring my fishing poles so we can fish"". I always thought that it was just me wanting to stay here but no, my kids also love it. I have no say so in this fight, we will always book Susan's BEAUTIFUL cabin in the wood. Next time we will make it a point to eat some of their BBQ."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place!! Very comfortable and inviting! Had everything I could imagine and more. Beds were comfy and place was beautifully decorated ! Would stay again
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very peaceful as described. The pond has some huge fish to catch. The home was very nice if I have anything bad to say, it would be that cell service is poor and the internet didn't work well. Also the master bed is super had but that is just a preference, but we ended up sleeping on another bed because we were uncomfortable. This is a very comfortable place to stay if you are looking to disconnect. We would definitelyrecommendto others."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was absolutely awesome! It was so peaceful and quiet. We loved the location and the pond, had so much fun fishing! We would like to come back sometime."

2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Can’t say enough great things about our stay, from the location and beautiful scenery, to the accommodations themselves, to the host!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a hidden gem! We had such a wonderful peaceful time away from our busy city life. The cottage was so comfortable, clean and well equipped with everything you need. I can’t say enough great things about it! The hosts were so helpful and communicated with us in advance and during our stay. We will definitely be back soon!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The property is amazing!! So peaceful and quiet. Susan is an absolute gem!! We had an issue with connecting to the Wi-Fi and Susan got someone out to the cabin right away; this helped us feel more comfortable to be able to Wi-Fi call/receive calls as our cell service carrier was spotty. Being able to grill out and enjoy sitting on the deck was our favorite.
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This stay completely exceeded my expectations! It was a bit off the beaten path, and the drive back to the house revealed a GORGEOUS surrounding. When we arrived the owners were out building something and told us about feeding the catfish. We immediately went over to feed said fish and it was MAGICAL!!! The space was so so so cozy. In the morning it was storming and it was the most relaxing place ever. We had the electric fire place going while we listened to the rain hit the tin roof, while we drank coffee and read. I never wanted to leave!! They have truly curated a beautiful and relaxing stay."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great cozy place to stay! Very friendly host with great communication. House was very clean. Would stay here again while in that area!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cottage was very clean and comfortable! It was the perfect place for our family to stay after the Polar Express train ride. It is a bit secluded, but Susan's instructions make it easy to find the place, even after dark. Beautiful views of the pond and woods. We'll have to come back and stay again so we can enjoy fishing and the fire pit! I'll echo another reviewer's suggestion of bringing pairs of ""outside only"" shoes. Though there isn't a dining table in the cottage, there are TV trays provided. The kitchen was well appointed and made it easy for us to cook a big breakfast in the morning. Overall, a peaceful and comfortable place to stay while in Palestine!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the cottage. It was very cozy and beautifully decorated. Very clean and easy to get in to. We came in for the Polar Express and needed a later check out time and she was very accommodating.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was so cute and a perfect home base for our trip to Palestine. The fishing at the pond was an added bonus for sure! All three of my kids caught huge catfish as well as my husband and dad. The only suggestion I have would be do bring a pair of outside only shoes for your kiddos.
We will be back for sure!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Check in was easy. There was a Very nice man there when we checked in and asked if we would want a Fire that evening. Which we declined. We also had a family emergency come up which didn't allow us to stay that night. Would definitely recommend this location.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect place for my and family and I. Being born and raised in the country and now living in the big city it was nice to be back home. My kids loved fishing and walking in the woods. We enjoyed the fire pit until about 2am even though it was 33° out. Beautiful home decor and VERY comfortable. We will definitely be booking even time I go back home!!! Thank you Ms Susan

Beautiful view on all sides to wake up to— we got a family of deer! Would highly recommend. Great hosts."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,My husband and I came in with some family for a Rockin' the Rails train trip to see a concert for my birthday. Our stay here was amazing. The house is very inviting.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place in the woods. The home is also very nice inside.
We enjoyed fishing and sitting outside. Carlos also brought us some of his BBQ which might literally be the best I’ve ever had.
If I’m ever in the area again I’ll definitely be staying again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,That place is truly great! The inside of the house is super clean and beautiful. The outside is peaceful and relaxing. It has that “sitting on the porch and drinking sweet tea” feeling to it.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I rented Susan's place while in Palestine to ride the train. The cottage is absolutely lovely, well stocked, immaculate and as advertised. The view of the trees and hills from the front porch is so lovely I could have sat there all day. If you have children, there is plenty of room for them to run around. The stocked fish pond is well kept and the frog song at night is delightful. If you have a husband, there is a lovely and large couch and a big TV, as well as a TV in the master bedroom. :) Susan was very prompt in responding to the couple of questions we had. I would love to visit this property again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a fantastic little getaway here. Beautiful part of Texas with everything you need for fun and relaxation. 10/10 will stay here again!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely place! Spotlessly clean and beautiful accommodations that are surrounded by woods. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch in the evenings - watching the deer and the blue heron come to the pond. It was quiet and peaceful there and the host was immediately responsive when we had questions. 5+ stars!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Susan, had the coffee ready to brew and in a spotless house. Our bed was the place we sank into and never woke up. And, that was after we enjoyed the view of the pond, the trickle of water from the windmill. Watched a huge red hawk hunting in the pasture just beyond. We will back!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This beautiful hidden gem was absolutely wonderful! My two kids loved the fishing pier and they both caught a fish on their first try! The pond is full of different fish and we loved feeding them as well! Beds were comfortable and the couch was even more comfy! We also enjoyed the cows and the donkey on the other side of the fence. When it came to communication with Susan, the host, she was nothing short of wonderful and answered any questions I had! She was very responsive and helped us navigate the area to find the nearest store. If I could rate 10 stars, I would!
**If I had one thing to add, it would be about how the drive looks right before you arrive to the house. Very country and a dirt road or two but please don’t let that sway you from going! We were in a little car and had no issues driving on the roads. Beautiful hills and ranches along the way! The property was absolutely perfect!
We will definitely be back to stay many times in our future!
Thank you Susan for having us!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is so cute and a great place to stay in town. I will say that this is definitely an unplugged experience. Wi-Fi is very shotty and TVs do not work due to connectivity. There was a lost in power due to wind also but it was restored after an hour or so. It made for a good experience for us because it kept us outside and enjoying each other‘s company. The pond was a great amenity as we caught several fish. The owner was an absolute gem. She was very responsive and very sweet. Will definitely be staying here again
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Susan and her husband were wonderful hosts, very good with communication and very kind. They own a BBQ restaurant in town and even brought us dinner to the house that we ordered earlier that day. The BBQ grill on site was missing a grill brush and they kindly immediately brought a new one over. The place was spotless and serene. We will definitely be back!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This location was like heaven 😍 to my spouse when he saw it he got out the car lol and yelled out loud lol he wanted a picture everywhere he rest and said this Air BNB was the best birthday gift he ever had so meeting the host and he family was the bomb.com ...Thank the host and her team level 10 service and we highly recommend anyone to try it
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A group of 6 of us stayed for 2 nights in order to attend a 90th birthday celebration. Everything was wonderful, from the well appointed kitchen to the comfortable beds. We enjoyed seeing the cows during the day and this area had the most wonderful sun rises. One thing I have noticed in some airbnbs that are set up to rent out is that the furniture can be an uncomfortable afterthought but not in this space. There was plenty of space to spread out and relax on plush couches whether we were watching TV or playing card games. We would definitely stay here again! Thank you, Susan!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"*Spacious, CLEAN, comfortable, and cozy
*Nice and newly decorated and furnished
*Very accommodating"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable house with everything needed to cook, if you are so inclined, and lots of entertainment options. Watching the wildlife and the sunrises (through the woods) and sunsets (across the pond) was very special. And the fish were biting! The house was spotless and communication with the host was excellent. There is room to roam on the property and several outdoor spaces to enjoy."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just as described! We only stayed the night, needed a place to rest before getting back on the road, so we did not get to see the property in daylight or enjoy the pond but we are hoping to go back in the warmer months and stay a couple of days."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dead Cat Ranch is much more than we had imagined it would be! It felt like a home away from home. The host was awesome. We dealt with Shawn throughout our stay and he was absolutely amazing! We did horseback riding, the shooting range, fishing and the UTV trails. The property and cabin was to die for!!!! We didn't want to leave!!! This was an all around 5 star experience!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely will be back to make this ranch a frequent Family Vacation spot!
We luckily found this spot as a last minute booking in efforts to surprise our youngest with her first trip to the Polar Express. We couldn’t have asked for anything better, and told Stacy to remember our faces because we will see her soon again!
The amenities were endless and all amazing quality, from the ATV/UTV’s to the clubhouse activities that entertained us for hours. It was too cold to swim, so we are looking forward to jumping in the beautiful pool next time.
Upon arrival Stacy greeted us, gave us a tour, and made us feel right at home. It was just the cherry on top of an already easy booking and check in. Check out was even easier, the only down side was we didn’t want to leave.
Thank you guys for the perfect place to relax, explore, make memories, and call home for a few days!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our experience at the Texas Hideaway Cabin was fantastic. The hosts were attentive, ensuring we had all the necessary information well ahead of our visit.
Shawn Blackwell, the Ranch Manager, was very helpful and facilitated our clay shooting activity which was great. Despite the low water levels in the lake/pond, it still provided a peaceful spot for paddling and fishing, and we caught a perch within a few minutes of casting.
The house was very clean and well designed, and had a well-equipped kitchen and coffee maker. Bug sprays were included, as well as fishing gear on the porch. The included Polaris Ranger was great. We enjoyed driving around all the trails and seeing deer everywhere. We hope to come back some time and tryout a few other activities."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I recently stayed at Dead Cat Ranch and we jad a wonderful time. It was a great cabin, the ATV trails we fun and the space was very well kept!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had an amazing time at the ranch! The cabins are great and you will have everything that you will need, and more. The description and the photos do no justice to the beauty of this ranch. Shawn was a great host, and the horseback riding is a must! There is so much to do and see through your stay. This is an awesome place to just relax, take it all in and feel really welcomed by the staff. Our overall experience and memories that we made at this ranch will be ones that we will never forget! Dead Cat Ranch is a place you will be glad you visited, and we definitely will be back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the peaceful countryside of Texas. Your Airbnb host was amazing! They were very welcoming and accommodating during my stay.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was such a nice getaway. The ranch is so peaceful and relaxing. The cabin was very welcoming and perfect in size. The activities fit well with our family. We loved watching the horses and tending to them. Although, we would've appreciated maybe watching roping sessions or something similiar.
The pool was tranquil and clean. For most of our stay, it felt like we were the only ones there, which was nice. The staff was super friendly and really went out of their way to make us feel at home. We definitely want to come back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Me and my wife really had a great time. Shawn was a excellent host while riding the horses. And the trails with the utv was amazing. Would visit again

Go ahead and book now and look nowhere else!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,One of me and my sons best stay ! Couldn’t ask for more ! Everyone was so helpful we had an amazing time will be going back soon
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place. The cabin was perfect and private…super crisp and clean. The amenities provided were very thoughtful…everything from a variety of coffees, snacks, oatmeal, and needed supplies….even lawn chairs.
Dead Cat Ranch is so peaceful and special. A great place for families or for friend trips.
We especially enjoyed riding the trails on the UTV provided with the room!
I wish we had more time to swing in the hammock and sit on the Adirondack chairs by the fire pit!
Palestine is a cute and fun place to eat and browse the unique shops and antiques.
We went to the Wiggy Thump music festival…so so fun.
Thank you and hope to return soon!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a great trip the cabin is comfy there’s so much to do around the ranch and the views make it so peaceful definitely will be back!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this place was great . It was a nice weekend getaway to disconnect from the world and reconnect with each other ! The attention to detail in the cabin was amazing , everything we needed for cooking was there and bathroom was fully stocked with shampoo body wash conditioner and even makeup remover wipes . We already are planning our next trip !"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was everything!!! Whatever expectations I had were exceeded by 1000%. I wish we would’ve stayed longer. Immediately after you pay for the booking, Stacy sends you plenty of activities to do on the ranch and around Palestine. We decided to book horseback riding with Shawn and gourmet lunch with Pam. Both of the experiences were amazing! I definitely recommend horseback riding to experience the beautiful views of the ranch and animals. Also, Pam makes the best blueberry banana pudding…. ever. So happy that TikTok showed me this place and that Stacy decided to share this gorgeous ranch with the public. We’ll definitely be coming back. :)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I will be telling all my friends to visit. Even if it is just a few days, it is truly worth it. It’s an amazing place to be and the staff and Stacy make it so warm and welcoming."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Dead Cat Ranch! The hosts are responsive and the check-in instructions were clear. Our cabin was clean and roomy for our 3-person family. The property is beautiful with plenty of activities to keep you busy on the ranch. The pool area was a hit with the kids.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. Where do we start?
Like many others, we hesitate to review and say great things because others will find out and book it all up! :p
The seclusion combined with the landscape made Deadcat PERFECT for people looking to get away from it all. It's quiet, remote, and has just enough amenities to keep you from getting bored. (If you're the kind of person that needs something to do every now and then)
The check-in was seamless and uncomplicated. The cabin was immaculate, and very well stocked. Having the Polaris to get around the property was outstanding. We took a daily drive around the property enjoying the wildlife and the lush surroundings. I did a little shooting on the range, which was a blast with the helpful staff on hand.
The pool was a nice break from the heat. The entire place had a ""summer camp"" type feel, only more geared towards adults instead of small children. Things like axe throwing, archery, cornhole, skeet shooting, ATV/UTV, etc are there to keep you entertained.
We will definitely be back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I can’t wait to come back to Dead Cat Ranch! We played in the pool, did some fishing and just relaxed! The cabin was so clean and accommodating. Such a peaceful and beautiful getaway. We will be back!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had great time
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place lots to do. Spent a lot of time relaxing in the pool and at the cabin. If you want to get away and relax this is the perfect place. We enjoyed riding around on the UTV it was a lot of fun and saw several deer running around.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I spent the weekend out on the ranch to celebrate our 1 yr anniversary and it was great! The place looks as pictured and the UTV trails to get around the property were easy. It is kept up with very nicely and they offer so many options for fun activities. The pool was very clean and perfect temp. It was a very relaxing time. The hosts were quick to respond as well. We will def be back with a group of friends. Thanks!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,call or txt ahead of arrival to have someone there to check you in was happenstance that someone was there but we did show up 15 min early.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You will not regret coming to this place. it is perfect for everyone, from couples, families with or with out kids, teenagers, travel solo. There are activities for everyone or plenty of solitude it you want to experience a quiet place. Really no need or even time to spend on electronic devices. The cabins inside are really clean, plenty space, yet cozy. The light color inside our cabin, gives a feeling of modernity with beautiful country views out the windows. enjoy all the flora and fauna. the lake is fantastic for a walk around it. plenty of fish for catch and release, the boats are safe. There is a really cool gazebo near the lake with blackberry bushes behind it. the fruit is fresh and sweet. you can take your picnic there. There are plenty of toys in the pool area as well as a nice seating area by the hot tub. The club house has sooo many games and activities to do. Ping pong table, corn sacks for throwing, giant chess, and many more. They are improving a lot of spaces. One of the most fun activities is to drive the UTV in the evenings and see all the wildlife around you. Bring safety glasses and a mask or bandana, because riding the UTV is dusty. Also, bring good hiking shoes to enjoy a long walk around the property because is HUGE and there is so much to see. A week long stay is not enough. We plan on going back and bring more family to share all we saw and did there."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time was very accommodating
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four had a great time at Dead Cat Ranch. There was a lot to do and plenty of downtime too. We want to go back. And don't forget to arrange for a horseback ride. It was a highlight. Everyone was kind and accommodating, the weather was cooperative for our trip, and the land is beautiful."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"DCR was beautiful and exceeded all expectations. The cabin was open, bright, comfy and very clean. Gorgeous views were abundant. So many activities to do even though just sitting on porch or riding in the UTV to take in the scenery would be more than enough. The owners and Ranch manager were all very accommodating and kind. DCR will be a recurring destination for myself, family and friends. Go ahead.....book it..... YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, friendly hosts and employees. Such unique beauty on the ranch. This place is awesome for escaping reality and getting back in touch with nature. Good for the soul."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I chose this place to propose to my fiancé! And I must say I do not regret making that choice at all. Stacy and Josh helped so much! I was allowed to predetermine a location to propose. And they were even willing to setup a whole surprise picnic for the occasion. It was perfect! My fiancé loved it! Stacy went above and beyond to make sure everything went according to plan and the setup was perfect! The property is stunning! All the extra activities (atvs, shooting, etc…) were super fun! The cabin was very cozy! We couldn’t have asked for a better weekend!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stacy was great about keeping in touch to make sure we were all set up prior to coming. We were give door codes prior to arrival so we werent required to check in with anyone. The Cabin was super clean and nice. For the price of the cabin you got a great ranch experience and UTV included to drive around. We met with the ranch manager Shawn and had a great time talking with him. Brian took the time to come to meet with us to make sure we could pick up some Dead Cat shirts which are very comfortable (not a cheap T Shirt with a logo slapped on and sold for an upcharge)
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay!! We had so much fun here. The hosts and people who stay in the property were all so nice. A piece of southern hospitality that has been fading over time has not been lost here.
Every thing was clean and nicely decorated, so much attention to details and so many activities to choose from! We didn’t have enough time for all of it in two nights. We added the private chef meal option and horseback riding. Both were amazing and memorable experiences. We WILL be back with friends, family or as a couple for sure!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at the cabin! We loved exploring the property on the ATV and the area is beautiful. Watching the deer from the porch was an added bonus. Stacy has done a great job making sure the cabin has just about everything you could possibly need for your stay - and then some! Everyone we encountered at the ranch was so friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be coming back!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came down from Ohio for my sons 5th birthday and it was an amazing trip!!!! They had party hats and and his favorite snacks all lined up and his name written on a chalk board! He was so excited about all of that. And then Shawn knew his name and that it was his birthday he was so shocked! Shawn went WAY above and beyond to make sure my son had a special birthday! It’s a trip we will never forget and I can’t wait to bring the rest of my family back!!!
Thank you!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely worth every penny! Can not wait to come back for a longer stay! The views are great, it’s very peaceful and serene, and we never got bored! The cabin was to die for, owners and staff were extremely nice and helpful and made sure our trip was memorable."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stacy and Josh went above and beyond. The cabin was so clean and had everything we could need - even a s’mores kit for the kids! The Polaris was awesome and the whole family had fun with all the activities ranging from archery, ping pong, axe throwing, basketball, fishing and clay shooting. We can’t wait to come back with friends and rent the bunk house!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an awesome time! You could easily spend a few days here just doing activities around the property: shooting, horseback riding, hot tub (swimming is closed ATM), ATV riding, ax throwing, fishing, etc. The ATV trail is a LOT of fun. Shawn, who took us horseback riding, was a great guy, and the trail was beautiful. Horses couldn't have been easier to ride! Gun range was great, too, complete with skeet shooting. Lots of good relaxation options, too. Comfortable cabin, porch chairs, hammock, etc.
Highly recommended!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for an outdoor getaway, this place is it!
-Cabin is clean and beautiful! We were provided s’mores which was fun to cook up on the fire outside.
-UTV provided had plenty of gas for us to get around and explore the ranch during our 2 night stay. There’s plenty of land!
-We did axe throwing, archery, and horseback riding. First time horseback riding which was a little scary at first but with the guidance of the ranch manager it was a fun experience. There were plenty of other activities also available that we didn’t have time for.
-Communication was fast and open. If we needed anything Stacy and Josh were readily available to respond.
Almost everything we needed was available or provided. From the amenities to the firewood Stacy and Josh really put thought into this property. This is not something we would usually do but glad we did because we really had a good time!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great piece of land, house is like brand new and really fun to drive in your own UTV throughout the property."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We visited Dead Cat Ranch for a friends birthday - what a great weekend! There’s so much to do and when it was time to relax it was the perfect place. Hosts are amazing. Can’t say enough good things about this air bnb. Highly suggest visiting.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My spontaneous spirit lead me to this unexpected peaceful and fun spot in Palestine, TX - Almost 5 hrs away from home 😳! it was worth the drive and my two littles who had a blast swimming, exploring in the atv, watching movies and enjoying the campfire!!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to get away to! Never got bored and the view was amazing!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Endless land! Beautiful and serene. Friendly staff that’s treats you more like a friend. Available when needed but gives you plenty of space to explore and relax. Many options for activities and great scenery just to relax.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Took my 10 yr old son on a father/son retreat for 2 nights. Couldn’t have had a better time. Riding the UTV on what seemed like limitless trails, axe throwing, archery, basketball, ping pong, campfires…. What a great time! We loved it, and hope to make it a tradition for us. My wife and daughters are jealous!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dead Cat ranch is a beautiful place to get away from city living without being too far from the city itself. The staff are friendly and extremely accommodating. 10/10 would recommend staying with Stacy.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was amazing and we’ll definitely be coming back
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a lovely time here over the weekend! The view is beautiful, the house is super clean and smelled really nice. We took our little ones fishing, and they just loved being outside. The place has what you need to whip up a simple meal, and the hosts were super friendly and quick to respond! We can’t wait to come back when it’s warmer! … also, that BED and PILLOWS were so comfy!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is my favorite place I've stayed at using AirBnB. Everything about it was great. The cabin, the ranch, and the people were all great. They were very accommodating with our kids, too."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! Such a nice getaway from the routine. Cabin was clean and organized and tastefully decorated. Hosts have thought of everything! We enjoyed the campfire at night and the quiet! The views from the living room are amazing! We caught some bass in the lake. We rode the trails in the UTV. We shot at clay targets and had a blast! The pool and hot tub area is lovely. Hosts were excellent with communication and wanting to make sure all was well during our stay. Will stay again!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Seriously, we wish we could have stayed longer! We had the BEST time fishing, horseback riding, and riding the trails on the side by side. We went to the clubhouse for axe throwing and corn hole. We enjoyed making s’mores on the fire at night (before it got too windy). The hammock was so relaxing and tranquil. The cabin was very nice and stocked with everything we needed for our stay. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The land is beautiful!!! We saw a family of 9 deer and the ranch dogs are the sweetest! Highly recommend!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our three nights in the cabin on the ranch! The view was amazing and we enjoyed it with our coffee in the morning and our wine by the campfire each night. It was so much fun driving the Ranger around the trails and down to the lake, where my husband caught a large mouth bass. Loved the amenities in the cabin, from the s’mores kit to all the kitchen necessities. We’ll come back when it’s warmer to try out the pool and maybe shooting and horseback riding. But this trip we just enjoyed the serenity under a full moon around the campfire!"
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful property to disconnect from the daily stresses of life and reconnect with your traveling partner. Lots of activities are included in the price but several do cost extra (i.e. shooting, ATVs, horseback riding)."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I chose this location for a surprise birthday weekend for my boyfriend. It definitely exceeded my expectations. The land is beautiful! We had some much needed R&R! We had fun clay shooting, exploring the trails on the ATV, relaxing on the hammock on a perfect day, and star gazing while making smores. The staff was so nice, the cabin was very clean, and we had everything we needed for a perfect weekend. Check in/check out was easy, and the hosts were available if needed! I highly recommend!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with a very beautiful sunrise.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is amazing and extremely well maintained. All of the amenities offered are unbelievable! We stayed in the cabin and had amazing views and woke up to deers in the field. We went horseback riding which allowed us to see a different part of the property we wouldn’t of been able to see otherwise and it was beautiful (highly recommend). Everyone we encountered was so welcoming and wanted to make sure we were having the best time. Overall a great weekend getaway but definitely could of stayed for a week, as we weren’t able to get in all the fun activities. Can’t wait to go back!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most amazing time, we initially only booked for 4 days and 3 nights, however when we got there we immediately wanted to stay for an additional day and night. We were lucky enough that they had the day open for us to continue our stay. The cabin was perfect! It has everything you need plus things your not even expecting! The property is breathtaking, we highly recommend getting out and driving your Polaris on the trails and explore! You can't get lost, they have done an amazing job making sure the trails are labeled and all lead back to the clubhouse!! The fishing lake at the back of the property is absolutely beautiful at sunset and although we fished every single day we were there, the lake bested us this time but we will be back and we will catch a fish. We saw the 24+ family of deer 3 out of the 4 nights we were there and it was so awesome to see! We highly recommend horse back riding, as you get to see a whole new view of the ranch! Talk about a relaxing vacation, they have no expectations of you, it is completly up to you to do what you want, when you want! Shawn (Ranch Manager) and his wife ReJane were the best and made our stay even better than we expected it could be. We can't wait to go back!"

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,this Airbnb was super clean and has the perfect view of a breath taking land scape. only down fall was not being fully prepared for all the dust on the trails and the sheets popping off every night while sleeping only to wake up to laying on plastic covering the mattress lol but this Airbnb was truly a nice get away for legit peace and quite. the hot tub and pool under the stars was amazing and I LOVED axe throwing! the host was quickly responsive and helpful!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This country retreat adventure was the perfect get away for our family.

No detail was missed with the planning of this country experience! So glad for the time there! Beautiful piece of Texas."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome hosts. Amazing location. The perfect place if you would like to stay-cation in TX. The trails are amazing, the pool/hot tub, the fire pits, oh man!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Do not sleep on this place book it NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As our daughter would say, it was a 10 out of 10! The ability to ride around the property and see those views was appreciated and SO much fun! The lake was a big favorite along with the pool/hot tub. Seeing all the animals brings another level of peace to the whole trip. Awesome soft bed with pillows so great, I ordered them for myself. Stacy and Josh were awesome to meet as well as the ranch manager, Shawn. We had a great time shooting some guns with Josh assisting us like a pro and Shawn was always very nice and helpful with whatever we needed! We will be back to ride some horses and ATVs!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dead Cat Ranch far exceeded our expectations! Our host and staff were excellent and accommodating. Communication was fast and very helpful.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I both enjoyed our stay here. The ranch managers were readily available to help with whatever we needed while also careful to give you the space needed to just relax and enjoy your time. So many deer stay on this ranch, they were beautiful. The cabin was nice, spacious, and inviting. Our struggle was between enjoying all the outside activities and staying inside to watch a movie and drink some coffee. Will definitely be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place for a weekend getaway. Stacy and her staff are very friendly and helpful. Tons of activities and fun, I highly recommend"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cabin on a beautiful piece of land with a great view, great trails, and fun activities to do. Our hosts communicated with us frequently leading up to our stay so we could be prepared and they really cared about making our honeymoon special. We got to meet our hosts while we were there and they are great people. We just had to buy a couple of their shirts as a souvenir"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is heaven on earth. It is so worth the money. The property is breathtaking and you have so much to see and do. The hammock was my favorite place to nap. I love going on the trails and being adventurous. The pool was awesome. All the little details were so thoughtful. I didn’t need to leave my entire stay. If you are thinking about booking it, JUST BOOK IT ALREADY. You will have an amazing time. I can’t wait to come back!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You can expect great communication from the host and a fun and relaxing experience on Dead Cat Ranch. We loved our cabin but couldn't stay indoors. We did the ATV rentals to explore tons of nature on the trails. The lake was our favorite where we fished and rode on the paddle boat. We also grilled and ended our adventure at the pool and in the hot tub to enjoy the stars. Many thanks to Stacy for welcoming us in and Shawn for answering our questions. They truly know how to treat guests.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I normally don’t write reviews but this one was so over-deserved. If you’re looking for somewhere, anywhere, this is it! I’ve stayed at many, many Airbnb’s over the years and this one takes the #1 award for everything from cleanliness to amenities to entertainment and everything between. The photos really don’t do this place justice to the beauty of all the hills and open fields of flowers on this property. My kiddo particularly enjoyed all the miles of trails to explore on the UTV, that was a blast. Thank you Dead Cat Ranch for opening up this incredible property to the public, we seriously cannot wait to come back!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our weekend was absolutely perfect from the Polaris you get to drive around, to the fishing, just watching the animals, swimming or cooking out. This place is absolutely perfect and the best place to make some special memories! We can not wait to go back!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great experience! We enjoyed everything from relaxing on our porch, to relaxing in the hot rub and then we relaxed in the pool. Riding the trails in the UTV and being able to explore the acreage and watch the wildlife was a huge highlight for us. The cabin was very spacious, well-stocked and tucked away perfectly for a very private feeling.
Everyone else can go to Broken Bow, we're going to Dead Cat Ranch!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolute beautiful home. Everything was very clean we had zero complaints! I did not expect the home to be so spacious on the inside it was huge. Pool was clean and looked fun to swim in but weather was too chilly. Overall very happy with our stay and would stay here again in the future!

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Angelica was such a great host! Warm, welcoming and very informative about all of our questions and concerns. The home was a beauty in itself; peaceful, private, clean and full of necessities.

It’s all that we expected and more, Thank You Again Angelica."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Thank you.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect county getaway, just what we were looking for. Found this gem after booking a ride on the Texas Railroad steam engine. Stacy and the team were great. I would highly recommend this property (they have multiple other listings) to any future guest. No picture can give the property a proper perspective, you have to see it for yourself."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place is beautiful. It rained during our stay but the large clubhouse and hot tub gave us things to do.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"I'm not sure what my expectations were, but they were well exceeded with this stay! I'm very glad that I found this place!

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place although it gets really dark at night. It could benefit from more outside lighting. I enjoyed the stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful girls trip! So much to do and absolutely peaceful!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third time out to Dead Cat Ranch and it remains one of our favorite getaways in Texas! The hosts and staff are so friendly and make you feel right at home. From the beautiful property, to the pristine pool, to the star filled nights - Stacy and Josh's ranch is such a special place to relax and unwind.<3"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Girls trip for my 40th BD; it was perfect! Beautiful, relaxing get away. Thanks for a fabulous time!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying out at Dead Cat Ranch. Stacy & Josh were incredibly accommodating to our last minute booking. We rented the Country Cottage this time around and it was immaculate and stayed ice cold in the unforgiving Texas heat. We very much look forward to our next visit and we're thankful that they have opened up their ranch to the public. DCR is hand's down one of the best AirBnb experiences in Texas!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dead Cat Ranch was the perfect location for our kid-free getaway with friends. Garzilla Guide Service is what brought us to Palestine, but if fishing isn't your thing, you could easily spend days at the Ranch and love it. From the peaceful views to the immense amount of activities, there's no shortage of fun. Ron and Shawn were who we communicated with while at the property, and they were so fun to chat with. It was our first time to Texas, and I can say we will absolutely be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay! The pictures do not do justice to the beauty of this ranch. It is so peaceful, clean and with so much to do. We felt so welcomed and everyone was so accommodating. Shawn was amazing, the horseback riding is a must! You have so many things to do here. This is a place where you can do as much or as little as you want. I would definitely recommend .......we look forward to staying here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Me and my family of 6 had a absolutely amazing time! 2 adults and 4 kids is hard to accommodate for. Dead Cat Ranch did a great job in being attentive to our needs! All the staff that worked on Proeprty were super friendly and nice.
- Very private where you stay!
- Way Underpriced for Amenities
- Food Nearby
- Host Stays out the Way
I would highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Third time back and we love it more every time!!! From the owners to the ranch workers everyone is so nice and make you feel right at home! We are already talking about when we’ll be able to get back to the ranch!
They certainly work on keeping everything so well kept and they add something new every time we visit!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful, relaxing weekend getaway!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in the Country Cottage for a friend’s 50th bday. The overall experience was incredible. We used the shooting range, rented 4 wheelers, rode horses, and took the side by side around the ranch to explore. We initially had plans to leave for dinner but decided to stay put once we arrived it was so peaceful. Josh was very patient and helpful with my friends while shooting and gave some great coaching (much needed). The “packing list” they provided had items like bandanas which were a must on four wheelers so you can tell they really thought out a lot of the details to make the experience better for all. Shawn was a great guide on horse, was patient with us, and felt like riding with another friend. The value for the add-ons is very reasonably priced. This place is well worth it if you take advantage of all they have to offer. Cottage was well equipped with all essentials and a perfect size for our group of 4. We all plan to return."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was awesome! At first, I was nervous, thinking there wouldn't be enough to do that would suit both my 6-year-old and 14-year-old. This place was perfect, and both of my boys absolutely loved it. Typically, I have a hard time relaxing, but not here. I felt so relaxed. The bed was amazing - it felt like I was sleeping at home!! We cannot wait to come back - this place was amazing!!
The clubhouse was way cool. Ping Pong table and a basketball goal were just two of the things that kept my kiddos entertained. My husband and I went horseback riding and we absolutely loved it. The scenery was beautiful and Shawn the ranch manager was extremely knowledgeable and made the experience very enjoyable."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My girlfriend and I booked Stacey’s place. Unfortunately we couldn’t make it for Valentine’s Day due to an illness however Stacey was so understanding and communicate the entire time. We didn’t get to enjoy the home but as far as communication and flat out easiness to deal with I would rate these guys at the top! Definitely will try again soon with this fantastic couple!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful drive up & around! Kroger is right around the corner so cooking great meals by the fire was so nice!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great location to have private family vacation, great host and friendly animals. We will be back in the summer"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The French Country Cottage had all the comforts of a nice boutique hotel. Our beds were comfy and cozy. Everything was spotless. Extra items like pillows, shampoo, TP were easy to locate. We did not cook but appreciated the well-equiped kitchen as well as the coffee service & snacks. The outdoor area was also well-appointed. We have stayed in many AirBnB's (including in more remote/rural areas) and this is one of the nicest - you could easily spend a peaceful weekend away from the city OR an extended holiday. Stacy was super responsive - and the Cottage was delightful!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful property and the bunk we stayed in exceeded expectations. The staff were very nice and all the activities offered on the property made it a great time. We went in the middle of July and it was hot. But we still did most of what they had to offer and dipped in the pool several times to cool off. Beds were like sleeping on a cloud. Definitely will try to make it back here in the cooler months!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed at Stacy and Josh’s cottage cabin for the July 4th long weekend. It was the perfect location to go into town or hang out on the ranch. The property is great, quiet, and very well maintained. We would definitely go back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice ranch and the cabin was very beautiful and clean. Nice getaway.
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"I think the pricing may not equal what is offered. The cottage was beautiful, but the activities and things offered didn’t strike me as being worth the price."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stacy was very accommodating with our reservations and responded quickly to any questions or needs. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dead Cat Ranch is a beautiful spot to visit & has lots of activities to do to keep you busy! I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the outdoors!
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The family working the ranch was AMAZING. Shawn our guide pretty much all weekend and his wife were great and very helpful. Not a single bad moment the entire weekend and it will now be a once a year if not twice a year getaway for my friends and family. We did the 4 wheelers, horseback riding and various games throughout ranch. Best stay to date out of all getaways"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend a stay at Dead Cat Ranch. So much to do for those who love the outdoors. A beautiful pool and hot tub, comfortable beds in a very clean cottage, the opportunity to shoot, 4 wheel, horseback ride.. the list goes on! Our favorite part was the side by side you get included in the price of your stay to ride around the land. The trails were amazing and so fun to explore and the pond was beautiful. 5 stars! We plan to return with our whole family in the future."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for a short girls’ getaway. The place was CLEAN and perfect for 3-4 people. We found the beds very comfortable, the place well stocked, and hot water was sufficient for all 3 of us to shower. We had a campfire every night and watched for shooting stars.
You’re generally required to use the included UTV to get to and from the cottage, which ended up being so fun we drove it all over the trails on the property and saw lots of deer grazing.
The pool and hot tub were in great shape and very clean (they even have fun multicolor pool lights at night) - enjoyed listening to the toads nearby talk to each other.
Town of Palestine is just 10-15 mins away. It has a well-stocked Kroger and some decent restaurant options.
Excellent communication from Josh & Stacy, and the rest of the staff we encountered were very helpful and kind. It’s the kind of place where they show you around and then generally leave you alone unless you need something. We even bought a few Dead Cat Ranch shirts and hats. We would definitely stay again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dead Cat Ranch is a wonderful escape from a busy, big city lifestyle. My family and I enjoyed the beautiful views of natures architecture at every turn, the damily-like atmosphere from the staff was incredible and the lodging was superb! You literally only need to pack clothes and
some crub because DCR takes care of everything elese for you. The fully stocked kitchen comes with all your needs and everything you always forget to pack, like a wine opener. The space was clean, stylish and comfortable. The pool/hot tub was amazing and the trails are breathtaking. There are plenty of activities to fill up your day or do absolutely nothing which will fill up your soul!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place to spend quality time with friends and family super clean and comfort houses ,Horse riding, ATV, shutting lessons ,fire camp, and more definitely we recommend death cat ranch !"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful lake house. He went above and beyond after a bad storm hit the area and knocked out the power. Be sure to get the recipe for the fig pecan cakes!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Roland and Susan have mastered the role of hosts. There are no words to describe how wonderful this experience was. We needed a place to stay in the area after we wrecked our RV while enroute to Palestine - so we regrouped and booked this cottage. After driving 9 hours we showed up exhausted and hungry and found our cottage to have delicious and fresh baked goods and juice waiting for us. It was such a lovely surprise! The cottage was well situated in a safe and peaceful setting with a great area to walk our dogs. The porch was where we enjoyed morning coffee on each of the 8 mornings we were there. The bed was comfortable with quality linens. WiFi was reliable despite the rural setting. The kitchen is well stocked and the gas grill is handy and clean. The AC held its own even with 109-degree temps. The cottage is most suitable for a couple or a small family and is highly recommended for those who need a respite; you will leave rested and happy!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time at the Bird Cottage! Will definitely return, best AirBnB we've ever stayed at 😁"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We just spent memorial day weekend at Bird Cottage! The place and outdoors was just spectacular- lots of activities, but also the perfect place to relax. Roland and Susan were wonderful! Can’t wait to come back."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing grounds, so well manicured, friendly hosts on property. Had everything we needed to make the stay very pleasant and extremely close to TSRR which we also had booked.
—Note the spiral stairs in booking for loft. It’s a tight fit for these grown adults and a bit of a laughing experience getting our luggage upstairs. But we loved the open rafters and small windows upstairs. Another note would to have a power strip for plugging devices in upstairs, or extremely long cords.
We liked having the cardinals visit us while sitting out on the porch, which we enjoyed extensively. 6 adults may be a little tight downstairs in house at one time but the porch is a wonderful extension to the space. Would definitely return!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Peaceful charming cottage and grounds. Property was beautiful. Hosts were wonderful and extremely thoughtful and nice. We loved the Fig/Pecan cakes that were provided for our arrival.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Before we even arrived, I knew this was a well-run operation. Roland responded almost instantly to the questions I had. The property is beautiful, the accommodations clean and comfortable and Roland and Susan were the perfect hosts. We can't wait to return!!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The perfect spot for a peaceful retreat. Our family and our dog had a wonderful time at the Bird Cottage.

We hope to make it back to the Bird Cottage again soon!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Roland and his wife are excellent hosts. The cabin was beautifully decorated and felt very comfortable from the moment you enter. The personal touches like homemade cakes and orange juice put them over the top Would highly recommend a stay at this wonderful cabin

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an absolutely beautiful property! We visited over Thanksgiving weekend and took our children to ride the Polar Express which was four minutes away.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful get-away for our family. We echo all the wonderful comments from the other guests: cozy cottage with fireplace, fresh homemade sweets (persimmon cake), pedal boat, beautiful hike around the lake, tractor ride, and close to the train depot. We had wonderful fall weather for our stay and spent the whole day outside exploring the place."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property with friendly hosts. They came and introduced themselves and welcomed us. They even left a sweet treat and some orange juice. They will give you suggestions of things to do and places to eat. It was very close to the the Texas State Railway if you’re planning on riding the train.

This is an East Texas treasure and made our sister trip one we won’t forget."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent property to relax and enjoy nature. If you're in East TX, I highly recommend staying at Bird Cottage."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous location and property! Just make sure to bring extra firewood in the winter as the house got about 45F at night with one small heating unit and we were left with 4 pieces of wood after the cold front moved in.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to hang out with very friendly hosts
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a five star cottage! Beautiful woodwork inside. The cottage is cozy and wonderfully decorated.

We enjoyed every moment of our stay.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a treat to stay at The Bird Cottage! The hosts are terrific, the property is beautiful and peaceful, and the amenities are plentiful. We enjoyed meeting the chickens, fishing, and taking the boat out on the pond. We visited to take a ride on the Polar Express, and the cottage is a great location for that, but the stay was worth the trip its own."

We felt very welcome and would love to return for another stay."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,A perfect place all year around. Loved all the bird details. And the shower was awesome! We will be back!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is the second time we (me and my family) have stayed at the Bird Cottage. And once again it does not disappoint. Roland and Susan are the nicest and most accommodating hosts you're likely to meet. The house itself is a slice of rustic paradise and my daughter loved fishing and paddle boating on the pond right on property. Will be back!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved everything about our stay. The attention to detail to make sure guests have all they need was evident. The way the cottage is nestled in the tree canopy is cozy and inviting. The property is beautiful and the cottage is warm. The owners are friendly and informative. The fig cakes tasted straight from my Grandmother's oven.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the Bird Cottage and would definitely think of it for another weekend getaway. The grounds were beautiful. We loved sitting in the breeze on the front porch. Ask your host about the beautiful roadway (yes, the roadway) that makes a circle around the property. Great story."

The lake is amazing and very quiet for meditation or fishing. Very safe place where our children were able to enjoy and run with peace of mind. Very friendly hosts all the time willing to make our stay a special moment! We really appreciate it and hope to be back again"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This property was absolutely beautiful! The kids loved it and it is close to the Polar Express train ride.

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cottage was absolutely beautiful and we can't wait to go back. Susan and Roland are such amazing beautiful people and we adore them. I can't wait to go back to the cottage. My kids had an amazingly time there and they made it so much more special for them. I recommend Bird Cottage for everyone.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,From arrival to departure this is a great place to relax and enjoy sunrise and the beauty of nature. The one morning that we had fog still had a beauty of its own! Didn’t want to leave.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Bird Cottage for our honeymoon. The cabin is beautiful and the hosts were wonderful. They stopped in to greet us and let us know how to contact them if we needed anything, but otherwise we had the place to ourselves, which is exactly what we needed. Highly recommended."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic weekend at Bird Cottage! My husband, our daughter and my best friend and her two children came to Palestine for the Polar Express. Bird Cottage was the perfect location - very close to the train station, but also secluded enough to feel like you are really getting away. The kids (ages 3, 4 and 5) had a BLAST! They spent most of their time outside, either decorating gingerbread houses on the covered porch or running wild in the fenced “corral” right outside the cottage. Since it the property is gated, we felt completely comfortable letting them explore!
The owners are wonderful people! They were so quick to respond to any question or request we had and also left some yummy blueberry bread for us in the fridge!
The home is well appointed and has everything you could need - ample kitchen utensils, appliances, toiletries in the bathroom, pillows, blankets, even Kleenex! This is a minor thing, but I’ve been to many Air BnBs that don’t provide much of anything! This one left us wanting for nothing.
We had the BEST time at Bird Cottage. Wish we could give it ten stars! We will for sure be back!"
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,everything was fabulous and you can't go wrong staying here!

2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at Bird Cottage with my 6-yr old daughter, sister, brother and his wife and 1-year old son for a family reunion down the road. Wow! I mean wow! Bird Cottage is an amazing home on an amazing piece of land. Complete with rustic charm and modern amenities the pictures do not do it justice. Breakfast and coffee on the porch surrounded by birds, fishing on the pond, or just taking a stroll around the beautiful grounds - every bit of it was great. Our hosts, Roland and Susan could not have been nicer. In addition to leaving delicious breakfast pastries for us they let us use their dock and even set up some fishing poles (very cool throwback bamboo poles) and my six year old daughter had a blast. My brother and his 1 year old even took the tractor out for a spin. Great memories. I will definitely be back next time the family gets together in Palestine."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful property with stunning views of valley and surrounded by pine trees. Didn’t feel like we were in Texas at all. Kids had great time playing at the play area, and at game room. Ranger - the dog on the property was center of everyone’s attention 😊. How itself is cozy and comfortable. Overall we loved our stay here and plan to return soon."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and peaceful. The host makes you feel welcome and the guest house is comfortable. Great for a large family or a small group of friends. The view from the dining table is stunning! It's 15-30 minutes away from towns with restaurants and shopping. If you are looking for a comfortable place to relax for a few days this is it.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place for siblings to gather for a weekend stay. Donna was very responsive to our questions and needs. Everyone loved the peaceful setting. We would definitely stay again.

Donna’s property was so peaceful and welcoming. There is a beautiful overlook of the Palestine hills right outside the guest house. You can tell great thought and care has gone toward the design of the grounds. There is a tranquil flower garden with a walking path, and there are several outdoor seating areas. We are already talking about planning a trip back in winter or early Spring."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Donna’s place was amazing. She was a great host, and very responsive."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful home! The directions were clear and concise. Plenty of room for our family of 6. The house was very clean with classy decor. Comfy beds! The views were refreshing with gorgeous sunrises. Thank you Donna.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"If we are going to this side of TEXAS- (Palestine) area- we are staying here!! Might be a drive to get there but the drive makes it worth the while if you are about long winding roads and trees! The house is perfect - great place for an early morning cup of coffee and just the sound of nature- we love to BBQ here and enjoy time with family and friends on the patio- THE HOUSE is clean, no smells, no oh no's of anything! Recommend this place if you are in the area!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This was the perfect place for our group of friends to get together. Donna was wonderful and the directions were spot on.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great view and value!
Super comfy beds. We thoroughly enjoyed the game room. Just a note, there is no stove/oven, however there is a toaster, microwave, griddle and portable burner. Also, try to arrive in the daylight, the darkness made finding the entrance a bit difficult the first time. The main entrance is the way to go."
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely, peaceful place with spectacular views for this part of eastTexas. Enjoyed early mornings and evenings out on the deck. Very secluded and quiet even though host and other guests reside on property.
Bring what you need (coffee, creamer,etc) as a quick trip into town isn’t easily accessible. But once you’re here, you won’t want to leave."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"When you visit Donna's guest house, you will be deep in the woods of East Texas. The view from the front porch and the great windows in the front room will remind you of the Smokey Mountains.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great gaming and exercise room, frisbee golf, outdoor fire pit, and gorgeous view."
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is just awesome, you can have entire house to you facing small mountains and the morning scenic one should never miss. It’s 15 miles from Palestine and drive is also great. If you’re lucky you can see lot of animals near the house, we are lucky to see deers and mangoose. House is clean and well maintained, if you’re about to cook for 4 or more people carry your own utensils and stove is really small, prepare yourself for that. Grill is good outside, so you can use that. Other than that it’s a great place to get away and hidden gem on north Texas. Donna is such a nice host, who will provide guidance how to reach the place as its little deep in woods. She will be super responsive. Lastly Royal- Donnas dog is such a good girl and she is very royal keeper who won’t let anyone enter to their house."

And the exercise / game room next door was a nice amenity, too."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely little cottage in a beautiful woodsy setting. I had a great getaway weekend with a few friends. We did stuff the fridge full but it worked out. The wifi had a bit of buffering so it might not be the best for a work situation. But we came here to get away from work!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful, peaceful getaway situated on beautiful property in the Piney Woods. Absolutely gorgeous! With plenty of room to spread out in the large home, we enjoyed Donna's place so much. Donna was a great host, quick to respond when we needed help with directions and pleasure to visit with upon arrival. Will definitely return!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect for a ladies' weekend. Plenty of space inside and out. The grounds were great for a short stroll or just sitting and enjoying the view. Donna was very helpful with booking, check-in, and knowledge of the area."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location in the piney woods. Great fire pit.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great family weekend. Donna and Mike are gracious hosts and their guesthouse was the perfect Covid getaway we needed. Perfect for young kids.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a great hidden treasure in the piney woods. The house was amazing, the view was beautiful, such a relaxing place. So many great amenities; fire pit, playscape and even a game room. We would come back in a heart beat- great family time."

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely quiet place! Great communication, sweet dogs— we loved it! It felt like a home away from home plus a spectacular view."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time. We took the grandkids to ride on the Polar Express. It was great.
The house is up in the hills. Great view. Wish I could live there. We want to go back in Fall to see the great colors."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,If your looking for a place to stay that is secluded with nice views then this is the place. I will be looking for availability next time I’m in the area.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for our family!
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The owner is very responsive to all questions. The house is very clean and comfortable. The outdoor space and views are worth the drive to the home. There is also a terrific exercise and game room. I highly recommend.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing house with beautiful views of the local area! We loved it and will definitely book again for our next TSR Train adventure!
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,My recommendation is to stay here. The 4 bedroom 2 bath was perfect for our buddy golf trip at Pine Dunes. The game room is AWESOME. The views are beautiful. You won't find a better place so do yourself a favor and rent this!!!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Set atop a hill shaded with tall pine trees, this place is a perfect respite from the Texas summer heat - our kids played outside for hours each day. The house is beautiful, the hosts are wonderful and Dash the dog is the best. We cannot wait to stay again."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a very relaxing stay and were pleasantly surprised at the pretty view of the surrounding hills. Our family really enjoyed playing darts and air hockey in the gameroom together. We were looking for a place to rest for a couple days and this house was a wonderfully quiet and peaceful environment.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Good view and comfortable place to stay
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing is just the beginning. The location, grounds and Guest House are a slice of heaven. Little Luvie dogs are warm and welcoming, too. The property is breathtakingly beautiful and the views are spectacular. The Guest House was immaculate. It’s all great. Donna and Mike are gracious hosts."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We saw deer!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at Donna's guest house. Beautiful scenery, great amenities, and my kids lived the play ground they had in the front. You cant go wrong with this gem in the Eastern Woodlands of Tx"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely wonderful place. You will not be disappointed!! We were thrilled and are looking forward to our next trip out there.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It is wonderful. Kid friendly out of this world. Only thing I would recommend is prepare for cooking foods that do not require am oven.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Donna’s place was awesome. The view was breathtaking and the home was very cozy with everything you would need. There were lots of extras that we did not get to experience because of the weather. Definitely a place to go to get away and enjoy nature.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"if you are looking for a quiet, peaceful getaway, then Donna’s guest house is for you. Beautiful countryside and views and her cottage has 4 bedrooms and 3 baths. There is a very well-equipped workout facility next door to the cabin. It rained pretty much the entire time we were there and we still had a great time. You are 20 or so minutes from shopping, antiquing, etc."
2019-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"All in all this place was great. Donna met us when we arrived to let us in and show us around. The grounds were great. The view of the area is gorgeous! The house was very well put together and the accommodations were great. My only small complaint would be the kitchen. There weren't really the appliances to do much cooking. Just a microwave, a toaster, and a hot plate. Since the house is located about 20 minutes from town, there aren't many restaurant options close. So, we had to opt for cooking simple meals. Which took away from the vacation rental house experience. Other than that, the place was great and we would definitely stay here again.
PS - The visit from the wild turkeys in the afternoon was a great experience for the kids."
2019-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great home for family vacations or a weekend stay! Plenty of extra activities to do in the game room or outside as well. We enjoyed our stay!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home with plenty of room, peaceful views and extra comfortable. Was our home away from home for the weekend. Donna’s place had everything we needed for our stay. Communication was quick and easy. We would definitely stay again if we are in the area!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time at Donna's place. The guest house sits at the top of a hill and overlooks a valley. It's a beautiful view morning and evening. The guest house is perfect for a getaway for a couple or with family and friends. There property grounds are great for walks or a jog. There's also a rec room with a gym and some game room activities. Palestine is a nice 15 minutes drive away, so you feel secluded but can make a quick drive to town to get a bite or see the sights. Donna and her husband are also very welcoming and communicative to make your stay as nice as possible. Great place to stay if you want a getaway from the big city to enjoy the outdoors, make a camp fire, and relax without being too far from a hot bath and comfy bed. Would definitely stay again!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great view and many things to do around property.
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,If you don't stay here you are crazy. It is perfect.
2018-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice accommodations to get away and enjoy quiet time and beautiful views. Kids loved the game room which has something for all ages. Lots of wooded acreage to explore.
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful and peaceful getaway. The view in the morning is breathtaking. The house is a gem. The location is nice and quiet. 5 adults and 3 small children and we all stayed comfortably (with the baby in the pack-n-play). And the kids loved the playground!!
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Thanks Donna!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great home based if you want to spend a few days Pine Dunes Golf Course. This is our second summer to stay at Donna’s place and it never disappoints. This is a very clean and comfortable home with all your basic creature comforts. We pack-in all our food and drinks and ice for the weekend. We utilize the provided charcoal grill (charcoal not provided) and bring our own small butane camp stove to cook meals on outside. Pots, pans and other sundry items provided. Don’t think twice if you’re looking for a place in in the Palestine/Athens area."
2018-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful property. Very clean and comfortable house. Perfect for our family of 7 this week. The adjacent game room was a treat for the kids. Donna was a delight - responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay here again!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If any traveler is debating on where to stay while in this particular area, my family and I can't recommend this beautiful home enough. It has such a warm and welcoming charm - making you feel right at home; and the surrounding scenery is absolutely beautiful. Also, traveling with a toddler and a baby is always nerve wrecking but staying here worked out perfectly for my family. My family and I truly got to experience a lovely getaway here."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This roomy, stylish, comfortable house is the perfect get away for those seeking escape and serenity. Deep in the woods of East TX and nine miles from the closest community, Donna's house is serene and soothing. The views are amazing. The beds are comfortable. The vibe is Zen. We four women could not have been more happy with the accommodations."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Donna was so sweet, she met me outside the guest house and walked me through the space. It was beautiful, clean, and very spacious. It was the perfect getaway, not too far from Dallas, but enough out that you feel on vacation. I would not hesitate to book another getaway at her guest house.
Thank you again!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family (4 adults / 3 children) stayed at this location while we attended my nephew's wedding in Gresham. It was remote, yet convenient to everything we needed. We had plenty of room ~ even enough for 3 more family members who stopped by one evening for dinner. Donna, the host, was very helpful and her response time is excellent! The grounds are so beautiful...peaceful! A joy to walk around the pond watching for all the butterflies, frogs and hummingbirds. We especially loved their pup, Dash, whom the kids renamed ""Friendly"" because she was so sweet! I already want to go back!!!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Exceptional accommodations and breathtaking views - great escape from city living!
2018-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a wonderful place to stay! It was perfect for our family of 6. We loved the house and the property. I enjoyed just sitting outside and relaxing while taking in the view. I would definitely recommend this home ! It’s a short drive into town and a short drive to Athens. We also went shopping at Canton trade days.
Everything was perfect! Thank you 😊"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Donna is an excellent host. Her hospitality is amazing and sincere. The home is lovely, and it is stocked with everything you need. With our large crowd, we needed a few extra things and she brought them over immediately. The view is absolutely stunning! It’s a perfect spot for a relaxed getaway."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paradise on a hill, beautiful landscaping, beautiful house, and wind thru the pines were the ingredients for a wonderful retreat weekend. On a scale of 1 to 10, the listing rates 15 if quiet, calm and private are what you are looking for."
2018-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The place was nice. Donna was an excellent host and we really enjoyed our stay
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Epic views, lovely property, and comfortable house to stay in. Staying here really enhanced our vacation. Highly recommend."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It has Charcoal grill. You can enjoy BBQ there.
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was lovely and very clean. A very nice place to stay!
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a GEM. The land is beautiful, and my kids (toddler age) had so many multiple fun activities to entertain themselves with between the playscape, the play room, and the pond. The view each morning as the sun rises is pretty breathtaking; we loved sipping our coffee and looking out the multiple bright windows and the birds circling. We fed the catfish in the pond, splashed in the mini-waterfall, and snuggled with their dog, Dash, who might just be the friendliest dog you will ever meet. This is a great getaway. The internet was a little spotty (but our cell reception was fine!), which was totally ok for us because it forced us to unplug! We would go back in a heartbeat."
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our third time staying here. As always, Donna was a great host. We will be back again!"
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Wonderful host. Accommodations were as described and great. Highly recommend Donna and her place.
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was adorable and very clean. The views were incredibly beautiful. My two kids enjoyed the game room and the playscape. Donna was a great host. We would definitely stay here again if we came back to Palestine.
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this property! It was very tidy, warm and welcoming. We really enjoyed our stay! The view was beautiful and the property is very relaxing. Donna is great to work with and was such a great host."
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here to visit the polar express train ride and it was absolutely perfect. Just a short drive to town, yet secluded enough if you want to go somewhere to for a relaxing getaway. The views from her guest home were amazing. Our two kids loved the property as well. I would recommend this for families anytime! I would definitely go back."
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Donna's place is located off the road and has a beautiful view. It is quiet, clean, and comfortable."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Absolutely wonderful. Beautiful country place with luxurious rooms. We will be back!!!
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay. Beautiful views and a wonderful host.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The pictures do not do this home any justice. It is gorgeous. Lots of room for my 3 littles to run and play. There is a pond full of lily pads and views of the hill country you have to see to believe!
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just BOOK this place now, trust me, don't think about it, just do it!! I am an Airbnb owner from Austin, Texas and this place is just fabulous. If you need to come to the Tyler/Palestine area hands down this is a jewel worth the country road drive. I am so very glad I explored outside of the hotels in the Tyler area since we needed to be in Frankston. Donna and her family have created an oasis tucked in the tall pines of east Texas between Palestine and Frankston. This is more like a home that has been updated with 4 bedrooms and 3 baths! Seriously even if it's just 2 of you book it, hotels would cost the same and be so boring next to this location. The kitchenette is just right with the fridge, along with coffee/filters and fixin's complimentary. The beds are comfortable and there are plenty of linens and towels. It is a lovely setting and the home is darling and the pictures don't do it justice due to the setting and views. You also have a whole recreation room next door that has a pool table and air hockey table with plenty of exercise equipment..... if you choose to do anything other than sit, read, drink coffee and enjoy the view, haha. If you have kids, they will really enjoy the playscape within eyesight of the front porch. The main house on the property is absolutely gorgeous along with the lily pond and waterfall that separates them. Donna enjoys sharing her place and is happy to engage as much or as little as you like, a lovely hostess. The fire pit was an added bonus with wood ready to go. We were in the area for a funeral and Donna went above and beyond knowing the part of our crew was driving 16 hours from Colorado and she had a delicious homemade casserole waiting for us, beyond thoughtful. I can't wait to go back and just have a relaxing weekend. In addition to my review please know the Colorado crew LOVED the place as well. Thanks Donna!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful location! Donna and Mike were very gracious hosts. Lots of room to explore. Be sure to bring groceries though since Palestine is about 20 minutes away. The guest house doesn't have a range, but pans and a plug in hot plate are provided."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great guys weekend with two days of golf at the nearby Pine Dunes Golf Cousre and poker nights at Donna's guest house! She offers very clean and well appointed lodging with an amazing hilltop view!
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely home! It was clean and spacious for my family. The children enjoyed the playroom and we enjoyed the amazing view with our morning coffee. The home was clean and neat and the host was very communicative.
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We absolutely loved our stay with Donna. The view is spectacular. The home was clean and very comfortable. Donna is easy to communicate with. It feels like you are staying at the home of relatives. When traveling to the Palestine/Frankston area we will always stay with Donna, if the residence is available."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a peaceful East Texas getaway, this is it. Gorgeous views. So quiet, all you hear is the wind blowing through the pines and birds singing. My toddler loved the playscape and resident dog, who was as friendly as she could be.
The house was perfect. Nicely decorated and clean. We had towels and all the basic supplies. Lots of windows to enjoy the view and natural light. We found a hot plate and toaster in addition to the microwave and coffee maker, so you could make some basic meals if you didn't want to leave every time to eat.
Donna was as kind and welcoming as she could be. She got back to me when I had questions and gave us our space. It felt like we were the only ones there!
We will stay again if we ever travel that way in the future."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donna's place was absolutely amazing!! She created the perfect experience for my family and I. She was very responsive, check in was smooth and easy! She remembered our names and made us feel like family. The views were BREATHTAKING, the GH was very clean and comfortable had everything we needed. Not to mention the game room/workout room gave us the perfect place to unwind and enjoy each other as family. And Dash he truly made us feel at home. "" He was a true ambassador "" In my dads words! Thanks again Donna, we can't wait to come back!!"
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Being a sales manager at 2 award winning Marriott properties, I have to say I am thoroughly impressed from the initial contact through departure of our stay. Donna and her husband were very personable and had everything very clean and inviting! The property was immaculate as was the guest house! The view was breathtaking, especially at sunrise! We had so much fun playing air hockey, pool and darts in the game/fitness area. We needed a quite place to recharge and this was perfect! Thank you for a perfect weekend!!"
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a find! This beautiful home is nestled among the pines in a secluded area just outside Palestine. It has an amazing view to wake up to, beautiful grounds to stroll through, and everything you need to be comfortable during your stay. Donna was a gracious and accommodating host and we really couldn't have asked for a better setting for our family gathering. Highly recommend for a getaway!"
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the best Airbnb experiences I've had. Donna is so kind and easy to work with. The property is stunning. The guest house was immaculate and comfortable with plenty of room for our group of 8. We hope to stay here again the next time we are in the area!
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great! Being a ""city person"", I was not used to driving on county roads. They are a bit narrow and scary when opposite traffic is hauling huge trailers or boats. I guess you get used to it. The drive was beautiful though, lots of trees , flowers, cows and horses. It was just what we needed. Our goal was to unplug the kids from technology for a while; let them have fun just being. Donna, Mike, Kathy and Dash made us very welcomed. You have a fine house and beautiful property. We were fortunate to stay there. Thank you very much."
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful secluded resort on the outskirts of Palestine. There were 4 spacious bedrooms with many amenities. There was a great fire pit right outside of our guest house. The fitness center was very updated with a pool table, air hockey and dart board. The grounds are very beautiful with many flowering plants, small waterfall and pond. The perfect weekend place for quiet times but offered many choices for children."
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house. It's so quiet at the house and we had so much fun. Donna stayed in contact with me to make sure I found the house safely. The game room is awesome and the kids loved it. It's so peaceful and beautiful out there.
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donna and Michael's guest house is SO BEAUTIFUL! We had excellent communication with them both before and during our stay. Their house is secluded along a beautiful winding road. We felt like we were in Colorado! The home was clean and very comfortable and had great views of the rolling hills outside. If we ever have a reason to be in Palestine again, we will definitely be staying with Donna and Michael!"
2016-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don't do this place justice. The view from the hilltop is spectacular and the property is gorgeous. Donna has a beautiful guest house with plenty of bedrooms and bathrooms to accommodate our 2 young families. Right before the cold front moved in, the hosts checked in with us to offer their home and fireplace should we lose power due to high winds - such a sweet gesture. We will definitely be back."
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed for the weekend with three other couples and had a wonderful time! The property is absolutely gorgeous and peaceful. The house was perfect for so many guests. Donna was so helpful at answering questions and getting back to us quickly. We all had a wonderful stay and I would recommend this place to anyone!
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful little house up on a high point near Palestine. Views were great from the deck and living room. Four bedrooms and three baths options are rare in most locations, but we found a great one.

Hostess was vary accommodating. The house is up a gravel road and a little hard to find after dark. She talked us up the driveway and met us at the house. It had everything we needed for our weekend."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was such a great experience to stay at your beautiful home. we enjoyed the rec room as well as having family over for the beautiful scenery and a large enough place to visit in❤️ You were truly hospitable and next time we come to Palastine Texas we will definitely Want to stay there again! Many Thanks Bobby & Denise Rinkle
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,House is great! Donna is a wonderful host! She was there to greet us and communicated with us on the way there. The house was four bedroom and three bathrooms plenty of room for our family of four. My kiddos loved the swings and sandbox. The workout gym was fabulous and the kids loved the air hockey table. We are looking forward to coming back next year and take our Australian cousins with us!!!
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Donna was a great host. She made sure we arrived safely and settled in with no problems. The home is beautifully decorated and very homey! Great location for a Canton weekend trip :)
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Guesthouse was absolutely Lovely! A group of us stayed at Donna's guesthouse for a ivy league ride weekend in Palestine. The property is amazing, and we felt very much at home. Donna was a great hostess, meeting us at the street (the driveway is a little hard to see) even though we arrived much later than anticipated. We are already planning our next Palestine gravel ride and I'll definitely be checking for availability here!"
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay over Labor Day weekend. Donna could not be any more accommodating. We got in a little late and she drove out to meet us (her place is a little hard to find) and made sure everything was just right for us while we were there. We had 7 adults and 2 kids and we were still all comfortable...it's a given that having 3 bathrooms for us was awesome. We plan on going back next year and Donna's is the first place I will look at coming back to!
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donna was a fabulous host. We got in late and she took the time to locate us and get us to the house. The location is a secluded and the property itself, including the house is breathtaking. Beautiful home and a relaxing time for all. Will definitely rent from again on our next round in that area!!!"
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family thoroughly enjoyed this lovely home, and wished the stay could be longer!"
2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donna's house was perfect for our family. We attended a wedding in Palestine and were able to house the entire family only minutes away from the venue. The views from the house are scenic, and the house is a great retreat location."
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was fantastic! I feel like we hit a home run with this booking. The scenery is superb and relaxing. I would have loved to stay longer. It was perfect for getting together with family. Donna was marvelous and we loved chatting with her and getting to know them a bit. Dash the dog is also a big part of the welcoming committee! The house was great too, everyone had their own room and then there was plenty of space to come together to watch a movie."
2016-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donna was wonderful to work with in both the planning of the trip (questions before reservation, hiccup in billing, assisting us with groceries, etc.) and during our visit (responsive to emails, friendly, etc.)

The guest house is BEAUTIFUL and the pictures don't really do it justice. It's much larger than I anticipated in my mind, has a gorgeous view and fit our family well. My only recommendation would be to upgrade the mattresses (especially in the master room)...as I ended up sleeping in the twins as the other beds were too soft for this Goldilocks :)"
2016-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house and the property were amazing. Donna and her husband are really great people. They are available at any time you need them. The views are amazing, the house is clean and well maintained. Their dog Dash is the friendliest animal I have ever met. We will stay here again and again. No more hotels in Palestine or Tyler for us!!"
2016-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Simply amazing! Beautiful house, clean and relaxing!
Hosts went above and beyond!"
2016-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect weekend getaway for my father's birthday. Donna is a gracious hostess and her guest house is beautiful. Thanks for allowing us to come and enjoy.
2016-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is my best AirBnB experience so far.
I booked Donna's guest house for a weekend getaway with 7 of my girlfriends and we all loved it! Donna is the most accommodating host there is - in every way. She brought extra cups after welcoming us, tried to help us buy something we forgot, volunteered to meet us at a more central location so we won't get lost, etc.
What one other reviewer said is so true - pictures don't do this place justice and it's winter time!
I'm booking her place again for spring break; -)"
2016-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our two little families had a fabulous time on Donna and Mikes grounds! The guest house was large and able to accommodate two plus families. We had so much fun New Year's Eve making a bonfire and roasting smores, playing in the entertainment building and cooking a great meal! They even let us use their oven in their house to cook;) the grounds and view were breathtaking and we will definitely be back! Looking forward to the next relaxation trip already!"
2015-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Donna was helpful with everything from directions upon arrival to taking our picture for us upon departure. The house made a relaxing space to spend time with the family, we enjoyed the scenery and games. I recommend it."
2015-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donna and her husband were WONDERFUL hosts. They were there for everything we needed and extra stocked the house with blankets and towels because we were more than expected. The view is also AMAZING! We had only traveled 2 hours away from Dallas and felt we were in a different state! We came with children and there were things to do for them all day and us. We even fished on the property apart from playing darts, pool, and air hockey. That said, the bonfire we were able to build at night was the best part! Overall unforgettable experience! Thank you!"
2015-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Donna is absolutely wonderful and friendly! The property is excellent and the scenery is gorgeous. This is the perfect place for a family to stay. The sandbox, trampoline and swing set was a big hit for my son. We will definitely return!"
2015-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a great experience at this property! The view was beautiful and Donna was very welcoming. The kids thoroughly enjoyed the playground and the friendly dog, Dash. We will definitely use this place again next year for our annual trip to Palestine for the Polar Express!"
2015-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"All around beautiful place to stay, inside and out. Donna was professional, accommodating and very nice. The beds and pillows super comfortable. Very nicely decorated. We felt so comfortable. And there is so much to do outside as well. I was more than impressed and plan to stay here again."
2015-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donna and her husband were gracious hosts. The guest house is even more beautiful than the pictures and the view is magnificent. We honestly didn't have one negative comment. In fact, we told many people in the area that this was a perfect getaway place for families and couples. If my friends and I were back in the area, we would definitely stay here again."
2015-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The guest house was adorable and perfect to handle our group for our stay to go on the Texas State Railroad Fall Brunch train. Donna was very sweet when we arrived later than expected, and she helped us get settled in in the dark. One of her dogs was extremely friendly, which I loved. The views from the house were amazing, you are looking down into a valley of beautiful trees from the large row of windows on one side of the house. My whole family agreed we wished we had more time to enjoy the location, and definitely would happily stay here again!"
2015-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed 1 night. It was a great location for riding the TX State Railroad- about 45 mins from the Rusk station.
The guest house is very lovely and the scenery is amazing. We enjoyed taking a walk around the beautiful pond.
The host Donna was very welcoming. She gave me good directions and we made it without any problems. Everything we needed was provided, including the all important morning coffee."
