2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good place, but the air conditioner and heater were noisy"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for our daughter’s graduation from MSU. The current prices of hotels this weekend were triple the cost and this was a cute and in a convenient location. I loved the access to a kitchen unlike in a hotel room where you have to go everywhere for food and drinks. They even provide the shower necessities (shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel) they also had coffee and sweetener for the coffee maker. Really a nice space for a few nights. If I had more time, I’d love to have walked around the capital. Cute area!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful spot, I really enjoyed my stay here for a work trip. Thank you!"
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed for one night and the location was excellent. Plenty of Free street parking right in front of condo. Very walkable.
The place itself was just ok. It was dark inside and sort of stinky. Not unbearable, but slightly unpleasant. The heat was on too high, so woke up with dry mouth. We found the thermostat in the morning, so totally our fault. The bed was ok, but there is a sky light right above your face, so we moved our pillows to the foot of the bed so the light was not in our eyes. I thought it was a little pricey for what it was, but still 40.00 less than hotel and you don’t have to pay parking fee. So, I would stay again just for location and price.
I think the owners care about this feedback, so I’m not complaining…just trying to give feed back that might help make the next tenant more comfortable. All easy fixes. Move bed, more light in bathroom, living room and kitchen and get rid of smell. Maybe natural oil diffuser with lavender?"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This apartment is surrounded by wonderful shops and eateries. The host gave great detailed instructions and was very responsive. We would recommend this place for anyone in need of a stay in the heart of downtown Lansing! The layout and design is very unique with exposed bricks and a modern industrial very cool vibe. It was also very quiet at night and good for traveling with a toddler. A++!!!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great host. The only request I have for them is to shift the bathroom bulb from yellow to White. But its best place to stay if u are in Lansing Area.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So close to the capital building and in walking distance to a lot of places, we parked in the garage they supplied parking to and walked everywhere we wanted to go from there, brewery, stores, restaurants, etc. The place was super easy and convenient to get into, had no issues at all, was only a little confused with parking at first, but the host was quick in response to help. The space was super clean and everything worked, so we had no complaints at all during our stay and very much enjoyed it!! Highly recommend!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great stay in the loft. The area was very pleasant and did not have any issues. The portable air conditioner was very loud but that was our only issue.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place seems to be on the verge between a developed, nice area, and something more questionable. That said, the apartments felt secure, and there were lots of close, walkable options. It was clean and the use of the space was ingenious and artistic. Highly Recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Goldilocks was such a pleasure to work with. I was traveling with 2 teens and a busy soccer schedule and adorable little studio apt was so easy to navigate.
Of significance, Goldilocks was promptly available at all hours of the night when I had a bizarre after hours request. So helpful and attentive!!
The Capital building is gorgeous at night and was beautifully lit up on our arrival. Coffee, little market, dining all very close & convenient.
I will be back and I highly recommend!!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I always have a good stay at Goldilocks place. Always clean, never noisy and always comfortable."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Goldilocks unit was as described. When I encountered an unexpected problem in the unit, they quickly relocated me to a different unit in the same building with no fuss. Communications were prompt, complete, and reached me via the App and directly by phone. I appreciated their flexibility and responsiveness."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect listing!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! Enjoyed my stay
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Close to MSU, not a lot to do otherwise. Basement is well stocked, good place to stay, but thin walls and creaky stairs means you'll hear anyone else in the house. Tough to beat for the price!
Suellen, however, was lovely! I'll be back next time I'm in town."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a very pleasant short stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I had a comfortable stay at Suellen's basement apartment. She is a wonderful host, and I recommend staying in her space. One thing to note is if you're taller than 6 feet, you'll need to watch your head because of the low ceiling (including fan)."
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could give Sueellen 5 stars. The price was fantastic and the space provided everything that I required. The reason that I give it 4 stars is because she seemed annoyed when I asked for clarification regarding her house rules and instructions. Twice she asked ""Didn't you read my message? I said..."" and then answered my question in a condescending way. I'm 52 but was made to feel like I was a bad child that wasn't listening to her. I tend to repeat information back to make sure I hear things correctly and she seemed annoyed. I wanted to think of her as warm and friendly like all of the other reviewers but I found her to be impatient with me. I arrived in the evening after a 5 hour drive so maybe my brain wasn't processing things as quickly as she'd like. The day I checked out I handed her the keys and she seemed annoyed that I didn't see her message to leave them on the table. I debated on writing this but it was a disconnect that she may need to be aware of for future guests."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suellen was a perfect host, offering a comfortable apartment that was clean and well stocked with basics in the kitchen and living room. The bed was comfortable and we were able to settle in with ease. The garden was beautiful and the neighborhood was quiet and very walkable. We would happily stay with Suellen again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very nice basement apartment, it worked great for my entire stay. Suellen was a wonderful host!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suellen’s apt is clean, quiet and private. Fully furnished kitchen (+ paper plates, napkins, oil, seasonings, etc.) Cooking is on 2 burner hot plate but it works fine. Very comfortable mattress, soothing, refreshing shower & products. Lots of restaurants, large mall & movie theater easily accessible. Stairs are a bit challenging for age 80+ folks, but manageable. Couch is not comfortable seating. Overall, our stay was great. Host is cordial & accessible."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful, relaxing retreat, full, clean, and spacious basement apartment. Could be quite independent, if that’s your desire. Host is very outgoing and we had a couple of interesting conversations about all manners of things. She was also very respectful of privacy. Beautiful, quiet area with several cool venues and restaurants."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was incredible!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Suellen was an amazing and gracious host! The art is so cool and she is. Joy to spend timeout vacation with!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Top top-notch basement efficiency with everything in a nice middle-class neighborhood. The other reviews don't lie, this is how airbnb's should be done."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Suellen is so nice everything was perfect for my stay.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best AirBNB stay ever! Suellen is a gem and a wealth of insights, stories and jokes. I needed privacy, a kitchen, good wifi and easy access to Michigan State University and Suellen's property, in a delightful historic neighborhood was perfect!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I travel often and this is the cleanest Airbnb you’ll find. Suellen exhibits pride in ownership and it’s reflected in the presentation and amenities. Small things, just like the plates and silverware being… better than the usual dollar store/mismatched sets in a typical Airbnb, more than enough towels, kitchen stocked with everything (foils, wraps, spices, utensils, etc) instead of the usual empty drawer with a burnt up hot pad and toast crumbs. You know what I’m talking about if you have ever stayed in a Airbnb while ballin on a budget.
Everything works. It doesn’t smell funny. There is a thermostat in the unit, I’ve had to call other hosts before and beg them to please come and turn the heat on because the thermostat was locked.
Unit is well set up and constructed, whereas many other Airbnb’s look like they had the local handyman as the architect and planner."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptional Host and fantastic space !! Super comfortable and had absolutely everything I needed .. Quiet and cozy .. Suellen is an absolute delight as well as a great conversationalist.. Beautiful backyard with unique art pieces.
I look forward to booking again when I’m in Lansing ."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very friendly host, most well stocked Airbnb I’ve ever been to, highly recommend for long term stays."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Suellen was extremely friendly and the place is just as described! It was private and had everything I needed - would highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a perfect place!! She was so accommodating when we had to switch plans! Such an amazing friendly host we loved staying there! Clean and comfortable! We will be back for sure, we would love to stay longer and visit more!!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Suellen's place for two months while being a Scholar at MSU. I cannot recommend this place enough. the apartment is cozy and has EVERYTHING you will ever need. When the bedside lamp stopped working I told Suellen and had a new one on the next day. The house is in a quiet, nice neighborhood, the next grocery store is a 5 min walk, the bus line 1, that connects to MSU is also a 5min walk.
But the best part was Suellen! I have never met such a warm, open, and caring person. I was impressed by her, her unique spirit, and also her artistic house. And she tells great jokes too. I was lucky to get to know her more and will be forever grateful for that."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Suellen is very warm and welcoming! She makes you feel at home. The studio was clean and quiet just as advertised. It has everything you need for a comfortable visit. The location is great as the bus stop is only a few minutes walk from the house. I really love her backyard, so artistic and interesting.
Thanks for a fabulous stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and host. Exactly what I expected and hoped. What an incredible backyard too!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suellen's place was great. You will be staying in a finished room in the basement of her house. I had the back door of her house as my private entrance. Everything was just as described. I had my own private restroom, shower, half-kitchen, sofa, tv with great cable and a comfortable bed. The neighborhood was peaceful and felt safe. Suellen's house is exactly halfway between downtown Lansing and Michigan State University. One night I took a 45 minute walk into downtown to visit the capitol building. The next night I walked 45 minutes the opposite direction to visit the many bars and restaurants in the University area. There are also ample scooters around that you can rent on an app and cruise around town on. Suellen was the best part of the whole experience! She was very friendly and we ended up having a couple long talks together. She made great local recommendations and couldn't have been more welcoming. It felt more like staying with a family member than a stranger."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed with Suellen while I did a Co-op/internship with General Motors, from January-Augist 2023. Suellen is the textbook example of what it means to be hospitable. When I first arrived, we sat down, had a conversation, and got to know each other. She then took me for a ride in her car all around town, pointing out good places to shop, and good restaurants to eat at. Suellen's home is full of charm and her backyard is beautiful. It is located in a safe, nice little neighborhood. My Lansing-native coworkers described it as a secure little nook that a lot of grandparents live in. I would agree with that. Suellen is very nice, and knowledgeable too. I would suggest that you strike up a conversation with her. She has a lot of wisdom to share! did I mention funny jokes too? I couldn't have asked for a better host. 10/10 I would recommend that you stay here."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suellen’s personal hospitality was fantastic. She was very welcoming, friendly and helpful. The place was very nice, clean and well equipped."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very nice n relaxing
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful, neat, well appointed basement apartment. Suellen is an accommodating host and can be as hands-on or hands-off as is comfortable for you. The East side is always a wonderful place to stay in Lansing; great residential neighbourhood close to great local businesses. Overall, a comfortable homestay."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place worked out perfect for my short stay!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay and it was just as cozy and clean as the last time. Tucked away in a great little neighborhood that's close to everything.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would stay here again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suellen was such an example of how to host and treat a guest. Whether her warm conversation, her superb hospitality, or the amazing space, we’ve found a place we can call home when we visit MSU as guests."

The backyard is beautiful and creative. The listing is completely accurate. The apartment was private and cozy. I will definitely be back."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"One word: wonderful! I really enjoy it.
The room is very big and it has all things we needed: Kitchen, large bed, sofa, TV, refrigerator, micro wave, individual bathroom, etc. And the room is very clean. I live very comfortable at this place.
Outside the house it is very beautiful and quiet, good place to hangout. And the public transportation is very near from the house. The bus station is only a few minutes walk from the house, if you have some friends at MSU you are able to visit them very easily.
Love it!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and well-presented basement studio. Excellent value and it was a pleasure to stay here and enjoy the beautiful garden. If you are over 6 ft, heed others’ advice that this is not the spot for you."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Suellen was very accommodating with my TV problems and brought another one to replace the broken one. Very nice host.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suellen is a very energetic host with great recommendations of food places around town! She is prompt with communication and good stories and jokes to share in person☺️
She has a beautiful backyard"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Suellen place is awesome and it is worth the price listed! Exactly the way it was described! Very great food recommendation! Suellen is a very well educated individual. If you have the time please take the time and learn a thing or two from her! Made my first experience at East Lansing the best!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"My stay at Suellen's basement apartment was comfortable. The apartment had everything one might need for a long-term stay for two from the kitchen cutlery to extra linens. Her home as a beautiful backyard, which can be great for relaxing on a beautiful day. Her house is in a good location, close to East Lansing with reliable public transit. Suellen is a warm and gracious host. She put in every effort to make my stay comfortable. Communication with her was quick and easy."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Suellen’s was great! Her space is ample, she has provided all the comforts of home, and it is clean. The location is great for getting to MSU and/or downtown."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I stayed here for 3 weeks during one of my clinical rotations and it was great! Suellen was very welcoming and prompt with communication. The apartment was very clean and stocked with kitchen essentials. There is also a lovely back yard with a peaceful area to read\ work\ relax. Overall I really enjoyed my stay and would book again!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I traveled from SC to visit my boyfriend in prison. I needed a place to stay a couple nights during my visit. The private floor downstairs was cozy and tranquil. Her space provided me a break from my children, dog, and work, so I truly felt like I was on a vacation. I’m introverted and Suellen gave me privacy. I had DoorDash delivered one night and it even snowed the day I left. I was thankful to have a pleasant first Airbnb experience."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suellen is very warm and welcoming. The room I rented was clean, private and had all the amenities I needed. She even had spices and little extras you may not think of when you’re traveling. The backyard/porch is colorful, artistic and interesting, yet serene."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Suellen is a wonderful host, and I would definitely book with her again in the future! My only comment is that if you are quite tall, the ceilings in the basement apartment might be too low for you, but I (5'5"") personally had zero issues."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It was great experience for 2 months.
She is nice host and she was a good teacher for me.
It was my first time staying United States, but she shared me lots of the informations like the best restaurants, and guided me how to go to MSU. Thank you very much, Suellen!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an awesome place to stay if it's available to book.
Location is great as you can get anywhere without it being a drive. Shops, restaurants, parks and Michigan State are minutes away.
Suellen is an awesome host. She makes feel at home and part of her family. She goes above and beyond to make sure you're taken care of.
The apartment was exactly as advertised. Very comfortable and well laid out. Basic cooking supplies are also included. The fact she provides things like coffee helps you control your food budget. That's a huge plus.
I hope to book here again in future when I need to be back in Lansing."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suellen is an amazing host! You can expect a warm stay in a prime location, minutes away from local attractions and venues. I have stayed there on 3 different occasions and it gets better every-time. It’s my favorite place to stay when I’m in town."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed in the basement apartment for about 4 months as I finished school at MSU. I thoroughly enjoyed the space and Suellen had everything I needed (pots/pans, mugs, coffee, shampoo/conditioner, etc.). Suellen is a fantastic host who wants to ensure her guests are having the best experience possible. She is a great communicator and quickly replied whenever I had a question or update. In addition to the basement, you also have access to the washer and dryer, her backyard, and parking in the driveway or street.
If you stay at her place, be sure to ask her for a joke!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay, super convenient to many places. wish I could have stayed longer. Books up fast, don't hesitate booking this place!"
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was very wonderful. Clean and stocked with everything a guest might need. Suellen (the host) is very grandmotherly which at times can be considered intrusive or rude but over all very sweet and easy to talk to.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"First time to use Airbnb. Suellen's place was very clean and full of what you needed. Suellen is a kind and gently soul that will make you feel at home. I would not hesitate to book again ""which I did"" or recommend. Book it before some else does. A true treasure in Lansing."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Suellen is very nice, welcoming and friendly. Her place is just as described, and very reasonably priced, as well as in a convenient location (we loved the El Oasis food truck down the street on Michigan Ave.!). We had a good stay there."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I'd recommend this stay. She is so nice and caring
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Suellen is wonderful - so warm and welcoming. Her basement apartment is full of little comforts to make you feel right at home, and the backyard is a dream! Bring layers if you get cold easily or are traveling in the winter - the basement can get a little chilly, but nothing unmanageable. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to stay for the whole time I had planned to due to a maintenance issue, but Suellen was so thoughtful, communicated quickly, and did everything she could to make my stay a pleasant one. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful sanctuary and great conversation!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suellen personifies hospitality, exhibited by her attention to the things a traveler may need, from a variety of cooking spices to paper clips and a pet hair roller! Above all, though, is her warm and welcoming self. Suellen gives a personal tour of the apartment and outside space, letting you know that your are to feel at home there. I highly, highly recommend!

Kitchen well-equipped for someone like me who likes to cook from scratch, with fresh foods.

I totally want to return on my next visit to Lansing area, if she's not all booked up!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Suellen's house was amazing. I'm kind of introverted and I appreciate having a separate living space during my Airbnb stays. Her basement apartment was spacious and had more than I really needed. For someone staying multiple nights, you'd be very happy (I only stayed one night). The yard is big and incredible and includes art, sculptures, and a screened in porch. I'd definitely stay again if I was passing through."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suellen is the best! One of the most personable, accommodating, and FUN AirBnB hosts we've ever had!

The apartment itself clean, cozy, private, and well-stocked with anything you might need, and the bed is super-comfortable. I was there in February, so I couldn't take advantage of the lovely porch and backyard, but I'll save that for my next trip. Finally, there's a reason Suellen is a superhost: she'll make you feel welcome, yet give you your own space -- and direct you to anything you might need or want to do anywhere around town.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Suellen was a lovely host- she’s a super host for a reason. She was accommodating in my tardy arrival and welcomed me into her home like I was an old friend. Her space was spotless and tidy. You can tell she takes pride in her home. I only regret I wasn’t able to stay longer than one night.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked this stay for my parents and, while I didn't stay the night myself, I did check in and had the privilege of meeting Suellen. She's the auntie that everyone WISHES they had and her place was so cute and centrally-located. My parent's review:
Suellen's Boulevard Retreat: 2019
As it was a brief one night stay, of all the places we have stayed, I must confess this place to be most charming and with a overwhelming eclectic positive vibe. The host that you will meet is very knowledgeable in many aspects of paleontology, culture , history and social norms as well as current events. The gift of humor and storytelling exists in this place. The garden with its whimsical aspects is absolutely perfect. Cozy accommodations in a basement apartment. Comfy pillows , clean linens and towels. I give it a 10 star rating."

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb experience with the nicest host ever!

On the next day she showed me her magical back yard and her chickens and I had a really great time talking to her! The house is in beautiful and quite surroundings and has a very good location, it’s close to MSU and grocery stores are also nearby. Check this place out if you’re going to stay in Lansing!!"

2019-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Suellen is a very open and positive person. She gave us a warm welcome and a tour of the place while introducing herself. Unfortunately, we did not stay at Suellen's basement apartment because (1) we wanted an entire place for ourself and were surprised to see that it was a room in the basement. (2) The crib was too small for our child. (3) And—as tall people—the basement, which included a fan lamp, was too low. Sadly, it was not a good fit for our family. We apologize for any inconvenience."

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Suellen is a great host - very personable and attentive to her guests. The space was exactly as described and very comfortable (for my wife and myself).

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very kind and hospitable. Warm, cozy and VERY comfortable space."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I have stayed at this location in the past. Suellen is always welcoming and her places is clean with great touches.

The apartment was very nice, sparkling clean and comfortable. Suellen provided parking in the driveway and also gave us helpful tips for our visit. We enjoyed our stay very much."
2019-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"I searched and booked what I believe was an entire place; however, to enter the apartment, which was the basement, I had to enter the main house from the back door which I was not comfortable doing. Additionally, the host had a strict curfew which could work for some. Curfew information is on the property page. I missed it and this is my fault, but I've never stayed at an ""entire place"" that imposed a curfew. I'm 30 years old, an 8-year veteran, and visiting Michigan for the weekend for an MBA student conference at Michigan State University. The host needs to clarify this is not a full apartment, but a room in the basement with a bathroom and kitchen. Overall, this is a good location; I just like my privacy and autonomy, and a curfew is ridiculous. The host seems like a nice woman."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Suellen and her AirBnB are fantastic!! Great value and everything you need in an apartment.

2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I very much enjoyed my 2-night stay with Suellen. She is a welcoming and gracious host. It's very apparent that she takes great pride in her home and her community. It is also clear that Suellen has put a lot of thought towards ""equipping"" her guests' space with everything her guests may need. For the space I stayed in, I didn't just get a private room but a complete bachelor apartment with many extras included. Suellen's place would be great for longer stays, as you have your own private space to cook in and store your food. Suellen is a joy to talk to - she's an interesting and knowledgeable person. I'd highly recommend her BnB."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,She is so nice and she supplies everything you might need while staying there.
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great, cute, old, rustic cabin. It has in-floor radiant heat which struggled to keep the cabin totally warm with the very cold temperatures we experienced, but it wasn't horrible. There were lots of blankets to snuggle up with and eventually the temperature got to where it should have been. It was awesome to have running water, bathroom, and wifi. We felt the value was great and are likely to return when we just need a place to escape from the world."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second time staying here. Would certainly do so again.

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Me a few friends stayed for MSU vs OSU football game... and had a great time in the area/town. The basement apartment had everything we needed. Clean, plenty of towels, refrigerator space, and sleeping arrangements were comfortable.
Suellen was very flexible with us on a late minute change in plans, and we’re very appreciative of her kindness. Great suggestion for Breakfast at Vine.
Walking distance to MSU campus and bars was a plus. Safe neighborhood. All great! Would definitely stay here again."
2018-11-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"The space was cozy and welcoming, with plenty of additional touches and amenities. The location is very nice and convient.
check in involved meeting with the host, which was not explicitly clear. Suellen was a lovely host, however, has expectations of her guest that are not listed. I would not recommend staying here if there is a chance you may be up later than midnight or expect for rules to be clearly laid out. This is likely a perfect place for a single person to stay."
2018-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good price.
2018-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Suellen's place! It was a great location in a cute neighborhood. Lots of shops and restaurants nearby. It was a short drive to MSU, which was perfect for my weekend conference. The apartment is nice and cozy. Suellen really makes everything easy and accessible. This was just the kind of place I needed for my trip!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Suellen really is one of a kind! We instantly felt very welcomed, enjoyed to chat with Suellen, meeting the chickens in her beautiful garden and having a closer look at her art. As for the apartment: It has everything you need and we slept very good. If you‘re looking for a place to stay in Lansing, we highly recommend staying here!"

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for something more than just a place to stay, Suellen is the perfect host for an extraordinary experience. The apartment is furnished with everything you may need during your stay, it is super clean, beautiful and spacious. It definitely reflects the significance of home to her. The added value is Suellen herself and the way she lovely hosts her guests: we had a great time with her, talking about our countries and our trip to the USA. Our best Airbnb experience so far!"

2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Suellen was great! I was running behind schedule for checking in, causing her to change her plans but it didn't phase her! She's awesome, the apartment basement was perfect and had everything we needed!
She's a very good host. She wants to make sure you have to best time while you're in town. She gives great recommendations and overall I was very satisfied! Thanks Suellen!!"

2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suellen's place is great! The space is very comfortable and set up with all of the amenities you could need and more. She also has very friendly chickens in her backyard who like to be held and eat grubs. Suellen herself is a wonderful, funny host who really goes out of her way to make sure your stay is comfortable and enjoyable. We highly recommend staying with Suellen (and her chickens) if you travel to East Lansing!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Suellen's place is amazing. she has everything you need while on the road. would go back anytime i am in Lansing
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My best recommendation for Suellen's house. Suellen was a wonderful and attentive host, the house was in a good location to go to MSU. It was really nice and very well equipped. I stayed for almost two weeks, and it was really convenient having all the cooking stuff that you don't normally get for a short stay: like oil, dressings, etc. I would love to come back and stay again at Suellen's."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is very clean and well maintained. It was a perfect rental for us. We would stay there again.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,it's so clean and all furnitures were well arranged. and rooms are nice and big that i expected. island dining table is so useful for us! i wanna stay this house if i am lansing again! and town was peaceful so i can walk around every evening.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quick access to highway and quiet place to work or relax!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our weekend stay in this unit was everything we could ask for! 4 parents with 4 small children had plenty of space to play and relax, an abundance of clean linens, a well supplied kitchen for meals,and super comfortable beds to sleep in. The house seemed recently renovated with new appliances and pristine furniture. Kevin was very professional - responding to questions before booking , and communicating instructions for check in well in advance. We were super happy with our stay and would recommend Kevin's house."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful new house , close to anything you might need."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home, thank you!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely, roomy home in pristine condition. The host was super nice. We would definitely recommend this house!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time staying in this beautiful home and my experience was even better than the first! Kevin is such an amazing and welcoming host. I was given pre-approval from Kevin to host a small family gathering (game night) and his home had everything we needed for the event. It was the perfect space for everything involved in my stay. I now plan to only stay here whenever I'm in Michigan visiting family and friends!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was wonderful! The host is great. The home is impeccable.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kevin was an amazing host and the rental was pristine, spacious, and centrally located!
We enjoyed all of the extra support our host provided to make sure we not only enjoyed our rental, but also the surrounding area. Whenever we stay in lansing area, we will be staying here!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We are regular Airbnb travelers and would rate Kevin’s place as one of the nicest, best located, and real value of all the places we have stayed. The place was very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home, and was an easy walk to all the places we wanted to visit downtown. It's also a few steps away from a mini-market which was very convenient. We really enjoyed being minutes from a handful of restaurants and cafes. Communication was great too (Kevin is SO knowledgeable about the area and the hidden gems). We would highly recommend this wonderful home!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property was great! Very comfortable and clean environment with all the necessary amenities for a short getaway. While there is tons to do in the area, this property provided everything we needed for cozy/game nights in too :)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one of the most memorable spaces I've ever stayed in. Super, super cool spot that was very well put together. Not every place that looks cool in the photos actually looks as cool up close, but this place *does*. Well done. And great host, too. Highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really special spot, especially a couple looking to take a romantic trip or just a break from everyday life. It felt thoughtfully designed to be a great Airbnb, and not just a good alternative to a hotel room but something unique and luxurious that you couldn't get at a hotel. The lighting, with interesting fixtures, placement, and a LED Hue system that has beautiful themes to pick from, lets you set the vibe and mood exactly how you want to. Bathroom, especially the shower, is fantastic. One of the best features is the design of the space which is roomy and open with enough interesting decorations and features that it doesn't feel empty. The couch is super comfortable, the bed is cozy, and the heat and A/C is powerful and quick to get you to to whatever temperature you want. The location is super convenient, close to MSU and also tons of shopping centers and restaurants and whatever you want. We've never stayed anywhere quite like this and will definitely be coming back."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely beautiful! My stay was everything I could have hoped for, my only wish was that I stayed longer. Rhett was super friendly and responsive. I look forward to staying at another property one day!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the house. The lighting was fun to play around with. Beds were comfortable, so was the couch. Bathroom is gorgeous and shower is huge. Very nice place to stay. Host was nice and quickly responded to any questions."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best of AirBnB. Second time here and hope to be back again!
Great hosts, superbly designed and thought out space with amenities that make us feel truly on vacation, even though we were only in town for a conference."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the place and all the amenities. The only thing I would I found challenging was getting the sauna working. Other than that, it was great!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love staying here! Always a relaxing time. I stay here whenever I get a chance. Rain shower and sauna alone make it worth a stay. Walkable to dinner and drinks and make sure you go to the Rooted Socialite if you like tea or kava!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,truly enjoyed the spa bathroom! sauna was rejuvenating and rain shower refreshing.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb left me absolutely speechless. It’s was everything Rhett said it would be and more. After driving 22 hours straight for a girls trip to hang with long distance friends. We made it to this stunning home! I normally struggle getting settled into new places due to anxiety but I didn’t have any issues here. I felt right at home! The space was clean! And perfectly set up for our arrival. Rhett was spot on with communication anytime we needed anything. The shower was to die for! Super relaxing! All the photos I took with my friends in this space came out amazing. The coffee machine was just wow!(kinda bought the same one after my trip! lol) I honestly can’t complain about anything! The hosts were fantastic and the space was perfect! I will definitely be coming back in the future!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, fun, comfy."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was such a vibe my friends and I loved the place Rhett was such a great host id be happy to stay again in the future.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Immersing in this penthouse was a revelation in luxury. The spa-like bathroom, especially the rain shower, offered an unmatched relaxation experience, transforming every moment into a retreat. The decision to expand the bathroom to include an infrared sauna was genius, creating a haven of tranquility. Comfortable queen beds and the infusion of technology, like the 85” vertical TV and Philips Hue lights, added layers of enjoyment to our stay. Yet, what sets this place apart is the anticipation of a friendly game of Spades with the host. Having not yet had the chance to challenge the host, it stands as a playful promise for my next visit. Looking forward to returning, Spades in hand, ready for a match that’s been long anticipated. This isn't just a stay; it's a luxury experience that beckons you back for the ambiance and the unfinished games."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was extremely amazing & comfortable. I love that they provide some games for you as well. That was a cute touch! The bathroom was spacious & cute. The lights to the entire house was controlled by an iPad & we got to change it up how we wanted. There is nothing bad I can say about our stay. My friends & I all enjoyed it & felt at home. We will recommend this place to everyone & will definitely book again!💕
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place! True to the photos. Would book again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean. Very unique, especially the fancy lighting!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very relaxing, creative space. I took full advantage of the infrared sauna and rain shower."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I am a local and I will be booking this listing time and time again for staycations. It was absolutely perfect and I’m already looking forward to coming back.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was beautiful again. The shower is to die for!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This AirBnB was spectacular with its modern coziness. The owner, Rhett, was very responsive throughout our stay. We had no issues during our stay and our entire group was impressed with how much the photos resembled what we walked into. Our group expressed how much they would want to come back to say in the same AirBnB or checkout what other AirBnB locations they have. This AirBnB location was close to any desired activity anyone would want to explore. The slight downfall was the price for one night. If it wasn’t for a group splitting the cost we wouldn’t have been able to experience this wonderful property. We aren’t from Michigan so maybe it is a reasonable nightly rate for a place in downtown Lansing. Overall, our group is in agreement that this is a place worth staying."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,amazon! 10/10
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family absolutely loved this home! The lights, the sauna, the shower and tvs were all amazing. The place definitely looks just like the pictures! The only thing I did not expect was the 6-8 stairs in the kitchen that led to the back door and basement. I brought a 1 year old that loves to run the house so her falling was a little worrisome. The local coffee shops and restaurants are delicious!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was very pleasant.The host answered all our questions on time and was always available to help.
The house has smart technology that operates the lights, which my teen daughters really enjoyed using. It had a nice little kitchen with all the amenities if needed to make something. Everything was well organized, clean, and cozy. Being able to relax in the sauna and shower under the large rain shower head was amazing after having to drive for three and a half hours. My daughters called dibs on the bedroom so my husband and I took the Murphy bed in the Living room. All of us had a great night. We slept comfortably and warm. We will definitely stay here again when we are in Michigan!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place. Coolest host. Without a doubt the best Airbnb in Lansing. So much thought put into the space. Just book it already.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved the place! The lighting, the bed, the bathroom, the massage gun! All of it made a romantic birthday night for my girlfriend a breeze and we both loved it."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rhett’s place was great! He had amenities outside of what was listed like name brand shampoo, conditioner, and body wash! There were even Q-tips in the bathroom for convenience. The nepresso maker and pods are a very nice addition and gave an upscale touch to the already great environment. This is a beautiful house and the features such as a the Phillips Hue lights, sauna, waterfall shower, many board games, TV’s, and comfortable beds/furniture are upgrades worth the price. Rhett was very proactive in instruction and the stay was clean and comfortable. I would stay here again! Checkout instructions were also very simplistic and did not require much effort on the guests behalf which I know is the preference of some Airbnb users."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is absolutely gorgeous! Clean and gorgeous space. The shower!! Perfection! Comfy bed.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very fun/unique spot! The space definitely had a “wow” factor; it wasn’t just somewhere to drop your bags before going out. The lighting and furniture and shower and nespresso and sauna were all really cool. More important, Rhett was a great, responsive, easy-going host who didn’t ruin the experience with a million rules. 10/10."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I recently had the pleasure of staying at Rhett's Airbnb, and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Despite the disappointment of our concert being postponed due to bad weather, Rhett's hospitality and the comfort of his place made our stay truly enjoyable.
The Airbnb itself was absolutely lovely. The cozy and stylishly decorated space instantly made us feel relaxed and at ease. The amenities provided were top-notch, from the comfortable bed and plush linens to the well-equipped kitchenette. We appreciated the attention to detail, as every aspect of the accommodation was thoughtfully arranged to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
Despite the change of plans with the concert, Rhett's Airbnb served as a wonderful retreat for us. We found ourselves enjoying the peacefulness of the surroundings. Overall, our stay at Rhett's Airbnb exceeded our expectations. We highly recommend Rhett's Airbnb to anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable getaway."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A fabulous, quirky place to stay in Lansing- I will definitely remember this place."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very nice. It was more about the lighting than anything else. it would have been more helpful to having little things that would be more helpful. Like a night stand beside the Murphy bed. See, you didn't have to put your phone or anything else on the floor. a bench in the bathroom or chair. So that way you have some place to sit while you're drying off or getting dressed. little packets of Sugar or Creamer with the coffee instead of the spices that don't get used. It was very confusing trying to run the TV's because you had 2 of them back to back and control worked for both of them. So you had to have both of them running. the beds were very comfortable and the pillows were soft. Being the first time renter had no clue about going online for the guest book thing. i had no ideal what was expected of me at checkout. had no clue of restaurants that delivered In the area. Feel that it would have been better to have gone to a hotel"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,had a great time! the place was amazing and Rhett did a great job responding to us!

Rhett was very reliable if I needed anything. The house was amazing the L.E.D. lights in the house looked cool. The neighborhood was quite and it was easy to go to sleep. The house was also very clean. I would recommend this airbnb if you want to see Lansing and to stay at a nice house instead of a hotel."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I found Rhett’s listing relatively last minute to visit my alma matter this past weekend. It was an incredible listing and will absolutely rebook the next time I’m in town. The listing was about 5-10 minutes from campus and very peaceful at night. Rhett was incredibly responsive and was very accommodating when we asked to check in a bit early. Thank you for a great experience back!

We laughed at all the technology we didn't (try very hard to) use, but we slept great- nice mattresses. The only thing we wished for was more blankets while we played games. Squeaky clean and lovely place, thanks!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a very nicely furnished house with everything you need. 10/10!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My only regret is that we didn’t stay longer, but we’ll definitely look to book with Rhett when we travel through Lansing next! A chain hotel with similar amenities would have cost twice as much. Even with a short notice booking, Rhett provided all the information we needed for a hassle free check in and stay."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very nice bathroom. The space was very clean but there was a bit of a musty smell. It was a minor thing but it did make the space feel stuffy.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place definitely recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rhett’s rental was the perfect home for our visit to Lansing. It felt like you stepped into an oasis. Beautiful bathroom, kitchen, and living area. The home was kept very clean with all the amenities needed to relax, cook dinner, and shower. We appreciated the attention to detail and the quick responses to all our questions! Thank you for allowing us to stay at your place Rhett and Kendal!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place! It’s exactly as described but even pictures don’t do it justice. They really put a lot of work into the house and it shows. Plus, that shower and sauna 😍"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The house was very nice and futuristic. They cleanliness wasn’t on point too. The host was very responsive and helpful when need be. Although the place was smaller then expected it was still a cozy and clean place.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at this house! Perfect location!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best places i have ever stayed on vacation. As soon as you step in you are at peace. From the lights, to the fireplace, the floating bed, the rainfall shower and the sauna were
some of the reasons why the hardest part of the vacation was having to leave, but I know I'll be back. Would recommend to anyone traveling near the lansing area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It felt brand new, loved the sauna and rainforest shower!! Great size bathroom! All the extra amenities just made our trip better! Loved the meditation wall, so relaxing listening to the water wave sounds. The colored hue lighting throughout the house was so cool! Very nice kitchen, had everything we needed and the place was so clean. Also, it is so close to so many things! Nespresso machine was great, but Strange Matter coffee right around the corner was great to have also! We did not do it this trip, but we also know there is an escape room a few blocks down as well! Thanks again for letting us stay! We will reach back out next time we are in the area ;-)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is so modern and cool, such a good find. I didn’t think I would use the lighting system much but it was so awesome once I started changing the settings on the tablet! Will definitely be staying here again."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, we showed up early on accident and got to meet Rhett. 😃Quiet and lovely space. Thanks again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An amazing experience won’t be disappointed! We’ve stayed at all 3 of Rhett’s rentals now and they each have been a truly unique and unforgettable experience! Would definitely recommend this place!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kendall and Rhett’s house was the best place to choose for hour four day trip away from the city. The whole time we were there it felt as if we were at the spa the entire time. The house has such a wonderful vibe and overall atmosphere that brings so much peace and tranquility. I would say it’s the best place to truly relax for a few days and reset.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay. Definitely a nice experience and would highly recommend. Host was proactive and provided ammenities that were above expectations.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An absolutely wonderful home! I can't recommend it highly enough, it was a pleasure to stay here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband, 8 month son, & I decided to take a quick trip after a long weekend partying at a Quinceañera. I came across Rhett’s place & thought it’d be perfect to unwind & relax—it was, indeed! The lighting made it feel so relaxing for us, but especially our son lol. He loved the rain shower with the “Cancun” lighting. My husband & I loved the sauna! We put our son to bed & enjoyed our time in the three-seasons room, sauna, the rain shower, & joined our son for bedtime. My husband was originally going to let my son & I take the bed in the bedroom while he took the pullout bed in the main area; however, after laying quickly on the bed in the master bedroom, he decided to join us as the bed felt like a cloud! My son slept for almost 14 hours (he really needed to catch up on some sleep). I also needed to catch up on some work & the meditation section was wonders for our son who usually has trouble with naps if it means not snuggling with mama. Thanks for a relaxing experience Rhett! :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful little gem. Spa feeling was the perfect respite after a day of long travel. The sauna and comfortable beds were perfect and the attention to detail was excellent. Highly recommend.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place to stay, super clean and worth the price!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved staying at this home! the lights throughout the house are a fun touch! Coffee was a nice sunrise and the shower is amazing!! Will stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was super beautiful and had a modern design. And looks exactly like the pictures. I would totally stay their again. Plus very affordable!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were so lucky to see this place pop-up while searching for a last minute getaway rental in the Lansing area. This place is so cool! Everything matched the description. We had planned to go out, but decided to stay in and play games since the atmosphere was too awesome to waste our time anywhere else! Rhett was a great communicator and definitely puts lots of thought and intention into making this rental a phenomenal experience."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place felt like I was at home
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time here!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a hidden gem! Everything was spotless and the features and amenities are amazing. I would highly recommend and will stay there again when visiting my daughter in Lansing.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed every minute of my stay here, beautiful property in a great location. Fell in love with a restaurant down the street that specializes in soups the last few days, very close to Potter Zoo as well along with other public spaces like big parks. Will be coming back hopefully some time soon!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where should I begin? Rhett was absolutely amazing. great attitude, very accommodating, and goes above and beyond for you! can't say enough about him! I highly recommend staying here!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Rhett's place was great for our group's one night stay. it was certainly a rare find and we were lucky to have it available for us when we needed it. They have put grea thought behind designing the space and I recommend experiencing it to anyone who gets a chance to.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the coolest and impressive places I have ever stayed at. The decorating and extra touches of the house made it really stand out from tablet control lighting through out the whole house (even a strip of lighting on the floor), the double sided TVs to watch from the bed and the couch, the super cool meditation area, to the Nespresso machine! The beds were super comfortable and the house had all the amenities that I needed! Rhett and Kendall were amazing hosts and I can't wait to stay here again!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rhett and Kendall’s place represents the best of AirbNb. A truly unique and luxurious gem you wouldn’t find at a hotel, filled with well thought out touches from the hosts. The pictures are great but do not do this justice. A truly memorable get-away."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I guess the 10 year anniversary is the Airbnb anniversary.
A few years ago, our goal was to go to Hawaii for our 10 year anniversary. Unfortunately, buying our forever home changed those plans. We still wanted to go somewhere, but we had to do it on a budget. That’s when we took a risk on an Airbnb in downtown Lansing.
As soon as we walked in the door, we weren’t in Lansing anymore. The sound-proof walls eliminated city noise and the sauna melted away the stress. It was cheaper than a night at a standard hotel. The best part was, it was not the owners primary residence. It really felt like our own private getaway. We will definitely be booking another night at LNSNG LXRY 3 soon, unless we want to check out their other properties in the Lansing area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rhett's listings provide the perfect escape from the busy pace of everyday life. As someone who frequently visits Lansing for work, I can always rely on Rhett's accommodations to offer a serene and inviting home away from home. With features like rain showers, saunas, and customizable LED lights, I know that no matter what the day brings, I can unwind and rejuvenate in one of their three fantastic offerings. It's truly a mood-enhancing experience that leaves me feeling refreshed and ready for anything."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the creative touch that went into the decor and design of this place. It was one of the more fun locations I’ve stayed in.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean property. Lots of amenities. Can control lights to whole house for color themes. Great for couples or anyone looking for a relaxing place to stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is absolutely incredible. Had a great nights sleep and the vibe is awesome. This place is the best!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Leigh and Van were very responsive to our questions and our stay was very comfortable. The back yard and back deck were great. We had our dog and sat in the back and it was great. Neighbors were friendly and quiet, relaxing neighborhood. We enjoyed our stay and will stay with them again when we’re in Lansing."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very well-appointed, clean house! I stayed here with 3 friends. The 3 bedrooms were perfect. There are Roku TVs in every room with free HDMI inputs. The washer/dryer and coffee machine were a huge help. Check in was super easy with a smart lock. Location is nice and quiet - plenty of parking, walkable to Old Town. Hosts were responsive too. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Check in was easy... the house was beautiful 😍 Van & Leigh answered me immediately when I reached out with a question... will stay with them again if the need arises...

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and clean home! We loved staying there! I appreciated the responsiveness! Great hosts!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A great property for our family stay! Hosts were very nice to deal with, and proactive before and after the rental. We will definitely look for this property on our next visit."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,from the moment that I made the reservation and realize I made a mistake in Booking the days that I did I could have been charged for cancellation fee but instead they accommodated my mistake and gave me the correct dates I needed the home is very clean and it's been renovated in the last couple months so everything is new the beds are comfortable having a washer and dryer in the unit was awesome and it actually felt like home instead of away from home we plan on using these host again hopefully for longer stays in a smaller more suitable unit for us and I highly recommend them and I'm sure other units are as nice as this one
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was pristinely clean and beds were comfy. It covered everything we needed, and the hosts were super quick to respond when we had a minor issue with the heat.
I only have two things to say to suggest to make it even better: 1) some throw pillows and a throw blanket or two would make the living room more comfy, and 2) all of the laminated signs everywhere with rules, especially one on the fridge guilting people into 5 star ratings, made it feel much less home-y/cozy and more like you were staying at a mean relative’s house. I stay in a LOT of airbnbs and I think of myself as an exceptionally considerate guest, and I’ve never seen this much communication posted around a house about rules. It kind of made me feel like I was walking on eggshells the whole time. That said, the 5 star rating was deserved, and I’d stay there again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's a great space!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean home with lots of space! Written instructions were very clear and easy to follow, and the hosts were very considerate."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We recently stayed at this Airbnb while in town for a show at Wharton. What a cool spot it was. We altered our evening and morning plans to spend more time in the loft. It was very clean, the atmosphere was great. We got plenty of ideas to decorate our home from this beautiful place.
Thank you!
We will be returning!
Go Green!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Aura’s loft was beautiful (loved the plants, exposed brick, natural light, comfortable bed, and thoughtful touches!) and it was in the perfect location for exploring Old Town. Aura was very communicative and gave excellent detail on how to check-in, where to park, etc. I would definitely stay again next time I’m in Lansing. Thanks for a great stay, Aura!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Have stayed with Aura a few times and will stay with her again on future trips to Lansing. just and excellent host and lovely spaces.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a lovely time staying again and will always book one of Aura’s AirBnB’s in the future
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a really beautiful space. I wish our visit was longer and we could have enjoyed it for a few more days.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved staying in this beautiful space. It felt like stepping into a magazine the space was so well put together and every detail was considered for the perfect staycation!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Aura was very hospitable even though we booked last minute! Very impressed with the plant life and decor throughout
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved the cleanliness, convenience and peaceful vibes of this beautiful loft! We were attending a conference at the Lansing Center and were able to walk there via the river path right behind the building which was a nice surprise."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely fantastic time at this charming Airbnb! From the moment we arrived, we were enveloped in a cozy atmosphere that made it feel like our own little sanctuary. The space was beautifully curated, providing the perfect backdrop for us to unwind and truly connect with each other. It was such a relief to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life and spend quality time together in such a homey environment. We're incredibly thankful for the opportunity to stay here and create lasting memories together. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a peaceful getaway!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could give more than five stars! I’ve stayed at many short term rentals, and this is my favorite. Amazing location - great view of downtown and the capital, well-appointed with so much attention to detail, and a gracious host. I will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was great. Very welcoming and comfortable. Great location, walkable to some shops & restaurants. Great for an overnight or weekend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You can't find a better apartment to experience Old Town Lansing then this place. The flat was extremely clean, cozy, and Aura's response time was extremely fast if I had any questions. Couldn't recommend this place more!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We've stayed at quite a few Airbnbs over the years, but I'd have to say Auras is probably my favorite. Talk about a hidden gem! We were traveling for my daughter's gymnastics competition, so we didn't get to stay very long, but walking into such a clean, beautiful, and inviting atmosphere after such a long drive, was EXACTLY what our family needed. We will definitely be staying again if we're ever back in the area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Happy to have stumbled onto such a nice place, for a last second trip this easily ended up being one of the better AirBNB’s I have booked!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This loft is absolutely beautiful! Looks exactly like the photos. All of the home furnishings, beds, blankets, appliances, dishes, etc were all wonderful quality. So many things available for guests to use in the kitchen and living room space."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Immaculate loft-style 2 bedroom apartment that is well furnished, spotless, modern and the hundreds of little touches (kitchen staples, toiletries, bedroom furnishings, etc.) that show you that the host truly cares about delivering a top-notch experience. Comms with Aura were responsive, useful and helpful. Check-in and out was a breeze, internet was great for work video conferences and kitchen was well equipped, perfect for making dinner vs. going out to eat each night. Location in Old Town is perfect, coffee, bars, restaurants all within walking distance and parking was affordable, safe and readily available.
Traffic noise in the bedrooms is present, but Aura gives you ear plugs and white noise machines that help greatly.
Highly recommend this place, easily one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed at, when in Lansing I will stay here again without hesitation. 10/10!!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,awesome place

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a quaint and peaceful getaway for my fiancé and I. A very clean and beautiful place. Very unique and inviting.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Aura’s place is absolutely gorgeous! Beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, with thoughtful amenities. Cozy furniture for relaxing and reading and comfortable beds. She even left out bowls and a bed for our pups! Speaking of pups, the location is right on the riverwalk so our dogs had fun walks every day. We didn’t do any cooking due to our plans, but the kitchen was fully stocked if we had wanted to. We had one question that Aura easily resolved within 10 minutes. 100/10 would definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Aura was such a lovely host! The space was beautiful with such thoughtful amenities! What a treat!!! Thank you!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a marvelous time at Aura's place. The apartment is so stylish and well-appointed. It was an inspiring environment with a lot of natural light and delightful aesthetic choices. We loved taking walks on the river trail, and the Old Town neighborhood is wonderful to explore. It was great seeing the strawberry mural right out the bedroom window :) Overall, we had a great time both inside and outside of this apartment during our stay in Lansing!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The loft was a great place to stay. It was very clean and comfortable. The location in Old Town is great and was a short walk to many restaurants and the river walk. Aura was nice enough to allow us an early check-in. Highly recommend booking.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Aura’s place is so beautiful , it has everything you would want or need in a stay ! The loft treehouse was luxury and a great time being nestled in the heart of Old Town Lansing!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND ❤️"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Words do not give justice to the beauty of the accommodations. We felt very comfortable and we appreciated all the 'extras'!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Aura’s place was AMAZING! It was so beautiful inside and well-decorated! Old Towne was not a super big area to hang out at, but it was just enough and everything was walking distance. The only thing is there are a lot of stairs because it is a loft apartment, but the views are beautiful!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location. Beautiful Airbnb would definitely recommend it. Felt like home. Very well stocked with goodies and the accessories to use while going on the town.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay and great location. Really enjoyed the stocked alcohol as well as the nearby stores/restaurants.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you want to be in Lansing or surrounding areas this is the place to stay!
The loft smelled amazing and was clearly cleaned well. Aura left snacks, drinks(both alcoholic and nonalcoholic), linens, perfumes, colognes, and needed kitchen or bathroom supplies. The patio was awesome and I wish we had come during a time in which I could enjoy that space more!
Overall this is the best place to stay and there is so much to do within walking distance."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great for an overnight stay! Great restaurants within walking distance, great view of the area, and comfortable space. The rooms were brightly lit from the street lights, but easily resolved by closing blinds. Wasn't particularly loyd when we were there, but noise machines were a nice touch. No interaction with the host necessary, which was nice, but still presented a personalized welcome. Some muffins were left for us by the host, which were amazingly good. Would stay again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Aura was simply the best! She left lots of goodies and snacks for us all included. The loft was spotless and clean with extra blankets and pillows. The decorating was so beautiful and unique! I can’t say enough great things about our time there and the space.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, peaceful loft. The space is curated to provide a clean, relaxing feel and that it did. It was one of the most thought out, relaxing airbnbs. Mindfully decorated. The provisions provided in the kitchen and bar were fun, unexpected, and great touches. The bathroom also had lovely products and perfumes. From the candles to the drinking glasses to the shower products - $$$ quality - which isn’t typical in airbnbs. You can find most of the dishes, decor, products at her store down the street. Which was kind of fun! We all purchased something we loved from our stay. The area of lansing is perfect too. We enjoyed the restaurants, river walk, and shops. The riverwalk was right behind the loft. The restaurants and shops all <1min walk away. The restaurants and cocktail places were cool but not rowdy. The street was actually quiet at night so sleep was sound. Bed was soooo luxurious! We all said we could just stay in bed all day haha! One day in and I was trying to find reasons to plan a trip back. Perfect little location for a recharge."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is absolutely perfect! Absolutely no complaints, it’s gorgeous."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I've had lots of experience with Airbnb's and usually there are a few things that make the experience ok, but less than ideal. This was absolutely not the case with this stay. Everything was fantastic about the space, beautifully furnished, lots of extra little touches to make the stay extra nice and welcoming. Really really well done and very well appointed. You should be commended for hosting so well. Well done Aura!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This loft was such a fun place to stay! Aura was very accommodating and provided a wonderful experience.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A cute loft in a wonderful area. Lots of cute shops and places to see during the day. The perfect spot for a night away. The host was very responsive to questions. The loft was warm and inviting, with many personal touches for a girls-night away."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Honestly, one of the best AirBnBs I have ever stayed in! The place was beautiful, clean, and awesomely decorated. But it is the amenities that blew me away. There was eggs in the fridge, bubbly water, adult drinks (so many really cool ones!), spices, oatmeal, and so much more.
The only drawback is knowing this wasn't my house!
I think my husband and I will come back to Lansing to get away and stay here again!
Thank you for the amazing night!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Truly cannot say enough about, The City Treehouse! Just wow! Aura thought of everything you could ever imagine and more! Her space is extremely clean and designed with love and soul. Aura provides the complete luxury experience with amazing “gifts” and amenities. We found it hard to leave the space to explore the area! Aura is truly one of the best. The location is perfect, including available parking and scenery. Check in was seamless and communication was easy!
We really fell extremely lucky to have found this amazing space. From the moment you enter, the vibe is magical. We have already planned our trip back in the spring.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Treehouse was just amazing. Aura has thought of everything-- so many unexpected touches! My favorite was the variety of perfumes from her shop to try. Every detail, from the decor to plants to the glassware in the cabinets has been carefully considered. I was inspired to come home and try to incorporate some of her ideas into my space. Oh, and the beds-- so plush and comfortable! Thank you again"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I were driving through Lansing to get to Chicago. We found this spot and immediately felt a sense of comfort with Eric’s hospitality and friendliness. He was super helpful with a package delivered to his place as well. Eric was clear on instructions and even messaged us to make sure we had an easy check in after our long drive! Place was fully stocked with so many small things that helped us feel at home. We’d really love to come back and explore Lansing some day! Thanks again for everything Eric! We so recommend your cozy spot to others.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eric was a wonderful host, very repsonsive, helpful, and friendly. The space was very cozy and clean and we loved that the river trail was just a few steps away! Location was central and very easy to get to different parts of town. Thank you, Eric!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I couldn't ask for a more welcoming stay than the one I had here. Eric considered everything that anyone could need, and put a visible effort forth to provide a clean and comfortable environment. Truly a no-BS host, he reached out to me without hesitation and told me anything I needed to know before I had to ask. I do hope that I end up in Lansing again, and if that happens, I will be staying here again without question."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was an amazing cozy place where to stay. The accommodations were spotless, beautifully decorated and incredibly comfortable. Eric’s attention to detail was evident in every aspect, from the amenities provided to the personalized touches throughout the space. Moreover, communication with Eric was seamless, making it easy to check in and out. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone who wants a wonderful stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Eric was a very responsive host. For the space being a smaller space, Eric still thought of many things to include to make the space homey and comfortable. Eric's place is also pet friendly so I was able to bring my dog with me. We loved the walks on the river trail which is right near by. I would definitely reserve again."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place! We loved it!
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"During my stay here, I was woken up in the middle of the night to 3-4 people walking up the outside front steps and proceeding to hang out on the porch area immediately outside the entrance to the unit. They were talking, turning on porch lights, sitting on the porch furniture, and standing directly outside the unit from about 2:30am until 4am (until it seems they went inside the unit next door). As other reviewers have mentioned, the walls are quite thin and this group of people hanging out *directly* outside the entrance was disruptive and very disconcerting, to say the least. I did make the owner aware of the situation.
In addition, earlier in the night, I was woken up to the sound of people talking on the phone (I could hear every single thing both people were saying through the walls). Also, just to be aware, there was no shampoo or body wash, and the water from the bathroom faucet is literally barely more than a trickle."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay and easy to communicate with the host! Close to everything that we needed to be close to.
Only had one minor issue with the lock to get in. It was dying when we arrived so at night when we returned we didn’t want to leave again because we didn’t know if the door would lock and the next morning it actually was completely dead upon checkout.
But that’s a battery issue, and overall the place was fantastic. Loved the view and thought that the bed was seriously the most comfortable ever lol.
Thank you so much! Would highly recommend this location."

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice place for a weekend stay. Location is close to downtown and seemed safe. Walls were paper thin and I could hear entire conversations and other things from next door. Would have given all stars, but didn’t have microwave or stove so made it hard to heat up or cook food. There is a little toaster over, that I couldn’t get to work, with 2 hot plates on the top. That worked in a pinch."

Parking is free but is behind the address of the property in a church parking lot. That said, once you figure that out, it was very easy to park.
It was walking distance to downtown. I particularly enjoyed Midtown Brewing Company’s pretzel burger. Best burger in a long time!
Thanks, Scott."

The parking situation also isn't great. I was told to park in the neighboring church parking lot that had towing signs. The host wouldn't guaranteevmy car wouldn't get towed because they didn't want to take responsibility in case that happened. The apt isnt walking distance to anything either.
The good things were that it was clean and there was lots of coffee."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place to stay so close to downtown. Great neighborhood - a few blocks from downtown/capitol building and a few more to the Riverwalk trail. Not sure if downtown Lansing is always so quiet on the weekends or if it was because of Labor Day weekend, but it was like a ghost town, but very pleasant to walk around freely. The Riverwalk is great and it's nice to be in walking distance. The room itself was perfect for us. Comfortable bed, nice couch and TV area, kitchen has what you need. Nice little terrace with a table and chairs. Great shower pressure and plenty of hot water. Price is comparable to a simple hotel room, but this is a much nicer option."

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great location !!! The capital building at night looks so cool, the community garden is awesome and the host is helpful and is always on hand. The a/c unit didn’t keep us cool enough on the hot summer nights but it was overall a good stay!"

2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a nice, small apartment in a good location if you need to do something at the Capitol building. When we were there, the neighborhood was pretty desolate (due to covid?), and restaurants were a hike away. But on the positive side, it's quiet, the small balcony and community garden right outside add a great vibe, and Gloria is a lovely host. All new interior, nice finishings, good hot water and wifi. This place is the size of a large hotel room with kitchenette and is better set up for 2 than 3 people."

I was visiting my Spartan son for the weekend and we were just looking for a place to sort of hibernate for a couple nights. This was perfect. It was uber comfortable without being obnoxious. The place isn't huge, but makes use of the space it has. Two of us were definitely fibe, as I had the master bedroom and my son the comfortable Murphy bed. we enjoyed relaxing on a comfy couch, watching movies, and yes ... the local on tap beer in the place was pretty good, and appreciated! Thanks for a great stay. Maybe the next stay with my wife."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully renovated space. Host was extremely responsive with any question I had. The condo we stayed in was amazing…. however, due to it being on the first floor, there was a lot of noise heard from the condo above. Don’t let that deter you. Just bring some air plugs or an extra sound machine. We stayed here for the Michigan State game, and the space was so great, only 12 minute drive to the campus. Easy to find an Uber. also, compared to a hotel… It was superior."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We were visiting our sun at MSU. We found that apartment on the lake. It was sooo good. Peaceful and quiet. Great view. Near a park for a stroll. The apartment was high tech. The bed was so comfortable. Bathroom tub and shower are amazing.

Very lux vibe, the bathroom is everything!!!! I didn’t want to leave. The bed was very comfortable. It’s a very high tech space from TV to shower but we got things figured out.

Keyframe was also very responsive to any concerns or questions that I had, they even left a chocolate congratulating us on our anniversary! We will definitely be coming to stay again!"

The kitchen had everything, including a coffee maker that was plumbed for water. Everything is hi-tech here, which for a gadget person was wonderful. Only issue was the number of remotes needed to manage everything. Very relaxing!"

It is a newly remodeled unit and the owners have spared no expense or missed any details. For those that love high tech - this is the place for you. Even the toaster is touchscreen. 😳
Amazing, amazing! Can’t wait to be back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing Space!!
Local couple just looking for a get away weekend after our wedding. The space was spotless and all the amenities made it a fun experience. The staff made this a really special trip with the responsiveness, how easy to work with they were, and customer service.

The set-up is super hi-tech and everything is brand new. The view from the balcony is even better on the 1st floor as the city removed the fence to the lake. The host is very responsive and generous. We are fully recharged and recuperated after 2 weeks. Thank you."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I want to thank Van & Leigh for their hospitality. I had a negative review on Arbnb from a situation that was not caused by me but the people who stayed with me. They were not going to allow me to stay because of that at first. I then explained the situation and out of the graciousness of their hearts they gave me a chance to prove that I'm not that review. I've been going through a really tough time and really needed a place to decompress and just have some me time. Staying at their place, which is amazing, gave me that time I needed to reset and refresh. The apartment is exactly what the pictures represent. It has a very home feeling, check in was incredibly easy and I loved the space provided. Thank you so much for giving me a chance to prove myself, I'm very grateful! When I need another home away from home overnight, that's still very close to my family, I'll book with them again for sure. I highly recommend any of their places to stay!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This one-bedroom unit is on the first floor of a small apartment building with well-lit parking in the back lot. Easy access with keyless entry to the building and unit. Living room with comfortable couch and large TV faces the street. Clean and clutter-free kitchen with small table for eating. A good size bathroom with OK shower pressure. Very comfortable queen bed! The unit was warm when I arrived, and the window AC was quick and effective to cool down the place. If you're visiting Lansing, I strongly recommend this place. I'm really glad that Van and Leigh accepted my last-minute reservation."

The grounds were well maintained and it’s a beautiful brick building. Parking was sufficient and always available. My partner and I then easily got inside by following the very clear instructions given by hosts to check in. The inside is exactly as seen in photos and description. It was also no surprise at all how clean the unit was and felt like “home”. During the stay we had absolutely no issues and the neighborhood is safe. Lastly, we were lucky enough to run into the host while leaving. She was very approachable and so kind. Overall I would recommend this property and give it a 5/5."

The apt had beautiful wood floors. We’ll stay on the 2nd floor next time as we had a heavy person staying above us, but really that was not a big deal.
My son worked remotely 2 days and the internet was very strong and he had a nice desk in the living room.
Van & Leigh are great hosts and the apartment was exactly what we expected. We will definitely return."

It's located in a lovely and quiet neighborhood, and I appreciated Van's suggested running route down to the river!"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed at this location several times and in every season!
I highly recommend this place, especially APT #3. 4 steps up from the side entry door, 10 more steps door and you are inside the perfect apartment.
We stayed 4 nights during Thanksgiving. We had a few inches of snow, then freezing rain our last night. It was plowed and salted early in the morning, so we could easily pack the car and leave.
As always, it was impeccably clean and well stocked with all of the essentials. Even those you might have forgotten.
You can easily get to the Capital, Lansing, East Lansing and DeWitt. There is a Quality Dairy and Rite-Aid close by.
It is safe, well lit and convenient off-street parking in the back.
Last, the owners are very responsive to messages. Often, within 5 minutes."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hands down my favorite Airbnb I have stayed in so far! Van and Leigh were very helpful and had everything set up extremely efficiently.
2021-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"There were certain things I found unpleasant about my stay and the apartment (i.e. hearing the footsteps and conversations of upstairs neighbors; being advised not to turn the thermostat past 72 degrees, limiting towel use, etc.). This may not be dealbreakers for others; but they are for me given the per night price I paid. I expected a lot more and nicer accommodations. The bathroom/shower were very clean however which I appreciated."

2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Van and Leigh were very thorough and timely communicators. When we got there we had no trouble getting in. And they had everything we needed and everything was clean. However the walls were very thin you could hear people going in and out of the building with an echo. They made sure we were not throwing any parties when we first spoke because the noise traveled, but I didn’t expect the walls to be that thin. Since it was a quiet building it didn’t bother us much. We just felt like we had to be very quiet like more than a usual apartment. But I really loved the location and charm of this place our family had a great stay."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. Extremely clean! Definitely would go back.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rented a place near us for my mom so she could visit from out of town and still social distance. The hosts got back quick, gave clear instructions and the place great, especially for the price. Felt really comfortable having her stay here.
Her review: The apartment was comfortable and homey, immaculately clean, supplied with everything I might need. I especially liked the bowl of items that are often forgotten.

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Neat and cozy place. I love it.
2019-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Ok
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is perfect if you are visiting Lansing. It is a short walk to downtown (State Capital and bars). The place itself is very well decorated, with a large living room tv (with cable). They also included amenities in case you forgot something, just like a hotel. Parking was super easy and right behind the house but like she mentions in the instructions try to bring only one car because there is minimal street and garage parking.
We visited Lansing Brewing Company while we were here and loved it. The pizza and chicken & waffles were amazing, plus great beer. Also, walking along the river is pretty and the state capitol is nice to see, but note going inside is closed on Sunday. The city was beginning to put up what appeared to be the city christmas tree when we were here in October.
We would definitely come back here. Great price and great place."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very charming apartment and the hosts have gone the extra mile with thoughtful touches to make you feel welcomed and at home. It is an older building, so sound does carry from other apartments, but it was not a major detractor for me. I would definitely stay here again."
2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"good host, prime location, and excellent value."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very nice place! Loved the historic decor and the effort put into restoration, etc. Everything was as described, clean interior, very good communication with the host. It's also within walking distance of the capital building/downtown as well as several parks, restaurants, bars, etc. if you're feeling adventurous. The neighborhood itself is quiet, we felt very much at home. Would stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay. At work perfectly for our visit with the family.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A cozy spot! The host was responsive and even had some light breakfast items available for our stay. Would definitely stay again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved Kathryn's place. It was so peaceful and relaxing. It was exactly as described. The list of recommended restaurants and grocery storea was great. Kathryn gets a AAA+ for great and speedy communication.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay here. Always a nice time and plenty of hospitality. This is an old house with tons of character inside. Take time to look around. Lots of books, games and local recommendations to enjoy. Kathryn is as helpful as you need her to be. Had a chance this time to venture into REO Town, which is only 10 minutes away. Lots of cool little shops and eateries. But you're so close to lots of things that you can't go wrong. As the listing states, this is a duplex, so you do have a permanent tenant living in the space above the Airbnb. NO FAULT of theirs as this is an older house, but just be advised that you can hear them. Outside street noise also comes in pretty easily. That is the only ""downfall,"" if you even want to call it that. If you would prefer a quieter stay, I'd recommend checking out Kathryn's other listing, ""Classy, Comfortable Updated Home-Downtown Lansing."" I've stayed there, as well, and it's PERFECT and super private. You can't go wrong booking with Kathryn."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a wonderful stay at Kathryn's place! We were in town for only one night for a show but it was lovely staying in a cozy place rather than a hotel room. I particularly enjoyed the couple of books about cats that were laying around.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cute little place.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place! One of the nicest ones we have stayed in over the years. Well equipped kitchen, comfortable bed and furniture. It is in a great location! Very clean. The offering of snacks and breakfast options was just a nice touch."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love this airbnb! It was perfect for my visit to Lansing. I really enjoyed walking to the capitol building and discovering what the area has to offer. Would definitely stay here again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Kathryn’s place and we hope to make a 3rd. The location is great and the house is perfect. IF you happen to forget an item, Kathryn is quite accommodating to help you get it back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was great. We would definitely stay here again. It had everything you could or would want for a stay. We loved the simpleness of the place too. Thank you so much for letting us stay at your place.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this cute rental less than 24 hours in advance. I was suppose to stay with my cousins but they fell ill. Kathryn responded quickly with all the information I needed. She was so responsive when I would reach out. When I actually got to the rental, it was clear she truly cares about the experience you have staying in her space. The place was absolutely beautiful and comfy. She thought of everything from the beautiful roses, the grapes and light breakfast items in the fridge, to the coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Her instructions were clear, which I appreciate. I was a bit worried about how thin the walls were as I am a light sleeper, but I slept so amazing.
If I have to rent the next time I am back, I will make sure to check if this space is available. Thank you for a wonderful stay, Kathryn."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great Airbnb and an even better host. The house is large with a lot of charm. It's fun to check out all the rooms and find little hidden treasures. (As a fellow Michigander, big props for having the UTR book!) The fridge and cart are stocked with drinks and snacks. Everything about the spot is very welcoming. It's close to downtown, yet still rather quiet. I discovered all this from only staying at this Airbnb a few hours. I needed Wi-Fi for my stay and due to a technical issue, the modem here was not working. The host was quick to fix the issue by moving me to another of her listings within a few blocks. It was a super easy transition and I could tell that it concerned her more than it bothered me. That right there shows you that the guest is always at the top of her mind and should give everyone comfort in booking here. "
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our brief stay at Kathryn's place. It was clean and cozy and there was plenty of room to spread out and relax.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I spent one night at Kathryn's place while helping my son move into MSU. The place was perfect. A short drive to his off campus housing, easy off street parking, very quiet neighborhood. The house itself is older, remodeled in all of the places that matter (kitchen and bathroom). It was clean and very well equipped and furnished. I did not hear the upstairs tenant during my stay (I got in at 10pm and left at 9am). I had a great night's sleep and really appreciated the supplied light breakfast that Kathryn had on hand (eggs, yogurt, coffee, bread, butter and jam). It really helped me get a great start to the day. I highly recommend staying here (the listing is accurate to the rental) and will seek it out on future trips to MSU."

If we ever find ourselves in the Lansing area we’d definitely stay again!"

The listing is exactly as described … a wonderful Turn of the Century first-floor apartment … complete with both antiques and modern appliances. The large, comfortable livingroom contained the large-screen TV. We were easily able to control the heat. We appreciated the breakfast goodies in the fridge and the well-stocked, spacious kitchen. The bedroom was cozy and romantic. We were able to park our car right beside the house, which was very convenient. We left our shoes by the entrance to the kitchen, as the sign indicated for us to do. We enthusiastically recommend this listing for anyone passing through (as we did for one night) Michigan."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for us, as we were in town for a friends wedding for a couple of days. We arrived late Friday evening and Kathryn’s thorough communication before we arrived made it an easy check in. The home itself is very cozy and light breakfast snacks were an added bonus. Highly recommend!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super comfortable and cozy stay - highly recommend
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my third stay at Kathryn's duplex. It truly has felt like home during our transition to Lansing from out of state.

Can't recommend this place enough."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kathryn's place is a cute apt that is bigger than it looks! You will not be disappointed if you book. Kathryn's communication was very fast and she even let us know that the unit was ready early for us which was so thoughtful and appreciated! Tons of snacks and little extras - really nice AirBnB experience. Thanks Kathryn!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful gem. Comfortable, quiet, great location"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot. Was perfect for the night and Kathryn had lots of extras on hand.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very comfortable location and convenient to old Town Lansing and MSU. The upstairs tenant is very considerate of noise and not an issue at all. The house is in a very quiet and safe location.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nicely furnished, clean, and well provisioned rental. Description was very accurate."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This was my third stay at Kathryn's duplex - this time for five weeks. I left a detailed review in July 2021. This place totally feels like a home away from home for me and I appreciate Kathryn and her thoughtfulness so much. Very much recommend!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Your stay will live up to 5 stars! Everything you can possibly need to enjoy your stay out in East Lansing. The consideration and care Kathryn provides to her guests is exactly what you’d want from a host. Would absolutely come out and stay again!

Jim & Elise"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kathryn’s place was comfortable and comes with a fully stocked kitchen. We appreciated the attention to detail and thoughtful decor. It worked well for us as a base camp for visiting friends and family within the Lansing area. Quite historic neighborhood. Two thumbs up and we would stay again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kathryn was great all around! Communication was easy, she was very accomodating, and very kind. The only downside is the neighborhood is a little run down, but other than that, everything was great! We loved our stay!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kathryn’s AirBnB was the perfect home away from home! Cute first impression with potted flowers at back porch, keypad entry and fresh cut flowers were a nice touch! We immediately noticed the tasteful decor with very cool vintage pieces plus it was impeccably clean. We very much appreciated ALL of the extra amenities… several drink options, breakfast items & even snacks. The bed was so comfy and I fell in love with the soft white bedspread. We really enjoyed the corner window views as we sipped our morning coffee. There was also a fun selection of books available… actually, we ended up ordering 2 online so we could finish reading them at home :)
We’ve stayed in many AirBnB’s and Kathryn has really set quite the standard. Our stay was such a pleasure!
Thank you! Scott & Ingrid"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay in Kathryn's duplex and I already wrote a long and enthusiastic review. I've enjoyed my stays so much that I've booked again for a five-week stay starting next month!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very special place. Kathryn is an incredibly thoughtful, attentive, and kind host. Her communication from booking through checkout and at every stage in between has been clear, friendly, and helpful. The off-street parking is super-convenient and it's location next to the door makes bringing in your luggage a breeze; the keypad entry is seemless. I've stayed in quite a few AirBnBs and this one has felt the most like a home-away-from-home. It is tastefully decorated and all of the furniture is very clean and comfortable. There's plenty of natural light during the day and the temperature inside the unit is comfortable in the summer - even on some very ho and humid days. And Kathryn has thought of everything! The kitchen, notably, is extremely well-appointed with plenty of dishes, appliances, and utensils, I wanted for absolutely nothing. I even found beautiful bouquets of fresh-cut flowers when I arrived- such a wonderful touch! I've enjoyed my stay so much that, from the comfort of one of the living room sofas, I've just booked my next stay in the duplex. 100% recommend Kathryn's place!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I stayed at Kathryn’s place for a weekend and it was fantastic! She really put the thought into making the airbnb seem like a home, offering more than just a place to sleep. Highly recommend a stay here."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just finished our second stay at this location and it was just as amazing as the first time. The apartment is beautiful, and secluded. The location is incredibly convenient, being right in the middle of Okemos and East Lansing. Kimberly and Brian were always helpful and communicate quickly. If you're lucky you might even get to pet their dogs if you both happen to be on the patio at the same time. Overall incredible stay, and we'll likely be back again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kimberly and Brain were great host, I didn't realize that it was basement apartment without an oven until I arrived but I still felt extremely comfortable and just made chicken soup on the stove top instead of the pot roast I had hoped to."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kimberley’s place was nicely furnished and she thought of everything one might need. Very comfortable.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend staying here!!! Everything was perfect, right down to the comfy bed. We came to town for an msu basketball game and location couldn't have been better!!! Would definitely stay again and hoping to in the future!!
GO GREEN!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Amazing place and amazing hosts. Incredibly convenient location, being right in the middle of Okemos and East Lansing. Kimberly was very communicative and overall helpful during our stay. We very much appreciated all of the little amenities, adding up to have a large impact overall and showed that Kimberly and Brian cared about their guests (including towels, toothbrushes, dish soap, shaving cream, box fan, etc). Another minor thing which we greatly appreciated was how the hosts would always save us a spot in the driveway, even when they had guests over.
Only minor complaint was that being directly below Kimberly's home, we were able to hear their dogs barking occasionally. That said, Kimberly was very up front about that before our stay, and the barking never impacted our enjoyment. I'm sure that we were audible at times to the hosts as well, and they never complained"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place right near campus. Your own little apartment that had everything.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Kimberly was a great host. The place was clean and a great location for MSU games

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful garden level oasis is exactly as stated. A magnificently beautiful landscaping design around a in ground pool. While not exactly pool weather you could certainly Invision sitting outside to enjoy a beautiful summer evening. Kim is a wonderful artist who proudly displays her beautiful paintings. Our one bedroom garden level oasis was perfect for what we needed. Nicely appointed kitchen, easy check-in, very friendly hosts. But it was the attention to the little details. White noise machines in each sleeping area, the living room had a sleeper coach. Room air freshener defuser with lemon oil if you’d like to freshen your bedroom area-which you really didn’t need to, the apartment was spotless. Plenty of hangers, welcome sign on table as you enter for personal greetings. I could go on, Kim and Bryan are very available hosts. We’ve traveled all over the world, we walked in and felt right at home. Well done Kim."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is Epic!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"i hesitate to tell y’all about this,
as i don’t want to see “no vacancy” !
This place is incredible!
Amongst a arboretum of flower and fauna
is the pool, clear except the ripples and turquoise blue.
This living space is “state of the art”.
one bedroom, a shower to stay all day, a fully equipped kitchen and a couch i unintentionally stayed too long.
It is artful and peaceful.
The hosts , lovely !
i forgot the fresh flowers, fresh fruit and candy dish!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Kimberly and Bryan's place for three nights and really can't think of anything I didn't like about the place. The rooms were clean, there was plenty of space, and the kitchen was nicely stocked. Everything looks very new. Their garden is beautiful: I just wish I'd had time to take advantage of it. Best of all, the hosts very very friendly, and let me in a little early. I really enjoyed chatting with Kimberly about her family, and of course meeting the dogs"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We spent 4 days in the area and wanted to find somewhere peaceful to stay. Boy oh boy did we find it! Kim isn't playing around when she describes her property as an oasis. The pool is spectacular but the real beauty is in the vast amount of flowers and trees in their ""garden."" I spent several mornings walking through and photographing this beautiful flower garden. It was amazing and inspired a lot of creativity and relaxation. The suite was perfect for my husband and I + our little dog. Everything was spotless and Kim's artwork all over the walls was the perfect addition to such a splendid place to stay and relax."

This is the first Airbnb I have booked myself and I am thoroughly satisfied with my experience. :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The backyard was beautiful, lots of places with shade and stuff to explore. The apartment it self is in an attached apartment and shares a wall with their laundry room. Although not big of a deal, you can hear a lot of walking and laundry sounds. It sounded like they were in our apartment sometimes 😅. The apartment itself was immaculate. The kitchen and bathroom were both clean and very modern.
The bedroom is also in more of an alcove than a bedroom and therefore has no door. But it's kinda cute. Overall 100% worth the price."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I had a great stay here with my dog. The hosts were so welcoming and friendly, the apartment was beautiful, and the garden was exquisite. The kitchen and bathroom were well equipped and stocked. It is a basement apartment (as disclosed by the hosts) so you can hear a bit from the house but it was not disruptive at all. Overall I had a very relaxing and refreshing visit."

2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"All you could need for an extended stay in a nice clean place in a quiet neighborhood.
I stayed for about a month and a half, as the apartment I signed a lease at wasn’t available until weeks after my first day of work, and enjoyed my time there.
William was attentive to any need i had, offering additional blankets when family and friends were over.
The place itself was nice and cozy. Big enough where I could move freely, but small enough where I didn’t feel lonely. I always liked that I could wake and be a few steps away from the kitchen for a snack or water.
Often I would work remotely, and when I did the internet could handle my video calls, streaming, etc.
There were other amenities that I found great use of, namely cookware, toiletries, and a washer and dryer.
William is accommodating of guests, but out of respect for other guests, I wouldn’t recommend having more than two or three over as the walls transfer sound easily. He also did a great job snow blowing, shoveling, and salting the sidewalks and parking lot. However, be cautious as ice can form quickly, especially on the sidewalk leading to the entrance door.
All in all, a very nice stay with an accommodating host."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Stayed for 4 months. Place was cozy and comfortable. The walls were super thin. I could hear the neighbors very easily. But overall, the place was clean and amazing!!"

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,William’s place was extremely neat and provided everything you could realistically need in a short term or long term stay. The in-unit washer/dryer were especially convenient!
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,All in all great place. Easy to find. Walls very thin and shared with other guests. Dishes had to be cleaned before use. Could have been a bit cleaner all around.

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place near MSU.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is a great unit and William is a great host.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this place for a trip to visit Michigan State university with my daughter. It's everything as advertised.
Comfortable, easy to get to, not far from campus, to only name a few. William is very friendly, prompt and accommodating. He met us when we arrived and was always quick to respond before and during our stay.
The apartment was exactly what we needed for our stay that weekend. You're also not far from various restaurants and fast food if you don't want to cook. A lot more spacious than I thought from the pictures too. The laundry facilities was a bonus, even though we didn't need to use them. That was an unexpected surprise.
I'd definitely book here again if we're in the Lansing MI area."
2019-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice location
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place close to Michigan state campus. Warm and cozy, perfect for cold days."
2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Who would have thought a clothes dryer would be so valuable! After 4 hours in the rain watching a less than stellar football game, it was great tumbling away the cold of the game and putting on warm dry clothes. The apartment worked well, super quiet, safe, tree lined neighborhood, easy access to campus via Mt Hope (super pretty) or the expressway. Apartment was sparkling clean and inviting and fit well under budget on a weekend when hotels were profiting mightily. I can see why this is an often rented property and am hopeful it is available when I return, Dan & Amy"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Small but very clean. Perfect for 2 people. The location is about 7 miles from the MSU campus. William was there to greet us and was quick to respond when needed. Great value for a football weekend if you don’t mind the 15 min drive to campus. We will stay there again next year when we come back for a game. Go Green!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great apartment in a great neighborhood. A added bonus is an outdoor garden and patio sitting area. Will definitely return and also recommend to my friends.

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The place was clean and quiet. It was a great size for my stay over 3 weeks.

If you need a place in the Lansing area, definitely stay here!"

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,William's apartment was great! Such a good value for the space. It was much larger than I had expected. Just what we needed for a couple of nights in Lansing.
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I came to town on a Fall weekend to attend a wedding, and were very pleased with the accommodations that William provides. The photos truly don't do justice to the place. It's great value. Everything is very tasteful, very clean, and we found there to be nothing lacking that we needed. The location is ideal: very peaceful and suburban. Even on an MSU football Saturday, it's far enough removed from the hubbub that one can remain oblivious to it all. We recommend it highly (and I might add that we ourselves are owners of a VRBO in Portland, OR, not easily impressed)."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great AirBnB. Nice comfortable and well equipped apartment, easy parking (just make sure you do not back up from the parking lot, the curb on the driver side is quite steep and easy to overlook). South Lansing is in general not the best area to visit, however, the local neighborhood of the apartment is very safe and quiet. We definitely recommend this place."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"William’s place was very clean & in a nice looking neighborhood. Also, there was actually a couch that he doesn’t have a picture of, so that was a bonus! The pictures definitely don’t do this Airbnb justice. Nicer than what I expected."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great host. The place is near a small mall with RiteAid, a dollar store and Value Land if you need something quick."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A charming private apartment. Everything clean, attractive, and properly functioning. Easy parking. A nice secluded picnic table area In back."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was super clean and comfortable - small but arranged in such a way that it didn't feel at all cramped. And it was convenient to downtown for the conference I was attending. I'll be back!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Better than any hotel! This one-bedroom apartment is perfect for any short- or long-term stay with all the amenities to make it feel like home.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place was excellent. I stayed here for roughly seven months while I worked in Lansing. William was a fantastic, considerate host. Anytime I had an issue, William was prompt and took care of it immediately. The neighborhood was great, easy to get anywhere you need to go.
I would highly recommend this place to anyone."
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I've now stayed in this rental twice and each time it's been great for me. The unit is 100% as advertised and truly a nice place to stay whenever in the area.

2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For my first time with airbnb I was extremely pleased, great location, economical and easy. William was right there on check in and had even made arrangements if we had not connected. Will definitely do this again."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"William's place is great. We were very comfortable and the apartment had all the amenities we needed. We used the kitchen a couple times to make meals and the Keurig was a great thing to have available for a quick cup of coffee. The apartment is close to downtown and REO town and there are lots of nice parks within walking distance. Wifi was great, we were able to stream every night of our stay. William is a great host, very easy to communicate with and very accommodating. Super easy check in. We would definitely stay at William's place again and highly recommend it."
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to stay. Enjoy the patio under the tree. Very reasonable cost. Would love to stay on our next visit.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The self-contained apartment had all the necessities to make it a home away from home. Location, size and amenities are A+. Communication was easy, check-in was a breeze and my time there was pleasant. I will definitely stay in the future."
2017-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Private , quiet immaculate"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at this apt. It is clean and cozy. Neighborhood is quiet and safe with grocery store at walking distance. 10 mins drive to MSU campus. We love the kitchen (with pans, utensils etc) and TV programs have wide selections. The washer is little bit small as we stayed 5 nights and need to find creative ways to dry our cloths. Thanks William to provide some juices/milk and cereals to start our stay, very thoughtful.
Anyway, we would definitely stay here again at our next visit of MSU."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value for a very nice, clean place to stay. Absolutely no issues."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great unit in a great location.
Everything I needed was there, the unit was very clean and the host was very responsive. I will definitely stay here again on future trips."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My boyfriend and I came up to Michigan to visit MSU as potential grad students and to determine if the Lansing area was somewhere we wanted to relocate to. William was great with providing suggesting for dining, some things to do/visit during our stay, and some towns/areas to look at for future housing. We utilized the kitchen a few times which helped us save some money on dining. We were minutes away from downtown Lansing as well as the University. Had a great time and would definitely use this place again for future visits!"
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great spot! There's even a lovely area in the corner of the property with a fire pit we were able to utilize. Very clean. William stays on site as well and is very friendly, responsive and considerate. We hope to be back that way soon."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"William was very friendly and quick to respond and that made the process really easy. I stayed here for a week, I didnt have any problems."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Caps Place (hosted by William) is a modest, tidy, and good value accommodation. William was a great host, welcoming, responsive but gave us our privacy. The accommodations were in a 3 or 4 unit flat, that was basically everything we needed. Unfortunately, my vehicle began a small oil drip, but William suggested an alternate parking spot (I appologize again for that). He suggested putting in an AC unit for the expected hot weekend, but we didnt think it was necessary We were wrong, and we should have taken him up on the suggestion."
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"William's place was very clean with lots of room. He was extremely easy to work with, flexible, honest and kind. We would definately stay here again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home is close to McLaren and Sparrow hospitals. Easy to get to highways and close to grocery stores and has many great restaurants near by. Washer and dryer was great to keep clothes clean. Roku TV was perfect in bedrooms and living area. Comfy beds and linens. Great communication by Hosts. I appreciated the communication the most. Very polite and informative.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such an unexpected, yet extremely pleasant surprise in this neighborhood. I grew up here & needed a quick overnight while visiting. This place is everything they say & more. That sauna is heavenly!! The shower was a delight! The living room area with the fireplace was so cozy, I fell asleep on the couch while relaxing before dinner. There’s a book case full of board games & floor space to do yoga/exercise, with just about everything you need to feel comfortable & beyond. But the sauna though!! I will definitely be returning to enjoy that feature! Such a nice touch! The kitchen was well stocked, loved the seasonings cabinet! I loved everything about the space. Great job with communication through the app too. I truly enjoyed my stay & will return when available. Thank you for a great experience."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rhett’s place is as advertised. Excellent. Beyond the relaxing, modern space, Rhett provides superior service to guests. The Wi-Fi went out on the first evening and Rhett went out of his way to arrange a tech and get a repair scheduled first thing the following morning, and show up to get it taken care of. The sauna was a perfect amenity to the location and the space, itself, is great. 100/10 would stay again."

2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"You get what you pay for. They tried but the home needs some more TLC. Mattresses are very hot, didn’t make sleep good at all.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rhett's place was really cozy and for a 3 bedroom place, a very good value. The upstairs shower was very nice, though we didn't try the sauna. It is quite small and though it appears very modern and well kept up, I was a bit too claustrophobic to give it a shot. I think I was expecting it to be just a little bigger. Really enjoyed sitting in the comfy living room by the fireplace and watching a movie, though. Overall, great value and would definitely recommend it."

,,,"So I work nights and to be told not to do laundry after midnight that I can’t leave after midnight was a big problem. My client fell about of bed cause loud noise, and we where told we was rude. I have other clients I see and help. So I couldn’t attend to cause of the midnight rule. I work nights the shift people don’t like working, where I’m doing pop ins on my clients making sure everything is ok and they safe. Also to noise this a business you don’t need to know anything about me . Just like checking in at a hotel short brief go about your day. Also knowing my client on oxygen and the entrance at the back of the house, no parking in the drive so had to unload and walk a far distance and walk my client on oxygen a far way. I would never recommend this Airbnb"
,,,…
,,,This Airbnb home was absolutely beautiful. Everything you need is there. Kathryn was very nice. unfortunately the situation upon arrival turned to mayhem almost immediately. The lawn man parked behind my car and when I asked him to move it so I could leave he went apeshit. I was so scared I went inside and locked the door. I contacted Kathryn and she said he would move the car immediately. it took 30 minutes. when I returned after being blocked in the driveway for 30 minutes there were 4 police officers and the lawn man in the driveway. I then contacted Kathryn again and she moved me to a hotel on her dime. She did say the lawn man was new and she heard of trouble. (the lawn man lives in the upstairs apartment of the house) the police said he threatened a neighbour with a broom the week before. so I cannot say I would reccomend at the moment. Once the crazy man is gone then I think it would be OK. ** REMEMBER you are renting in the USA and everyone owns a gun
