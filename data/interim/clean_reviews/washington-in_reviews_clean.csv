2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, but small- which we knew. Beds were comfy- plenty of pillows/blankets; kitchen was well stocked with items needed. Bathroom is tiny, bathtub was tough to get into for a few of us elderly, and there were no safety bars; but it was clean, and we managed.
Visit the park across the street, it’s beautiful and a nice view from the front porch. It’s a nice walk. The house is convenient to everything in Vincennes.
We found that loading and unloading from the back porch was much easier for us. And it was convenient…and we felt that it was safer for our car so it wasn’t parked on the street.
Some suggestions for owner: 1. some sort of table for eating on- msybe a coffee table that pulls up to table height; 2. Full length mirror somewhere ;3. Written instructions inside the house for check out.
Overall, nice place, we would stay again. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to stay and super responsive host. We were able to park and walk to the nearby restaurants which was a nice perk!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I came to Vincennes on 4/20/23 for an event at Vincennes Univ for my son. My late husband's 80 yr old Aunt came w/me. After a full day of traveling, an evening of visiting & exploring, & rain storms coming in, we decided to skip stay the night rather than drive 3.5 hours back home. I called the hotel I usually stay at but the few rooms left were far more costly than usual, as were all other hotels. I finally remembered Airbnb but since it was now 10pm, I wasn't sure I'd get a response. I was pleasantly surprised Vince & his local manager responded very quickly. DJ met us there & assisted my Aunt w/the stairs & me w/our luggage. We enjoyed chatting w/him while we settled in. Note: Beds on the firmer side comfy w/lots of cozy pillows & blankets! Shower has great water pressure! Basement has lots usable space. Only wish: Front porch chairs to enjoy that stunning view of the Monument!! We 100% loved our stay! I hope to bring my kids & grands to explore Vincennes & stay your other home!"

Very cool horse stables underneath the living quarters for if you are traveling with your equine friends. The horse stables downstairs are totally seperate from the sleeping quarters, so if you didn't go exploring, you wouldn't even know they are there. I would definitely recommend staying here ."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We booked last minute for the eclipse. Place was amazing! only negative was the stairs as they are steeper than we were used to. nothing the owner has control of as this is a renovated older building. Just keep the stairs in mind if you have a lot to pack in and out like we did with a toddler.

LOVE the space and location, walkable to Washington high school (where we were attending a robotics competition) and downtown. Definitely stay here again if in the area.

2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Abraham and his wife were such friendly hosts — allowing us to check in a little early because of a change of our schedule, helping us quickly when we had a small issue and offering their help if we needed anything.
The property is absolutely beautiful— even in the winter we enjoyed the quiet surroundings and loved strolling among the old barns and woods and fields. So refreshing!
The house is so unique and beautiful! Freshly renovated and so well done. The uneven floors, old fireplaces, and steep stairways just add to the charm of the place. We had three couples here and it was a perfect size for us. We enjoyed all the amenities in the kitchen, sitting around the living room visiting, and the big dining room table. Everything is homey and clean. Bottled water, coffee and even flavored creamer in the fridge were provided.
We did get pizza, mushrooms and wings delivered one night from Bill and Betty Bobe’s Pizza, which was delicious!
We’d love to come back again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful updated accommodation. Very clean with great shower and a comfortable bed. Would definitely book again.
Would not recommend for anyone with mobility issues due to the open steep outdoor stairway."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Well equipped. Very comfortable. More space than what we expected. If you are in the area it is a great option!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"During our stay at this Airbnb, we were pleasantly surprised by how clean and well-maintained everything was. The owners had thoughtfully provided a printed list of local restaurants and things to do, which was greatly appreciated. The Airbnb was outfitted with high-end furnishings and amenities that made us feel right at home from the moment we walked in. If you're in search of a wonderful place to stay in Washington, this is a must!"
2023-11-01,3,Stayed one night,The studio was beautiful. The only down side was that there was not really enough hot water...it did run out pretty quickly. Could not streaming services as the TV would not allow me to log in. The door had about 2-3 inch gap from the floor which allowed us to hear all noises coming in from the outside and other neighbors.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Lovely place. Will be back
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Nice place. Not suited well for boat trailers.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"To me ,the solitude & peacefulness I find here , in a beautiful cabin hidden in the woods, is well worth the price of admission. Only wish I'd had found it sooner. You nailed it !"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice, well kept place. Hot tub and pond made for enjoyable evenings."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Was a great place to stay! Great get away
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit. It was so peaceful and such a beautiful location. Tyson was very helpful and quick with answering my questions. We loved it and hope to come back again sometime.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very Nice and well maintained! Secluded and Peaceful
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay. Fishing was great!!! Peace was much needed
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely, secluded cabin. It was just what we were looking for!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cabin was exactly as described. We live a busy life and was great to unwind and not be bothered. 100% will be back
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Walk into the cabin and the world falls away. The large pond (with great fishing!) is steps away. At the end of the day, sit on the front porch and listen to the sounds of nature, enjoy the hot tub out back, or just chill inside. This is a special place."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Stayed here for a week and it was worth every penny. beautiful property and beautiful cabin. definitely a place to relax and unwind. Will definitely be back!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for a private getaway, this is a fabulous place! The property is gorgeous, and the house has lots of space. Our kids loved the lake, paddle boat, and hot tub. The house had lots of space to spread out in plus a beautiful porch to just sit and rest. The shaded area around the house is wonderful to just sit and relax in. Tyson is very responsive and responds almost immediately through the Air BnB app. He was great to work with.
A couple of key things to know:
1.) The house does not have Wi-Fi. It’s in the listing, but I missed it. We only had about two bars of signal the entire time we were there.
2.) There are lots of taxidermy animals heads in the house. It shows up some in the pics.
3.) There is no dishwasher or garbage disposal. The grill was not working when we were there so plan ahead for your meals.
We will return for a space that is wonderful to just chill in and get away from it all. We had a wonderful time."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place to visit, very peaceful"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is absolutely beautiful and is better then the photos!
The hot tub was SO relaxing. The place was spotless! It had a fully stocked kitchen so we could cook/eat in.
The views are amazing!
Our cell service was in and out at the cabin but that is exactly what we were looking for.
We checked out Washington and French Lick during our stay, both of which are great places to eat and grab groceries and were within a 15-20 min drive.
Tyson is an excellent host! We had very clear directions on getting to the place and clear instructions for check-in/out.
Our previous host had canceled on us just hours before our scheduled trip. We stumbled onto Tyson's place and with just a couple hours notice, he had his place prep and ready for us!! We could not be more thankful for all he did for us to still be able to enjoy our weekend get-away!
Highly recommend! Would definitely return!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, location, and enjoyed taking my parents out to relax around an outdoor fire. Definitely would go back. Some really good eating nearby as well. Very nice place!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tyson is #1, 2nd to none, in responding to questions and/or concerns. This is our third year staying at his cabin and it only gets better, as the years go by. Thank you for sharing your piece of wilderness with us!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Relaxing fire pit and some fishing after work was a great time to relax.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a great cabin! Everything went smoothly, and host was quick to respond to my text.
Of note, and did not impact our stay-grill was not functioning. I was alerted the day before arrival. But, if you plan to use it, you might check before reserving.
The cabin is beautiful, very clean, well-kept and easy to get to. Includes all the basics (linens, towels, a fully outfitter kitchen.) We really enjoyed the lake, campfire, and hot tub."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay was great! The cabin was wonderful & the location was beautiful. The pond was perfect for fishing and relaxing. The cabin was very clean and we had no issues. We really enjoyed our time spent at the cabin and would definitely go back again. It’s the perfect getaway place in a great location!

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Tyson’s cabin was a great getaway for a a couple of nights as we brought in the New Year! We had 4 adults and 3 kids ages 7 and 8. We all had a blast relaxing in the hot tub and enjoying the outdoors. Sitting on the porch was very relaxing and the views were beautiful. The cabin itself is very nice and had all the amenities we needed. The basement/TV room is great and had dish network so we could watch the Bearcats game! We would highly recommend this cabin and Tyson was a great host!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at Tyson’s cabin! We had young children, and the toys and outdoor exploration were great for keeping them busy. Tyson also recommended a really nice park in Washington, which the kiddos enjoyed. Overall, the cabin was clean and offered sufficiently comfortable amenities for our families, including a hot tub for the chilly December evenings. Tyson was a super responsive host. Thanks Tyson!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful! The views are stunning! Great sunrises and the sunsets from the front porch are breathtaking! Easy to not want to leave!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place for our family to stay. Tyson stayed in touch prior to our arrival and checked a couple times with texts to make sure all was going well during our stay.

2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect cabin for a weekend getaway to disconnect. I recommend looking up directions beforehand because signal can be spotty, but other than that everything was smooth. There’s a beautiful lake out front with a water feature, multiple fire pits, and a nice hot tub, which makes it perfect for spending your entire day outside relaxing."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful scenery and a great place for some R&R!

2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Cabin was clean. The area is peaceful. He is easy to communicate with if there is any questions.
Definitely recommend"
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"I booked Tyson’s cabin/property for my good friend’s bachelor party. I have to start by saying, this place looked like something out of a movie scene. I don’t know that any pictures could do this place justice. We brought kayaks to take on the pond to fish and lots of firewood for the evenings. (The bonfire area is lit with string lights) We golfed at the Country Oaks Golf Club and ate at the Gasthof Amish buffet, all within 15-20 minutes from the cabin. Overall, we had a fantastic stay.
Tyson was very easy going and quick to reply to any questions; I would highly recommend staying at his property."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was absolutely gorgeous! We got to the property as the sun was setting. Absolutely beautiful.. from sitting on the porch with a swing looking out into the pond to the hot tub to the bonfires! Great mini vaca and would stay longer if had the chance! Very relaxing, peaceful, gorgeous views. Very clean and taken care of. So many great things about this place! Would highly recommend!!"

2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was amazing! The cabin was very clean and it was the perfect relaxation spot for all of us during our archery competition. It was a nice quiet retreat and the basement where the sectional couch is was the perfect space for the kids to hang out together. We can’t wait to have the opportunity to go back.
2021-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, hot tub is nice with fire pit close by the hot tub, Seen some deer as we was enjoying the fire pit"

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great time
2020-12-01,4,Group trip,"Very nice cabin, but wish we were allowed to use more of the cabin amenities- fire place. Would have been really awesome! The only other thing is not being allowed to walk around on the property. Other than that, was a great weekend."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Host is very communicative and accommodating. (We never met face to face as there was no need). Upscale furnishings. Impeccably clean. A good experience for our family. Thank you, Tyson."

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,This house was perfect for the group we had the teenagers had there own space and the adults had there space as well. Close to everything we needed
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This is a three level house. The upstairs is a very quiet place with two bedrooms and a little living area and full bathroom. The kitchen, family rooms/TV room, and master bedroom are the most wonderful places for family together if you have a big group. Very spacious. The basement is huge. The beds are great, but the noise level of the heating and air-conditioning unit is very loud. The family that was going to sleep down there ended up sleeping upstairs. However, it would be a great area for playing games, and let kids runoff steam. My family enjoyed this place very much."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Let me start by saying that we were blown away by the accommodations of our place! It was perfect for our mini sewing retreat!!!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was perfect for a weekend getaway. The only complaint is that there wasn’t a remote that worked the ROKU part of the tv and one of the tv’s upstairs didn’t work. But overall was a great experience. We would definitely stay here again!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a little expensive for us only because we only needed 3 beds I could have got a smaller one but it was well worth the price especially if you needed all the beds they had available
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice and clean house. It was actually nicer in person than I though it was going to be from looking at the pictures. Very impressed and will book again if we are in the area.

2022-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for our needs. We were pleasantly surprised by the addition of bunk beds in the master bedroom which was great for our 2 kids. The only reason this house was not a 5 was due to the location. The neighborhood is okay, but we pulled in Friday night to the smell of marijuana from the neighbors. We also heard loud mufflers throughout the night and a nearby bar blared music until 3am. That being said, the house was plenty spacious and clean. I would recommend this house if visiting Washington."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We chose Naomi & Steve’s Washington home bc it was an hour’s drive to Holiday World. We could have chosen somewhere closer, but were smitten with the home when we came across it. It had plenty of room for our crew of six not to be cramped. It was perfect. Definitely worth the drive.
It’s location was right in the heart of the town with restaurants, bars & grocery stores only minutes away.
The home was freshly remodeled with everything we needed. We couldn’t have asked for anything better for the weekend we had planned."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay with the family. Very clean, inviting, and comfortable. Lots of room for everyone, close to everything you need, and Naomi is so great! Very responsive and nice!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is immaculate! It was better than its own description. We knew from the pictures that it would be spacious but it was even better than the pictures. Each space was carefully decorated with small resting areas away from the main living area. Perfect for group and family travel as it provides quiet areas for people to rest and relax.
The beds were EXCEPTIONALLY comfortable. The best I've experienced in nearly 10 years of using AirBnB.
Naomi was very responsive to any questions or comments and I enjoyed our limited interaction.
Definitely a treasure for the town of Washington and the surrounding Knox and Daviess counties.
P. S. We ate breakfast everyday at Benjy's and were never disappointed."

It is situated on a semi-busy road and has several off-street parking spots. We had a positive experience!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,These guys are awesome. We have stayed in a couple different properties they have and we are always satisfied! Great communication! We actually had a mix up this stay (all my fault) and thought we were checking out a day later than we actually were! It could have been a huge mess but DJ moved us down the road to another house for the last night so it all worked out great. He was extremely understanding and willing to get it worked out for us even though I’m the one that messed up my dates! Highly recommend staying at any of the houses they offer!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for our stay. The kids loved the back yard, and it was in a perfect location for us. Very responsive communication and everything was as described. We want to book again for next year!"

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"My crew and I worked in the area for three weeks so we stayed here for that time. For a small business owner, it was a way better option than a hotel. For the price I paid here to house my crew, I would have had to pay double or more for multiple hotel rooms were you have to walk up and own stairs, share space with people you don’t know, etc. Here, we were able to get off work and relax. My wife came and cooked meals so I was able to save money on eating out too. We had a very nice stay."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,The place was well taken care of and we were accommodated well. Any question or concern I had was answered promptly. I would definitely recommend this place.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We rented this with our kids and grandkids for a family wedding in the area. It was prefect !! Close to everything that we needed. I wanted to pick this house up and move it to where I live. It is so cute, clean and homey feeling. Everything was just as described and DJ , the property manager, was great and answered the few questions I had.
It was a great value and offered a wonderful outdoor area for everyone !
We will definitely try to rent again if we are in the area ( already thinking not a bad drive from there to Holiday World sometime !)."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I own a business and we had some work across the river. We had 4-5 people there including my wife. It was way better and more comfortable than paying for 2 or 3 rooms at a hotel.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had the most wonderful stay here while in town. The bed was the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in. The sunroom was the perfect space to chat and watch tv. It truly had everything we could need. I wish we could have stayed longer to just enjoy the surroundings. Thank you!!!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,We felt right at home. The house was clean and welcoming. Everything was labeled. We enjoyed sitting in the sun room and cooking on the grill.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Vince’s place was beautiful just like the pictures. His communication was good also, I’ll definitely give this place a 10 out of 10. Loved everything about it."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The home was extremely clean and comfortable. It was better than the photos. Thank you for allowing us to stay with you.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed each other to havefamily together in one place for three days. We had lots to do outside of the house, but it was nice when we came to this comfortable place. My kids only suggestion would possibly be have a coffee pot in addition to a Keurig. Who would use this place again."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay at Vince's place. The check-in was super easy. We absolutely loved the heated sunroom and loved watching the animals in the huge backyard. We had a wedding at the Great Banquet Hall and it was only a 6 min drive.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,My friends and i enjoyed this 3 bedroom home. We loved the sunroom the most! Everything was very neat and tidy in the home. The hosts were very responsive. We all would love to stay again in the future. Just a short drive to downtown Vincennes about 5-10 min away depending on your end location.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My family and I loved our week long stay at this beautiful Airbnb in Vincennes, IN. The location is right on a main road, but in a peaceful rural area. I enjoyed seeing rabbits and American robins during the day and numerous sparkling stars in the sky above at night. My aunt especially enjoyed the kitchen. We ended up cooking at home each day instead of eating out at a restaurant because the space really does feel like a home away from home. My family was also impressed by the amenities, which really exceeded our expectations. There was plenty of cookware, dinnerware, and linens. And most importantly, COFFEE! The weather was cold during our stay, so there being plenty of extra cozy blankets was a huge plus.
Vince truly is an excellent host. It's like he anticipated everything we'd need, so I didn't have to contact him during our stay with any concerns or questions. If available, I would like to stay at this property again. Thank you."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was beautiful (the back porch is where all our time was spent) and the property manager was extremely helpful and friendly! Amazing stay

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is a fantastic stay, especially if you have young children. The play structure and thoughtful kid-friendly touches like board and card games, multiple screens throughout the home, and large private yard we’re exactly the right thing for our family. It is *very* close to shopping and entertainment in town, but feels miles away once you’re there."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is just as nice as the photos. It is well stocked with the basics and the beds were shockingly comfortable. We would definitely stay here again without reservations.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time while in town visiting family. We instantly felt right at home. The house is in a great spot just outside Vincennes. We will definitely be back!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we really enjoyed our stay! it was out in the country but not far from the University. We had nice mornings on the patio and front porch just listening to the birds while drinking our coffee. Thoughtful owner. our needs were more than met. a nice place for a family to stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super clean home! Quiet neighborhood, wonderful and beautiful backyard with swingset! Plenty of space, and fast wifi! 10 out of 10!!!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent house and value! Vince thought of everything, all we needed to do was show up and enjoy ourselves. Close to everything downtown. Kids loved the backyard, and plenty of space for 6 of us. We will definitely book here again when we are in town. 5 star all the way!!!!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,all good
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was spotless and so well appointed. Everything you might need including boxes of soft tissues in almost every room!
Clear easy to understand instructions for everything that needed instructions and an owner who is easy to contact and quick to respond. What more can you ask?
The sun room is the crowning glory, with a view that is calming and restful. I watched a squirrel on the play equipment and thought he'd go down the slide, but he didn't. That was the only disappointment of our stay!
We would most probably rent again when visiting family in Vincennes.
The Burton's, Orlando, FL."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow, I have stayed at quite a few airbnbs and I have never seen one that was so thoughtfully appointed. The kitchen and bathrooms had every amenity you could think of and everything was carefully labelled. The design and layout worked beautifully for our family. if you are thinking about staying here, don't hesitate! I hope we have a reason to come back to Vincennes someday."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a fantastic home! Plenty of room, has everything you could imagine, great kitchen, sun room was great to hang out in, the owner and caretaker are great and were very accommodating. Has all the Tech you want, TVs and stuff, nice grill, big yard etc... Highly recommend"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,really enjoyed staying at the loft ... comfortable beds ... anything needed to cook a meal was there only thing you needed was the food ...cleaning supplies and laundry supplies were there if needed ... as i told him before I left my only complaint was we had to head back home lol
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay close to Downtown
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful home in a quaint town. We enjoyed our stay!
The vaulted ceiling, industrial brick walls and metal window frames made this a unique place to spend the night.
Sound and light carried throughout the space, because there are walls to divide the rooms but no traditional plaster ceilings covering each room.
Despite this, I would stay there again. It was calming and homey- a plus with children in tow! The accommodations were very clean and comfortable."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"The location matched the host's description and our expectations.
Being a loft space, privacy is lessened compared to a more traditional residence--the room walls do not reach the building's roof, so sound carries throughout the entire space. This isn't an issue if you know what to expect, but some folks who signed the guestbook apparently did not anticipate this when booking.
We stayed during a spectacular total solar eclipse in the city, and this space provided a location that was easily walkable to the main community celebration and to some of the local restaurants and shops. The shortage of lodging in the area for the event drove up prices for accommodations, but this listing offered a relatively reasonable value compared to other nearby options.
The host was very friendly, and her responses to any questions we had were prompt and helpful.
This was our first Airbnb stay, and we can only hope that future bookings will be as smooth and pleasant as Jessica helped make this one."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,It is an excellent place to stay in and large enough for a family.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Would definitely book again! Great space and location and all seemed brand new.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Easy check in and clean.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay!
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,We had a comfortable stay! Close to the quaint little town. We made some sweet memories around the open ceilings over every room. We will stay again if in the area!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Close to everything and the place is very clean and spacious.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Amazing stay !
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this apartment! It was clean and very spacious. I loved the brick walls, high ceilings and natural light. It was a beautiful place to stay and absolutely perfect for what we needed. I would definitely stay there again if I ever go back to that area."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay to get a feel of downtown Washington. We enjoyed envisioning what people did in the building in years past. We loved the uniqueness of the space and would definitely book again.

2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Very cool place, neat historical loft!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay at the loft! Jess and Jarret were great host. The loft was equipped with everything we needed and even some things we didn't know we needed. The loft was very clean, comfortable, and conveniently located. We would definitely stay again and recommend to all our friends. It was an unexpected surprise for the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A/C had not been on long enough to cool the rooms down. Besides that, everything was great! Thank you for being the best hosts!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent place to stay in Washington. Very spacious and very affordable. Highly recommend.
Only caveat's:
It is a loft as described, and the walls do not go all the way to the ceiling. Thus sound travels and this includes Bathrooms. They do include some white noise machines and that did help. But be aware of this.
Parking can be tricky in that you can park in front of the place, but you may be the only car on the road. I didn't feel comfortable being the only car parked there, so I parked on the side of the building. However, I had to move first thing Monday morning so that i wasn't in the way of the work trailers parked there.
Finally, the master bed/bathroom does not have a door between the bathroom and the bedroom. So be aware of that.
Overall though a wonderful stay and I'd definitely stay there again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was clean and spacious. I really enjoyed my stay!
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Jessica’s place was a great find for our weekend. We came into the area for The Spirit of Vincennes weekend, our kids and parents were taking part as Rev War reenactors. It was a great spot to come back and relax after the long days in the sun. It’s a very cool space with a lots of room to spread out. Clean and comfortable!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place in Washington IN
Would stay there again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were very pleased with our stay. We were able to take evening walks in town and getting to restaurants and sites in the area was very easy. Jessica let us know things that were happening during our stay and we were not disappointed when we visited these suggestions. The accommodations were well above our expectations. It served us well. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was our second stay at this lovely place.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for what we needed. Plenty of space and very clean!

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The kitchen sink does take a while to get hot water, and the kitchen wasn't super well equipped. But it was a beautiful place, the host was responsive and helpful. We enjoyed our stay and would stay there again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,What an amazing little hidden gem in Washington IN. Perfect for a little weekend getaway!! Hoping to stay again in the future!! The kids even had a blast with the games that were available!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is a hidden gem. We enjoyed our stay.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for us to stay while visiting our family. The apartment is very spacious, clean and had every thing we needed. I would recommend ear plugs if you’re a light sleeper, the noise from the street and nearby businesses is kind of loud. Other than that it’s a great place! Jessica was quick to reply when I messaged her. We will definitely stay again!
Thanks for sharing your super cool apartment!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very unique place!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,TheWrightAway was the perfect meeting spot between family from Indy and us from Southern Indiana. The industrial design of the converted loft is very cool and unique. We really loved the exposed brick and the huge windows. The kitchen was perfect for us to do a little cooking and then play games and get comfy in the living room. We would love to stay again in the future! 🤗
2022-11-01,3,Stayed one night,"One of the reasons we chose to stay here was the hot tub. Unfortunately, there was not enough hot water to fill the tub. We notified the owner and he came out immediately and told us everything working fine and that no one else had complained. We went to bed and, in the morning, we tried again to fill the tub. The hot water ran out before the tub was half full. There were dozens of dead flies and one cockroach. There were 2 gas fireplaces but neither worked. This place has so much unreached potential."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Stayed here for a 16 week contract for work. Cute loft style very spacious!
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"What a great place. It was perfect for our family, and we look forward to staying there again on our next visit to Washington."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great space for a family to enjoy.
There were sound machines to help with sound traveling throughout the open space (low walls and tall ceilings), and the place was very clean and in good working order. The unique windows made for a truly one of a kind experience.
We used this as a jumping off point for Holiday World and we found the time change allowed us better mornings and the drive wasn't bad as we were able to enjoy the small towns around for places to see and eat.
