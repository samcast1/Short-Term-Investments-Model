2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, good price!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home we talked in person in the parking lot a little bit. Mary was super friendly and gave lots of recommendations on where to eat. Would definitely return to this place if in the area again
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay . The apartment was very clean and the location was great!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nicely done garage apartment. Comfortable and relaxing.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in both apartments at Mugivan Manor. Both are gems! Mary is also a great, reliable host. We hope to return again when in the area."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved my stay! It was perfect for what I needed it for. Mary was a great host! Would love to stay again on my next visit!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was very clean! They were super responsive and flexible with our late arrival time. They gave us plenty of privacy, we didn’t see them once. Would book again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Misty and Mark were so kind and accommodating! Excellent hosts
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay that provided easy access to the Nickle Plate and Pan Handle bike trails. Misty and Mark were most accommodating and the studio guest quarters were extremely comfortable. They have upgraded the seating from the gray couch to Lazy-Boy love seat recliners! Likely the cleanest Air B&B we have experienced. No steps and the curb less shower is much appreciated for us seniors. It was a little challenging finding the correct drive but there address number is on the mailbox and when you look for the white finish it is very obvious.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful place with wonderful surroundings! Quick responses from the owner and great fishing spot.
Only issue was it seemed like the shower wasn’t able to drain properly and left a lot of water on the floor, making it slick."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, pristine, simple, charming, and everything we needed for our getaway from it all stay! Misty replied to any questions almost immediately! Mattress was softer than we were used to, so we were surprised at how comfortable it actually was - and the bedding was so cozy! The pond and woods trails provided an entertaining variety of nature for curious nature buffs like me. A beautiful, serene place. I plan to bring my daughter and her girls here soon! Tip: the bathroom is done in an industrial theme. It has a concrete floor that gets slippery when wet. There are a couple of bath mats on the floor and nice-sized non-skid mats in the shower. Those with falling or balance issues might want to bring flip-flops or shower shoes for extra precaution. We usually camp in our camper when we travel but love this place so much, we'll likely make this an annual (at least) to come visit."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was easy to find and peaceful spot. Host was responsive and very nice. Location was perfect and apartment had everything we needed for a pleasant stay. Highly recommended!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We were in the area for work and Misty’s place worked out perfect for us until we were able to move into our house. We were able to grill outside, fish in the pond and enjoy some of the good restaurants in Peru. The dogs are super friendly!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed our stay here! It was clean, neat, quiet and misty and her husband were great hosts! I absolutely loved the back yard and enjoyed the pond in the back. I wish we had more time to relax there!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time here. Although our stay was short, since we mainly came just to see the eclipse, we still enjoyed our stay, and we would definitely come back. Everything was exactly as pictured, and the dogs were very friendly. It was easy to find and our host communicated everything very clearly."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Misty's place for a week of work. Misty is a great host. She's welcoming and responsive. She wanted to make sure I had everything I needed and did it. The efficiency apartment is an addition to the garage and is very nicely designed. It is on a beautiful property and was new, clean, and comfortable. I highly recommend Misty's place for anyone stying in the Peru area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Misty's place was cute and cozy. The hosts were very responsive to messages and had a great recommendation for local food. I would definitely stay there again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,absolutely perfect it was only a 7 minute drive from where my oldest was staying at grandma's the dogs were friendly and so were they
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We took our grandson. He loved the dogs, had a great time fishing at the pond, and exploring the grounds. The sunset over the fields was beautiful. Town was very close and plenty of restaurants to choose from. The creative design of the accommodations is what drew us to this Air BNB. Thoughtful, private, peaceful, friendly. Great place to make memories."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our second stay at Misty's was as relaxing as the first. It is so beautiful and comfortable. Misty is very accommodating. We really enjoyed our stay and will return. Darla Ferguson

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Needed a small, quiet place to rest my mind for a few days. These guys had the perfect place to do this. Had some work to do in the area but, overall, it was outstanding. Wabash is a cool little town, too. very personable couple. Sweet pups and a little baby too.
Thank you guys."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great hosts and great unit, would recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Misty's place was perfect for our night in town to visit friends and go to a baby shower. Would definitelystay here again and she even left dog treats for our dog inside. So sweet!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Misty’s place was just as described. Beautiful place to spend a night. She had restaurant recommendations that were also spot on. Will return when we are in the area
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a very calm and relaxing place. Wouldn’t like to go back. Misty was a very good host.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great Gem
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Misty was super thoughtful and responsive!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the second time staying here and it was just as great as the first time. My dog loved the trails, the relaxing pond, and their friendly pups! My fav part was fishing at the pond and the open layout of the shower! They allowed me to use their charcoal grill and the little kitchen had everything we needed to prep and make the food we packed for 3 nights. We will most likely try to come back after winter!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice place!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little space for our weekend away. Very modern, clean, and comfy accommodations. Will definitely stay again when in that area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we were in town for a wedding so we didn't spend too much time here, but it was absolutely peaceful and such a great stay! when we walked in it smelled great and was very clean and cozy with the fireplace running. my partner enjoyed the pond nearby while I was out."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for a quick getaway!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was a beautiful getaway. We enjoyed staying in their homey studio apartment and enjoying their outdoors. Misty was very friendly and helpful the entire time!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a lovely place to stay. I am lucky I was able to stay here.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great, relaxing night away. Property was peaceful and beautiful. Hosts were quick to answer all questions we had, right down to whether we would have access to the OSU-ND game :) If you are looking for a little peace and relaxation, then you won't be disappointed!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was exactly what we needed for our stay. The only suggestion is.
It would have been easier to see from the road the entrance especially at night because its completely dark maybe some reflectors on address or driveway."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! We fished--and caught lots of fish including about a 6 pound bass.....we do catch and release so he is still there...it is lovely and quiet there. Misty was quick to answer all questions and she was very helpful.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was the day before my hubby’s bday and when I tell you it’s was Beautiful thanks to Misty and Her Hubby.The Studio,Pond (My Hubby Caught a Crappy Fish).They have 2 Doggies(So Sweet)….Our Host and Hostess made us feel at home in Every Way.The Hospitality ❤️The Cleanliness,Amenities,Scenery (Perfect).Didn’t Need For Anything (They made sure everything was in already provided.If you wanted to Barbecue,There’s an Air Fryer and An A Hot Plate.Midnight Came and it was time to sing Happy Birthday to My Hubby and there was a Bonfire and Pond with the Perfect Furnishings.We Even had our Puppy (She Got Along Great with their 2 🐶’s.I’m ready to go back and it’s just been not even 24 hours yet….They deserve a Trillion or more Stars"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was very nice and we enjoyed fishing in the pond.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super friendly and responsive hosts! We had to leave early but 100% would love to come back!!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean apartment and misty was incredibly responsive. Kitchen had everything we needed and the trails were great! Only thing we didn’t expect was how many homes were around the property, but we are from the city so it didn’t detour us! Still incredibly peaceful and had a great time! We would definitely come back! Our puppy LOVED running free on the trails and around the water ❤️"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This stay was amazing! The room was clean, organized,and not cluttered. All the essentials you would need were provided as well. The pond was clean, beautiful, and well stocked which lead to very little down time between catching fish. I had never gone fishing before and had a great fishing experience!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Misty is a great host ! We needed a place to stay to break our drive from KY to WI, our night there was very relaxing. If we would have had our dog with us, she would have loved the large fenced in area!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as stated and then some. We fully enjoyed our stay. Great hosts and a great place to stay! The Fergusons, Mooresville, In."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and relaxing space. The mattress and bedding were amazing. Lots included in the space to make my stay more comfortable. The dogs loved their treats too 🐶
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Just came back from spending 3 nights there with my pup. It was one of my fav airbnbs so far. The place was super easy to find and I was impressed by how clean and simple everything was. I’m super picky about how clean a place feels when you first walk in and I had absolutely no issues, not a cob web in sight, and I didn’t feel like I had to keep all my bags off the floor lol. The mini kitchen was just enough for me to prepare the food I packed and the shower in the bathroom is amazing. I specifically was looking for a place that was lowkey, quiet, AND had access to a pond for fishing and this was perfect. I even caught my first 5 pound bass! The hosts were super welcoming and accommodating especially when it came to having my dog with me. I already told them I plan to come back."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay and highly recommend Misty’s place! There were detailed instructions on entry, house rules, WiFi, local things to do, etc. It was the coolest place and complete with everything you’d need. The pictures don’t do it justice. Quiet and peaceful describe this Airbnb, complete with a nature setting and pond on the property. We hope to get back to the area and stay again. 🙂"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The most comfortable bed I may have ever slept on. Plenty of space, nice furnishings. I never saw the lake nor could figure out how to see it. Parking is right in front and private behind their home. It offers basic amenities (coffee but no cream or sugar sorta deal) and is safe and quiet in the country. They have large dogs on the property which didn't bother me at all, but if you don't like big dogs be forewarned. I recommend this space in rural Indiana."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Misty’s place was beautiful! All the amenities were perfect!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were driving from Kentucky to Michigan, hit a severe storm, and wanted to get off the road. Misty was extremely responsive, let us check in with 30 minutes notice, and it was a great choice for us. Far better than any hotel option within 50 miles. We were able to comfortably work from the place the next day and the kitchenette made dinner and breakfast easy. The weather prevented us from getting out and exploring the land, but it was peaceful and perfect for our overnight stay."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay. Nice park like setting in the back. Great space.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Well designed and nice layout. Beautiful property and pond. The kitchenette was well thought out. They even added an air fryer and a blender. These were great amenities to have. Having access to the grill made meal plans a breeze. Loved the shower in the bathroom. We'd happily stay here again. Enjoy our stay there very much! Anyone wanting a few days away to a quiet area should check this airbnb out!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, will definitely have to go to the pond next visit!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was exactly what I was looking for.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don’t do it justice .
Much cuter in person !
And the pond … icing on the cake . Had not been there ten minutes and caught my first fish . We went back out the next morning and I caught 4 more . So much fun and such a change of pace .
Would definitely recommend Mark & Misty’s !"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great. One of the best places I have stayed from air bnb. Misty and her husband was very nice and accommodating. Everything was in perfect condition. Only problem is I never had lime to get to the pond. This is a great place with even better hosts. Will definitely be staying here again when I’m back in the area.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a nice stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Cute and very clean! The bath towels could be cloroxed when washed to take out the musty smell, but other than that everything was lovely! Thanks, Marlene!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marlene was such a great host. Her and her husband were very attentive and made sure our stay was perfect! Great Place! Perfect Price!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,She very helpful when you need something. Very nice person to deal with and would stay again in the future
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marlene was a great host, super to say the least. The cottage was clean and had everything we needed. Beautiful spot right by the river. Hidden back away from the road. Loved it!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and clean place, responsive host"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the River House fully met our every expectation. The house is super clean, well maintained and thoughtfully appointed. In short, all we need and more. Marlene is very responsive to any need, more than fair and a delight to deal with. These folks are the real deal!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful scenery and surprisingly quiet considering how close the other neighbors were.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Beautiful house next to a beautiful river. What more could you ask for…
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely, well kept place! Just a little sketchy when drove up & saw the place to the right. Grateful when we opened our door...the place was just like the pictures!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay, it was close to town and very peaceful and relaxing. We loved the river view and the woodsy area. Marlene was kind and helpful, and her place was a wonderful place to stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a very clean and quiet stay. We would love to stay again for sure. A few issues we had were that the grill was not up kept and there was no charcoal or propane. We would have loved to grill. The rubber mattress cover would not stay on and made it very sweaty but the bed was comfy. With that being said we still love the little cottage and want to go back. We loved the quiet and the sounds of nature. The pictures online are exactly what we walked into. The hosts were there if we needed them which we did not and they gave us our privacy. It was very nice. ( a faster coffee pot would be a great addition) just a thought.
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The inside was clean and cute. The internet on the tv in the living room wouldn’t load Netflix. The outside was full off cobwebs. I had to clean them off the key box to access it. The mattress on the bed sinks to the middle. Paying a $75 cleaning fee I shouldn’t have to clean or clear anything. Only 1 small creamer for coffee and no sugar only artificial sweetener. No cleared path to the rivers edge. Lots of sm tree stumps in the yard and around the fire pit, we both tripped over. My boyfriend has a bad hip and knee, not a good mix. The cover over the grill was all torn and was not inviting to cook on. It actually had a wasp nest by the handle. There was supposed to be lighter fluid to start the firepit but there wasn’t any to be found. The cottage next door was overgrown and an eyesore, I understand they don’t have control over that but it was unpleasant to sit out back. To say we were disappointed would be an understatement for the money we spent."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The location of the house was nice and quiet. All essentials were included. Only thing was the bedroom didn't seen as clean as it should have been.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was really nice and so relaxing!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was neat, clean, and uncluttered. They had some rental options available for fun activities but we were getting rain and couldn’t explore them. Would recommend for anyone staying in the area."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you my stay was good!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My bestie and I had a blast! The cottage was absolutely adorable, and Marlene and her husband are wonderful hosts! Would highly recommend this gem!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Interior photos are precise, it is a true two person only cottage with barn door to separate bedroom. Window AC in bedroom and ceiling fans kept everything cool. Oven, stovetop and kitchen supplies were great, mini frig the only limit. Very close to town and Grissom."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay for the weekend and get away! Lots of things to do around the area, and beautiful view from the back porch!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Marlene communicated very well.
The house was very clean and the bed comfortable.
I have no complaints."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was exactly as described. I wish the weather behaved more while we were there. I liked looking out the kitchen windows and seeing the birds on the river. I would rent again from Marlene.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I enjoyed the stay. The place was clean and furnished with most of what you would need. Marlene was proactive in checking on me and responsive when i messaged her. I met a few of the neighbors and they all seemed friendly. Close to town and a few steps from the river. It was quiet and felt more like home than staying in a hotel. I would stay here again. Hopefully with better weather.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was very quiet and peaceful. There are a lot nature trails to walk nearby if u like nature. We enjoyed our stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was amazing and in great shape. Had everything you could need. Cozy little getaway. Perfect for us as a couple.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Absolutely love this cabin! The view is great and the place is cozy! Hoping to be able to rent this place again! It’s so peaceful and it’s wonderful to watch the sunset over the river!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house and “super hosts” are all you could need or ask for. These folks are the real deal!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great location for those who enjoy a bit of nature but still want access to the local amenities. The view of the Wabash review right off the back porch was splendid. And while there are neighboring homes, this location is well set back from any high traffic areas. It is very quiet.
Marlene provided a great place to stay. Clean, cozy, and well stocked! We will definitely consider this location for a repeat visit!"
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Location is not what we expected.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The stay at Marlenes was quiet, quaint, and serene! It wasn’t a far drive from northwestern Indiana at all. The exterior is a little antiquated and buggy (there were a few tiny night bugs to watch for when coming in and out the back porch) but the inside is beautifully enhanced and so cozy! The house is perfect for couples looking to relax and bond! We were able to take kayaks to the river right behind us for a short paddle by the house. They do have a longer a kayak option with much more beautiful views to see but we arrived a little later to try, we would love to be able to try that next time. The house is fully equipped with everything you needed for the stay. If you are in the area looking for a peaceful stay away from the busy life, this is the place!"
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures of the inside of the house were accurate and it was nice but the outside surroundings were very disappointing and pictures were deceiving.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peru, the circus capital of the world. Marlene's place, the chill capital of the world. 10/10 would go again."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great little cabin in the woods! There are other homes right next door in the little area where the cabin is located. The cabin was pristine on the inside and Marlene was very accommodating.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for 2 nights wanting a quiet get away for my birthday. It was perfect, the cottage is very cozy. I loved that we got to make food over the fireplace like we were camping, but also get to go inside and make food on the stove and then have a cozy movie night. I loved the shower, it was really hot and had good pressure, and the bed is comfortable. We had a great time!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If your looking for a quite retreat with a view of the Wabash River just outside Peru Ind area this cabin is a great value and a wonderful spot . Very quite and secluded it is clean and comfortable and close to town in fact if your a walker you can walk to it . We loved our stay and will definitely stay there again should we be come back to the area.

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"nice location on the river, cute and quaint."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location! We floated on the river right from the bank behind the house. Caveat for other travelers- there is nowhere to unpack clothing, so plan to live out of your luggage. Doesn’t take away from the fantastic experience of this quiet space with beautiful views."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this cottage! It was a very quiet and peaceful setting, and the cottage was very clean. It is also not far from town, which was very convenient. We enjoy walking, so we walked into town and had a lovely time. (Disclosure: There is a short stretch before town with no sidewalk). It was a great place to stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a cozy cottage. Clean interior! It felt like visiting a friend's house. There was everything we needed there. Town had a few cute places to go. relaxing!
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute private cottage! We enjoyed the location by the river and watching the variety of birds in the area as we sat on the back porch! Everything was clean and comfortable, they certainly thought of everything you would need to enjoy your stay!
There were a few hiccups but everything was handled promptly and professionally! Definitely worth the price point!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little cottage! Relaxation at its finest! Perfect little place for a couple to unwind!

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a sweet cottage on the river! Sparkling clean! Beautifully decorated! Everything we needed! Porches on the front AND back of the cottage we're charming! The views of the river from the back were both relaxing and beautiful! Well done!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute place! Stayed on the way to a friend’s wedding and would love to come back when we’re in the area next!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marlene is a great host and quick to respond. The house is perfect. Just as listed and literally right on the river. Fully stocked kitchen, we cooked dinner there and loved the front porch and back deck. Great value."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cool place to stay for a weekend getaway. Super clean, super friendly people and you get to look at the river drinking your morning coffee. Just a heads up for people with bad backs like me, the bed is super soft. The kind of soft that sucks you in. Wasn't great for my back but still deserving of a 5 star review. Nice place"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here!! It was very cozy and modern inside the cabin. It was a very quiet area and we felt safe.
Marlene thought of little details in case you forgot to pack something as well, which was very thoughtful.
I highly recommend this cabin if you’re looking for a cozy getaway."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to rest after a hectic day in town.
This is the most beautiful Airbnb in Peru, IN.
Thanks Marlene for the stylish touches and the comfort of your wonderful home."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had a really nice stay at this cabin over labor day weekend. Marlene was really helpful about planning a few lovely surprises for my partner. She created a lovely display of chocolates, local wine, beautiful flowers, and baked treats that were waiting for us on the table when we arrived. They also allowed us to rent a couple kayaks and Marlene's husband dropped us off up river for a truly fantastic afternoon on the water. We saw bald eagles, hawks, turtles, and jumping Asian Carp, and didn't see another person the whole time! After 3-4 hours on the water, we pulled up right beside the house. Super easy!
The cabin was very clean and well appointed inside, though the exterior is a little buggy (mostly harmless spiders, but one or two stinging bugs to look out for). It has a fairly new interior with newer windows and doors. The kitchen contains a full-sized range, oven, and microwave, and a mini-fridge. The bedroom has a queen sized bed with a soft mattress on a wobbly frame. The mattress had a thick plastic cover under the fitted sheet which was both a little noisy and somewhat uncomfortable (sweaty) to sleep on.
The location is on the water as pictured, but it's a bit of a walk down a dirt embankment to a shore made of large irregular concrete blocks.
If you're sensitive to smells, let them know ahead of time so they can unplug the air fresheners.
We appreciated Marlene's guidance on some interesting things to do in the area. My sense is that they will answer any questions you have and address any concerns you share to the best of their abilities.
All told, it was a lovely place to stay and I can't speak highly enough of Marlene and Marvin. They are attentive, honest, and helpful hosts who are committed to helping their guests have a good visit.
Also, if you're looking for a place that is more secluded, you might prefer another cabin they own that is a bit more rustic. We might stay there on our next visit if it's available!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing! We enjoyed the cabin so much; it was the perfect size for the two of us, and the perfect little weekend getaway."

2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a couple. View of the river was great.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I went for the 4th of July weekend and had so much fun. We went down town to walk around and hang out at the winery.
The house was super clean and cute! We loved the little snacks too (: we decided to kayak so Marlene and her husband offered to pick us up and drop us off up stream."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay for the area. The place was beautifully set up. I Would recommend it to anyone who is needing small town getaway.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy, clean cabin on the banks of the Wabash. We loved opening the windows and hearing the sounds of the River. Very convenient location, the snacks were appreciated after our drive and the bed was super comfy!"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay for me because I wanted to ride The Nickel Plate Rail to Trail over the two days I was there. The space was perfect for one person, finding it cozy and comfortable. Overall my stay went well."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great little place on the river. Consisting of just 3 rooms it’s just big enough for a couple. We had everything we needed at the house with some extra snacks included. The fridge was a little small but we managed to fit all we needed for 6 days. Checking in and out was very simple and the cleanliness was top notch. We didn’t find a ton to do in Peru but within an hour of the house there was plenty to keep us entertained. All in all I would recommend to any group of 2 who wants a nice place on the river.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay very quiet and clean. Sitting on the deck and watching the river is peaceful we will return for another visit.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a nice little getaway trip to this cottage. Small, quaint, and relaxing. Everything was laid out well in the home, and we enjoyed the little treats Marlene left as well. Local restaurants were not far, and Marlene's recommendations were great. Overall a good time!"
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was great and we enjoyed our stay there with only a couple issues. This cottage is what I imagine a Febreeze factory would smell like. I unplugged the air fresheners, but the residual fragrance continued to bother my allergies. This isn't an issue for most people, but it can be a REALLY BIG issue for some.
Also, the dorm room style refrigerator doesn't hold a lot and turned our milk to ice.
Otherwise, it was clean, quiet, and everything worked as it should.
I would stay there again, if I could get her to remove the air fresheners a few days before our arrival."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I came here for a solo getaway and everything was absolutely perfect. Being so close to the river was so relaxing, and I still can't get over how comfy the bed is! I will definitely be back here next time I make my way around"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was easy, clean, nice aesthetics, I especially appreciated the comfy bed (big and soft) and the fire pit next to the relaxing sounds of the birds and the river rapids. I recommend this place as a little get away or a retreat mid camping, etc."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cosy and tidy!
Super convenient!
Effortless communication with host!
I was doing some volunteer work with the International Circus Hall of Fame down the road, and I needed a place to call home while I was doing it.
This riverside cabin fit the bill to a tee!"
2021-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Great time. Very relaxing

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely little getaway. Marlene was super kind and accommodating, extending my stay easily when I asked. It was a perfect place to rest."
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,My wife and I met here while I was doing an away rotation in Northern Indiana. Marlene's AirBnB is a lovely quiet little retreat by the river. The kitchen is fully equipped for making meals. The heating system was a little confusing at first but once it was up and running the place stayed nice and warm. Peru is a pleasant small town that is easily within walking distance or a quick drive from the location with numerous little dives to check out. I would happily stay here again for a relaxing weekend getaway.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful comfy stay right by the river
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy and stylish cottage to rest and enjoy after a hard day at work.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay! We had such an amazing time and were able to do a lot with the space given. We were able to cook our own meals and we were very close to town to get take out as well. There was a beautiful view in the back and the cottage was so cozy. I loved how clean it was, especially right now with covid. They were super quick to respond to questions and was so kind! The bed was extremely comfortable and loved that we could log into our streaming services on both TVs. It was really a great stay and we really enjoyed our time there. Hopefully we can stay there again in the future!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a cute place for a weekend getaway!! We didn't expect much fun in the winter but the beautiful river view surprised us at the first glance. We saw birds, ducks and swans on the river. We drove down to get some meat from Kroger and throw them on the griller. Sunset and grilled ribs are such a good combination."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This listing is everything described and more. The hosts truly are super! We will return without any hesitation.
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Newly remodeled and stylish place right on the Wabash River.. Appreciated the goody basket for guests!! We were in town for a wedding and were in and out, so this small space had everything we needed.. Bed was very comfy! At first glance the surrounding houses might seem a little sketchy, but we never felt unsafe.. If we weren’t there in the winter, we would have probably took the host up on renting the kayaks.. Would stay again!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Nice modernized cot. Super cozy and clean. Love having the river in the backyard and very quiet and serine environment. Will definitely be back for another getaway with the Wife
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great little place to stay. Marlene and her husband have made this little cottage in to a super comfortable and modern space. I liked it so much I plan to stay there again soon.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very clean, tastefully furnished space as advertised by most accommodating hosts. Would certainly recommend to others."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A adorable little space that is tidy, cozy, and clean. We loved that the back deck overlooked the river. It was just what we were looking for - affordable, quiet, and clean. There were so many thoughtful touches, too!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sparking clean. Right on the river. A nice cozy place to stay.
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very nice space to stay the weekend. It was very clean and cute!Included a mini fridge and amenities to cook, as well as a fire pit. They even provided fishing poles upon request! I will say the bed was smaller than expected but overall the place was very nice with lots of cute touches around the place."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is a cozy retreat and with the all new tasteful reno’s you can feel safe on the cleanliness accept. All new fresh and clean. No one mentioned the TV system is pretty awesome to do some binge watching both in living area and bedroom. I enjoyed the spacious kitchen to do some cooking. It is nice and bright with good lighting and 3 nice ceiling fans. Yes the bed I saw mentioned in a review is small just a double, though that is all that would be able to fit. I don’t think I saw mentioned as an option, there is an air mattress there and I wouldn’t have hesitated to set that up on the clean floor with the extra bedding available. I am hoping to see if they do another reno to host in the near future."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Marlene’s place is exactly as pictured- so cute and comfortable. Exactly what we expected! Many very thoughtful touches.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cottage was a wonderful place to stay! Very clean and cute!! It was nice to sit out on the back deck in the mornings to drink coffee and watch the river. Hosts were wonderful! Would definitely come back again!!

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful cottage, looked like something off HGTV. Right on the river! Quiet and peaceful. Perfect for nice relaxing vacation."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an incredible time at Marlenes place! The cottage was so clean and fresh and welcoming. There were very thoughtful touches all around. When we first checked in, her husband got some firewood for us so we didn’t need to go out. We loved exploring the town of Peru, and Marlene gave us great recommendations. I loved watching the river flow out back and the sunset over it.
I had seen in an earlier review that there was a confederate flag in the neighbors window. We were slightly nervous about that, but didn’t see any flags or really anything of that nature during our time in Peru. Everyone was very welcoming and friendly."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Would absolutely stay again!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a vary quite cozy place with very accommodating renters. They were very responsive in communication and provided a list of things to do!

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was great! We enjoyed our little stay as we relaxed and enjoyed some quiet time! Very clean and had great amenities and snacks!!!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We will definitely be back! And next time we will bring fishing poles. This little gem is right on the beautiful river, and better than we imagined. It was perfect for our 1 night stay, and wish it would have been longer! Super cute space, and very clean."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great little place! Perfect for our plans to go somewhere away from people for a bit. The inside has been completely remodeled to be modern just as pictured. It’s so clean and well organized. Marlene has a lot of really thoughtful touches - good snacks (Frosted Flakes!! 🤤), toiletries, a few dvds and games, and plenty of towels. The WiFi and streaming worked well. The bed was comfy and the decor was well done. Oh, and the water pressure in the shower was amazing.
Having the river right out the backdoor was really nice and the backyard has a fire pit and some firewood (didn’t get to use it bc of rain but looking forward to that next time). I do need to mention that the next door neighbor had a confederate flag in the window, which made us uncomfortable. We did not see or interact with them at any time. Obviously this is out of Marlene’s control and she was nothing but kind and welcoming to us.
The town of Peru is quite small but we found a few places to eat and a great ice cream place.
Marlene was a wonderful host. Had to reach out a couple times and she was very kind and super responsive. Overall, we were really happy with Marlene and this little cottage!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful little cottage, perfect for couples wanting to spend quite time, relaxing with a great view of Wabash River right out the back door.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and great hosts. Would absolutely stay at this location again. The river is beautiful, especially at sun rise / sun set. Perfect for couples."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house sits atop a hill over looking the Wabash river. Nestled under the shade of several trees is this very clean comfortable home. You have your choice for outdoor seating either on the front or back porch. After a quiet night's rest, I awoke early, made a fresh batch of dark roast coffee and sat quietly on the back porch listening to the early morning sounds. Then as the sun began to rise, the sky turned from pink to orange as I walked down to the rivers edge, there I sat and gazed long enough to watch as 2 bald eagles, the female carrying a fish. They both flew so close that I could see the color of their eyes. As they stopped in mid air and flew up over head, red tailed carp rolled in the shallow waters below. If you enjoy quiet, peaceful moments in time, you're gonna love this little oasis."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,quiet super cozy super clean with great response time to any concerns very close to downtown peru i would definetly use again

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Awesome place to stay. Worth the money and 10 minutes from every thing yet a million miles away.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet had a very lovely cabin and me and my girlfriend enjoyed our time very much. It did take a couple of minutes for us to get some help with which cabin were staying in as there is 2 others on the property. The cabin was as clean and Janet provided some nice amenities.

He kept saying, “Lita, we need to come back!”🥰🥰 Thank you, Janet!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet is the nicest and sweetest person I’ve ever met and she has the best air bnb I’ve ever stayed in. It’s perfect. Close enough to the city but far enough that you feel peaceful. The forest is beautiful and the surroundings make you feel at peace.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was absolutely beautiful. Very peaceful location. Didn’t have enough time to do the amenities but will definitely be back again soon. Janet was amazing and very friendly. Can’t wait to go back.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this cabin with Janet! The space was just what we needed to get away for the weekend. Peru is a charming town with many neighboring towns as well. Janet's property was beautiful and welcoming; we loved saying hi to their horses and donkey. The cabin was well-kept, large, and private. We really enjoyed getting to use many of the amenities, the firepit, kayaks, sauna, hottub, and more. I would love to visit Janet again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My family and I reserved this cabin for our parents 50th anniversary! They enjoyed their stay.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm so glad a friend recommended Janet's cabins—it's an incredible resource for anyone involved in SCCA/etc shenanigans over at the Grissom Aeroplex. Super cute, and only 7 minutes from the site. My cabin was clean, comfy, and relaxing—and a much better vibe than the hotel rooms I would have had to drive to Kokomo for. I will absolutely be booking again next time I'm attending an event in the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Janet was an amazing host. She greets you when you arrive and makes you feel welcomed. She goes out of her way and provides extras like sodas, candy, coffee, and popcorn, etc. available for your use. Janet is the hostess with the mostest! She is very kind and compassionate She gives you privacy as well. The cabin was great!!! It was very comfortable. It is a great getaway. It is close to wonderful local restaurants. It is next to the Grissom Air Force Museum which was fantastic. My son and I enjoyed great father and son time. The cabin comfortably sleeps two people. But there are three other rentals onsite if you are traveling with other couples. It is a beautiful place at a reasonable price. We also enjoyed the donkey and horses onsite. She has available kayaks, corn hole, hot tub and sauna. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch swing and rocking chairs. I would highly recommend Janet's. place if you need a peaceful retreat from the busy hustle of every day life. We plan to return."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay. It makes you feel far away from everything. However in reality everything is just a quick drive away.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I have traveled extensively and Janet was the friendliest and most accommodating host we have encountered. On her own time she went out of her way to get my son and I a couple of kayaks for my son and I to use at no additional cost even though we offered. She has lived there her whole life and went out of her way to make us feel at home. The fridge was stocked with a variety of name brand soda pop and the bathroom was even full of toiletries.

The pictures are fine, but the actual space is super cute, comfortable, extremely clean, and remarkably quiet, even being on the bottom floor of a multi-apartment dwelling. I felt safe in the area, which was extremely close to the Amateur Circus (my reason for being in the area) and my other favorite Peru spots.
Linda was so very kind and a real pleasure to communicate with. She has paid attention to every detail (*except one tiny request) and even put in extra touches, like juice drinks chilling in the refrigerator and York Peppermint Patties on the bedside table!
I really enjoyed everything about Linda’s listing and will definitely stay at this location again!
*I’ve been so spoiled by my recent AirB&B hosts that I just took for granted that this location would have shampoo available in the shower/bathroom.But that was my fault."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved this place. Probably the best surprise I've had in my AirBnB experience. Very nice place. Matches its name.
2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This is what I would call an efficiency apartment. You walk into the kitchen area with no table and chairs for morning coffee. and straight ahead is the bed and off from that is the stand up shower and small sink and toilet. One wing back chair is beside the bed. You also have to do your own dishes before you leave which I think should be the host responsibility to assure for the next guest that they are cleaned right. I don’t remember reading that before I made our reservation.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Linda's place was super cozy. It was a great place to stop for the night to rest before we went on with the rest of our trip. Linda was very sweet and responsive to my messages.

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice clean and super homey
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda is an excellent host who provides guests a comfy place in a very walkable neighborhood. This little apartment is fairly quiet, under other apartments, at the back of the attached building with a dedicated private parking space for one car. There is a full kitchen with stove/range, mini-fridge stocked with water and a couple of sugar sodas. Perfectly stocked cupboards with cookware, dishware, etc. However, there was no place to eat, and no warning of this before we booked. Only one chair and it was a big wing chair, not one that you could move around for eating. There's just no room for small table & 2 chairs in current kitchen configuration. So we needed to eat every meal out, rather than being able to cook. For one person, it would have been easy to cook, then eat by the bed in the wing chair, but for two people, it was impossible. Internet was excellent and fast, but as stated, no place for 2 people to work on laptops at the same time, unless one is in the bed. We were there in winter (snow, down to around 20 F at night), and the whole apartment stayed toasty warm. Didn't use the TV, which is atop a dresser, with router behind. Huge closet for your suitcases and hanging clothes. Tiny bathroom with it's own room heater! All-in-all this was a great stay in a sparking clean and pretty private apartment in the best part of downtown."

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda accommodated my fiancé and I at short notice while we were travelling for the holidays. Everything was fantastic!

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Needed a place to stay the night while visiting family in Logan. This was a perfect place to stay overnight. The place was very clean and comfy. I would highly recommend and will be using this spot for future stays!

Parking is readily available and neighbors were very friendly. Highly recommend.

I was pleasantly surprised to see a mini refrigerator with complimentary beverages as well. Linda was always available and the neighbors are all super friendly and welcoming. I'm sure this will be our ""go to"" spot when we travel to Peru again."

Not only was Linda incredibly gracious and accommodating regarding our check-in time, but she and her husband both took the time to ensure our stay was absolutely perfect. Even when I had a question, she responded immediately! I can’t thank them enough for their hospitality. The space was the perfect size for the two of us, and the kitchen accommodated cooking anything from a full meal to a midnight snack. LOVED the shower! It’s huge, and the tile is beautiful! The location couldn’t get better. You are right on the edge of downtown, so walking to local shops and restaurants is quick and a blast! It is also incredibly close to grocery stores and other restaurants throughout the town!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My absolute priority wherever I stay is cleanliness. This property exceeded my high expectations.
I also appreciate a well-equipped home when I am traveling. Small things like a few cold bottles of water, a bowl with snacks, paper and pen, ziploc bags, and extra paper products make for a more convenient and easy stay. This property had all of those amenities plus much more.
I have already booked this property for a future stay in the area. It was one of the best properties I’ve booked through Airbnb to date. Thank you!"

This was a total score of a find!!!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the best AirBnB experience we have had. Perfect description and every little detail was attended to. It was lovely to have body wash and some shampoo/conditioner stocked, waters in the fridge, and a few snacks on the counter. The Kcup selection was also great! The bed was very comfortable, as was the couch. I am so bummed they aren’t open when we’re in town next. Book this spot!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! The place is new, had all the things that we needed and it was spotless. As a bonus upon arrival, when we looked outside the window, we saw two deer and a red squirrel outside - it's that quiet and secluded. The host was kind to provide a generous bowl of snacks in the kitchen and was always available via the app, when we had questions.
The place is stand alone house, so there was no one above or below us, which is perfect. If you're looking for a romantic getaway for two, this is definitely the spot!
Thank you for hosting us; you have a beautiful place!"

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place. Comfortable, clean, convenient and affordable. The only caution I would have is that there really isn't much privacy between the two beds. This was not an issue for us but might be a surprise for others if needed or desired. It isn't especially clear from the description or photos."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Historic stay! Thanks, Cole!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully decorated with the Cole Porter theme. Comfortable and clean. Communication with Cole was easy and pleasant. Lots of space if you had a family of four or two couples. If you are a fan of memory foam mattresses, the bed will serve you well. Also, be prepared to take a bath instead of a shower. It might be tough for those who are elderly though. The kitchen is very small and limited, so you may want to eat out instead. We didn't spend a lot of time at the apartment because we were visiting our son, who was at Culver Academies for the summer, so it was a good place to stay for that purpose."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We couldn’t stay for long but it was still a great stay! Good bang for the buck suite in Peru! Would definitely recommend
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow, we loved this place! Such an amazing time, we’ll be back for sure! Highly recommend this to anyone visiting Peru or surrounding areas."

My parents and I stayed there and immediately felt the historical warm welcome of our hosts. We spent the night reading to each other about the life and legacy of the influential musical protégé from Peru Indiana! My mom even had a dream where she was visited by his family!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have lived just an hour away for many years, but have never taken the time to hang out in Peru. The Cole Porter Inn was the perfect place to do so! There is so much history in Peru, and in the Inn itself. When we arrived, we put on some Cole Porter music, and read up a little bit on this remarkable musician. Our suite was very quiet and restful, and everything we needed was there. We had one minor issue (my fault!) that required us to call the hosts, and they were super-helpful and responsive. We had a wonderful time, and really enjoyed our stay. If you are looking for a great place to stay in or near Peru, this is it!"

TONS of towels in the bathroom! Lots of delicious snacks! and we loved drinking our 6th Street coffee and swinging on the front porch!!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far my favorite place I've stayed at this far. Julie and Russ were very welcoming and met us at the house to give us a tour. You know sometimes pictures are very deceiving but I was delighted that this place met our expectations and more! It's very comfortable, well stocked for anything you may need and is very cozy. We had a great stay and definitely will be back when we come!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay in this AirBNB! The owners were wonderful, very helpful and accommodating. The location was perfect for the weekend's activities, and the home felt cozy and comfortable."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have been staying at Airbnb for 3 years, Russ and Julie’s place was the best yet.
Super homey, amazing amenities, extremely clean, very, very comfortable.
We especially appreciated the fact that Russ and Julie meet you and introduce themselves to you- that was special.
We were in Peru for a golf tournament and we really hope to get back so we can stay at Russ and Julie’s again!!!
10 out of 10!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home, immaculately clean, very comfortable and the hosts met us in person to check us in. Judy left amazing treats and lots of everyday essentials in the bathroom and kitchen. Will definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A very lovely place to stay. We stayed here to be close to family in the area. This place provided all we needed and more.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay. Comfortable and convenient.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Russ andJulie are extremely personable and have a sincere desire to make the experience pleasant for the guests. Would definitely stay here again. The house has everything you need to cook, do laundry, sleep."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Hosts were very friendly and responsive. The house had everything anyone might need to use.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was spacious and lovely. We biked the Nickel Plate Trail and it was convenient to the trailhead. Both Russ and Julie met us at the door and were very patient with us as we had to run a quick errand and then got stuck in traffic and were later than we initially thought.
Russ and Julie were incredible hosts offering us ideas as to what to do and places to eat. We will definitely be biking the Trail again and hopefully stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Clean and no issues. Worked great for a business trip.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"House was nice and clean, Russ and Julie took time to go over everything and to make sure we felt right at home."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,we had a very nice stay at Blue Swing Flats. we travel a lot for business and have stayed at many hotels and AirBnB's. Russ and Juile's place was very nice and close to downtown. very clean and the hosts were great to communicate with. we will definitely stay here again if it is available. I would recommend Blue Swing Flats for anyone that is visiting Peru or going through.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is obvious that this is a passion for Russ and Julie as opposed to a passive income. They take tremendous pride in their place and enjoy sharing it with others. They go above and beyond with little things, like providing pastries from a local bakery. I liked that in the provided binder they shared the history of the house as well as things to do and places to eat locally."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay, once again! Thank you, Julie and Russ, for creating such a homey space to lay my weary head at the end of the day! I took advantage of the Riverwalk and a remarkable self-guided tour of the neighborhood with its remarkable architecture!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie met me at the door and was super friendly. She actually took me through the house and showed me all of the features of the home. I stayed in the room with the firm mattress on the bed. It was wonderful!!! There was a full bowl with chocolates and hard candies. After my long drive from Ohio, it was a welcome surprise! I was so impressed with how pristine everything was. I am looking forward to returning next week!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Got an amazing deal on this place for a week stay while in town for work. Russ and Julie have put a lot of thought and hard work into making this place comfortable for the guests. I dont think there is anything i could have needed that wasn't already there. It was very clean and beautifully decorated. Bed was comfortable and i felt right at home. There was a binder put together with all the local attractions including restaurants and other things to do while in town. Julie was very responsive when i had questions and provided excellent recommendations when i asked. There were some local treats left for me upon arrival and Russ and Julie met me to show me around the place. Very friendly and informative. I couldnt have asked for better hosts. I would absolutely stay here again if i come back to the area.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was very nice. We are bass tournament fishermen and stay in some pretty sketchy spots just to get an electrical hook up for boat batteries.
This place was awesome and homey. The only thing we missed was a coffee pot as there was a keurig and plenty of those coffees but we are coffee snobs and forgot our travel pot but made it ours on the stove the old fashioned way.
Jayne is a super host for a reason!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,ok
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"We are from the area and were there to take care of some family business, so we didn't spend much time at the house. It was definitely peaceful and private....had it been summer, we could have really enjoyed the big deck. Jayne was a great host. She was very friendly and always responsive. And it was reassuring knowing that she and her husband were close by if we needed anything."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed my stay. It was so peaceful and relaxing
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful! This property was perfect, we felt so comfy and right at home. It was close enough to town, absolutely will be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really appreciate all the snacks they had for us.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the best Airbnb stays we’ve ever had! The property was even better than we expected — beautiful scenery, cute home touches, and exceptional hospitality. 11/10."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. The house was exceptionally clean. The artistic touches and local antiques make the house very warm and inviting. We had fun playing corn hole in the evening. The gypsy wagon on the back of the property that the couple has refurbished is awesome to visit. Jayne and Keith were friendly and responsive. I would recommend staying here.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jayne’s place is magical. A cosy, comfortable getaway on a quiet rural road, enhanced by Jane and her husband Keith’s incredible artistry. This place is way more than just a place to sleep. It is a wondrous, living museum of art, history, literature, horticulture, woodcraft — you name it. Do not pass by an opportunity to soak in this special place. Barn quilts, Adirondack wooden boats, a lovingly constructed vardo traveling wagon are just some of the delights . . ."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Grateful Earth Farm is a comfortable and relaxing place to stay just outside of Peru, IN. Jayne and her husband were kind hosts and fun to talk to. I took advantage of being less than a mile from the Nickle Plate Rail Trail to take a nice evening ride South toward Kokomo, while my wife and daughter explored the river front park and picked up groceries not more than 2 miles away. Highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, clean, well-appointed, and very cute. Comfortable bed."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am a repeat customer, which in my opinion, speaks for itself. Jayne is a great communicator. The space is relaxing and comfortable. I'm sure I'll be back again!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,All was great. Only suggestion is fiigitr out why maps led me to an empty parking lot. Using Waze found the way and all was well from there.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place. Stayed for 8 days. Beautiful view, quiet, clean and host was extremely accommodating and response. I would reserve again if I return to the area."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we have stayed at this particular Airbnb and that is because we love everything about the place! As soon as I sat down when I first arrived, I felt relaxed. It was a great place to start and end our day. It is beautifully decorated and all the details are attended to. I highly recommend this space and will look to stay here again in the future."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this charming guest house! It was the perfect place to stay to enjoy the Cole Porter Festival. It was clean, spacious and had every amenity you could need. Lovely outdoor deck overlooking a meticulous yard. Plentiful continental breakfast. Just a great place to get away from it all!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t stay at any hotel around Peru, Stay Here!! You won’t be disappointed! Just perfectly adorable! We loved the location, the decor, the awesome breakfast items, and so clean!
The linens smelled heavenly! We can’t wait to return and sit under that beautiful tree! Loved it!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,There were very clear instructions and the space was very clean and organized. It was an extremely quiet and relaxing location. There were many books of interest. We never looked at our phones or turned on the television. Easy place to unplug and unwind. Close to downtown Peru but you wouldn’t know it. Great hosts! Quick to respond to our request to stay an extra day. We were there for a weekend of golf. Close to many great courses.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best air bnb I’ve stayed at. Great location, relaxing. Deserves every 5 star rating it gets."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jayne is prompt and welcoming. Her place is serene and quiet in a lovely setting
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This host and her property have well earned all ""5 stars"" in every category! Jayne has created a whimsical and interesting environment for her guests! This home was undoubtedly cozy and SPOTLESS! #comfortable beds
Honestly, I wanted to stay longer to read several of her books.
We found THE BROADWAY CAFE in downtown Peru to have an excellent cauliflower pizza, a welcoming staff, and a nice atmosphere."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was a wonderful stay would come back
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jayne's place is fantastic! Even nicer than what the pictures show. Everything was perfectly clean and well stocked (e.g., lots of pillows, blankets, toiletries, etc.). And she had some nice touches in the kitchen - plenty of Keurig coffee, bagels, coffee cake, and a few other light snacks. It is decorated very nicely, kind of like an upscale antique vibe. The only ""negative"" is that the TV in the living room was rather small, but it's such a cozy place that unplugging/not watching TV is probably a good thing. If ever back in Peru, my wife and I would 100% stay here again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Grateful Earth Farm guest house is delightfully charming! The decor gives you so much to look at and the furnishings are cozy and comfortable. I especially enjoyed the vintage circus theme in the bathroom, an important theme in the circus city! We enjoyed our special night away at the Grateful Earth Farm guest house!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place is very lovely and clean. We appreciated the continental breakfast left us. We had a quick stay on our way home after a Norte Dame game and having the continental breakfast meant we didn’t have to stop someplace to eat breakfast on our way home. Check in was very easy. I would highly recommend this place!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What every Airbnb should be like
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cute place, we really enjoyed our stay. We rode the Nickelplate bike trail on a Saturday and Sunday, and stayed here Saturday night. Jayne has clearly thought of all the details; she had breakfast foods, coffee and snacks, as well as shampoo and soap available."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our night here. The home was clean, cozy and spacious. We'd stay here again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was clean, very unique, and the owners were very nice."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"wonderful location. We live in Indiana and we're travelling between South Bend and Bloomington and this was just off the main state highway heading south. The hosts have done an amazing job making an exquisite private guest house that is separate but close to teh main house. The details show their abilities. The porch, outdoor seating area and the interior is dripping with personal touches and craftsmanship. The woodwork, carpentry, handmade quilts, and attention to a farm style decor is all very wonderful. The location is quiet and very, very clean. Even the porch and outdoor seating areas look like they get regular attention. The grounds were extremely tidy. We stayed in an upstairs area that had stairs, but we are fit and able so it was no problem. The unit had two bedrooms, one had hand painted murals. There is one full bath (walk-in style tub/shower) for the two rooms and it is standard guest bathroom sized for an average house and clean and tidy. The kitchen was very generous, and fully functional. We will stay again and next time we'll bring our two young daughters."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful surprise in Peru! The family and I loved every minute of our stay at Grateful Earth Farm. Jayne made us feel so at home. We enjoyed strolling along the gardens, looking for frogs in the pond, playing with our kids on the back lawn, and enjoying a peaceful dinner on the deck. Great touches inside were mixed with all the amenities we could need. And if you are lucky, as we were, you might get a quick tour of the grounds and learn a little about the history of the place and its astonishingly creative and talented owners. Our family will definitely be back."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I spent a couple of days riding our bikes on the nickel plate trail. This perfect location was easy to go north or south for a nice long day trip. The place is beyond cute and the people are incredibly sweet. Highly recommend anyone!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing! Idyllic Farmhouse Retreat! We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Peaceful and lovely; Jayne was a wonderful host that was thoughtful and gracious. Can't wait to return!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I can't possibly express how much we enjoyed our stay! The space is enviting and comfortable! The attention to detail is amazing! We drank coffee on the deck to start our day and ended our day on the deck as well. Everything was perfect in my opinion and I will definitely look to return the next time I'm in the area.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a wonderful place! There is much to love. We would absolutely stay here again.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay here! Jayne was so nice to communicate with and responded quickly to everything. The entire guest house had to be the cleanest of any place we’ve ever stayed.
There was obviously a lot of care put into making each room unique; this couple obviously loves sharing this space with people. The continental breakfast was a perfect start to our day.
We came to town to visit a friend and all three of us stayed here for the weekend and had such a relaxing time visiting and playing board games. We cannot wait to book here again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful piece of paradise! We enjoyed exploring the tiny town of Peru. The bakery and coffee shop were outstanding and lunch at Garden Gate was delicious.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place is so peaceful & relaxing. The hosts think of everything you could possibly need & have it already in the space. They are super quick with responses on any questions or comments. We can’t wait to stay again.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jayne is quick to respond to inquiries. She provided very clean accommodations. This was a peaceful location

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this apartment on a small farm in Peru, close to the Nickel Plate Trail. We rode our bikes twice and loved it. (We drove our bikes to two different access points.) The unit has a well appointed kitchen and is an airy yet cozy space. Warm and thoughtful hosts and interesting things to see in the home and on the property, including a renovated gypsy caravan. We'll be back!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice clean and a very nice view over the pond. Would stay again. Great atmosphere very homey.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It's the little things in life that can make a big difference! Jayne's little touches truly elevated the stay!
A cute little apartment decorated with love and well maintained. Plenty of space for our group of 4.
The muffins, bagels, juice, and milk added a genuine touch of hospitality that you don't often get from a one-night stay at an Airbnb.
Jayne was responded quickly to our enquiry and texts along the way. A quick but personal welcome was another one of those little touches.
We would all stay here again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute, comfy and clean were the top three things we liked about Grateful Earth Farm guest home. Everything was just as described and we really enjoyed our stay. It’s a really neat little country gem."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Amazing touches! The continental breakfast was so appreciated. Very comfortable and colorful with ideas of places to see in the area and fun things to do if you're staying in. Coffee on the deck was great too! Loved chatting with the owners! We would highly recommend this place.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,10/10 would recommend! Really enjoyed that the owner of the property personally welcomed us upon our arrival and the barn is a charming little place with all the amenities we could ever ask for. We will definitely book again if we’re ever back in the area!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jayne’s place was the perfect location to stay when going to an event at Grissom. She has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable. We travel frequently, and have stayed in many vacation rentals. The bed at Jayne’s rental is probably the most comfortable we have slept in. The sheets were perfectly soft. She has continental breakfast fixings available. Her response to emails was always prompt.
Anytime we are in this area for an overnight stay, I hope this cute little guest house is available."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hey :) please enjoy my review and experience:
Context- I had a last minute personal trip that I had to run to with a few of friends. It came up quick and I didn’t have much time to react. We had to drive all night and needed a place to stay for the weekend.
Communication: Due to the nature of my trip, someone replying to me quickly and efficiently was something we really needed so we could get on the road ASAP. Jayne responded quickly and efficiently.
She was patient and warm in her responses about my questions (which I found out later, some of the answers I needed were already in her listing, my apologies!).
Hospitality: Jayne was incredibly warm in answering my questions. She was also personable in her responses and her amenities. She left us continental breakfast stating that we might need the “COFFEE” :).
Since we drove all night, it would mean checking in early would be a major advantage because we would be arriving very early and very tired. My host was flexible in allowing us to come early which meant the world to us. We were very tired from driving 14 hours.
One of my friends was outside and happened to run into her husband when she was outside. She said that he was a very pleasant individual and enjoyed their conversation. He even asked if there was anything he could do to improve our stay which was super appreciated.
Airbnb: Our cute place exactly like the photos (so accurate marketing!). It was a quiet and comfy home in Peru, IN. Our hosts took their time in adding personal touches to the home from decorations to plates and coffee mugs. We slept very well in the cozy and comfortable beds. The place was clean and spotless when we got it.
One cool amenity with this Airbnb different from most was an outside shower. This shower was located right under the deck stairs. A couple of my friends thought that it was the coolest thing in the world and tried it out.
Thank you for an amazing stay. ❤️
6/5 stars."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Grateful Earth Farm! We found everything to be comfortable, clean and welcoming! The space feels very private! Great job Jayne!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Far beyond what we expected! Extremely clean! A great breakfast variety! The set up for the kids with the extra bed and the cute comforter which my 6 year old loved were above and beyond. ❤️ They absolutely loved the yard and the tree swing. We slept so well in the comfy beds and enjoyed drying off after our showers with your super soft towels. 😃 Having breakfast on the deck was just lovely. Super quaint and quiet. We will definitely be coming back to stay next time we are in Indiana! Thank you so much for a great experience!
-The Keith Family of 4"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a place to stay, look no further! This is ideal for all travel parties, including children. The space is larger than the pictures show and the deck is huge! We had aunts and cousins over with plenty of room inside or on the deck. Staying on the farm reminded me of home and where I came from. It is beautiful outside and Jayne has really put her craft-style stamp on the inside, every nook and cranny. This accommodation exceeded my expectations! If I can attach pictures I will. Thanks, Jayne!!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The stay was Lovely for a quick overnight. For the price, the owner did provide cereal, milk, and coffee for our family for breakfast. I also drew to the owners attention and extraordinary amount of bees crawling under the gutter. With a child allergic to bees, the owner sprayed the area and allowed our family to use the side entrance to avoid contact. The apartment above their barn was clean, and allowed our family to comfortably sleep five as the owner also provided an extra mattress for our children. Lovely experience overall and would recommend the barn apartment to other families.Finally, the owner also was beyond responsive in messages and quickly addressed things. We had no issues and were able to check ourselves in. We didn’t even meet the owner during our stay."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful place to stay!! So clean and quaint. Great hospitality and quick response to any questions. We will definitely stay here again when we return.

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice and very clean. One of the nicest places we have stayed at so far.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Grateful Earth Farm Guest House was the perfect place for us to stay as we returned to Peru for a family funeral. Although we grieved, we were comforted by its peaceful surroundings and the nostalgic decor. Jayne was flexible with our scheduling requests and when we arrived, late in the evening, the lights were on and the kitchen had been stocked with nourishing foods. Everything was spotlessly clean and we really felt at home. The bath linens were as soft as clouds. Had it not been rainy weather, we would have spent even more time on the outdoor balcony to watch the birds in the meadow and listen to the pond frogs sing in the evening (there was a tv with cable, but with such a view, we never needed it!) Such a nice place, kind people, and very comfortable, the essence of Hoosier hospitality."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adorable, comfy, clean, spacious space. We were in town for a funeral, and were able to find this last minute. Jayne was a gracious host and made a sad time much easier. Beds are comfy, living room and kitchen area are lovely and large enough for a family or two couples. Nice amenities too."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jayne's place was cozy and I felt very comfortable when staying here. Jayne was excellent about communication. It was a great place!

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jayne’s place was phenomenal! We loved everything about it. I’ll definitely be back! It’s so pretty and peaceful. Jayne welcomed us and made sure there wasn’t anything she’d forgotten before running to the store, which was very thoughtful. She is an amazing host who thought of everything! There were bagels, muffins, fresh fruit to eat. She had coffee, milk, orange juice to drink! The space was spotless, beautifully decorated, and felt like home. I must say she also had the fluffiest towels ever too! I, 100%, recommended staying in the Grateful Earth Farm guest house."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would give Grateful Earth Farm (and Jayne!) far more than five stars, if I could. If you are questioning whether you should stay at this Airbnb, question no more. You will not find a nicer, cleaner, more charming and wonderful place to stay than this one. A few months back my brother and I had planned to visit several state historic sites in northern Indiana. I looked at many Airbnbs in Fort Wayne and Lafayette and all the cities in between. After much research, I decided on Grateful Earth Farm. I am so glad I did! Jayne stayed in touch from the time of my initial request onward and answered my inquiries promptly. We found the place to be absolutely spotless and incredibly warm and welcoming – Hoosier Hospitality at its best! She thought of everything – from coffee, juice, milk, fruit, bagels with cream cheese, muffins, cinnamon bread and cereal for breakfast to toiletries, magazines, fluffy towels and the most comfortable beds ever. We spent Sunday morning eating the leisurely breakfast provided by Jayne and relaxing on the deck before our departure. My brother was truly taken aback by the Jayne’s kindness and consideration. He simply couldn’t believe all that she did to make our stay perfect. Jayne, a heartfelt thank you from the two of us. You made our wonderful weekend infinitely better. - Nan"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jayne's house was one of the nicest Air Bnb's I've stayed in! She was so hospitable. I was in town for a wake/funeral and she was kind enough to give us a couple extra hours so we didn't have to pack up before the funeral. She left lots of snacks and breakfast food. The decorations were adorable and the place was spotless. My favorite part was watching the stars on the huge deck attached to the house. I would highly recommend Jayne's place!!
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jayne’s place is a little piece of paradise right outside of town. She was an amazing host and her place offered a comforting place to stay for the weekend. The bed was super comfortable as well! I would highly recommend staying here.

I was looking forward specifically to enjoying the hot tub. However, I discovered that the hot tub was in an indoor room on the lower level of the house next door. I expected it to be outside and close to the cabin. So I decided not to use it. But the rest of the experience made up for the disappointment."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great
,,,Hosts were great at first until they began to come over nightly to check on their property. Felt really unsafe with that. kicked us out a day before checkout so they coukd clean! put all of our stuff on the porch.
,,,"Can't begin to express how unhappy I was with this attempted reservation.
I chose the property as it looked to have potential, paid, then waited.
And waited and waited. I reached out to host via text, phone and AirBNB messaging. No responses. I assumed I would get one, and continued my drive in the direction of the AirBnb. 30 mintues past, than an hour, then more hours. No contact from host. No directions or instructions on how to stay.
Arrived in the general area still without contact. Stress level rose. Contacted Airbnb. They tried to reach Janet, couldn't.
So I was stuck. Listing said ""no refunds"". There were no hotels in area. It was getting dark.
what should have been a stress free stay in a cute cottage turned into an expense ridden journey, where I had to backtrack many miles to find a hotel. Additionally spent a good four hours in text and phone conversations with Air bnb just to get a refund for this place.
Dont be surprised if you get no response from host after paying!"
