2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Our extended family stayed at the house while we were in town for the wedding of our son. The house was spacious and comfortable with all of us there. Our only regret was not planning to stay longer because we enjoyed the peaceful surroundings and house so much.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect for our visit. We were close to all of our destinations. Close to town, but still far enough that we didn’t feel crowded. The house is beautiful!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved it. plenty of space for our family gathering. All of them are talking about coming back again for our next get together.
So much better than trying to gather in a hotel.
We were really taken the views of the sunrise and sunsets. We could even see the northern lights from the lovely back yard on Friday night.

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stayed here for a Girl's Getaway for 2 nights, 3 days. Senior ladies, three of us mobility challenged; we selected this home because there were 3 bedrooms on the main floor and it was described as handicap accessible. There are some suggestions we will make to enhance senior/mobility safety, but the home was lovely and quite comfortable with beautiful views. There is a beautiful front porch and back patio with seating along with extensive outdoor area for kids to play. Although the location is secluded, both historical Richmond and it's business district is only 10-15 minutes away. Planning to return with family and grandchildren in the future."

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Oh my goodness! Jean's Yellow House on the Hill was the perfect place for us to stay during our family reunion weekend. There was plenty of room for 8 of us (two different families) to hang out together but also have private rooms for sleeping. On two nights, we had additional family members join us for visiting (back deck, spacious front porch, large space for yard games, beautiful sunset). We gathered in the family room for a genealogy presentation, and were able to use the dining room and living room for displaying pictures. Jean was a great host! We hope to return soon!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the place was perfect!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were recently in Richmond for a wedding. As city dwellers, we thought it'd be fun to spend the weekend in the country. We were not disappointed. Jean's home is absolutely lovely, and surrounded by beautiful meadows and wide open space. We especially enjoyed quiet mornings out on the huge porch watching deer and listening to the birds.
This home is immaculate, cozy and spacious. The kitchen is well-appointed, the beds are very comfortable with nice-quality linens. The baths are spotless and well-stocked with everything we could have needed.
Jean was very responsive and helpful in our few communications. All in all, it was the perfect weekend get-away and we would definitely stay here again when visiting Richmond."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at this Idealic setting. What a beautiful and tranquil place. It was just as described. the pictures don’t do this place justice. It feels like you’re 50 miles out into the country when in reality, you’re only 3 miles away from the city and the stores.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jean’s place! The house was bigger than expected and very comfortable for our family.

Jean is a friendly and flexible host. We will definitely stay here again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, tranquil setting. The home is even nicer in person than the pictures portrayed and much bigger! It fit our large family perfectly. Many upscale finishes, everything was very clean and tidy. I love the antique finishing touches. The location was close enough of a drive to all the locations we needed, the picturesque rolling hills and neighbors’ farm setting was comforting.

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"I hosted a small family reunion (50 people total including ten children) at this house and it was absolutely perfect! The floor plan flow makes moving around very easy, and offers plenty of spaces for feeling like you're all together or small nooks to have more one on one conversations. The front porch and garage were nice alternatives for additional space if we weren't able to be outdoors due to rain. The expansive property gave us plenty of room to spread out for kickball, croquet, bocce ball, and other games. And out of town family had places to stay for the night. This house would be great for small family gatherings, smaller office parties, work retreats, and baby/wedding showers.
The host was wonderful and accommodating to our specific event. I really couldn't have wished for anything better. And the 360 views from every window in the house are amazing!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfectly equipped and spacious for the whole family. We loved seeing deer in the field at twilight. We’ll definitely stay here from now on when we come to visit.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This hilltop home is beautiful, peaceful, spacious, and so comfortable. With four bedrooms, three on the first floor, accessibility for old knees is appreciated. The kitchen is well equipped, the beds comfortable, one downstairs room with twin beds is decorated for kids, and she has child-proofed all the outlets we saw with protectors. 3.5 baths allowed for all of us to have our own space. I loved having the Bluetooth speaker and business center with printer for doing the bit of work needed, and streaming my favorite music. Roku tv in the living room and in the upstairs bedroom also worked well. Hummingbirds visit her feeder often, and we were told to watch for deer but didn't see any. The ""yard"" is enormous, grass cut widely but with flowers and longer grasses beyond. So loved watching the sun go down from the patio, and the swallows swooping for bugs at dusk. Her property abutts a pasture of shy cows, but we didn't hear them moo from the house. I am so happy to know Jean's home is there for us the next time we need a getaway."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Yellow House on the Hill was absolutely amazing. So spacious! Felt like home! Loved sitting out on front porch with cup of coffee in the morning and on the back patio in evening and watching the deer. Close to restaurants and yet quiet country setting. We will be back again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a beautiful home!!! The setting was phenomenal with the sunrise off the front porch and the sunset at the back patio. Jean's house was absolutely perfect. Our trike group enjoyed the opportunity to stay at this wonderful home. It is completely equipped with all you will need for your stay. We loved the opportunity to cook our own meals and even enjoyed the barbeque grill. Jean is just a phone call away, if you need anything. The hammock on the front porch was a great way to spend a lazy afternoon. We will definitely come back when we are in the area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home and great location! Very private and quiet. Excellent home for a large group or family. Host was very attentive, home was extremely clean and comfortable."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I booked this Beautiful Country house to come to my daughters graduation in Earlham College. I couldn’t have found a better place to stay. Just 10 minutes away from Earlham, on the out skirts of the city, but still close enough to everything. We loved our stay. Super clean house with amazing views through the house. The Host is was very responsive to my messages. We locked the bottom lock of the key pad entry lock and she came to help my family within 5 minutes.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a bit of trouble unlocking the door but Tina rectified that right away. It was Thanksgiving weekend and the kitchen was well supplied with utensils. But I had forgotten to bring my grater and she brought one over to the Carriage House immediately.
My husband and I stayed in the room downstairs and my son, his wife and 2 small children slept upstairs, it was really nice for them to have that space to themselves.
Lots of blankets and linens were provided. There were space heaters in the bathroom and kitchen which added a nice touch. And coffee fixings were there to start our day!
It was a very good experience and I would like to go back sometime when we are not so busy with family and Thanksgiving."

She was a very pleasant and knowledgeable host. My granddaughter attends college in the area, and we will likely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Gennett house carriage house was a beautiful AirBNB. We loved how it was decorated, and everything was spotless and designed with a guest's comfort in mind. Our boys played with the board games on hand, and the host, Tina, even offered to give us a tour of the historic Gennett mansion. It was incredibly interesting to talk to her about the history of the area, and we took up way too much of her time, but it was much appreciated! We would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I've been visiting Richmond a lot recently and have grown tired of the hotels that have sprung up around I-70. Well just a few miles down US40 - Richmond's Main Street - is this delightful little carriage house behind the historic Gennett Mansion. 1000% better than a hotel and conveniently located too. Loads of vintage charm - since it was a originally a carriage house it feels like a cabin inside. The kitchen is nicely stocked with cooking essentials - we visited the Farmers Market on 6th Street the Saturday morning of our breakfast and made ourselves delicious dinner and Sunday morning breakfast! Also just down the road from Starbucks and other restaurants and across the street from Glen Miller Park.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Awesome Cottage! We loved our time in Richmond. Tina was the perfect host, and I would love to stay again. She has games, books, paper products, and kitchen staples, which is most convenient. All the beds are comfortable for a good night's sleep."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We reserved to attend a family wedding. I appreciated the well equipped kitchen so that I could assemble the wedding cake! It was a relaxing space when we weren’t busy with wedding details. The groomsmen were able to use the upstairs for preparing and chilling.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a fantastic experience! My family loved the guest house so much, it was such a beautiful and cozy home away from home. We appreciated how well-stocked and pretty everything was, and Tina was a fantastic and helpful host at every turn. The Gennett Mansion is a beautiful piece of Richmond history, and it was a joy to be a part of it, and have the opportunity to learn more about our surroundings.
This was easily my best experience with any type of guest rental or AirBnB, I fully plan on booking it again next time we're in town. I recommend this AirBnB wholeheartedly!! You can expect a comfortable and charming stay that will leave you with a greater appreciation of Richmond."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very nicely maintained, cute and a perfect place to access the Universities in Ohio - which is why we were in town. The town itself did not have a lot to do but had the essentials of grocery and necessities. Looked like it was once a vibrant town that now has a lot of vacancies due to shifts in industry. We needed a base to go back and forth to Oxford, OH to Miami of Ohio and that was perfect. Tina was thoughtful and had little kind details like a welcome card and a gift for us for my son's graduation. I would stay again. She was organized, had all we needed for a easy, short stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was wonderful! Clean, quiet, and perfect for myself and my friends."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Staying in the carriage house was so special. It’s historic and sits behind a beautiful, well known historic mansion in my hometown.

A bonus for us- lilacs in bloom on the property!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My daughter and I came to town for a funeral and needed to find a place for just a few days. Tima accommodated our check-in and check-out times outside the posted times which was so helpful to us. The home is so cute and beautifully decorated.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My mom, sister, and I stayed at this location for our first ever girls getaway and we absolutely loved this place. As stated, it was the old carriage house to the Gennett Mansion in Richmond, IN that has been updated into a guesthouse. All I can say overall is WOW!!! Not only was this place beyond our expectations of cleanliness, location, communication with the host, size, and character, but it is also rich in history of Richmond, IN. We had so much fun learning about the history of Richmond and the Gennett's and ended up choosing the perfect weekend to go as well as it was their annual fall festival. There was so much to do in this location and this place is seriously the most adorable guesthouse. Tina was the ultimate host, always responding in a timely manner and she also offered us a tour of the Gennett Mansion which was the perfect close to our trip. We definitely plan on staying here again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was just perfect for us. It was straight out of a Better Homes and Garden magazine. The house was very clean and well stocked. There was a nice seating area out back that was perfect for hanging out.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy yet spacious house was the perfect place to spend time during my anniversary! Theres plenty of things to do in the surrounding Richmond and Liberty area, including hiking, museums, and the old Gennette Records building (my favorite trail as of yet). Tina was responsive and even allowed us some leniency on check out due to our crazy busy day! I am definitely going to be returning!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was so clean and cozy! The area was so cool with all the historical houses in the town! Found several local food places and thrift shops that were a lot of fun to experience. We plan on staying again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Location was perfect for us.
Check in was easy.
We came in late and left early so did not get to enjoy the beautiful outdoors as we would have liked."
2024-04-01,4.0,Group trip,Very cute cottage with plenty of room. The gated entrance wasn’t working and door to house left unlocked so not very secure. Hair all over the sheets on one of the beds and check out instructions required us to strip our own beds so the cleaning fee seems excessive.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay, would definitely recommend to others coming to Richmond!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just as described in the listing and such a sweet and darling cottage! The location is so incredibly beautiful and peaceful as well! Nicole was so incredibly kind, responsive, and accommodating. I booked this place last minute in a winter storm that I was traveling in with my daughter. We were so thankful to get off the road, and so pleased to have such a cozy and lovely place."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for hosting us! The only thing I wish we had was the history of the brick home on the property! Watching the deer from the living room window was a fantastic bonus!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! We were in town for a last minute work trip. We had a minor issue upon arrival but Nicole went out of her way to take care of our needs and to make sure that we had a very comfortable stay. She was super responsive and helpful and checked in on us throughout our trip. The house was beautiful and absolutely worth the stay!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Nice with enough space for our large family. We were warned about the low kitchen seating so we didn't use the kitchen at all. The description was accurate but the spiral staircase was a bit of a surprise. We tried to keep the small children on one floor. The games were great and the upstairs and downstairs living areas are large and comfortable. It was a bit musty smelling. Great for a one night stay with five adults and four kids
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Nicole’s place was cozy and comfortable. It was the perfect place for a quick girls’ trip. Lovely location and Nicole was a helpful and responsive host. My friends and I are already trying to plan when to go back.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at this cute and spacious cottage. Feels like home. Attention to detail was nice, and there was plenty of stuff to cover us in case we forgot anything. Good selection of books and games to browse through. I really like the outdoor patio even though we didn’t have much of a chance to enjoy it on this stay because of rain.
Really appreciate the private entrance it feels very private and secure. Instructions were given with pictures, which is always nice :)
Thanks for having us we will definitely stay here again !"
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Place is private, gated, secure, unique, host was flexible and communicated well. While pleasing to the eye it could use a facelift."

2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,Our family enjoyed the time we spent there. Beds were not real comfortable. Treacherous steps from driveway. Lovely location.
2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,Quiet place. Worked for our large group.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were staying in the area as we were from our if state and attending my mother's funeral services.
As the loss of a loved one can greatly impact your ability to think straight I mistakenly booked for one night instead of two.
I received a call during my mother's funeral service which I didn't recognize and when in the limbo on the way to the cemetery I returned the call and found we should have been in the process of checking out as they had someone else booked for that day and needed to clean.
My daughter's rushed back to the Airbnb to retrieve our belongings which the cleaners had graciously placed in bags for us
The hosts were very interesting and only charged us an extra $50.00.
The cottage was very quaint and had everything we needed for comfortable stay"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful house with plenty of room for our whole family. The location was amazing and the house is well stocked with games and books. I would definitely recommend this for families.
2023-08-01,3.0,Group trip,"Description had listed the kitchen as fully stocked. There were seven of us staying there, and I don’t think we even had enough forks to use for one of the meals. So we had to wash dishes because there is no dishwasher but we had to wash in order for everyone to be able to eat. Also, I believe the listing says that it can accommodate 12 people but the table, I think only had three chairs at it. The living room definitely did not accommodate that many. There was a really musty old smell when we came into the house. The outside furniture wasn’t very clean so we were not able to use that. And in the kitchen, it was quite dark. There was one light in the kitchen that had two bulbs, and one of the bulbs was burned out. There was no light over the sink . Main bathroom shower water did not come out that great.
Hosts were very responsive and kind."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we stayed here and it’s so nice to have a private and quiet place to be when we were done with our day. The house is great, it has such character and they hosts were always super quick in their responses. Super great place 10 stars if I could."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We used this location as a staff retreat. There were five wonderful and comfortable bedrooms, two bathrooms (so everyone had their own space and we weren't crowding one another), games available, a walking trail, a beautiful back patio under the trees, and a space for us to gather for accomplishing work as well as bonding. This will certainly become a yearly retreat center for us."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,absolutely wonderful place! can't wait to come back as soon as possible!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a great place to stay if you have a large number of people traveling. The nature walk to the waterfall is a short hike for a cool reward and the house all-in-all is quite private.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is in a beautiful setting. Peaceful/quiet/easy to get to restaurants shopping, etc. Two friendly neighborhood cats welcomed us. Many original features to the cottage -- bedrooms are small with various sizes/types of beds/comfort. Host is very responsive to questions/concerns."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The cottage was a lovely space to share with our family while in town for our oldest son's wedding. The accommodations were clean and comfortable. lenty of space for the 8 of us to spread out. We were together without being on top of each other. The grounds were beautiful and the outdoor space was perfect for the cool evenings especially for this group from Florida :) The location was very convenient for our wedding events in Connersville. We would certainly stay here again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The stay was great! Very simple and easy check in and the host even had a bottle of wine for the guests! Definitely would stay again.
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Its a beautiful setting,but when we got inside it felt like someone lived there and just stepped out while we stayed a night. There were glasses and a ring on the counter. A plate with leftover food under the upstsirs twin bed. The full bed upstairs really creaks with every move! The wine was a delightful gift, we say thanks!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect spot, perfect place. So happy we had this location and I hope to book again. Glad for the extra attention paid to every detail."

She even came over very quickly after I checked in to bring me a new coffee carafe and coffee. The house has everything you need for a comfortable stay. I loved that I could get up and have coffee and sit out on the terrace and see the squirrels in the trees behind the house. It was also close to great restaurants, a waterfall and a greenway to walk or run on! Overall a great place to stay. Thanks for sharing your cottage with us. Carmella and Tom"

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a lovely stay. The home was very safe and it was conveniently located. We were dropping off our younger daughter for her first year of college at Earlham. The home only about 2 miles from Earlham, so we were close and could go back and forth easily. The unit was well stocked and the den was comfortable and welcoming. Our daughter's godparents traveled with us and there was plenty of room for everyone. It was also very close to the grocery store. I would stay at the home again the next time I visit Richmond, for sure."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend. Very peaceful and quiet
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We had a family reunion and those of us from out of town stayed at this cottage. We were able to sit around and visit with each other. The cottage was close to a grocery store and not far from I-70. They were very gracious in helping us to find parking for a third car and for our truck and trailer as we were moving our son from Bremerton, WA to Groton, CT. We would stay here again."

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We reserved this Airbnb for the girls in my bridal party, and they absolutely loved it! It’s such a cute little cottage in a nice area of Richmond, and Nicole and Madelyn were very responsive and kind. :)"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at the cottage! It’s very comfortable for our family with separate living spaces upstairs and downstairs. We enjoy the surrounding nature, but with convenient access to all of Richmond and interstate 70. Looking forward to our next stay."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we first got to the house it hadn’t been cleaned, I contacted Madeline and she cleaned it that evening while we were out. When we got back I noticed the food I had stored in the fridge was gone, I contacted Madeline again and she brought back most of the food to us. After that there were no issues, it was a nice place in a nice area."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a charming 1950's ""cottage"", actually a two story affair with living space and rooms on both floors. It's in a gated area, up the hill from the highway and commercial enterprises, a very quiet location with lovely grounds/landscaping. There are outside patios that look engaging, but the weather was too chilly for us to enjoy them. We did walk the trail to the waterfall, but unfortunately the ground was too soggy to get a close look. Some nice wildflowers along the way. Sitting in the upstairs living room, you are looking out into tree tops. The decorations and art works on the walls are quite entertaining - someone clearly has a flair for that. Not something we usually see in an AirBnB. I particularly enjoyed the Parisian scene painting hidden away in the bookcase - you'll have to find that! The surprise hostess gift was greatly appreciated, at the end of a long day's drive. And - the ultimate test - we got a good night's sleep in this quiet, secluded setting. This was an unusually interesting AirBnB rental, and very reasonably priced (all things considered). We would definitely book it again if passing through this area."
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!!!

2022-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"Great location, loved all the views. Just be mindful of bigger groups. The house isn’t suited for the 10+ people it says. Bring paper towels and napkins (even for 1 night). Hosts were very nice tho."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice cottage, plenty of space, well decorated, had everything one needed. The bed and bedding could have been a bit better but overall a really nice stay."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Felt private, house was as expected, nice to have some extra items from past guests like coffee and jelly. The beds were of varying degrees of comfort. If it were a full house there would definitely be some disappointed guests but for the 4 of us, we were able to Goldilocks our way around and find a match for everyone. Such a sweet touch to leave a bottle of wine for us! We arrived late the first night at hadn’t had a chance to grocery shop- fortunately we had a drink all ready for us to help us land softly!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spent a rainy weekend in Richmond with my family. Quaker Cottage was warm and comfortable, and there were even two wood burning fireplaces. We made some good memories.
Easily accommodates a crowd - there are 4 bedrooms, a pullout couch in each of two living rooms, and a large capacity washer and dryer."

Two real wood burning fireplaces are also available, however we didn’t have any wood so bring some if you plan on using. The bookshelves are well stocked with cool books and magazines as well as games and some toys for kids. We really loved that a high chair and pack and play were available as well (since we forgot our own)!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nicole and Madeline are two of the kindest and most hospitable people you could ever find. Love their place and will definitely book this place again!

2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely cottage with wonderful spaces for multiple activities. Beautiful setting. Responsive hosts. It was an ideal place for our 5-person music group to spend a week while doing performances in Indiana.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cottage was perfect for our family! Convenient and peaceful!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend. Like others have mentioned, there was plenty of room for our family of 5.
If you get the chance, take the hike down to see the waterfalls. The host had games on hand which our kiddos surely enjoyed. Nice & thoughtful little touches throughout which we appreciated."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was so nice to be able to have ALL of us together. It was clean and cozy! We would definitely stay again!
2021-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"What a lovely property and very cute and cozy but spacious older cottage! Deck and patio were great, looks onto mature trees and is separate from host's house. Tons of privacy and a locked gate to drive in with code is appreciated. Great for a family with kids bc bunk beds in one of the 4 bedrooms and a kitchen on each level. Nicole and Madeline are lovely, prompt in communicating and clear about directions and house rules, though we did not meet them. We really liked having 2 levels with 2 bathrooms and 4 bedrooms for 5 people. We appreciated no smoking anywhere on the property. The bottle of wine, welcome note and starbucks beans for use to grind were very nice and thoughtful touches. We would only suggest considering upgrading the bedding and pillows that have been well used, and to include taking out the garbage, doing dishes and stripping beds in the cleaning fee. We found past guests washed their dishes with questionable effort. It was overall a very clean space but could use a handyman touch up or two."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Charming and quiet old cottage surrounded by mature trees. It felt secure and charming.

2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The path to the waterfall was fun and adventurous but absolutely overgrown. Do wear pants and shoes. There is not a large dining table if you a big group but we had a great time and the home was cozy and Nicole and Madeline were great at communication.
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This space was a great value and location for our stay in Richmond. There were plenty of sleeping spaces. The two
Living spaces were nice. Check in was a breeze. We would definitely stay here again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed one week at Nicole’s very cute cottage to see my family. The description and photos are accurate. It is definitely an old house, which could use some work, but is otherwise just fine for a short visit. The neighborhood feels very safe, and the house is secure. If you’re traveling with small children as we are, you should be aware of the spiral staircase in the main living room, and be prepared to block access from them. We enjoyed our stay at the cottage, and hope to return on our next visit back home to Richmond."

2019-09-01,3.0,Group trip,We found the cottage to be nicely decorated but in need of some cosmetic upgrades. The kitchen was stocked with the basics and is in need of mixing bowls and a baking pan. Hot water was plentiful and the water pressure was good for showers

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing! It's a lovely cottage with a lot of old-time charm. It was a perfect stay for our family with 5 adults and 2 kids. We only stayed for one night but would be suitable for an extended stay for multiple people. The cottage has two levels with two bed rooms and one bathroom on each floor. Overall there were 2 queen beds, a twin bed with a twin trundle and twin bunk beds. The couches were also quite comfortable for sleeping. There is even a 2nd kitchenette on the downstairs level. It was cold and rainy so we didn't get to enjoy the balcony but it is surrounded by woods and would be lovely in the Spring and Summer.
Everything we needed was available, including basic toiletries such as shampoo, conditioner and body wash. It's very secure since it's on gated grounds.
Check-in and check-out were simple and easy and we couldn't beat the price for everything we got.
Very pleased and hope to return soon!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely recommend. There are a ton of nice touches and details that are rare amongst Airbnbs typically: spices, condiments, plenty of towels, games that still have pieces and are playable. The pinball machine and arcade games are great. My biggest complaint is they didn't have pictures of how great the view of the fall colors is from pretty much any window in the house."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A wonderfull cottage. We loved staying here. It was super clean and comfortable. Kitchen is big and everything you need is there.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was brief as we just spent the night, but it suited our needs. The kids enjoyed the arcade games."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I loved the aesthetic of this cottage! It was a cozy and comfortable place for my family of four on our mini-getaway. The kids loved the downstairs game room and my husband and I enjoyed having our morning coffee next to the woods in the backyard where we were visiting by a deer.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, cute, and comfortable. We were visiting family in Richmond, but I also wanted a home base for some down time. The house was perfect-quiet area but easy access to restaurants in historic area, antiquing along 40, and trekking around Whitewater."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"This space did not work well for our family. The kitchen is in down in the basement which was inconvenient with little kids. We didn't have a good spot to eat dinner as there are only two chairs at the upstairs table. the backyard would have been nice for the kids to play in but the grass was high. The water in the refrigerator has hardly any pressure so filling up water bottles was a chore. Most Airbnbs I stay at takes care of the trash etc for you, but here you supposed to get the trash out to the detached garage before you left, which is just one more thing to do when trying to get pack up and in the road. There are more knick knacks than I wanted to keep kids away from. Cute house and cozy decor-just did not work well for us ."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. This home is cozy, comfortable, and full of character. Our hosts were kind and welcoming and communication was excellent. We particularly appreciated the view of the trees and landscape from the many windows in the living room and the wonderful sense of history in the cottage.
We were in the area to ride the Cardinal Greenway and access to the trail is just a short drive from the cottage. After biking we very much enjoyed a stroll around the beautiful grounds at nearby Earlham College. Richmond has a wonderful sense of history and place. On a previous visit we really enjoyed visiting the Gennett Walk of Fame, a must visit for jazz and history lovers!
Thank you Kristen and Mark for allowing us to visit your wonderful cottage!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed your clean, cozy home as a quick rest place on our long journey. We even took time to play a couple of the games you had available."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the woods view. In town but not.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall it was a really nice stay. The place was clean and welcoming. The neighboorhood was nice and peaceful. Though not a particularly walkable area, we did walk to a nearby yard sale and the neighbors were friendly. The directions for where to park and check-in/out were clear. We had a slight issue with the wifi connecting to some of our personal devices during our stay, but the hosts were responsive and friendly."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the perfect location between Centerville and Richmond.
We loved the Centerville antique mall.
Excellent restaurant choices surround you. This is a very private and peaceful location."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful vintage home with beautiful hardwood floors, but tastefully upgraded. We slept well and were ready for a day on the bike trail that is located less than a mile from there house on a quiet country road.
They provided excellent recommendations for the dinner in town and our stay was just what we expected."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We had no issues whatsoever. Very clean and beautifully decorated.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a little confusion at check in with the key code, but Mark & Kristen were very quick to respond and rectify the issue! We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the house, our 2 year old grand son had a blast. There was something for everyone to do, from the game room to just relaxing in the back yard. Very peaceful and calming to relax out back in the evening. Would definitely recommend to all!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house and yard are reminiscent of an era gone by. It feels historic yet has updated bathrooms and feels clean. The drive to the house was through a less affluent part of town so that feel did not match the feel of the actual house and surrounding area. Also if you are particular to strong smells that you would encounter in an older home then this might not suit your needs. Overall we enjoyed our stay. The area is so green and quiet.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice place. We used it for an overnight stay on a long trip. Was sorry we came late and had to leave early. Very responsive,helpful hosts."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property in a home with an historic feel. Easy to get to and keypad worked well. We didn’t need to interact with Kristen and Mark during our short stay which suited us just fine.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Abington Cottage is a cute and clean bungaloe with some amenities that other places simply don't have.
It's far enough out of the city to be peaceful, but close enough that it's easy to access shopping and fooderies.
The downstairs game room was a big hit with my group. It's nostalgic, charming, and relaxing.
This place felt very homey.
Much thanks to Mark and Kristen for hosting our group!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Second time we’ve stayed here and we love it. It’s so peaceful and great for a weekend get away!

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cute little house was just as advertised. It was well maintained and very well provisioned. It sits on a pleasant, secluded lot where deer appeared in the mornings. Entry was easy. We appreciated the porch light that came on at dusk so we didn't have to come back to a dark house. Thank you, Mark and Kristin."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location for stop over between IL and WV. Relaxing backyard and great club/boardgame room. Big family room and comfortable beds. I recommend dinner at Colonial Inn and breakfast at the very cute bagel shop across the street from the Colonial Inn.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a lovely cottage. There was unique decor throughout the house, and the kids loved the American themed bedroom too. They also have a beautiful backyard with a nice patio area. Our only small suggestion for them was to add more cable channels or Netflix, Hulu, etc. There did, however, seem to be a very good selection of board games that we unfortunately did not have time to enjoy as our stay was only about 12 hours. We'd definently enjoy staying again if we're ever in the area!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was great and offered a very nice and quiet retreat after a long day on the road. Our daughter loved the America room! Highly recommend if you’ll be staying in the area!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mark and Kristen were fast to respond when we needed a place to stay on our travels home. Tucked away from the city it was perfect for us.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A great place for my family and I to spend the night! The beds are comfy and the upper-level shower was just what we needed after a day on the road. It rained quite a lot while we were there so we didn't get a chance to sit out on the patio, but it looked nice from the windows. We also saw a family of deer passing by. The downstairs den/dining area has a fully-stocked book and game shelf that we took advantage of. All in all, comfy, welcoming, quiet, and nice."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"extremely nice well decorated super clean great cabin in Richmond indiana!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I stay in a lot of Airbnbs and this one totally blew me away! Super spacious, quiet, and homey. Very clean with clear directions on how everything worked. I wish I could live here full time. An absolute dream."
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"Not a senior-friendly home. The few steps into the house are fine, but the kitchen is in the basement. A walkout basement, but not on the same floor as the bedrooms. A bad remodel job was done on this home. The plumbing wasn't done correctly and the floor transitions are awful. Many tripping hazards in several doorways. Basic TV was nice, but the TV itself is the size of a large computer monitor. Good thing it's on a cart that you can pull closer to the seating area. Beds all need new mattresses."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place to stay!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at this charming cottage!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Directions provided by the hosts were top notch. The only thing that caught us off guard was that the kitchen is in the wall out basement. The room adjacent to the kitchen is a cool place to play a game or hang out with your other guests.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great house. loved everything about the house. if we have a need in the future to stay in Richmond we will definitely see if it is available. highly recommend. great hosts.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a quaint and comfortable stay, even complete with creaky flooring that reminds you of a nostalgic stay at grandma's house. Everything was accurate and clean and centrally located.
Only issue I had with the property is parking under a tree that left thousands of little spots all over my car. It did come off the windshield fairly easy, just hope it comes off the body as easily."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You know you’re at a wonderful Air Bnb when you envision actually living at the residence on a daily basis! This cottage brought my family and I joy during a time of traveling for a sad occasion. I could see how a few families could stay here together and still feel like they have their own space. There are intentional touches, such as the loaded games to please the guests. For those with mobility issues, be aware the kitchen is located downstairs. Would highly recommend staying here if you find an open date!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,beautiful cottage! perfect for our family of five to stop for the night on our travels. so much nicer than staying in a motel! I hope we can stay longer next time. I definitely recommend this place.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I stayed here on our drive from Harrisburg, PA to Colorado Springs, CO. The host accepted our last minute reservation request quickly. We enjoyed our stay. Everything was very clean and inviting. Easy check in. We loved looking out the back window into the backyard, we saw an opposum and deer. The TV was pretty small for the space but we were out checking out the town so didn't bother us much and looking outside was a treat for us being from a city. We would stay here again!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was nice. Lots of rooms and beds, tastefully appointed and decorated. Ample towels,pillows, and blankets. The grounds are beautiful and if it hadn’t rained— we would have been outside all day! But being stuck inside was just fine due to the lovely space. We chose this place to meet our son halfway and celebrate his birthday. Also got a chance to check out a local Amish grocery store! Hosts responding quickly to the few questions we had when we arrived. Checking in was easy as was check out. Would stay here again. (Also enjoyed watching the family of deer enjoy their evening meal)."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cheryl was very responsive and even checked to see if we needed anything. I loved that she has kept and is restoring the woodwork inside. Looks beautiful! Keep in mind, it is an older home and not an upscale, modern dwelling. With that said, it was clean, quiet and very relaxing. She also had the kitchen area stocked with coffee's, tea, ice and basic needs. I always appreciate that when I don't have time to stop. If I had one negative it would be the sofa wasn't very comfy. However, we just put the cushions on the floor in front of the fireplace and it was great. I would stay here again as I'm in the area often."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a home away from home. It’s a perfect place for dogs or kids. There is plenty of room to spread out with the upstairs and downstairs. There also was a park and playground across the street. The neighborhood is very nice and very nice to walk around. I loved sitting on the front porch. Cheryl had everything we could possibly need.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Cheryl’s homes are perfect for visiting Richmond, walkable to Earlham College in a neighborhood that is quiet and peaceful and itself good for walking.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Cheryl was the best host. The place was just what we were looking for, we always visit Richmond every year to see our grandchildren. We usually stay at a hotel , but had a bad experience in 2022, so we decided to try a airbnb, best decision we made. will always choose a airbnb and Cheryl place was the best.....Thank you Cheryl for sharing your home with us, very grateful...."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was clean and the supplies provided by the host were excellent (much better than other rentals I’ve experienced). Communication to and from Cheryl was great. And the location was good!
The only thing we struggled with was poor water pressure and coordinating 6 people in one bathroom in the mornings."

I will absolutely be back next time I am in Richmond."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very lovely two night stay! Home very very comfortable and warm on our cool fall nights. The kitchen was very clean and well stocked with dishes and pans and the whole house was very clean and attractive. Cheryl was great about giving recommendations for restaurants and quickly answered any of my questions . We all slept well! We will definitely stay again if back in Richmond.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cheryl's place was probably the most lovely Airbnb I've ever had the pleasure to stay in- spacious, welcoming, clean, and it felt like coming home. Being so close to Earlham was incredibly convenient.
One thing to note- I did find out the hard way that sound travels incredibly easily from the first floor down into the apartment below, and I disturbed the guests downstairs the first night. Just something to keep in mind for future guests!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was absolutely perfect for our weekend away. We have 3 young kids and there was plenty of space of each of them. The adults had plenty of room as well and everything was clean, organized, and set up perfectly. We will happily book again!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,We had another enjoyable stay at the Westside Guest House. We have been staying here once a year since 2011. It has become our Richmond “home.” We love the porch and the park across the street. Cheryl is always very responsive to any needs but we usually don’t need anything because everything is already there. My only complaint is that it is becoming harder to find open dates for our stay. That is a tribute to this great place.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay. Spent a lot of time on the porch watching the squirrels run by and listen to the bird chirping. Very peaceful place and great location.

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is not our first time staying at this location. It has a lot of space. It is a great location in Richmond: there’s a beautiful park across the street and it has easy access to the downtown area. One of our favorite things about it is the porch. We seem to spend a lot of time out there, relaxing. Cheryl is fantastic! I highly recommend this location."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was very clean and exactly as described with lots of space. Cheryl reached out to us to make sure all was ok and see if we needed anything. I have two young kids and the park across the street was great for them. The front porch and front yard were also very nice spaces to spend time.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the 2nd time staying at this specific house, and it was exactly perfect for our needs. Comfortable furniture, extremely clean, spacious kitchen and comfortable beds (which is not always the case for me in beds away from home). You absolutely cannot beat the price for the comfort, space and location (close to Earlham). I always look to stay at one of Cheryl's properties when visiting Richmond."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This location was close to the Fairgrounds - which was where I was working. It was a quiet neighborhood. It was also close to the Historic District which is my favorite place to visit when in Richmond. Cheryl was great at communicating with me - this was especially appreciated since we were there during the recent fire.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay for
visiting Earlham.
Clean and comfortable"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was an amazing stay while I worked. The closs proximity to awesome parks were awesome for my wife and daughter!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cheryl was very helpful and wanted to meet all our needs.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We arrived on a cold January night to find a very warm, cozy and welcoming atmosphere. We loved the fireplace and enjoyed sitting together in the living spaces. The house has a lot of charm, and the neighborhood is nice. I loved walking our dog in the open spaces provided by the park across the street. It is definitely a nice alternative to the hotels in town which are all dislocated from the real central part of Richmond. We will definitely stay again. Thanks Cheryl!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our weekend stay in this 2 story, 3 bedroom home. The rental was cozy and inviting. Kitchen was well appointed. The house was some great historic charm. The second floor sunroom off the master bedroom was my favorite feature. The large front porch was also perfect for relaxing on the mild winter nights we were there. The neighborhood is very walkable with a park and school directly across the street. Host was very responsive and accommodating."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We felt very comfortable staying here. It was inviting and relaxing. I was glad to stay here - much better than a hotel. We could each go to sleep and get up on our own schedule without bothering the others. Cheryl was very responsive and helpful.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was great. It’s not what we were used to bc usually we are in more updated airbnbs but the house had that old town charm and we had all that we needed. We would stay again. :)
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very comfortable and warm house that has pretty much everything you need to have a very relaxing stay.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have been staying here for the last 11 years. We have always found the house clean and in wonderful condition, just as it was 11 years ago. Cheryl is responsive to any need we may have. It has definitely become our “Richmond home.” The porch is our favorite place."

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The rental was very large and spacious. Very clean with comfortable beds. Cheryl was very pleasant and responsive to messages. One thing to note, the living room furniture was not very comfortable. But there were some comfy seats out on the covered porch which was nice."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Fantastic stay that I absolutely recommend. A very well equipped house and lovely hosts. Went exactly as I’d hoped. A wonderful neighborhood and peaceful lodging. Close to grocery and other sites. My favorite parts were the very big front porch and the coffee maker!! Thank you very much Cheryl & Michael you are the best
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a GREAT house and we had an awesome visit with our family from the area.. Mom spent mornings on the porch drinking her coffee while I was in the nook off the master bedroom with a book and coffee. The location by the park was great for us with the grandkids. Everything was clean and well maintained..

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Older home with a lot of charm, too bad it was just too cold to enjoy the front porch! Very clean, everything clearly marked with instructions etc. Hosts were very close and at least a few of our gang spoke to at least one of the owners every morning. Two of our gang went back to the house to nap during the day and said the most lovely music was coming from the basement, they thought maybe a cello. All in all....we will stay there again if the dates are available for our needs!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Comfortably appointed, and immaculately clean - Cheryl’s home is a great place to stay. We appreciated the charming historic home nestled in a park like setting (with an actual park right across the street). The gas fireplace was a welcome feature in an unseasonably cold spring. Cheryl is a fantastic host and went out of her way to ensure we had an enjoyable stay."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was clean and comfortable and just as described.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This has become one of my favorite Airbnb’s, a home away from home. I love sitting on the screen porch in the morning and evening and taking walks in the neighborhood. A perfect setting to get to all the places I want to go in Richmond!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super place! Very spacious, and the pictures don’t do it justice. Cheryl was terrific. This is one of the best places we’ve stayed with Airbnb."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We were traveling to visit my mother for Christmas and needed a place to stay where dogs were permitted. I think we found the best!! The house was comfortable and spotlessly clean. Although we didn't do any cooking, the kitchen appeared well outfitted with all the necessary items. The neighborhood is quiet and pleasant with a lovely park across the street; perfect for dog walking! We especially enjoyed the gas fireplace; so cozy. All communication with Cheryl was easy with almost immediate response. Thanks for a ""home away from home""! I hope we will be able to visit again in warm weather to enjoy the lovely front porch!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place! Close to Earlham college. Loved the fireplace and the sunroom. The kitchen was a nice place to gather as well. Oh, can't forget the porch looking out on to the park across the street.
We had a very pleasant stay. So nice of Cheryl to have the fireplace going-it was a much appreciated greeting after a long day of traveling, and coming out of the rain. We would definitely stay again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cheryl is such a wonderful host. The house was exactly as listed, extremely clean, and wonderfully homey.

2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"very clean, very beautiful home.. very friendly owners. we went down for a race at winchester, myself and 4 other guys stayed in the house it was perfect for the 5 of us. ample amount of parking, especially for 2 trucks and a race car trailer. would definitely recommend to others, and we will be staying here again when we come back down next yr"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This darling home is immaculate! Our family had a very comfortable stay while visiting our son at college for Families Weekend. We arrived very late the first night and so appreciated the key pad entry system which made our check in super easy. I walked in to town the next morning for breakfast at 5th Street Bagels. When we had to check out, my normally taciturn son said, ""This place was really nice. I wish we'd been able to spend more time here."" High praise indeed!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cheryl is a great host! The home is beautiful and the communication throughout the entire process was great.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a charming older home with great character! We had more space than we needed. We appreciated being able to bring my mom’s little dog with us. She enjoyed the house too.
There was a cute little sitting room with wonderful light off of one bedroom.
The kitchen was well thought out and had everything we could have needed! Tea and coffee selection was excellent! She had a Keurig and a regular coffee pot if needed.
We will consider staying again if we return to the area."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Homey, clean, and thoughtfully put together, this was the perfect home away from home for our Richmond trip. Close to Earlham, across the street from a lovely little park, in a cozy neighborhood that’s great for taking walks in. We’ll be back!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We have been staying here for the last 10 years and have always had a good experience. The owner is very welcoming and responsive to anything we might need. The house is very clean and comfortable.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Cheryl’s place is amazing. Great communication all around and she was very helpful when needed. My roommates and I felt very safe throughout our 3-month stay and would 100% stay here again. Cheryl’s husband even shoveled the snow off of our sidewalks very early so we could get to our cars easier before work (at least 6 inches of snow at times!!) We loved it here!
2020-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay was over Christmas. I had question after question regarding how the home would be set up since we had little ones that needed to be assured ""Santa"" could find the home. Cheryl was wonderful, answered every question promptly and had the place decorated with a lovely tree. This home has lots of extra touches that are out of the normal, making it feel like home. We intend to stay again when we need to be in the area. Thanks Cheryl for doing it ""right""!!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Everything was much better than I anticipated. In every possible way. Hospitality, cleanliness, style and size, responsiveness and friendliness, as well as tips for local places to explore. For me this experience makes me never want to use a regular hotel again."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The accommodations were incredible. Everything was clean and the host made sure we had everything we needed.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Only stayed for 2 nights but I loved it! Reminded me of back home, peaceful, beautiful and out in the country.

Would absolutely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Only there for one night but exactly as described, very clean and quiet and location was beautiful. Would absolutely stay there again and highly recommended!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I was only there for one night but it was a very nice setting and apartment will be happy to stay again
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I were moving across the country. Linda’s home was our halfway point. It was a welcome retreat after 13 hours on the road. Linda was sweet, welcoming, and accommodating, even with our late evening arrival and large moving truck. She provided plenty of snacks and waking up to the beautiful peaceful country was a pleasure! Thanks so much, Linda!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Linda was absolutely amazing. She was so gracious and amazing. She made breakfast was welcoming to my dog
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay Linda was a awesome host super kind and generous just an amazing stay can't wait to go back
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"LINDA AND HER HUSBAND WERE WONDERFUL. THEY WERE BOTH VERY FRIENDLY AND WELCOMING. THE LITTLE HOUSE WAS VERY CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE. THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL SET-UP IN A VERY BEAUTIFUL SETTING. THEY HAVE A LONG ZIPLINE SET UP FOR YOUR DOG (OURS LOVED BEING ABLE TO SNIF AROUND WITH FREEDOM, BUT NOT RUNNING LOOSE. WE WOULD DEFINATELY STAY AGAIN IF IN THE AREA."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Linda was a great hostess. Met us at the door and gave us a tour to make sure we knew how everything worked. The farm was beautiful! Our dogs ran off to explore and when they did not return Linda and her husband immediately went into action to help successfully retrieve them! We are so grateful!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and the best hospitality I’ve ever experienced by a host. Added bonus of a beautiful country setting.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved Linda’s Airbnb. It’s a beautiful and peaceful location. We were very happy and comfortable. The dog also had a great time, lots of outdoor space to run around."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you're looking for the perfect quite country getaway, this is the place to stay! Peaceful, beautiful, quite, great views. Farm animals near by, perfect for hiking, picnic, etc.
We loved every minute of it, looking forward to go back. Thank you to the Wallace family for their kindness and hospitality."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay here for the solar eclipse. It's a large property in beautiful Amish farm country. Very quiet and peaceful. I could hear the faint clop-clop of horse drawn buggies on distant roads, and the railroad couple miles away. Far enough from big cities that you can see many stars.
Apartment is very nice and cozy size for 1 or 2 (400 sq ft). Furnishings comfortable. Kitchen well equipped -- full size fridge / freezer, microwave, toaster oven, K-cup. No stove but didn't miss it. Kitchen well stocked w essentials and snacks. Everything clean. Dish TV and WiFi worked well. You can park right at the door & only 2 steps up into the space. The rest of the building is a large workshop -- all very quiet.
Hosts live in the main house and are very friendly, helpful, and easy to reach. Home-cooked meals and pies were delicious and unexpected. I felt very welcome. Hosts appear new to AirBnB but I can't think of anything to improve. Hope to return someday. Highly recommended!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful quiet spot! The hosts met me upon arrival, gave me TV and heating instructions. The place was clean and we'll stocked. I was traveling with 3 puppies and sadly was not able to leave their place as clean and tidy as I found it. Thanks for being such great hosts!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very cozy and comfortable. Super quiet in the country. Plenty of towels provided. Tv in living area and bedroom. Linda made this space very inviting and is interested in your comfort. Loved the fresh flowers! I wish I could take this Airbnb with me everywhere I go with my dogs because it was so convenient.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I stayed a couple nights on an antique picking excursion
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect size space for me, my boyfriend, and our dog. Very large dining and living room area for hanging out with family and game nights. The kitchen was absolutely adorable and cozy! The bed was super comfy and we loved sitting on the balcony in the mornings/evenings to watch the trains and the people go by. I’m originally from the area and definitely see myself staying here again when I come back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My boyfriend and I, as well as our three dogs, stayed here for the night. We arrived at about 645p and check in was very easy. The place was clean, the bed was comfortable and the water pressure/temperature was amazing.
Some suggestions I’d have is getting a curtain or something to prevent people from looking in through the glass door. We left at 3a and there was someone trying to get into the loft (very disoriented) which was scary. Another thing would be a gate to create a barrier for dogs to not have access to those stairs. Also a bigger TV for that living room space. It’s a very tiny TV for the area and I couldn’t see the screen.
Overall though, amazing price. I LOVED the porch, I didn’t even know it had one. We would stay here again! :)
Thank you so much!"
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re ok with two bars below, and a train wizzing by often- then book this place for a convenient and comfy place to stay!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We didn’t get to take advantage of every amenity, but the comment from my 18 year old was, “I could live in a place like this!”"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very spacious apartment, the pet friendly part was the best. The host had treats for dogs nice touch. Little noisy at night since its close to couple bars, we still slept like babies. Would stay here again."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Oliver and Miranda were great hosts. The location was easy to find and the loft was spacious. There were some cleanliness issues from what I believe was a previous guest and Oliver and Miranda were responsive and happy to resolve for me.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really cool place! Instructions were clear, there was space to park, and the bed was very comfortable."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you like nightlife, and a fun getaway for a weekend this was the place to go. It had a nice balcony, a big living room area, and a very unique feel. Overall a great place to for a friend's trip or romantic getaway, the stairs were a little narrow and steep but besides that, an awesome place to stay."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at the loft was exactly where we needed for a quick sleep before finishing our trip. The nearby trains were happening often and that was a plus for one of us :) We weren't able to sleep in the bedroom because there were no windows to the outside but if you were averse to outside noise, this would be the best spot to sleep for sure. Eclectic stay, really fun decor, neat to stay in such an historic area, especially for the price--was a great deal. We could not find a garbage can, so we took our trash out with us as there wasn't a lot. The skylights and balcony were very unique highlights. We did not come with pets but this would be PERFECT if we had furry travelers, certainly. The nearby bars were not incredibly loud but again, we slept on the couch so if the noise was an issue, sleeping in the bedroom would likely help! Overall definitely as advertised and much thanks to owners for the opportunity for the overnight!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place in Richmond. It’s also in walking distance of a couple bars and restaurants.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very nice place. close to where we needed to go
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Massive space in a beautiful old building. Our dog literally could run laps in there. Some noise from the freight trains, but the house makes up for it. A very unique and memorable experience in a thoughtful home in a cool forgotten historical town. Check out the Firehouse pub and some local murals-- also close by to many antique shops. Loved our short stay."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Large space
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space and an effortless experience!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great spot for an overnight stay with our dogs! The layout was open and made for a great work environment for a day. We were able to find multiple spots near us to take the dogs out, and accessing the apartment was super easy. It’s definitely a very quiet spot of town, which for a working day away was perfect. The only real sound came from the train, but after the first few times of it going by we had it tuned out fairly easy."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely fabulous Airbnb, great hosts, really cute bohemian space and so very roomy and comfortable. Very thoughtfully done, and this part of Richmond was really interesting with murals, colorful old buildings and breweries and cafes within walking distance. I wish we could stay longer - if I could give 10 ⭐️ I would!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay especially for the price
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was very ambient and intimate. They had great communication usually only took 10 minutes for a response. Would love to stay again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don't do justice to how spacious and beautiful this home is. The hosts were extremely clear and responsive, and they pushed to get me checked in as soon as possible. This is the only place I would book should I travel to Richmond again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love the vibe here! Super close to coffee shops and food. Would definitely stay here again! Oliver and Miranda were quick with communication and accommodated our needs. I highly recommend them as hosts!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved the space and the location! You could walk to restaurants, pubs, and stores for shopping. The loft is absolutely adorable with a balcony for end of day relaxation."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My partner and I only stayed for one night as we travelled from Indiana to Columbus. We loved the loft and were able to do a little bit of exploring in our short stay! There were bands playing at the pubs downstairs, so we stopped by and enjoyed the live music. In the morning, we stopped at a really cute coffee shop on 5th Street. The bagels were amazing! Communication with the hosts was very easy. They responded quickly to our messages and were very nice. Great place to stay and very nicely furnished/decorated!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great space and location. Very walkable to restaurants, breweries and bars. Large living space, very clean."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 4th stay here, we will continue to stay here for our work trips."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Oliver and Miranda's place was such a nice place to stay on our road trip cross country. It's such an amazing space, a beautiful loft, nicely furnished, with everything you might need. We personally loved watching the trains go by from the balcony. It started snowing while we were there which added to the magic - we almost spontaneously booked a second night to avoid the snowy drive and play pac-man instead! It has a good location, close to good restaurants and coffee - wish we could have explored more but we loved the BBQ place around the corner. We will definitely be coming back on our next trip that direction!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a very brief stay, arriving very late and leaving very early, so we did not have the opportunity to fully explore the space or outside environs. We liked the uniqueness of the location (downtown across from train depot) and the uniqueness of the space (spacious, historic building, creative decorating, modern kitchen appliances). Communication with the host was excellent, and getting into the space was easy.
There were, however, several things we didn't like. There is new hardwood flooring in the living area, but it made a crackling sound as you walked on it. We were surprised at the overall musty odor within the space, and cigarette odor in the bedroom. I am a strong fan of cotton bed sheets, and did not like the synthetic-fiber sheets that felt slippery."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cheaper than a hotel, more spacious than a hotel, worked great as a travel stop!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I loved the novelty of this unit and only wish I’d had more time to explore the area! My daughter had stayed there once before and thoroughly enjoyed the community! But the apartment itself was tastefully decorated and unique! Communication was excellent!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying at the loft with our dog. It was the perfect place to stopover on a cross country roadtrip, and we will be back! Clean, clear communication, comfy bed and full size fridge! Thank you!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a great space in downtown Richmond. The loft is really well appointed, with tons of space. There are train tracks across the street, but it didn’t bother us at all. When I had an issue at arrival (at midnight!) they were immediately responsive. Great apartment with great hosts."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved this space - very spacious and chic with lots of room to lounge around. We didn’t really use the kitchen but if we would have been happy with it if we had needed it! Will stay here again if we are in town.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cute, comfortable, private, well-appointed. Lots of evening spots within walking distance."

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Was in town for work and this was convenient. Enjoyed dinner at the Cordial Cork which was an easy walk.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This has been our 3rd different stay here for our work trips, no complaints at all, we will continue to stay here."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this loft was a warm and spacious place to nest! location was great-had a nice dinner on the block! grateful to know it's here. thanks oliver and miranda
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect place for a restful night and was able to avoid staying in a hotel. If I’m ever in the area again, I will definitely stay here."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing space, beautifully decorated. Oliver & Miranda are fantastic. Reasonably priced. My new favorite location!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing loft! Felt safe and right at home. Was decorated beautifully and simply just had no problems at all. Hosts super responsive and friendly, just an overall great experience and investment. Saw an earlier review about the water pressure and definitely noticed it was perfect haha. Would stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This has been our 2nd stay here for our out of town work. Great space and location, no complaints."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location and perfectly priced. Its now our go-to place to stay in Richmond! **highly recommend eating at the cordial cork. The mashed potatoes w/gravy was so good!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,thanks so much thanks for giving that special at home experience. we hope to return next year
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Appreciate you letting us stay at your place!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"PROS: (we would stay here again)
- very cozy/spacious
- complimentary coffee
- very short walk to all kinds of good restaurants, coffee shop, book store, ice cream shop, etc.
CONS: (you'll probably need earplugs)
- this airbnb is sandwiched in between two pubs/bars. From about 11pm - 3am it was VERY noisy and I could not sleep because of the numerous people standing right outside the door laughing, arguing, yelling etc.
- train runs by directly across the street numerous times day & night."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My stay was so comfortable and easy! Oliver and Miranda were so clear with instructions and very proactive. The place was easy to find and I had no trouble getting in and settled. The apartment is beautiful and larger than the pictures portray. I greatly appreciated the very quick communication and friendliness. I would definitely stay again when I’m traveling through the area next. Highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Richmond at Oliver & Miranda’s place was wonderful! The space is quite large, and the skylights were definitely a more unexpected highlight of the place!
The kitchen was well appointed, though we mainly ate at Roscoe’s Coffee Bar & Tap Room (10/10 would recommend!). The bed and the couch were QUITE comfortable and great for our stay. Lots of extra blankets, great temperature control, etc. and the water pressure in the shower was GREAT!
Parking is ample in the area, and free!!
Important to note:
This location can be a bit noisy. This is to NO fault of the owners, just the nature of the Depot District in Richmond. The train runs outside and honks as it passes and E Street Pub is pretty popular and is the downstairs neighbor to Oliver & Miranda’s place. I am not a light sleeper so I didn’t mind it one bit. My friend said that a little noise from a sound machine and it drowned out any noises very well - just keep in mind if you are really sensitive to sound!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed everything about this space except for the active train track nearby.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect location for us. We came from Muncie by bicycle on the Cardinal Greenway for a one night stay. We loved the unique space with skylights giving natural light. You will hear a couple of trains, but it's not too bad. There is even less neighborhood noise in the bedroom. We enjoyed being able to watch some episodes on Netflix and we should have fired up the Pac-Man game sooner. Maybe next time!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This loft is an absolute gem! We were looking for an easy, pet friendly place to stop over to break up a long drive and Oliver and Miranda's place totally fit the bill. My husband loved it so much he kept saying that he would live there long term! We had no problem with the bar downstairs and did not smell any cigarette smoke or hear anything during the night. Comfy bed, great kitchen and stylish lodgings. Richmond is such a cute town - we'd never heard of it before stopping but are so glad we did regardless. Filled with Italianate style houses and incredible murals everywhere, it was fun just walking the dog around the area. Had a good meal at The Coridal Cork and picked up some coffees in the morning at Roscoe's Coffee Bar before heading out. Definitely would recommend this loft - reasonably priced for a wonderful experience!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Location is wonderful with lots of places to walk to. Plenty of space and the bedroom was quiet. Can hear the trains but can easily drown them out. Water temperature and pressure was great. Bed was comfortable and allowed us to enjoy a great weekend.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wonderful Airbnb located in depot district. Close to restaurants and coffee shops. It was perfect for us for our weeklong stay with our dog. Highly recommended if you’re looking for a place in Richmond.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was good, not great. The host were great."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The place is as describe. Great communication and super easy check in. A lot of space. Great value.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a few questions I needed answered before selecting this place as a quick sleepover on a drive through town. Their response was quick - within minutes! The apartment was cozy and we felt right at home. Everything was great! The only draw back IMO is the smell of cigarette smoke from the nightclub below. We could definitely smell smoke what seemed like all night long (it was a Wednesday evening). As some of the other reviews state - it’s hot in the bedroom. If you’re smart and read reviews before booking, then you already know this & it won’t be an issue. Would stay again if we ever find ourselves back in town."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This Airbnb was in a cool town with plenty of old building to look at. The place itself was way bigger than the pictures make you believe. I loved the look and feel of the place especially the brick walls and nice kitchen.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Accommodations were as described. Cool rehab of the building into this space. Could hear the bar downstairs at bed time but the provided air purifier and fans helped. Love the PAC man! Fun place to stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed for one night instead of getting a hotel since we were just passing through. We enjoyed our stay Oliver and Miranda were really attentive and accommodating, would definitely stay here again in the future!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome location and space, Oliver and Miranda were excellent hosts where communication was easy and smooth. If I’m ever in the area I would only want to stay here."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The loft is much bigger than the pictures show! It is an incredible space in a super cool location and we would have loved to stay longer if not live there permanently! Oliver and Miranda were extremely helpful and they responded super quickly!
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect location for walking and exploring the Depot. Excellents restaurants/bars within walking distance.
It was hot when I was there, and the bedroom didn't cool off even with two air-conditioners running, made it difficult to sleep. A box fan was provided and that helped. The floors needed a good cleaning."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"lovely and spacious place! super cozy and comfortable. the loft had two small ac units but due to the summer heat of richmond it was a bit stuffy, nonetheless i would definitely book again in the fall/winter :) super responsive and great hosts!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely stunning space. Easy access. Nice, quiet neighborhood."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a nice stay at this sweet loft! The decor was super cute, lots of seating areas, big kitchen and big kitchen table, plus board games and Pac-Man. The only little thing if you are prone to getting overheated like me =) was that the bedroom didn’t have it’s own AC unit and it got fairly hot in there. There was an AC unit in the kitchen, hallway and the main living space but not the bedroom and because of the structure it didn’t pump that much air into the bedroom. We understand it’s summer time and heat is to be expected and they did provide a big plug in fan in the bedroom but with the door closed it still got fairly warm. Just something to keep in mind. But other than that we had a nice stay. And such a good price for the value and space in the loft! Our dog loved it too. They even provided some doggie treats inside. =)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Oliver & Miranda’s place was an ideal stopping point on our road trip from Raleigh, NC to Cedar Rapids, IA. When we had a minor check-in issue with the keypads, they were super responsive and resolved it immediately. What you can’t tell from the photos is how huge this place is! It had everything we needed, plus a fun Pac-Man mini arcade game. :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a nice stay on our way to Indianapolis. After being cooped up in our car for so long it was so nice to get to the Airbnb and just be able to relax in a clean and homey environment.

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Such a nice, cute apartment. It's spacious and inviting. Nice in-town location. Near by train tracks and much road construction right on the street where the building is located. Of course, the owners can't control these factors but that explains our lower ratings for some topics."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great loft in a cool location. Easy to find and access. Very comfortable stay after a very long drive. We would stay again!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Oliver and Miranda's loft is so beautiful and cozy! This was our first adventure with an airbnb, so we were nervous, but they made me feel relaxed with every aspect! The loft is so comfortable with all the amenities needed. we came in late on Thursday, we walked around the town. There were a couple of bars open with live music, which we enjoyed ! The next morning, we made our breakfast and had it on the adorable balcony (with a quick trip to the local coffee shop). We highly recommend this place!"

Great value! Instructions were very clear as to how to access the entrance and Oliver and Miranda were extremely responsive. Very comfortable bed and lovely living area. My daughter and I loved the Pac Man game in the living room. I would definitely return and highly recommend! Check out Thisthlewaite Falls if you have time - and the Richmond Farmer’s Market!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our jaws dropped when we walked into the loft. It is SO BIG! Cute and comfortable. Easy walking distance to many things. My husband enjoyed a great cup of coffee from Roscoe's. The train is close, but we love trains so that was a bonus for us. Stayed on a Tues night so it was quiet. Oliver was super helpful and really responsive when we had an issue with getting in the front door after going out. Bed was comfy and we slept well. We so appreciate being able to bring our dog. We will definitely stay again on our way through."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a downtown loft experience, this is it. A great combo of modern and vintage decor with high ceilings and plenty of space. The skylights brought in wonderful natural light during the day and the night-time thunder storm was spectacular!
Everything was provided that you could ever need. A great home away from home. We highly recommend Oliver and Miranda's Laurel Loft!"

The loft is beautifully restored with original details yet modern and thoughtfully decorated and furnished. It was perfectly clean as well. The location is wonderful; very walkable to nearby restaurants in charming little Richmond. I had no issue with noise, as others pointed out and the small fan in the bedroom provides nice white noise in the case one is sensitive to the train or noises outside. And the hosts, Oliver and Miranda, were so friendly and quick to respond; they seemed to truly care about your experience. I even forgot an item and they were so kind, going above and beyond to orchestrate getting it back. I would hands down book again. Thank you again, Oliver and Miranda; I wouldn’t have wanted to spend my birthday anywhere else!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for our crew to stay at for our out of town work. First choice if we send our crew back to Richmond for work.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a good location for us. The bed and couch are so comfortable and the living room and kitchen are very spacious! It’s fun to hear the trains go by and if you are sensitive to sound, they have air purifiers that help cover up outside noise. The linens and towels are great! The bathroom is a bit small, but not bad. The only issue we had was local homeless people hanging out downstairs by the door. The owners were quick to respond and help when needed. I would stay here again."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is awesome. What you can't tell from the photos is that this property is the depth of the entire block. It's huge. The open floorplan makes it feel even bigger. It's extremely comfortable. They mentioned the train, they mentioned the steps, so there were no surprises. Walkable to shopping and dining (go to Firehouse BBQ, I mean it). It was a perfect place for our little family, human and pet, to stop for a night."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"So comfy, cozy, eclectic and cool! We stayed one night on a road trip with our pup, and all the human and animal amenities are on point. The loft aesthetic is so awesome. Access and checkin are a breeze, with delicious food options and fun hangout spots steps away. ( Note for very light sleepers and/or smoke-sensitive folks: on the weekends the adjacent nightlife can seep into the space ). The linens, couches, and blankets are soft and plentiful, everything is spotless and well-functioning with thoughtful touches throughout. Miranda and Oliver were so friendly and graciously fielded our requests for recommendations. We all had a wonderful time. We truly appreciated the care the hosts have taken to make this a welcoming space for all guests. ❤️🐶"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a wonderful and charming loft. The place is huge yet feels so cozy. The loft is set in a historical part of the town right next to an old depot train station that has been rehabbed. Lots of restaurants and stores to walk to. Loved hearing the trains as they came through. Thank you for hosting me.

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Over all a decent place to stay for a one night stop on our way to the east coast. The place was mostly clean except for the bathtub. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen stocked. Be aware that the bar a couple doors down has music at least on Friday nights and it can be heard in the bedroom until early in the morning.
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Great communication
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful loft! It was clean, stocked, and just as advertised. The hosts were wonderful and communicated quickly.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved this space and location. It will definitely become a regular stay for our occasional drives from NJ to MO.
The hosts are very friendly and communicative. There are some great dining/social options nearby.
If you want to walk the trail, we recommend driving to the trail even though it looks close on a map. It took us a few tries to figure out how to get to the trail by walking and the streets are not the friendliest to cross on foot. But there is a parking lot almost directly west."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft has a cool vibe and was great for our stay in Richmond. Nice restaurants and bars within walking distance, and a short drive to parks. We enjoyed watching the trains pass by!"

We have three small children so he accommodated us on a special request, and had one issue while staying there and although it could not get resolved, he did all he could to help us and offered a very unique offer I’m sure no other owner would have. We didn’t accept it but he offered a solution which would have solved our issue..above and beyond nice..

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! What a gem.
The location was great. It’s in a nice part of town and it is among other beautiful homes. It’s also close to all of the major shopping areas of town.
Adam and his wife put so much thought and curation into their space - ie a complimentary snack basket, well written instructions around the house, and well designed lounging spaces for a comfy gathering.
The house had nice features such as a Nest thermostat, Smart TV, security cameras, and keyless entry.
We arrived a bit earlier than designated check-in to drop stuff by and we bumped into them tidying the bushes in the back yard. This moment exemplified their great hosting characteristics: kindness and flexibility, exquisite care and detail to their property, and generally just pleasant people to interact with.
My only caution about the space is that it is not fragrance free. For those with sensitivities to fragrances, there are glade misters and scented products throughout the house.
We can’t wait to have another family gathering here! Highly recommend. The best place we’ve stayed in the Richmond area."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,House was perfect would stay again
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best place I've ever stayed in Richmond. Do it - particularly in the fall when the maple in front is putting on a show. Great place!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Mike & Terri’s Speakeasy. The unit was unique, beautiful, and just like the pictures. Directions to find and enter the loft were extremely helpful as were the restaurant reviews. Terri and Mike were very responsive and offered great recommendations for food that did not disappoint. We had dinner at Old Richmond Inn, coffee at Roscoe’s Coffee Bar and Tap Room and breakfast at 5th Street Bagels. Everything was close by, delicious, and great service. We also did the Chocolate Trail in town and that did not disappoint.
Definitely recommend this stay and local dining."
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"When we arrived, there was one set of bath towels, one additional towel, but no hand, towel or washcloth, and no towels in the kitchen not paper towels, not a dish towel, not a rag. I dropped my mascara, and it rolled to the corner. it came up, covered in dust and hair. I looked around to the other corners of the room and behind the bed there was dirt and dust and debris. We stayed in one of their other properties and it was wonderful. This one did not meet my expectations. I’ve had forgotten my toothbrush. There wasn’t a single amenity in the place. We are charged cleaning fees, but asked to take the garbage out around the corner to the dumpster. When you stay at a hotel, you don’t have to empty the trash to the dumpster isn’t that why were paying a fee"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a nice stay at this unique loft. We loved the openess of the loft and the decorating was spot on. The host was responsive and informative. We will definitely stay again when we come to visit family.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My daughter and I enjoyed our stay. We loved the swings and the cool vibe of the place.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space and comfortable bed. If you are light sleeper you may want to pack earplugs since there are train tracks nearby.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful bnb in a cute alleyway!! I loved the vibe of the place and how everything was set up. Swings were so fun aswell!!! The area was good with many walkable places and everything else just a short drive away. To anyone looking to stay here I would recommend!! Couple things to note; a ton of steep stairs when you first walk in, definitely kicked my ass after a night out😂 bathroom could’ve been cleaner, there was a conditioner bottle that seemed to be left behind and some trash in the bathroom can. Also the kitchen sponge is due for an upgrade. Was fairly quiet and peaceful but you are close to railroad tracks to whoever that concerns. Overall worth the money I paid, and provided a good place to stay while visiting. Thanks!!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great getaway weekend! The place was cute and met our needs.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,we booked last minute for Valentine's Day and the weather just happened to give us 3 inches of snow. we enjoyed the wide open space of the loft and the Firehouse restaurant next door. Would like to stay again in better weather so we could explore more. Mike and Terri were easy to get ahold of for any questions we had. The only thing I would like to see is a way to secure the entrance door from the alley better could be kicked in easily.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wry nice and helpful people!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful spot! The swings were a great, unique detail to add. They are safe and durable. In a great location if you’re looking for a fun night out as it is surrounded by bars and restaurants."

The space is beautiful, clean and feels very homey. The bed feels like sleeping on a cloud. Mike and Terri are wonderful hosts and I highly recommend this place"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great. Walking distance to multiple restaurants. The presentation of the space is beautiful. One thing to remember is that it is a loft, so if you go during a winter weather advisory, it does get chill in the loft."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary getaway and LOVED it! The loft is so cozy and aesthetically decorated! It was even more magical than the pictures :). We were so pleasantly surprised by the location and the surroundings! There was so much within walking distance and we kept saying we wanted to come back when it’s warm and explore more. Mike and Terri were very accommodating and responsive! 10/10 would stay here again :))!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"my fiancé and i loved this place! The swings were a super cute touch, and the restaurants around town are super cute. if you like video games, comic books, or anything vintage, this is the place for you as they have all of these shops right in walking distance."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was an absolute pleasure. The space is as it is shown in the photos. Clean and very comfortable. We look forward to staying with them again!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a fun place! I surprised my wife for this overnight trip - no idea of a place or city. She was blown away by the loft. She loved the decor, style, openness and overall it's uniqueness. She used the swing multiple times! Sidenote she loves lamps and said multiple times this place has amazing lamps, so shout out to the lamp /decor lead!
Loved how it was in the middle of the Depot District which meant we could just walk around to look at the many cool murals, fabulous options for foods and plenty of boutiquish shops to explore.
Though we didn't know much of Richmond we really enjoyed the quality of stay, destination and overall had a memorable time. We have already told and shown friends this place and love it as well.
Hosts were proactice in communicating helpful information and responded quickly. Making check in and check out so easy.
Highly recommend."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous loft right in the middle of Richmond's depot district. The space was clean and comfortable, with really fun 1920s-inspired decor.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is lovely, and in a great walkable neighborhood."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mike and Terri's place was probably our favorite AirBnB that we have been to! The loft was so cool and it was huge! While it looks just like the pictures, somehow they just don't do it justice. We were searching cool places to visit on AirBnB and loved the photos so we booked it and drove 4.5 hrs! The location is awesome and there are cute shops and restaurants nearby! We went on a little antiquing adventure and it ended up being the perfect midpoint of Antique Alley. We look forward to visiting again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The other inconvenience we experienced was the condition of the shower. The remainder of the bathroom was clean, but it looked like someone had forgotten to clean the shower. There were hairs and grime throughout the shower, but it was simple enough for us to purchase a shower cleaner and wipe it down. The remainder of the entire space was immaculate, and we would absolutely stay there again! Truly beautiful place!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place with very responsive hosts. We would definitely stay here again.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When we arrived, the room was very tidy and clean. There was shampoo, body wash, and extra towels in the bathroom.

Lastly, Mike and Terri communicated quickly and made sure we could find everything we need. Overall friendly and thoughtful hosts!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent stay I this beautifully unique destination. Our hosts gave us detailed information on where to park and how to find the Loft.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mike and Terri’s place was in a cute alley of Richmond. We found several restaurants in walking distance. We enjoyed the openness of the space and the swings were such a fun addition!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very spacious. Great hosts. A handful of local restaurants. We stopped for one night here on a road trip. Building has a fascinating history too.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great loft! Beautiful set up. Really enjoyed it. Don’t come to Richmond on a Sunday because everything is closed. Also the only suggestion would be to have some coffee on hand to go with the beautiful coffee set up.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! The bed was so comfy, the AC unit kept the whole place cool, and the swings were SO fun. There’s a couple bars and restaurants within walking distance (I recommend the bbq joint around the corner - sooo good) & a record shop in the same alleyway had an amazing selection. We loved learning about Richmond’s music culture on the Starr Gennett walkway. The model t ford Museum is right across the street and was actually really cool. The speakeasy was a great choice for our short trip. Thank you!!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Interesting place to stay, we liked the loft. We were in town to meet some family, so we weren't there long, but it met our needs in Richmond. Thanks!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I recently stayed with my boyfriend and we had a great time on our little trip to indiana!

The hosts are always a step ahead and make sure you have all the information you need and suggestions for places around the area! Thank you Mike and Terri!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute apartment down an alley in a smaller town. Restaurants next door with very kind staff. Loft was unique & cute. Host was very flexible with check in. Mostly everything was nice and clean but shower appeared to be quite old. Wish we would have been able to spend more time here exploring nearby spots.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The speakeasy was a great little spot. My wife and I stayed here while road-tripping across the country. Mike and Terri were very prepared and made our stay easy and comfortable. The room looks exactly like the photos and is conveniently located right next to the best restaurant in town.
Highly recommend if you’re staying in Richmond IN."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Mike and Terri were very pleasant and responsive. All of the pictures are up-to-date and the loft was exactly as advertised. We would recommend bringing coffee grounds, creamer, or anything you would need if you like your coffee in the morning. The pots, pans, and cups are if you choose to prepare your own meal should you choose to bring any food or snacks. We stayed on a Sunday night so the location was very quiet as the restaurants below were closed. Access to other locations such a shopping and restaurants is convenient and within a five minute drive. If we are in the area again, we would be happy to contact Mike and Terri to stay here at their cozy and beautiful loft."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property was so fun and beautiful. We normally take weekends to large cities, but we saw this Airbnb and decided to take a quick trip to Richmond from Cincinnati to stay in the Speakeasy. It was clean, and looked just like the pictures. We were able to walk to local restaurants to eat and enjoy live music. We also took short rides to the art museum, the abortorium and the local garden show. I would recommend this property to anyone who wants a fun get away!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great stay and felt very welcomed in the residence! The neighborhood was quiet and was a great choice for my one night stay.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A convenient location for our son’s graduation from Miami University. Our stay was short but very sweet… due to commitments in Oxford we checked in rather late and had to depart early. We would have loved to pottered around Richmond and enjoy the local foodie spots. We could not recommend this unique loft more highly… for location, ease of free street parking, all the amenities and a place with such a wonderful homely feel. Best bit… an incredibly comfy kingside bed… we both slept SO well!!
Thank you for having us Mike & Terri… first class hosts!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at this Airbnb! The place itself was so unique, well-kept, and beautiful. Mike and Terry were incredibly responsive and helpful with every part of our stay. If we ever return to Richmond Indiana, we will book there!"

2023-04-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Unfortunately this stay was not a great experience for my husband and I. we knew it was an old loft, but it smelled old and damp and half of the electrical outlets didn't work. There was also no privacy with the next door unit. their conversations could be heared like they were in our room. I think this place would be great for a photo shoot, but as for a night's stay... not a first pick. No fault of the owners, but every business was closed or under construction. The area did not feel like the area was safe to walk beyond our immediate location. Some guy with no teeth made sure to inform us we were ""in the hood..."" I don't fully believe that, but I have nothing good to go off of. Unfortunately I would not recommend this location for any couple looking for a date night stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little place for a place.
Stayed here doing the antique trail."

2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,This air bnb is very beautiful but very dirty. Crumbs were left everywhere on every surface. I even found small piles of dirt? Old coffee grounds and coffee were left in machine from previous guests. Stains on the visible parts of the mattress. If you’re going to have a beautiful property it would be nice to have it be a clean property as well.

While not hard to find, the entrance is actually behind the street address down a cute little alley (...can one call an alley cute? Well, this one is). We were only here for the night, but we'd love to come back and explore the surrounding area, full of restaurants and interesting looking shops. Well worth a trip to Richmond!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! Hoot was so helpful and responsive, and very friendly. If you want to feel more like you’re staying a friends house, this is definitely the place. The sunroom with all the plants was my favorite!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This house was perfect for us and exactly as described. Hoot was quick to respond when we had a question.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying here, the beds were comfortable and our 4 year old son was happy to have bunk beds. We would stay again for sure!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Cottage was QUAINT AND COZY...great location....warm and wonderful! I am 64 and loved the comfort of the top bunk bed! The artwork...decor...personal touches were FABULOUS.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Hoot's place was exactly as described and looked like the pictures. It was a quaint apartment that met our needs. Being able to have our two little Shorkies with us was nice. The neighborhood was nice and safe to walk our dogs in. The host reached out proactively and checked on us often. He was a very attentive host!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect place for my daughter and I to say while she visited Earlham College. Hoot was kind, thoughtful, and great at communicating. If my daughter ends up going to Earlham I can imagine staying at Hoot's every time I visit."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very happy with our stay!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was excellent close to everything I needed

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, simple, affordable. Hoot was very responsive and helpful- even got a pack n play for our infant! Very quick to reply to questions and requests! Loved the eclectic decor. Has everything you need and no frills. Minimal cooking space/tools so I wouldn’t plan to make a meal here."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,House was nice and everything was as advertised. Hoot made sure everything was to my liking and would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay for business travel. Hoot was very easy to communicate with and the place was exactly as listed.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,After a last minute change in travel plans we (my partner and I) needed to make a last minute change to our Thanksgiving plans. We found Hoot’s place on a whim and booked it instantly. Hoot was friendly and communicative and fixed any issues that popped up ASAP. The home is adorable though the space is awkward given its age (this was not something that was too bothersome but good to note:)). Hoot had thought of everything down to essentials if you forgot them. The kitchen is WELL stocked if you were to cook (we didn’t do much of that). My partner and I needed a getaway just us and enjoyed the peace and quiet that the space offered! I loved looking around the house and seeing the decor and Hoot’s artwork! We loved the stay and will keep Hoot’s place in mind when we return as it is pet friendly (I have a kitty but she stayed home this trip) and the house is adorable! Thanks Hoot!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home is truly vintage and the hosts worked very hard to ensure that you were accommodated. We arrived ahead of schedule and they let us check in early without any fuss at all.
We made some meals and everything we needed was in the kitchen, even some fun spices.
The bathroom and kitchen are genuinely vintage and the shower isn’t great, so if you’re uncomfortable with that it won’t work for you. I grew up in a house a lot like it, my parents are still there and have also kept their vintage bathrooms, so for me it was a bit nostalgic.
I especially loved the sunlight. The sitting rooms and closed in porch are sunny, cheerful and sweet. I also loved the neighborhood. I’m a small woman and it is safe and comfortable to walk, even at night. It’s also convenient to a Dollar General, gas stations and some fast food.
Lovely experience and can definitely recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are visiting Earlham College for any reason, this residence is the perfect place to stay. Hoot was a great host and had the residence clean and with great amenities. Very satisfied, would love to stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Always nice to find a pet friendly place. The house is old so is laid out a bit oddly but everything was clean. We didn't cook this time as we were visiting family in the area, but the kitchen appeared very well stocked. Washer and dryer were nice to have but do make the bathroom a little crowded. Parking on the street wasn't always as close as would have liked but there was space on the block. Would book again if we needed a place to stay in Richmond."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for long weekend visit with son at Earlham College. House was exactly as described with everything we needed. All instructions were very clear and Hoot was welcoming and responsive with advice about local activities and restaurants. Highly recommend this spot, especially when visiting EC. We’ll definitely be back. 🥰"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was amazing. I needed a few nights away and this place was perfect. First of all the place looked amazing and they had many kitchen appliances if you like cooking. Not to mention the host himself was phenomenal. He constantly checked to see if we were good and taken care of. For my first ever Airbnb this place was amazing. I’ll definitely be coming to the place.

From the time of booking Hoot was very helpful and responsive to questions and quick with recommendations for local services. The check in process was super easy. The home was just what we needed for the overnight, clean and homey with very comfortable beds, and after a very long day on bicycles the hot shower with great water pressure and nice shower head was very welcomed. I would definitely stay here again! A nice quiet area nestled in between the college and downtown with easy access to everything."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We so enjoyed our stay at Pat’s place while traveling across country. Pat was the best host, so friendly and welcoming, we loved talking to her and meeting her pets! The neighborhood is very quiet and the unit very nice. We will definitely be staying here again when we do another cross country trip!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our 3rd successful stay with Pat over the years. Her hosting never disappoints. We love the place and the beautiful improvements she has put into the yard for the chickens. She’s a kind and interesting woman who we love having this small connection with. The place is cozy and quaint. I wouldn’t change a thing about it!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pat was a very responsive and welcoming host that made the stay super easy. It was very clean and cozy. Pat took time to talk to us when we arrived and left to see if there’s anything she can do to make our stay as good as possible and to see if there’s anything she can improve on. It was a great stay, overall!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pat’s place was cozy and inviting, and we loved the unique architecture nestled amongst the trees. It’s close to Earlham College and good walking areas. Pat was a warm host, greeting us when we arrived late at night, and she even sent us on our way with some eggs from her chickens. We will certainly look to stay with her again when we return to Richmond."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was great just like the last time I stayed! Quiet dead end street in walking distance to Earlham College. I brought my 2 dogs with me to visit my daughter and Pat was a terrific host. The bed was very comfortable and it was a great space to visit with my daughter and relax. Will stay again if I have the chance.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is just a great place. Quiet, lovely and classic, custom, obviously loved space. Pat's super host designation is very well earned!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pat is wonderful and the place is even better than the photos, highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I’ve stayed at Pat’s in the past two years and I love it. It’s very reasonably priced and now that the kitchenette is finished, all the more functional. Indiana is always warmer than home so I love sitting on the balcony, having a glass of wine and watching Pat’s chickens and evolving gardens.
It’s great for walking to / from the Earlham campus and nearby grocery store, as well as back campus (woods, horses, gardens). It’s in a quiet, fully lived-in residential neighborhood, which I love.
Pat is welcoming and a good communicator but not fussy. She kindly left the light on and the apartment open when we arrived late and in the rain.
One thing I didn’t catch the first time I stayed (even though she says it clearly) is that there’s not WiFi, only Ethernet. Also no smart tv (yay) but a collection of DVDs.
I will definitely try to stay here each time I come."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pat was so friendly and helpful. We had a great overnight stay with plenty of time to rest and relax. We will remember Pat next time we need an over night stay in Richmond, Indiana."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The windows and ambient light were beautiful. The buildup of dust on some flat surfaces was off putting. Pat was a very nice host.

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Neat place and overall pleasant experience. Place is older so there's lots of floor creaking, squeaking, and other louder noises that I guess were from baseboard heat. I did very much appreciate the sound machine in the bedroom though it didn't completely mask what i was hearing at the time."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely Airbnb stay. It has a cozy, treehouse feeling. This house in clearly a special piece of midcentury history. Pat was so hospitable and generous. I want to be like her when I grow up!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love staying at Pat's! Pat's place is so peaceful and quiet and walkable to Earlham campus and widerness hikes. We love eating at Thai Thara and Roscoe's. Richmond is a very cute little town and we will most certainly be back!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely lovely stay! The apartment was peaceful and lovely, and the architecture was historically interesting and beautiful. Chickens were also fun to watch while sipping coffee in the morning. I was fortunate to have a few conversations with Pat during my visit, and found her to be kind and informative about the history of the house, as well as Richmond. Overall...staying here is SO MUCH better than staying at a hotel!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This property is a dream. I did not want to leave it!
Such attention to detail, aesthetic, and comfort, I was blown away.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You can search far and wide, but it will be very very difficult to find a better place to stay and I’ve stayed a lot of places with Airbnb. Pat is a supreme host, and you will find delights around every corner. ￼"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pat’s guest house was a great place for our one night stay. It is unique and comfortable . Pat checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed. What I personally liked was its proximity to Earlham- an easy walk with lots to explore on campus, especially with a dog to walk."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Always a great stay with Pat! Her home has become our go-to spot on the road. Excellent host, excellent space."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy spot
Tons of space
Pat was super nice"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a one of a kind, ecological haven that has a treehouse feel. It's a special prefab house from the 1950's called TechBuilt, a rustic 2 level design in which the lower level functions as a quasi-basement and the upper level as a quasi-attic. The ceiling of the upper level goes all the way up to the peaked roof so it has a cathedral feel. The walls are almost all window, looking out on a woodsy neighborhood and backyard, which features a geodesic dome, a tiny house, and a chicken coop. We bought fresh eggs while we were there. The apartment features warm wood paneling, nice antiques, and beautiful plants. There are books by the host on the book shelves along with games and DVDs. We watched a great old Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert film. We found the bed overly soft, but we're not used to memory foam. The wood smoke smell was intense, but we got used to it and our clothes did not smell afterward. This place is extremely peaceful, unique, relaxing, and affordable. We loved it."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy. We had a short stay and it was everything we needed. Pat was very nice and made us feel welcome!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Pat was a wonderful host! She was kind and responsive to our last minute check in needs. Her place is beautiful and our experience with her was great! We will definitely be staying here again anytime we are in town.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cozy cute and comfortable apartment. Everything you need for a short stay. The area is lovely and very enjoyable to walk our dogs.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great comfortable stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I will always stay with Pat while driving across the country. She is the most hospitable host and we always have great discussions. She is super accommodating of my dog and I. Always a great time.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pat’s place is right near the college. Lots of peace & quiet and campus activities as well as community things to do. Even though there is not a full kitchen, the fridge & appliances are most sufficient. We know our way around town but it was nice to see so many community things promoted and information available. I’m sure if anyone has questions she would have or find the answers."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place with an incredible host! Pat was pleasantly communicative and offered her published works for purchase, I brought several home! She is a resource for at home gardening and poultry care, and I enjoyed learning from her. I slept more comfortably here than I do at home; I enjoyed waking up with hot tea on the patio listening to the backyard water feature and chickens! 10/10 recommend, and will be visiting again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute and Comfortable place. There is no wall or door between the shared front door and the a
Guest apartment, which could potentially cause privacy concerns, but overall a cozy little spot."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pat was an active and visible host, offering insights into Richmond or Earlham, stopping into the apartment when I’d stepped away to turn on lights or open windows and turn on fans to cool the apartment down, or to send a good morning message. She graciously lent a bicycle pump when I needed one.
The apartment is inviting, with spaces to sleep, eat, relax and cook simple meals. The library is stocked with games, books, movies and information about the town.
Most mornings I was greeted by the backyard chickens or the dog, Lamb chop.
The neighborhood is quiet, and convenient to Earlham and the Whitewater Valley Gorge Park and its connection to the Cardinal Greenway."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Love staying at Pat's place! Its so peacful there. We will be back soon!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed a quiet stay at Pat's place. The house is in a pleasant neighborhood, great for walking. The bed was very comfortable, and the deck was the perfect place to sit with a cup of coffee and enjoy looking over the back yard with Pat's flock of chickens.
Pat was a great host, friendly but not intrusive. We'd love to stay with her again!"
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"She failed to notify that the shower was not working. She did offer a refund the day after, but at that time it was too late to find another location. Plus the inconvenience of having to pack and unpack all over again. She did agree to an extension on the check out from 10am to 1pm."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The earlham college area is very peaceful which made my stay well worth what I paid
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pat is very friendly and personable and is very conscious of sustainable living. It is an old house but she has kept it in good shape. Lots of wood! I loved the piano. She encouraged me to play. The bed was very comfortable and I slept very well as it is a very quiet neighborhood and feels like being in the country. She knows the restaurants and places to walk in Richmond. I recommend Pat's place for a good rest or a good place to work or come back to if you are working in Richmond.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The setting was so nice. We really enjoyed the privacy, the wood cabin smell, and the setup. So cozy & entertaining. She’s even got books & boardgames!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pat is warm and friendly. We really love staying at her place! We will be back! Thank you Pat !!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was simply lovely. It was peaceful and the atmosphere was serene. The space was clean and the backyard garden was a dream. I stayed here with my fiancé and we would highly recommend. Pat was an excellent host. Extremely attentive and considerate.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I had a great stay at Pat's place while I was there for a 2 week class at Earlham. The space had plenty of room to spread out, a kitchenette for meals, a big dining room table for working and eating, and a tv/relaxation area. Best of all, Pat let me bring my dog which was a big comfort while being away from home for 2 weeks. Thank you Pat and I hope to come back and stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect stay, excellent host, everyone should feel safe and eager to book with Pat. There are a few steps to the apartment though, so keep that in mind if mobility is an issue. Appreciated especially lots of air in the room, cleanliness, shower things, kind generosity, therapy dog and baby chicks!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was an excellent stay. Very cozy and in a great part of town. Nestled near the university, has great walks nearby. Pat was an excellent host, would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I love staying at Pat’s place. It is the perfect respite from the road. Pat is very welcoming, we had a great discussion. The balcony overlooking the backyard is very serene."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely beautiful apartment, lovely balcony, full of local brochures and books, peaceful, large windows and the like."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a lovely place to rest. We absolutely adored Pat’s place. She was very warm and helpful. Her yard is worth the stay alone. The space is beautiful and very comfortable. Highly recommend.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pat's place was great! The grounds were very welcoming as was her hospitality. I felt a sense of peacefulness while staying there. Privacy is somewhat unique. Some doorways have coverings/partitions instead of doors. Inside the common entryway there is not a door on either side of the stairs leading up to the apartment. It all just inside the front door. Overall, a lovely place to relax and let your guard down. Being pet-friendly is a bonus and the area is great for dog walks and taking in a lovely back yard from the balcony."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pat's place is unique and quirky---and oh, so peaceful. At first, I was a little dismayed that there was no Wi-Fi (I should have read closer, but I was in a bit of a rush to book a place), but that later felt like an asset. I got the best night of sleep in two-plus weeks on the road during what we're now dubbing the ""Road Trip That Will Never End,"" (my two-year-old car has broken down twice and required days of waiting for parts to be delivered) and I think that was because I had so few distractions. I couldn't get the provided USB connector to work, and that was just fine!
Proximity to the local college was an asset since I had my dog with me. We went for several long walks!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can't say enough nice things about Pat. Such a congenital hostess. We arrived ĺate & she still came out to welcome us.
The apartment was clean, quaint & specious. If we ever come back to this area, I would return again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pat was super friendly & fun to talk to, and her place was cozy and comfy and peaceful:). Loved sitting out on the deck in the morning, overlooking her gardens. The restaurant she recommended for dinner (and made reservations for us) was excellent, and the breakfast spot she said not to miss was also wonderful:) She even surprised my hubby with an ice cold beverage when we arrived, as he had just finished his 160 mile bike ride across Indiana (RAIN). It was a kind and thoughtful gesture that was so appreciated:). Would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful place. Pat was as kind and welcoming as can be. I now know what bamboo toilet paper is, and may never look back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pat was such a friendly and knowledgeable host! I spent a few days at her place checking out Earlham with a prospective student. Pat’s place has easy access to the campus, and Pat knows a lot about Earlham and Richmond. We felt comfortable coming and going as needed to attend meetings and tours on campus or to go into town for coffee or meals. We loved watching the chickens and evening fireflies from the back porch. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pat was a great host. I was in the area for business and it was the perfect place to stay. The apartment was well furnished, the area was away from the busyness of town, and the sound of the landscape waterfall and watching the chickens in the backyard was very peaceful. I hope to stay here again on my next visit to Richmond."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The space was as described and very unique. Pat was helpful and gave good recommendations for dinner. Would stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Pat’s place was fabulous! She was very responsive and SO SO accommodating to our dog. She left out clear pet instructions, a few dog treats, and even let her run around the backyard before we checked out!! We really appreciated this ahead of a long day of driving. Not to mention, Pat’s place has free roaming chickens - the cutest! Her place was exactly as described, very roomy and truly a treat. Highly recommend!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had stayed here once before, and this time was extremely pleased to see that Pat had installed a small galley kitchen, making it very easy to wash cups, etc. Her lovely chickens have some cute babies running around and her backyard gardens are delightful. She even accomidated my ebike in her garage!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was my second time ever having an Airbnb as I had my first solo, cross country trip. I am quite nervous in new environments and found this bnb perfect. Pam welcomed
me very kindly, and was super flexible with when I got in. The rooms were all exactly as pictured with a beautiful balcony overlooking a lush yard with hens, complimented by a gentle water fountain. Pam has everything you could possibly need in this upper apartment level from a kitchen space to a spot for music and writing. Pam also has most everything labeled, which as I previously mentioned, being so nervous, the labels made me feel much more at ease and informed. Whether you want a serene place to end a busy travel day, or someone to share an enthralling conversation with, this is the spot!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Decent place to stay. My fault for missing the part that says someone is living downstairs upon booking but it wasn’t too bad just personally prefer our privacy. Quiet, safe neighborhood too."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wish we had more time just to spend in the place. Very well decorated and much larger than expected. Nice host. Beautiful landscaping and kitty friendly (She left out treats for them!).
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place to stay while driving across the country. The apartment was peaceful with a beautiful backyard. Pat was very welcoming.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Was traveling across country and looking for a respite from highways and typical noisy hotels. This was the perfect spot! Very cool and unique space located on a quiet street with lush greenery everywhere. Pat was there to greet us and super helpful when it came to dining options, especially because we arrived later than planned. We had the entire upstairs to ourselves with plenty of room for our two pups to relax as well. Everything was clean and well appointed, so we felt right at home. Would’ve loved an extra day to explore the quaint town of Richmond. Definitely love to stay here again. Thanks! :)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pat was wonderful her place is amazing!! We got to meet her, her dog, her cat, and her chickens! She had great recommendations for local food places, too! We highly recommend Pat and her home for a wonderful, peaceful escape!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Pat was extremely friendly! She helped us carry our bags after a long drive and get into the upper unit quickly.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet and peaceful. Enjoyed sitting on the balcony, watching the animals. Would definitely stay there again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had an amazing stay. Thank you Pat!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A very nice apartment. Unique architecture. There were plenty of things to do left for us. My daughter loved watching the chickens with the binoculars Pat left in the apartment. There is a nice bed in the bedroom, because my wife and I are both large, and my sleep schedule I slept on the couch. It was nice and cozy and long. Also there was a spare mattress behind it. Would definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My mother, pup and I needed a spot for a our road trip and Pat's place was great. Her dog is very friendly and great with my big young dog who loves to play and watch the chickens. Pat gave us very clear instructions, greeted us and chatted, gave local recommendations and was knowledgeable of the area. The apartment was clean and instructions were clear, printed and placed around the space to leave no doubt as to expectations. The bed was very soft, bathroom was well stocked. The kitchen appeared well stocked but we didn't need to use anything in our short stay. Great location in a quiet, safe neighborhood. Thanks Pat!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pat was so kind and welcoming. The space was peaceful and serene. She made me feel at home. She recommended a labyrinth right down the street which was wonderful. If I ever drive through Indiana again, I will be sure to stay with her!!"

We really enjoyed dinner at The Old Richmond Inn, which Pat recommended, and slept really well!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am an ESR student and Pat’s apartment was PERFECT for my week long stay in Richmond. Pat is a wonderful person who made me feel right at home and is a fun, wise, and and amiable soul to be in proximity to. The Techbuilt house is so neat; it feels simultaneously so airy and so cozy. It is in a peaceful area and very close to amazing trails through back campus, which I walked daily. Coffee on the back porch, watching the chickens with the fountain was relaxing and rejuvenating. I definitely hope to stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely time. Ideal location and exactly what I needed. I hope to return in future and will recommend to friends. The balcony was a wonderful place to relax with view of back gardens and water feature and the indoor space super cozy with wonderful light and space. One caveat: While there is internet, it is not wifi so that limits where you can use within the space."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,another great stay. Thank you Pat

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, quiet neighborhood..close to everything..relaxing"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for the hospitality Pat! You're space is wonderful!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for having us Pat. Another great stay.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pat's place was clean, quiet, and charming."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This the third year in a row I've stayed at Pat's. She's always very friendly and warm in her welcome (along with her sidekick Lambchop). 🐕
Her place is easy to find, with easy access, and is centrally located for the places I visit while in Richmond and the surrounding area. I love how peaceful the area is and how I can hear the rain falling on the trees and roof.
This year, Pat had an addition bonus of a small kitchenette add-on! Awesome!
For anyone staying in the area, I would highly recommend contacting Pat to set up a booking!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for another great stay!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always enjoy staying at Pat’s. Looking forward to our next stay.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another great stay - Thanks Pat! Love the new addition for the sink/ hot plate / fridge. See you again soon.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Pat is a wonderful host and thankful for her attention to the small details. She’s thought of everything to make your stay special.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Accommodations were very clean! The house has character and some neat touches. It was easy to find and had everything you might need during your stay. Pat was a lovely host. My only caution would be to light sleepers. You can hear the stadium nearby and there is a police shooting range nearby as well. They started up at 6AM during our stay and continued throughout the morning. Pat does provide a white noise maker that did help dampen the sounds some.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A really lovely and peaceful place. The space looks like it was taken straight from a country living magazine. Sit on the deck and watch the chickens with the included binoculars!
And it's a very short and easy walk to Earlham College-- 5 minutes at most to the edge of campus. You can also walk to the Back Campus area.
The master bedroom has a thin accordion door that separates it from the main living area. But there's a gap at the top, so you don't get complete sound privacy from anyone else staying on the single bed. You also may have to do a bit of work to keep the temperature where you like it on very hot or very cold nights.
There's a compact but really nice kitchen that seems to be a brand new added bonus.
Overall it's a really wonderful place to stay!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We truly enjoyed meeting Pat. She was a gracious host. Very friendly. The house was quiet inside and relaxing. The back porch overlooking the chickens was amazing. There was room for two cars in the driveway. Neighborhood felt safe. It was a great experience.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,felt right at home
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying at Pat's place. It was so cozy and comfortable. We were looking for a relaxing weekend away and it really was. What we especially enjoyed was she left our dog a couple dog treats, and that felt very special."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I went to visit my daughter at Earlham College and the location is within walking distance of the campus. It was very peaceful and homey. It is better than the pictures relay! Pat was a great host and made sure we were well taken care of. I brought our dogs to visit my daughter as well and the apartment is on a dead end street - great for walking them. We didn't sit outside on the balcony because it was a little cold for that, but in nicer weather it would be great. I will defiantly stay again in the future!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Amazing stay!!!! Warm, lovely, safe, inviting, peaceful, comfortable, so sweet & beautiful. Excellent location. Pat is a fantastic host in countless ways. Look no further…"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super kind and beautiful place.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Pat was a very kind and helpful host. We only stayed one night but the upper apartment area was very cozy and there were helpful labels around the space.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very unique loft apartment, interesting eclectic furniture and lots of books to browse. There is a small desk but I found working on the dining room table was very easy. There was even a calculator in the desk to help with my work."

."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pat has a lovely place. I really appreciated the communication, especially as I got a later start which meant I arrived later than planned. Pat was a wonderful hostess. My dog and I very much enjoyed our brief stay!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Probably one of our top three locations on Air BnB- a gorgeous mid century home - well appointed, comfortable and dripping in charm. Pat, Lambchop and the flock were all friendly and informative and the location was perfect- a quiet, walkable neighborhood with good food options and a donut place a short drive away. We can’t wait to go back."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pats place was much more than I expected. Typically most listing give the appearance of being larger than really are so I have come to expect less. Not here. A very roomy and pleasantly comfortable apartment in a lovely, quiet college neighborhood. The apartment is immaculate and I really enjoyed so many of the older things around that work perfectly as they did the day they new. The place has a terrific character about it. Pat and of course her pooch Lamb Chop are a delight. You'll find everything you need here. If you want a nice break from your typical stay then this is the place for you. I can assure you I will be looking forward to a return visit here."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my second time to stay at Pat's place. I love the peacefulness of the neighborhood and the location is perfect.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pat is a wonderful host. She puts the super in super host. Very spacious loft that made me feel welcome and was cozy to stay in.

There is a piano and a pleasant environment to relax in. I especially love the back porch. Exciting that a kitchenette is being put in, but until then, there is a mini fridge and small kitchen appliances like a modern toaster oven with air fry setting, microwave, crockpot, coffeemaker and water kettle. It’s a close walk to the Earlham Campus and close to downtown."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Pat is an amazing host and the apartment is so cute and clean. Watching the chickens in the backyard was awesome and she even let us hold a baby chick! This was one of the best Airbnb experiences! If you are going to Richmond then I highly recommend that you stay here.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay! The host was very helpful and has created a welcoming space. It's a neat example of 1950s modern architecture - with an open floor plan and a fun, almost treehouse feel. There's a nice balcony overlooking the back yard complete with beautiful chickens! Well-located, with an easy walk to Earlham College and places to walk dogs. We would definitely stay there again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My daughter and I had a wonderful time staying in Pat’s lovely place so close to Earlham for our campus visit. It was delightful from start to finish. We hope to come back!

Although she had offered to turn on the air conditioning, I opted for the open windows and was glad I did...the katydid chorus (and other night-time insects) put me right to sleep. In the morning I enjoyed chatting with her about her backyard chicken flock. Any time I am passing through or near Richmond, I will see if Pat has space for me."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pat prepared everything for us. The plans to get into the apartment were easy to understand, and communication with Pat was easy and quick. A great host!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pat was very welcoming and easy to communicate with. She made our one night layover very relaxing and made our puppy’s first long road trip a success by letting him run in her fenced in backyard with her super dog, Lambchops. The little apartment is above her house and super cute. Very homey. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely, relaxing place to stay. I especially loved sitting on the balcony and watching the little chicks. Pat is a really attentive, thoughtful host."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place - lots of space inside and fun to sit on the balcony and watch the chickens in the back year. Pat was very willing to help.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pat was very attentive to what made our family comfortable when we stayed with her.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy! Lovely place!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,There's not enough words to really say how truly special this little place is with the Babbling Fountain next to your balcony the chickens in the backyard the fireflies at night Windows surrounding you in the unit and then there's the lovely Pat who just makes it all that much better
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pat’s place exceeded our expectations in every way. An amazing space inside and out and a living testimony to the beauty inherent in sustainable living. Pat is a delightful host, helpfully sharing her experience and wisdom while we enjoyed the privacy of this quiet retreat. Our only regret is that we weren’t able to stay longer. One of our favorite places (and we’ve stayed in a lot of them!). Highly recommended!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very cute place with lots of windows for natural light to come in. You can watch her chickens from the balcony and there is a nice hiking trail nearby.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a great location--close to Earlham College, particularly. We loved the open floor plan, natural aesthetic, and comfort of the space."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Pat’s place is a nice place to stay close to Earlham college.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks so much for sharing your beautiful space. I appreciated the real live houseplants, the interesting and homey decorating, and the well-stocked bookshelf. The yoga mat and weights were a thoughtful touch for my morning exercise routine. I enjoyed learning about Techbuilt houses—what a interesting chance to experience architectural history! I appreciated the tips on keeping the space cool during this heat wave—it stayed pleasant. Thank you! I hope to have another chance to visit soon."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Yet anther wonderful stay at Pat's place. It's always a pleasure to be back. Pat is a great host, the location is great, and the apartment is very cozy."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent accommodations with an eclectic feel and very pleasing.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pat's place is great! The apartment is just as it appears in the pictures. When the kitchen is complete, it will make this place amazing! Such a quiet and pretty neighborhood. Pat was very helpful and communicative. She even told me about construction around Indianapolis and a better route to her place. I would definitely check to see if her place is available if needed when visiting family in the area in the future."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a restful quiet time and I would make a return visit if I am in the area.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pat’s place is great!! So unique and fun - perfect for visiting my daughter at Earlham because it’s so close, and we even got to meet the chickens 😊 I would definitely love to stay there again - thank you Pat!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host! Really perfect set up for us. Loved it.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It’s an extraordinary and sophisticated apartment that’s located in a very safe neighborhood. Pat is an accessible and friendly host who has provided an unique apartment space that is clean, comfortable and peaceful."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a very charming and spacious place with lots of windows in a lovely neighborhood with a great yard. Pat was an excellent host--good communication and a very easy check-in and check-out. I would definitely stay here again, and I recommend it!"
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really loved how easy check-in was, how easy it was to find Pat's place, and how close it was to Earlham's campus. Pat has a gorgeous back yard that is very peaceful with singing birds and quietly clucking chickens. The bedding was soft and it was easy to sleep there. It's a nice big space and I loved the variety of books she had! For my needs, though, the space was not clean enough. It was a bit like visiting a friend who didn't know you were coming. I have a severe dust allergy, am immune compromised, and have celiac disease, which means that I can get sick from small food particles. The inside of the microwave was covered with food splatters and crumbs, the fridge had some kind of dirt or food stuff in the bottom, and the bathtub had enough dust and hair on it that it really looked like it hadn't been cleaned. I showed these things to Pat and she said that I must be a picky cleaner. I explained about my celiac disease and she pushed back, asking questions about how the crumbs could make me sick. At that point, she did do a quick wipe of the fridge, but made no attempt to clean the bathroom. I found the microwave issue later, but had no confidence that she would respond well, so I didn't bother to say anything. I did use the cleaner she had around and completely cleaned the bathroom and as much of the kitchen area as was safe for me to touch. The cloth I used came up dirty enough that it really seemed that it hadn't been cleaned. And then when I went to plug in my phone in the bedroom, I found a bunch of dust or dirt behind the dresser. So I won't be going back, but I do think it's a nice place to stay, especially for the cost, if you don't need it to be particularly clean."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love the chickens roaming and the natural sunlight
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a cozy house with lots of charm in a great location if you’re coming to visit Earlham. Pat was very friendly. We enjoyed the back porch with a view of the chickens. Will stay here again if we come back to Richmond.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A nice spot for an out of town parent(s) to visit with their Earlhamite!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Within moments of our arrival, my son (18) declared this the ""perfect Airbnb""--peaceful setting, happy chickens in the backyard, a sweet cat and dog, and a stylish rustic-modern space to stay in."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"nice unit, great privacy, natural environment."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for Earlham visit or Richmond stay-quiet inspiring comfortable.
Host is uber helpful and resourceful."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great. Will be even better when the kitchen is installed.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pat’s Airbnb is a fun find in Richmond, Indiana!
The location was a quiet sanctuary with a delightful balcony overlooking a yard with chickens!
Pat was a very gracious host that gave us a great education on chickens, answered all our questions, let my daughter collect the eggs twice, and let us hold these endearing creatures!
In addition, Pat was easy to communicate with and responded quickly.
One thing that we were really thankful for was a bedroom that could be separated by a wall partition so my daughter could sleep in during the morning and not be disturbed when I got up earlier and could make coffee and move around in the rest of the place.
Also, we found the Airbnb to be central and close by many attractions such as the Joseph Moore Museum, Wayne County Historical Museum, Levi Coffin House, Welcome Center, and the falls for fossil collecting.
Overall, we were sad to leave and would love to go back again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pat was such a great host! We told her we'd be in late and she left the door unlocked so we wouldn't have to fiddle with the lockbox once we got there. Cozy, warm atmosphere and getting to meet the chickens, her dog and cat was such a nice bonus of staying there."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely recommend this place to stay. Amenities the space. Everything was perfect

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We thought this place was such a cool spot. We loved the decor with the uniqueness of the high ceilings wood floors and over-sized couches. We loved how it felt like “a home away from home.” It was our son’s prom night and we were able to capture beautiful shots inside the loft.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is THE place! The Starr Loft was one of the coolest Airbnb experiences my family has had to date. The interior is decorated so beautifully, quality Wi-Fi, comfy couches... Train tracks are nearby which for us was a plus cause I had a lot of trainiac kids with me. lol
10/10, stay here."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay. Love the historic district. Mike and terri have done a great job with the space. Very cool. We didnt end up interacting with Mike and Terri because everything was so clear. We had no need. Would definately stay there again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,a really nice place to stay. combination trendy and rustic furnishings . The coolest location in Richmond. Parking is good and free. Walking distance to nice restaurants and a coffee shop
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike &Terri’s place was really beautiful! The pictures on the site don’t do it justice!! They were really responsive when I had questions regarding our stay and things to do. The only fly in the ointment was not being made aware of construction on our check-in day that resulted in the street (which provided access to the building and parking) being closed!!! We had no idea where to park. Mike & Terri were quick to respond and gave directions to a parking garage lot around the corner- not ideal for unloading a car, but it was all there was. Late afternoon on our second day the road did open back up and we were able to park in front of the building."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very nice and in walking distance of some good food and hangouts. Would definitely recommend!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was such a unique space. We enjoyed really much. Thanks for having us.
2024-03-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"The place was beautiful but loud noises from the street, neighbors, and next door bar made it impossible to relax.
The checkout list on the guestbook, did not match the instructions that were sent via text thru the app.
Very dissatisfied and disappointed with the stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful loft! Had everything we needed! Very clean! We enjoyed ourself and would recommend!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was stunning! Had plenty of room for guests. A lot of construction going on in Richmond that made parking difficult and moving around the town.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very trendy place to stay in downtown Richmond!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The room has a unique history and has a lot of character with a good mix of old and new charm. There is a train that runs nearby but it wasn’t distracting. There are also some cool places to eat and it is close to the Ford Model T Museum.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We love Richmond so much! The amazing historical architecture is such a gem. I enjoyed the wine bar and drink at Roscoe’s as well as the included breakfast! The spot is awesome and I love the history and charm. Richmond has very cool antique shops.
Check-in was super easy. Everything was clean and exactly as described. Will definitely stay again when back in the area!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Me and the girls had a wonderful time! The Starr Loft was stunning. We loved all of the decor and details. It was comfortable, easily accessible, within walking distance of everything we wanted to do, very clean, just as described and pictured in the listing. We didn’t have any trouble at all. We HIGHLY recommend this place and we will DEFINITELY be back again!!!! Thank you for sharing your place with us!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing time here! Walking distance to a great places and business and overall very charming town!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 4th time staying at The Starr Loft! It has become one of our favorite quick weekend getaways. We love that there are restaurants within walking distance where we can have a cocktail. It's also close to antique alley, which is always a fun day. It's a beautiful shabby chic space! If I were to complain about anything-it would be the noise. It's not very peaceful-if that is what you are looking for. You can hear things going on in different parts of the building-but that is in no way the fault of Mike and Terri. They are excellent hosts. It also would not deter us from coming back, and it hasn't yet. We look forward to coming back!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This loft is a very beautiful space. You can tell it has been well thought out to make guests feel at home. My husband and I highly recommend this space. The steps would be the only issue for someone with a disability. We absolutely loved it. Loved hearing the train run nearby. Thank you Terri and Mike!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay...will be our Richmond ""spot"" every time we visit!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was a great stay, and I hope to be back again some day. A great way to get away for a few days. The loft is very spacious with plenty of cool details and heart put into it, making it feel like a home. The only downside was the wifi seemed intermittent with our personal devices, but it was not necessary for our stay, and it made disconnecting from the digital world more practical, which was nice."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay for a long weekend or in my case a staycation! Highly recommend!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Loved the uniqueness of the place and all the history. Lots of great places to eat within walking distance.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This was not our first time staying here. We loved it in the past. Roomy, great location and just overall a great fit for our needs. We were a bit disappointed in the cleanliness this time. There was substantial dust throughout, leftover items in the fridge when we arrived and trash/food waste in under the trash can. We also had to do laundry immediately upon arriving: there were linens to fold and put away in the dryer and all the towels were in the washing machine and needed to be dried. Upon checking out, we went to start the dish washer and there were no dish tabs under the sink( check out directions stated they would be there). Normally not a big issue, however we had to go find and buy dishwasher tabs on Christmas morning, which wasn’t easy.
Hopefully, this isn’t the new normal and just a result of a busy holiday season, as we loved staying here in the past."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at my home away from home! I love staying here when visiting with family in the area. Convenient, cozy, and such a beautiful space."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,most beautiful place ive been in yet. you really dont feel like your in richmond at all.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Always my favorite place to stay in Richmond feels like my home away from home
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cool space in an old building. Main bed is very comfortable. There is a bit of traffic and train noise in the living room if people are sleeping there.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect space to stay when visiting Richmond. The loft is spacious and is a great space to have friends and family visit.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect! I was performing in a musical locally and this was the perfect place to relax and have fellow cast mates over after the show. Awesome place! Great bathroom! Great kitchen! Comfy bed! And the couches…….unbelievable! Just awesome will probably stay again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Fantastic stay for myself and the bridesmaids and perfect location for getting ready for the big day!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious! Great windows!
Excellent places to eat and hang out at. Easy to walk to and find.
Pick this place !"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had the best time during our stay. The Airbnb was absolutely gorgeous and exactly the vibe we were looking for. We loved going to the local coffee shops and exploring the little town! We will definitely be back to this Airbnb on the future!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious, quiet, immaculate place! Great kitchen, bathroom. Comfy bed, tons of room to relax, watch TV, play games. And very good neighborhood place nearby for included breakfast! I hope to return!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay at the Starr Loft. The space is impressive and grand yet still so comfortable. Street parking was easy (Sunday) and the check in process simple. Good memories were made for our overnight trip to the Richmond area. Thanks to Mike and Terri for sharing your lovely loft.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spent the weekend for Miami of Ohio family weekend. The price and uniqueness of the loft made the 40 minute drive to campus worth it. The loft is beautiful. Wish we had planned to spend more time there to enjoy the beauty and the surrounding restaurants. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute local find! In the heart of the depot district and you can’t beat the coffee and breakfast at Roscoes!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful Airbnb at the depot district. It was perfect for me and my bridesmaids to get ready together. Hosts were communicative and shared all details.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it here!! Rented it for the whole weekend for our wedding and it was the perfect spot!! Loved the attention to detail of the decorating, cozy and comfortable beds, and couches.
It made for the perfect spot to get ready at including making pictures perfect. Will definitely be staying and recommending this lovely spot again!!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Hosts were quick to answer questions. Charming loft. Wish we were staying longer. Breakfast at Roscoe’s was a nice treat!!
Great little spot."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Would stay here again! Beautiful place and great location. Hosts were excellent!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautifully spacious loft with hosts who were very responsive. After a long day of driving, we didn’t arrive until later in the evening and I sent a question upon arrival, and they responded immediately! If you find yourself in Richmond, Indiana, stay here! The free coffee and breakfast sandwiches around the corner were much better than we could have imagined and highly appreciated. :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect spot to stay while in town. I had family over for breakfast and was able to have friends over foe dinner. Perfect spot yo entertain or have people visit. It was exactly what I needed for this visit since it was a reunion weekend. Lot of compliments on the space. I will rent this space again when I come to town to visit.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Starr Loft while bringing my daughter to school in Richmond from Alberta, Canada. This was an incredibly stressful time and large transition for our family. Starr loft provided a nurturing environment that I never would of had in a hotel experience. I cant thank Mike and Terri enough for providing such a fantastic space to feel at home in away from home. I will always return to Starr Loft if it is available."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, modern and rustic, great kitchen & unique bathroom, wonderfully high ceilings."
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"PROS: - great location. walkable to restaurants.
- very charming loft with mounds of character.
- came with (2) free breakfasts & drinks at Roscoes which was very good.
- hosts were very communicative when checking in.
- would love to become a regular at this airbnb if it was clean....
CONS: - unfortunately the loft was extremely dirty. (everything was dusty, food crumbs on chairs (and chair covers were filthy and stained), floor and in sink. bathtub and shower dirty with visible orange mildew..... there is no way it had been cleaned despite me being charged a cleaning fee. I messaged the hosts with a lot of detail of what all was dirty & offered to show them photos I took but I did not receive a reply nor offered a refund of the cleaning fee."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely loft.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So cute!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to call home for a few days while visiting family. Very clean and beautiful loft. Plenty of room for a family of 4. Easy check-in and out. Mike and Terri were great hosts.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Beautiful space and excellent hosts…included coffee and breakfast at Roscoe’s was wonderful!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Great stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,such a fun unique area! loved the vibe of the loft! would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great decor! Nice for an easy laid back time!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Mike and Terri were fantastic hosts! So accommodating and responsive. We also loved the included breakfast at Roscoe’s! The loft was beautiful, comfortable, and spacious. Our only critique is that there was loud music happening nearby late into the night and the trains also caused us to struggle some with sleep. Would recommend bringing ear plugs if you’re easily awakened and you’ll be set!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,beautifully done loft
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft was great for my wife & I. we used it as home-based and couldn't ask for a better location. Minus the occasional train and a neighbor, the Loft was both quiet and convenient. we can see how the Loft could be fun with six but is also perfect for two. The Loft is as advertised with wonderful hosts which make staying at the Loft a pleasant experience and one to remember."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always enjoy my time at the Starr!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If we could give more than five stars, we would! The place was beautiful and almost dreamlike. We wish we could’ve spent more time there!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We LOVED the loft! Looked exactly like the photos. Mike was super responsive to our questions and very friendly. Parking was super easy. My kids loved the games and Jenga available. We definitely will stay there again when we come back to the area for a visit.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is so cool. It’s a 1800s building that used to be a tin shop. It’s so neat. The furnishings are so eccentric, the decor one of a kind, and the space it’s self is amazing! The free coffee/breakfast at Roscoes was a sweet added touch. Highly recommend Roscoes. So good. All of this was so good and that’s where it stops. The place was dirty. Hair in the tub, hair in the shower, dirty kitchen cabinets, dirty refrigerator, laundry in the washer and dryer that had been been started and not completed. The owners offered to “‘make it right the next day” but how do you clean an Air BNB you’d already checked into when you need to be in the place?! I think I one time this place was loved, but not so much anymore. In addition, it’s really loud (which the owners can’t control) because there’s a main bridge under construction and a train that goes by multiple times a day. Be aware. Overall, it has potential but the lack of cleanliness detours me from ever staying here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed in Richmond while attending events in the AirBnb desert that is Oxford, OH, 40 minutes south. What a great play! Much easier than Cincinnati and light years hipper than what is available in Hamilton. I highly recommend Mike & Terri’s place. I wish I’d had more people to share it with - a gem."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Really cool place! Bed is pretty firm but all was clean!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is a great spot for my husband and I to enjoy date night. There was plenty of space & the bed was comfortable.We were hoping to hit a restaurant nearby , and most are closed on Sundays, so check 1st. There are a few cool spots in the area where we didn't have time to check them out ,we'll be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This makes my second time staying at a Airbnb through this host! Their responsiveness was 11/10. Always helpful & kind.
So happy we have these places in Richmond area for a little stay-cation, or for those visiting from out of town.
It’s the perfect mix of industrial, modern & eclectic. Makes you feel at home."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We have reserved this space twice now and both times we had a great time! We especially love the unique decor and view. The hosts are very responsive and friendly.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a repeat stay here at the loft. We love it! If you enjoy antiques and eclectic surroundings you will, too."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the third time that we have stayed at Mike & Terri’s loft. It feels like home, and we love it! I would recommend it to everyone!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This loft is absolutely unique and gorgeous!!! The living room is stunning and the grand ceilings & artistic design of the space welcomes you. We appreciated the included Roscoe’s coffee and breakfast & enjoyed both mornings! Please consider this place as it is beautiful and the hosts are great!
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful apartment but it just wasn’t very clean. The beds and kitchen were clean but the whole place wasn’t dusted or swept and the bathroom… especially the shower wasn’t very clean. Be aware that due to location, you will hear trains and sirens most of the night.
The two free breakfasts at Roscoe was a nice touch. Thank you for that!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay was spur of the moment and went very smoothly. The loft was exactly as described and an awesome place to stay. Super cute decor!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderfully put together, easy instructions for accessing the property, accommodations for drinks and food around the corner."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As always, I am blessed to have such a nice location to take photos that is located in downtown Richmond. Comfortable and homy, as well as the perfect vibe to do photo shoots. The window lighting is awesome."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Terri were absolutely amazing! Great hosts!! The loft was gorgeous and very much ""my style"" of a space. I didn't see a lot of reviews that mentioned the train - one review said they could hear it ""off in the distance."" I have to respectfully disagree. It was a bit too noisy for my preference, but everyone likes a certain cup of tea, I suppose!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful loft! Perfect location in town but quiet. I felt right at home. Would definitely stay again
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was super nice and the location was convenient. Definitely want to stay again sometime!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful experience here. The flat was beautiful, and the accommodations were amazing. Lots to do within walking distance, and if you prefer to stay there and relax, the furniture was very comfortable to recline back on and relax. The only drawback was the small water heater, which shortened shower time. However, once I knew that it wasn't an issue. Most definitely looking forward to visiting this beautiful flat again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place really is a hidden gem in Richmond. The pictures just don't do it any justice. You have to see it in person to appreciate all the magic this spot offers. We live about 15 minutes away and were in need of a small get away for some R&R. We definitely felt transported to a place we'd never been before with this location. The open floor plan, high ceilings and décor are just beautiful. Everything was very clean, beds were super comfy, and make sure to soak in that tub! We will absolutely be returning to this loft. Hands down, 5 stars!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This loft is beautiful and was perfect for our girls night away. The only thing we didn’t like was how close to the railroad tracks we were. The train is frequent and loud. But overall, it was a wonderful stay. Highly recommend you try Roscoe’s coffee and Lulu’s tacos."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a neat little place. The details and old school charm made our visit one we will always remember. Very comfortable and all the little extras to make us feel like home.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is beautiful! Will definitely book again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic loft and a great location!
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We love staying here! It is a such a gem in a small town. The hosts are warm and friendly and it’s so easy to relax and read a book, play a board game, or make an elaborate dinner in the kitchen together."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautifully repurposed space! We loved the comfortable couches and egg chair, the beautiful chandelier, updated and clean kitchen and bath. Be aware there is a moderately steep flight of stairs upon entry and only a curtain separating the sleeping space. Perfect for an adult couple’s getaway. Carefully decorated, not overdone, and all the conveniences are there (coffee, sweeteners, glassware, etc.). The mattress was just okay. The location is fabulous! Don’t miss all the neat history across the street in the furniture store, or the adorable used bookstore down the block. Street parking was free and easy. Door code lock was simple to operate. Coincidentally, the antique books in the bedroom are the same set we have at home, passed down by my great-grandfather. We took it as a sign we were meant to stay there!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures don’t do this beautiful home justice! It was perfect for our family: 2 adults, 2 teens. Plenty of room, very clean and convenient location. We are originally from the area but moved several hours away. We will definitely be booking this again. We’ve found our go-to place for our trips back home."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and vibe!!! Absolutely perfect place to do photo shoots!!!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was an absolute gem. If you’re needing a place to stay in Richmond there can’t possibly be a better option, hotel other Airbnb or otherwise."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazing time staying at The Starr Loft! The area had so much to do and see, and the loft itself had such perfect vibes. From the beautiful decorative touches (the chandelier really makes you appreciate the exposed beams and soaring ceilings), to the fully equipped kitchen perfect for preparing food for a night in, it gives off eclectic luxury in the best way! Definitely check out the little museum on the Earlham campus if you have the chance to stay at the loft; it is a really impressive collection for a small school and the staff will walk you through and let you get hands on with reptiles! Also, can’t end this review without mentioning Mike and Terri as hosts; absolutely stellar communication and everything was easy and clear!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had an excellent stay and perfect for our visit with our daughter at Earlham. So easy and comfortable and spacious. We will be back!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The loft is absolutely AMAZING! Loved the decor and free breakfast at Roscoe's. Highly recommend!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Do yourself a favor and book it. Wonderful place!
2022-10-01,4.0,Group trip,"It's a very beautiful place, in walking distance to a lot of small attractions. Some things inside were a little bit hard to navigate, but overall worth it!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We had a nice stay at this Airbnb. The building was amazing and we loved the uniqueness and decoration. The only thing to be aware of is the train that came through multiple times. We live in the quiet countryside so it seemed loud to us however if you are used to city living you wouldn’t mind it. Highly recommend the hosts they were awesome!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay at The Starr Loft!! We would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in Richmond. We will certainly be back whenever we find ourselves in need of a night away. We also loved our breakfast at Roscoe's.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! This place delivers! Beautiful kitchen and appliances, perfect ombiance with the chandelier lighting in the living room, a cozy bedroom with a comfy bed, and romantically perfect bathroom. Everything was FANTASTIC! The area is historic and so cool. Loved walking to grab our breakfast and even that place is cool! Don't hesitate because this has it all and then some! I'm on a personal hunt to get leather couches just like in the loft. Couldn't be more pleased about our stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying at the Loft! We loved the Richmond area, and all Mike & Terri’s suggestions! This was our first time staying in an air bnb, and it was a pleasant experience."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This host was very helpful. We look forward to coming back.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a absolutely beautiful place to stay it definitely put us in the mood for antiquing. Loved that they offer complimentary breakfast and drinks for each day of our stay at Roscoes and it was delicious and good coffee. It was perfect for our stay in Richmond. So much history in the loft and the town. We will be back for sure.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Unique setting. The place is great. We enjoyed it very much.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful loft space. Very clean. Comfy bed, we slept well. We were in from out-of-state to ride the 60 mile Cardinal Greenway Trail, and this was conveniently close by. We had a little trouble getting the door unlocked, but once the motorcycles stopped roaring by we could hear the lock whirr in response to the code. As directed, we parked our van on the street with the bicycles inside, and had no problems. We could see the car from the second floor front window. We didn’t spend much time trying to figure out the TVs, but they seemed mostly streaming-oriented. We didn’t use the breakfast option (a web search said it was .3 miles away?) because we wanted an early start on the bike trail, which was a great trail."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cool spot in a cool neighborhood. Very fun space great for a visit to Richmond.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great place, we would certainly recommend!’n"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place! Very clean, great industrial/vintage decor, great communication from the host, and prime location to do the Antique Alley Trails. I plan on going back again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at Starr Loft, and won't be my last I am sure. I love this place so much! It is beautifully decorated and there are so many cool little touches. It just feels so calm and peaceful in the apartment. And, free breakfast at Roscoes! That was a great perk."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Spent one great evening in the loft! We shall be back soon!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was just “Wowed!” when our family walked in. Having never lived or stayed in a place like this before, you’ll never want to leave. We were so comfortable like no place ever. Space for everyone, the modern kitchen, and the temperature is perfect. I’m looking forward to returning if there’s availability. Thank you Mike and Terri."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place. Very clean. The building is definitely historic and goes with the little area it’s in. Only stayed for the night but would love to come back and explore some more!! The train in the distance was new to us but added to its uniqueness. The kitchen living room and bed room are beautiful. And how could we forget the shower, the whole family now wants an awesome shower like that! Host are amazing communicated extremely quickly as we booked seriously last minute!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at Mike & Terri's, it's right downtown and very close to everywhere we went over the weekend. We did not get a chance to check out any of the businesses around the area to give a solid recommendation but read several reviews on Roscoe's and a bit bummed we were not able to make it. Since the place is right downtown there were a few times where loud bikes or even the occasional police car would come by though personally did not bother us especially with a small speaker. We look forward to booking this place again in the future as we were beyond impressed overall !"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing space. Unique space in a cool area. Loved staying there. I already miss the incredible shower.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice loft space.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Starr Loft is absolutely stunning! The interior design is to die for. Honestly, we didn’t want to leave! It’s worth noting that the space underneath the loft is no longer Roscoes, but is now called Community of Faith. Just wanted to put that out there in case you’re looking for Roscoes upon arriving. Our stay was lovely and we will be booking this place again when we come back to Richmond."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This gorgeous loft is in a quiet neighborhood and I would definitely recommend staying here. Hosts were wonderful and accommodating. It was affordable. The vibes of the space are very rustic luxury. Even the beautiful photos do not do it justice. I could have just spent my vacation staying in and enjoying all of the ambience of the loft. Roscoe’s is a cute spot with swanky energy, I ended up buying a piece of art and enjoying a vegan smoothie. We arrived late in the night and felt safe in the streets unloading. Big gorgeous windows overlooking the streets. One of the most amazing showering experiences I’ve ever had. Perfect water pressure and temperature. Very clean everything. I hope to return and am thankful this spot is here!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely amazing place to stay while we visited the University of Indiana East for our daughter. We we will back:)
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A comfortable place to stay, close to lots to do! The hosts are responsive. We didn’t have any kiddos with us, but I don’t think this place would be well-suited for littles due to the open staircase and the general openness of the space. But, for a couple of a group of friends, it’s great!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Booked this apartment as a gift for my brother and his girlfriend, and they loved it! A gorgeous space in an incredible location."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the quaint, quiet loft! Perfect for a couples getaway or a family!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at the Starr Loft. The property was so much fun for our family of four (my wife and I and our two children, ages 13 and 9). We definitely will return the next time that we are in the area.
Thanks so much, Mike and Terri!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Loft is the perfect spot to reconnect and recharge. We enjoyed the large sofas for family movie night. We participated in the Chocolate Trail in Richmond. We enjoyed lots of yummy treats.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was absolutely lovely. The only thing I’ll mention is that if you are easily bothered by noise there is a train that comes through frequently and is very loud. Other than that we loved the space!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautiful!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and plenty of space. Walking distance to restaurants and bars. Close to Cardinal Greenway Trail.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is one of a kind. Super cool and has all you’ll need for a great stay. Can’t think of a thing we didn’t like about the loft! Roscoe’s has moved so it’s no longer just below the loft, but it’s only a couple short blocks. The breakfast was delicious! We also stopped for a drink at their tap room, inexpensive and very cool setting.
Thanks for a great stay!
Of note, this is a downtown out of the 60-70’s that seems to be going through some needed changes. We look forward to seeing the revitalization!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place! Would love to stay here again.

2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Good location and fun space.
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, spacious apartment in a super cool building in a historic district. Take time to appreciate the carefully curated objects throughout. Clean and comfortable—a great place for an extended stay. Slightly disappointed the coffee shop is no longer ""downstairs,"" but still close enough to walk."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Second stay. Lovely, special spot. Very quiet even on Saturday night. The town is very sleepy on Sunday morning- it was a challenge to find an open coffee shop. But the calm and quiet was wonderful."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We eloped in October and opted to have some bridal pictures in the venue where we spent our night away from it all. The place has a lot of space, romance, and history. We loved it."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really a neat little place. We were just passing though and it happened to be at a good stopping point. But, I am sure when the weather was nice and on a weekend this would be a really fun spot to hangout and walk around Richmond.
Very clean and had every amenity you would need."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Honesty, the best Richmond has to offer! Clean, everything you need, easy check in, easy free parking and very room!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Always great to stay at The Loft!! Stairs are a little iffy, but take them slow. ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL UP THERE!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend even if you have kids with you. The place was $15 more than a typical hotel room and was much better!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying at the Starr Loft. It’s a unique and wonderful place to stay. Great location near Richmond restaurants and cafes. We were biking on the Cardinal Greenway trail, and the Loft is close to the trailhead. We hope we can stay with Mike and Terri again next time we come to Richmond!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was perfect. They have most of the tools you need ready to go, and there is enough nearby to where if you want something specific you can grab it! I highly recommend grabbing this if you're gonna be doing things in the area, or just wanna vibe in this super cute and edgy place. Loved it."
2021-11-01,4.0,Group trip,"The Loft was BEAUTIFUL.✨ Perfect for our weekend getaway, and the location with a coffee shop and other small stores within walking distance, was lovely."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This loft is very tastefully done and a peaceful location to stay. It’s well equipped and you can walk to restaurants around the area. We’ll definitely stay again if in town visiting family.
2021-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I won't be returning here. It is not clean enough for someone who likes things really clean. For example, I was looking forward to taking a bath but there were hairs in the tub and there were feathers and dust on the living room floor. The cool factor of living in an old loft is dampened by the fact that the ceilings are so high and the HVAC infrastructure is visible so who knows how many insects and dust are there. Plus the industrial AC is really loud! It rained a lot the night I was there and there was a leak from the ceiling dripping next to the kitchen."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Unique location with a true loft feel. We loved the decor and feeling the history of the building. Look forward to the next stay!
,,,Mold in shower; no hot water; no mattress pad on old awful mattress; leftover food in fridge; throw rugs everywhere covering stained carpet; no cable tv; no porch lights to illuminate tripping hazards of sidewalk and porch; mold growing up siding all over front of house; no street sign or street number; furnished entire house with throwaway furniture; don’t go!
