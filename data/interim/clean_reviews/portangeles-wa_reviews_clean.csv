2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location close to hurricane ridge and nearby town (port angles). Has Tesla EV charging. Cabin was clean with heater and loved the jaccuzi. Overall best place to relax for the weekend.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was very enjoyable, quiet, and peaceful surroundings! A lot to do inside of the home on the rainy days."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Thanks so much for hosting us. Wonderful, quiet setting."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay here. It was a perfect location. It was peaceful and quiet, and still close enough to town. Hosts were attentive and made they're home so cozy. thank you!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is a dream location and the most beautiful place to relax after a day of hiking.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a beautiful location, the hosts thought of everything a traveler could need. Plenty of info about the town and surrounding activities. The cabin was very clean and inviting. We enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub and using the outdoor fireplace and watching the stars. This was a perfect home base for exploring the Olympic Peninsula! Thank you for sharing this special place with us."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little cabin with hiking trails on site. Very clean and decorated nicely. Also very private! You can get to town in about 8 minutes.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best Airbnb that I have ever stayed at. The views are stunning, the home is beautiful, the hot tub was so relaxing. I’ll be telling all my friends about this place and plan on returning as well."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot, beautiful home, super helpful and enjoyable amenities. A little slice of heaven."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our time at the cabin! The surroundings were so beautiful and the details in the cabin were so thoughtful. Plenty of space for a family to have a wonderful time. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were amazing and super responsive! From the moment we walked in, the smell hit me first (like fall was made into a candle) and it was the most welcoming and warm home I’ve ever stepped in.
Sitting in the hot tub with the snow falling, fire crackling, and your best friends next to you? A weekend you’ll never forget. I will be thinking about this cabin for the rest of days and recommending it to anyone looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Absolutely great stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is the most incredible, hidden gem of a cabin! The night we stayed, snow began to fall just as we settled into the cedar hot tub. The morning dawn shown on a blanket of white snow. I couldn’t think of a better place to enjoy a trip to Olympic National Park!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful home in a special location. Close to town, yet remote and peaceful. Every detail has been thought through, making for a very well appointed and comfortable home. We love a clean and comfortable home and this house met every expectation. We loved how cozy, warm and welcoming the house is, yet free of clutter. The wood stove and the heated bathroom floor were special amenities for a winter visit. Looking forward to a return visit sometime soon!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved this cozy stay with friends and their small human - great kitchen for home-cooked meals, great toys (board and stuffed!) for the kiddo, serene atmospheres for busy adults to wind down and spend quality time together, thoughtful touches, tasteful cabin decor. All was as advertised so the following isn't a criticism but rather an FYI for those deciding to stay - the entrance to one of the bedrooms is either through the (1) bathroom or through the spare bedroom, so best suited for a group of close friends/family who are willing to share a space rather than a large group looking for privacy from each other. That said, we in particular would gladly come back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute spot. Would definitely go back.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a perfect cabin to be in! It was super cozy and had all the amenities we needed. It was in a great location as well! We will forsure book again
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin with enough seclusion to really feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere. The hot tub was a huge plus as well as the comfy big beds and fireplace. 5 star indeed
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of my favorite stays. The place was absolutely gorgeous and it's the perfect location for a peaceful weekend in nature. Between the wood stove, cozy lighting, hot tub, full kitchen, and heated bathroom floor, there was so much to love about it. We will absolutely be returning here."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin, loved the space and lighting. VERY comfortable master bed. We loved the hot tub, and all the games offered."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"An exceptionally beautiful home. The attention to detail was in each and every room. Tastefully decorated with extras. The beds were very comfortable, kitchen well stocked, quality towels/linens. I cooked 3 meals each day and never lacked what was needed for meal preparation. Several cozy locations to curl up and read a book. I was there with my son and grandson. They enjoyed the games and hot tub. The park is only open Friday, Saturday & Sunday during the winter. That was our only disappointment but I should have checked that in advance. Every aspect was easy and exceeded our expectations. The loft area is perfect for kids. You can see and hear them but feels very much their own special place."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,What a magical lil cabin can’t wait to comeback
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Omgg this was the CUTEST place to stay! It was so beautiful and so quiet. There are neighbors but neither of you can see each other and the entire neighborhood is quiet. The house itself was so adorable, and the bears everywhere made us laugh. It feels so incredibly homey, and like it's your own getaway house. I am definitely taking notes on what I want my future house to have! The Jacuzzi was perfect and being surrounded by a forest was so nice. I've been to a few airbnbs but this one is definitely my favorite hands down. PA is only a ten-ish drive away but you're still secluded enough to feel immense privacy. Absolutely stunning house and surroundings. We will definitely be back and definitely for a longer stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second year taking our family here for a mid-winter escape and we’re already planning our trip next year! The cabin feels like the owners actually stay here, not that they’re just throwing a place together for a quick buck.
Favorite parts, by family member
7yo: board games!
2yo: cedar hot tub and no bedtime
Dad: cedar hot tub, wood stove, comfy bed and pillows (and he’s picky!). All the bears!
Mom: lots of open space to hang out, wood stove, heated bathroom floors (!!)."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, clean, and well appointed cabin on an awesome property in a fantastic location - what more could you want?! We were seriously impressed by both the interior of the cabin and the property itself, everything was actually BETTER in real life than in the pictures (which is rare!). The outdoor area is so picturesque and has a lovely hot tub, fire pit, sitting areas, and trails directly off the property. We also loved that the main bedroom actually has a large king size bed and was super cozy. You’re also minutes from an entrance to the Olympics, I seriously don’t think you could get much closer without camping. Overall, highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sara and Ashley are great hosts who are super responsive! We enjoyed our stay at this beautiful cabin, especially the hot tub. All the instructions and resources were shared well in advance, which made the entire checkin process easy. The place was kept clean, organized and well throughout with cozy cabin vibes. I highly recommend this place!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing stay, only problem we had was toilet wouldn’t flush occasionally"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We are enjoyed our stay here and wish we could stay longer. Our stay has been a very pleasant experience and we were surprised at all the amenities that we discovered. Our expectations have been exceeded and we plan to visit again in the near future.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location that is also very private! Couldn't have asked for a better place to disconnect from the outside world! The inside decor is very welcoming and comfy! They supply everything you need, full kitchen, lots of beds, plenty of towels, lots of DVDs to watch movies, jacuzzi, firewood, grill, and even a Tesla charger. Would 100% recommend to anyone who is looking for a private peaceful stay in the woods with all the comfort of home."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved this adorable cabin retreat and would easily come back! Especially loved the hot tub even with the colder November weather.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,One of the best air bnb’s we’ve stayed at! Very clean and exactly as listed. Definitely recommend this place to couples and families interested in a home base to explore Olympic National Park
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing host! Amazing property!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Traveled here from CT so we could explore the peninsula. The home was beautiful & cozy. Had a lot of great amenities: heated bathroom floors, wood stove, grill, hot tub.
The hosts were super friendly & communication was a 10/10. I would definitely stay here again! We didn’t want to leave!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed 4 nights at this cabin and will certainly be back for an even longer stay! Perfectly appointed with every amenity you could ever think of, and a few you may not realize you need til you’re there. We were looking to turn off our phones and recharge our batteries following an intensely busy stretch of life… this was the perfect spot. Super comfortable beds, beautiful cedar hot tub, walking distance to many hiking trails, and modern conveniences throughout the cabin. WiFi and TV didn’t work well, but a blessing in disguise to be honest as we were able to concentrate on relaxing. Highly recc’d!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Privately tucked amongst cedar trees, this house is so thoughtfully designed (inside and out) that we are hoping to come back next summer. Our intention for the weekend was to rest and be together (it was a romantic getaway for us) and we could not have been more satisfied with EVERYTHING! I am a realtor on Whidbey Island. I see a lot of vacation rentals. The care and love that went into this place is palpable. We loved that we felt ""so far away"" yet were still close enough to Pt. Angeles that we had access to great dining. The house exceeded our expectations. If you are looking for a quiet retreat surrounded by beauty, this is it! Already looking forward to a summertime visit!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was incredibly comfortable and had every amenity imaginable. Would not hesitate to book again in the future.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location right at the entrance of Olympic National Park. Was great to get away from the hustle and bustle of things and take some time to relax in this beautiful forest. Would return and stay here if we were every in the area again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to relax & enjoy nature. The outdoor area was really nice. Enjoyed the hot tub.
House had a great cabin feel to it.
Would definitely come back."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful, relaxing visit and will sure to be back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy cabin. Felt like home. Clean renovated bathroom, soft new towels, heated bathroom floors. Well equipped kitchen. Loved wooden walls in bedrooms. Loft was a fun place for our younger daughter. Enjoyed wood burning fireplace. Comfy couches. Very well decorated cabin! Very cool wooden hot tub, fire pit with chairs and more! Literally 10 seconds away from Hurricane Ridge entrance! We had a great time with our family at this cabin! Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay at the Hurricane Ridge Retreat. The property feels really private even though is just a few minutes drive from Port Angeles, and just around the corner from the Hurricane Ridge Park entrance. We really enjoyed lying on the wooden loungers looking up at the trees and watching the birds, and relaxing in the hot tub after hiking. The house is really cosy (specially the bedrooms) which made it difficult to leave for hikes in the morning!.
Overall we had a great stay and wished we could have stayed longer."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved my stay. Beautiful location and very private. So nice to unwind from the hustle + bustle of my everyday in the city.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had amazing stay. It was the perfect place for us after a long day of hiking. Looking forward to coming back someday!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful clean cabin. Very secluded and quiet. We felt alone in the woods and that’s just what we wanted. We’ve stayed at quite a few cabins over the last few years and this was one of the top ones. Everything worked, was laid out nicely, very clean, private, etc. I actually left something behind and the host was so kind as to offer to send it back to me. We plan to stay here again in the future for sure. We just loved it. So random but their DVD collection was 10/10 lol."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very comfortable and peaceful mountain getaway, with unbeatable access to hurricane ridge. Very well kept, cozy, and relaxing."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A really charming cabin, highly recommended."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved staying at this cabin for our Olympic Peninsula explorations. We stayed in Forks for a few days prior to coming here to explore the west side, and then we came here. From here, we explored Hurricane Ridge, Lake Crescent, and Port Townsend for whale watching. This cabin was the perfect basecamp for our adventures, and we loved coming home each day to this peaceful and beautiful cabin and property. We loved the outdoor area for star gazing and soaking in the cedar hot tub. The house itself was so cozy, homey, and clean. We would love to come again!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This charming cabin was a last minute booking as my family had some itinerary changes to our Washington trip. We couldn’t have lucked out more! As soon as we got to the house we regretted having to leave the next day! Everything was perfect and thought of. The mountain charm throughout the home was great. The rain shower felt AMAZING after a day of hiking. The bed in the main bedroom was literal heaven. Our kids loved the bed in the loft, the checkers and the cool Jenga blocks!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Host did a great job with the place. Sleeping arrangements are really good. There was a tesla car charger which helped. Great location to go to hurricane ridge and make a pitstop when doing the loop. We stayed for a day and felt it was a little expensive. Overall we enjoyed a lot
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved our stay - it was incredibly close to the Hurricane Ridge entrance of Olympic National Park which made it the perfect location for us! The care into the details of this home was above and beyond and it showed! The hot tub was the cherry on top. Would definitely return!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very relaxing stay for our family!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing location, and very well done home/property. We were sad to leave!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tucked inside the Olympic National Forest, this place is magical. It was so convenient to hiking Hurricane Ridge. The hot tub was wonderful for relaxing after a day of hiking. The place was exactly as described- very cozy and comfortable. I hope to stay again soon!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here. It was so peaceful and the perfect access point to our adventures in Olympic National Park. My husband and I loved the heated bathroom floor, stocked kitchen and king sized bed while our five year old loved the board games and the deer that came to visit us while we were in the hot tub. We’d definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house is everything advertised and MORE! It is comfortable and clean, well-furnished and well-provisioned, and provides an incredible, peaceful retreat from the outside world. The beds were SUPER comfortable, the bathroom was modern with heated floors and an amazing shower, kitchen was stocked with everything we needed (including every type of coffee accoutrement anyone would need) and there was plenty of information about the house, the surrounding areas, and activities. The best part of the house is the outdoor space! There is a lovely soaking tub, a fire pit (owners provided wood! they also left some makings for s'mores, but I'd recommend bringing your own) and hammocks in the trees for extra peaceful afternoons. This is a fantastic place to stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying at the cabin. It was peaceful and a perfect location. Everything worked as it should and the property manager was very responsive. We would love to stay here again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome!!! It was the perfect location and set up for my family to enjoy Olympic National Park. The kids loved the hot tub and making s'mores at the fire pit at night. We can't wait to come back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Such a beautiful cabin with the cutest details. Definitely will be coming back to stay again in the future.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As every other review says, this place is AMAZING! Worth every cent if you’re looking to escape and enjoy nature. My husband and I traveled with our 7 month old and we loved that we could watch her monitor via wifi from the hot tub! What a wonderful first family get away."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay at the Hurricane Ridge Retreat. It fit our family of 5 perfectly and was so cozy and welcoming. The hot tub was a favorite spot each evening after a day of hiking & exploring. We stayed 6 nights and having a washer & dryer was an added bonus. Great location and so peaceful! Really appreciated the attention to detail. The s’mores fixings and bottle of wine waiting for us were so nice! Highly recommend!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay!! We really enjoyed the cedar hot tub and the trail that is accessible from the property.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Booked this place before we knew that hurricane ridge was to be closed. However, this was still the best place we stayed on our entire Olympia trip. It is extremely well located with multiple hikes very close by. The outside area was amazing. 1st time in a cedar hot tub, which was great. Got to see deer wandering around regularly. Would definitely rent again if in the area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place in a cool spot. Loved enjoying the bon fire pit in the evenings. We will definitely be back when Hurricane Ridge is back open. Thanks!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and secluded.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spent a long weekend here, serves as an excellent base camp for hikes around Hurricane Ridge and Lake Crescent. Interior is well designed and rustic and the outdoor seating and fire pit were excellent. Cedar tub was superb. Overall, a great spot for a quiet long weekend."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed for a week for our honeymoon. We will be back! 5 stars
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ever find one of those places where it's so terrific that you're amazed it's not booked solid and unavailable all the time? This is one of those. Beautiful. Relaxing. Comfortable. Well thought-through basics tucked away right where they're needed. If their calendar gets a bit tighter, it's because we'll be some of the people filling it up with return visits."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m so glad we were able to find this cabin online! Absolutely stunning views, so peaceful. It was in the perfect location, close to the main attractions of the National Park, while also a fifteen minute drive to Port Angeles. The outdoor patio was beautiful, and amazing at night with the fire pit and cedar hot tub. The interior was great, the heated tile floor in the bathroom was clutch for the cooler nights. We’re already talking about coming back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of my favorite Airbnbs.
This pristine and cozy cabin exceeded our expectations. The cedar hot tub was our favorite and the surroundings are stunning. The beds are so comfortable and the bathroom is luxurious. It was the best getaway for a birthday weekend with friends.
10/10 recommend."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely stunning!! Exactly what we needed! The beautiful back yard of forest, and the perfect selection of board games to play inside! And the hot tub!☺️
Thank you again for helping to make this an amazing 2 day get away!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This cabin exceeded our expectations in every way! It is absolutely perfect for a peaceful retreat in the most beautiful surroundings! Great to disconnect from the world.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful, cozy home! it was clean, welcoming, and just perfect"
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay - peaceful location with easy access to Hurricane Ridge. Hot tub was unique and super nice.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay. Very picturesque, quiet and comfy - perfect for moms book club weekend. we were having such a great time, we ask for late check out the day before we were supposed to check out. They were very responsive and allowed us to do that. We also forgot a couple of items, which they located, and sent to us! Very accommodating."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Location and accommodation exceeded our expectations. Amazing location, comfy beds, amazing shower. We loved it. Wish we could have stayed the week. Highly recommend even for the most discerning traveler."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a superb location, close enough to town, but beautifully private and serene. The cabin is fantastic and a great value. We loved our stay here."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely one of the nicest Air BnBs we’ve ever stayed in. So clean and well appointed—it felt like we were the first people to ever stay there! The quality of everything in the house is excellent. So many little touches that just made it feel so special and relaxing. We really felt cared for. So glad we stayed and hope to return again one day!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a cute cabin in beautiful surroundings! I love the attention to details in this unit. So close tow town that has everything you need. The only thing that would have been better is if the heat was turned on before our arrival. The unit was very cold in the winter. But overall, we loved this place!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the best air bnbs we've stayed at! the property is full of amenities and has a well stocked kitchen. our favorites were the heated bathroom floors and the cedar hot tub. we could not say enough nice things about this spot and will definitely be back soon!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great spot!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay. Super clean and cozy. This place deserves a million stars!!!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This location is beautiful and the cabin is a perfect getaway home. Amazing job with the decor and landscape!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home in a private setting. Hot tub was very relaxing after a long day. The heated floors in the bathroom were an added plus! Beds were super comfortable. Loved the way the place was decorated! Easy check in/check out. Only con would be no service but personally that is a pro for me as I don’t like being bothered on vacation 😅 Added to our list of places to stay again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are constant repeats at this spot, and will continue to be for generations to come 😀. The cabin is maintained perfectly, the location is unbeatable, and the backyard is about as beautiful and natural as it gets! Great hosts!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I’ve used Airbnb many times, and this may be my favorite stay. The cabin is located right outside the entrance of Hurricane Ridge which made access quick and easy; it’s also a short easy drive to Port Angeles, so getting all of the essentials was seamless.
There’s much more space in the cabin than I anticipated, the loft basically serves as a third bedroom, which our kids LOVED.
The property itself is obviously well cared for, from all of the details inside to the outside set up, it’s apparent that so much care is put into the cabin. Without a doubt, we’ll be staying here in the future."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really enjoyed out stay at this lovely cabin. It was warm, cozy and perfect spot for our family to pop up to Hurricane Ridge to get some ski time."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my family’s favorite vacation spot! The entire cabin was incredibly cozy. The bed was very comfortable, the kitchen well stocked and had a delightful s’mores / warm drink set up. The hot tub was especially fun during the snow. We’re already excited to plan our return trip!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was amazing in every way. Worth every penny. You won’t regret choosing this Airbnb when you visit Olympic National Park. Nice and cozy and so much attention to detail. It was perfect!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here! So cozy. Had a quick one-nighter after a day of hiking in the park. This house is 3 minutes from the Lake Angeles trailhead and about 15 minutes from Port Angeles, making it the perfect spot for hikers. The hot tub and shower inside are both amazing after a long hike. The host generously let us in before check-in time so we could change into dry clothes before getting lunch. Much more space to sleep than we initially thought – plenty of space for three guys."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing private, quite place, in the middle of fairytale forest with deer families passing by. If you are looking for the perfect relaxation getaway - I highly recommend it. The cedar barrel outside, with spectacular view on the forest is something that will certainly change your entire perspective of how hot tube should look/feel like. I do not think I will enjoy chilling in other type of hot tube from this very moment.
Should emphasize the all small touching details in the house - you can definitely say that the person who owns it truly love this place from the bottom of the heat.
I can’t imagine more calm place that will bring you to the Christmas mood even then it is still one month ahead."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was perfect, hot tub, king bed, kitchen, all of it was great. We’re already thinking about going back."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"No complaints except for that the internet is relatively slow, and the hot tub instructions were sparse. The hot tub takes very long (several hours) to get to target temperature.
Great place and location otherwise."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was absolutely perfect. You can tell a lot of love goes into this place with all the decorations and amenities. Everything you may want or need is available and the host is so kind.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved staying the Hurricane Ridge Retreat. The moment we pulled up into the driveway, we fell in love with it. The cabin smelled amazing and the decor made it that much more cozier. We had everything we needed to make dinner our first night, we enjoyed the hot tub in the middle of the forest and under the stars, and we slept so well that it was difficult to get up for our drive to our hikes in the morning. 5/5 stars for everything and we can’t wait to bring our friends and family here in the future!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great cabin - would work well for two couples or a family. Loved the cedar hot tub, fire pit, and proximity to the park.
Be sure to check the NPS website to see if Hurricane Ridge is open prior to your booking."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing cozy cabin perfect for a home base for our hiking trip!
Place was just as we had expected and more! Nice little touches really makes you feel welcomed. Super clean and had everything we needed for our stay.
We will definitely book again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place very clean and definitely recommend! I love it
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was an absolutely perfect location to explore day hikes for the Olympic National Forest. The house had everything we needed and then some. If you're looking for an evening out for dinner head in town at Next Door Gastro Pub. Everything was as advertised! Fantastic trip...
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here. The cozy atmosphere and great views was key for a great weekend. The hot tub and amazing view made it a memorable adventure.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location if you want to explore Hurricane Ridge area. It is about a 2 minute drive to entrance. House is decorated very nicely and the outdoor space is a great place to relax after hiking…The hot tub was much appreciated. Lake Dawn is across the street so not actually viewable from backyard…but there is a hiking trail that may lead to a vista where you have a view?..we didn’t make it up that far. Wifi was a bit spotty so recommend making all important calls and communication prior to returning for the evening.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved everything about this place! No details were missed!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check in, great location. Clean and well-stocked. Would do it again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing place with incredible attention to detail. The property, the amenities, and the facilities were all top notch. Anyone would be lucky to stay here."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and professionally maintained. Layout was a little confusing but it fit our family of 5 great.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to explore the Hurricane Ridge section of Olympic National Park.
The house is extremely comfortable; the beds make you feel like you are sleeping on a cloud.
We all enjoyed the hot tub and lovely property! Would definitely come back!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful, family friendly cabin! The owners have created such a beautiful and inviting place for kids and their parents to stay. Our son LOVED the loft space to play and watch a movie. He wanted desperately to take the large deer home with us and named him Rudy. The hot tub was a wonderful place for my husband and I to relax and unwind after hiking and exploring the beauty of Olympic National Park and the surrounding areas. The cabin is perfectly located near one of the visitor's centers and is not far from downtown Port Angeles. There are trails on the property itself as well as just down the road to explore. All in all, they have thought of everything you could need to make your stay perfect!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay near hiking. Layout was a little funny, but not too inconvenient. There was no gas on property for the fire outside, although we didn’t try to message to get this sorted (was not a big deal for us)."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Hurricane Ridge Retreat is a great place to stay while visiting Hurricane ridge or the Crescent Lake. Both are an easy car ride away. The cabin is fully renovated and has lots of great touches that make it feel homey. The beds were very comfortable. We would definitely recommend staying here to our family and friends.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the best cabin rental we have ever experienced. We sincerely appreciated the little details that made the stay extra special -- for instance, the first aid kit, the espresso machine, games, robes, s'more packs, the citronella candles..we could go on and on. Someone walked carefully through the every day life of a vacationer and anticipated his/her every need. The cabin was clean and comfortable and decorated perfectly. We long to return for a soak in the hot tub and to sit around the fire pit. Thank you for opening your cabin so that we could experience the magic of the forest in simple yet luxurious style."
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"We took this trip for my daughter’s 16th birthday so it was all focused on her. My 8yo son was very gracious about doing everything she wanted to do and only wanted this hot tub. We specifically booked this place cause he asked for a hot tub, and it was much more expensive than we would have liked. Needless to say the hot tub did not work. When I messaged them, thinking I didn’t know how to get it to work, Instead of sending instructions or saying “hmm that’s odd, try this or that and if not I’ll get someone out there,” they immediately responded saying it was too late to send someone. I responded saying “hey just tell me how to do it I dont know if somethings wrong…..” They were then completely unresponsive the rest of that evening and through the next morning, even to the Airbnb people who tried to contact them. Because of the amount of $ we spent that we wouldn’t have without wanting the hot tub, everything was very disappointing. Though the property/house was beautiful, I would steer clear because if you have any issues you may not get a response."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was really a great cabin in the woods. We used it as of jumping off point to go up to Hurricane Ridge (completely amazing) and explore the Olympic National Park. We also loved exploring the trail right from the property. Didn’t see a soul!
We also took the Little river road right from Lake Dawn Road as a cut through down to Madison Falls - worked out perfectly (kind of looks sketchy on the map but in the summer it’s totally easy).
Kids loved hanging around on the hammocks & the loft was a total hit. We had a little deer come visit too. The house was so clean, cute and well stocked. Exactly what we were looking for! The property management team was super easy to work with and very responsive. A+!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay in the cabin exceeded our expectations. The attention to detail inside and outside the cabin is incredible and it was super clean. We appreciated the nice fluffy towels and comfy beds to come back to after a day hiking in the national park. The location is perfect for those wanting to explore Hurricane Ridge and Lake Crescent. Would recommend to anyone in a heartbeat for an incredible stay in the Pacific Northwest.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is what dreams are made of… super comfortable beds, everything you need for a great time (even s’mores kits), beautiful hiking trail right out of the backyard and minutes from the national park entrance. We will come from Florida again to visit this cabin."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is absolutely wonderful. Maybe the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at. Everything is perfectly thought out, from the hot tub and fire pit to the kitchen, bathroom, laundry, etc. The bed was very comfortable and the location was perfect after a hike on Hurricane Ridge"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing!! The place itself is so cozy with extremely comfortable beds and the “cozy corner” was the perfect place for sitting and watching a movie at the end of the day! The outdoor space is so cute, we loved the cedar wood hot tub after a long day of hiking. The appliances are all new/updated and the house was very clean. As for location, it was a perfect jumping off point for exploring all the area has to offer!! Would absolutely stay here again"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing place! We loved every second!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great cabin in a great location. We loved coming back after a long day of hiking and getting to soak in the hot tub. Our little guy really loved the loft area too and that became his playroom when it was raining too much outside. Overall a great stay!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful place! Our family had a great time! The perfect place for adventures and the girls loved the hot tub and s'mores.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is better than pictured. It felt like arriving home. Everything has been thought of and the location could not be any more perfect! If you are looking to enjoy the PNW, this is the place!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have been road tripping through Washington state for 2 weeks staying in different Airbnbs in different cities. This one was our favorite! So cozy & the beds were so comfortable! Hot tub, fire place, heated bathroom floors, & nespresso machine was our favorite part! We are big on coffee & that just made our trip even better to be able to make our coffee at home with a view! Lots of awesome hikes! We did Hurricane Hill which is right up the road, Mount Storm King, Marymere Falls, Sol Duc Falls, & Hole in the Wall at Rialto Beach. Highly recommend staying here! We hope to come back one day! :)"
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,This is such a lovely spot! Perfect for hikers and adventure enthusiasts who want to be close to different parks nearby. The hot tub was a great way to relax sore muscles from a day of hiking. This is an ideal place for 4 people.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the best cabin experience ever! Had everything you would need. Games, firewood, robes, detergent, s’mores kits, coffee, you name it! The cedar tub was perfect, even got to see some deer in the backyard! Minutes from hurricane ridge. Would love to stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great and cozy cabin. Had everything we needed. My kids loved the stuffy decorations in the loft, ple t of fun games to play, of course the hot tub, and the huge dvd collection. The big shower and heater floors were a nice touch too. Heaters in every room kept us cozy. Kitchen had all the cooking equipment we needed. Robes provided for back and forth to the hot tub. Nice access to local hikes. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing cabin! Host was super accommodating. Went for a girls trip and would recommend to anyone.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Spectacular. Cannot say enough good things. If you’re traveling with a toddler, we set up the pack and play in the space between the second bedroom and the bathroom which while it doesn’t have a door provided enough space between the kids to work well and meant we didn’t have to sleep in the loft!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely magical and beautiful retreat!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was fantastic! Location was great and they had tons of amenities as well.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay. We loved the feeling of being surrounded by the forest. The location was ideal. It didn't feel like too long of a drive up and down the road to get to town, but it was remote enough that we felt like we were in a cabin in the woods. We found Port Angeles itself to be lovely as well.
We loved that the host was so thoughtful about the items in the house. Little things like games, firestarter, matches, roasting sticks, cooking oil, salt, pepper, coffee, tea, and soap were there for us even though these are things we normally always try to remember to pack because you never know what will be available, but this host was thoughtful enough to have them available in case we forgot our own. We had everything we needed for cooking, everything we needed for a stress-free stay.
We would love to come back someday."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"🏔🐻 to the future guests of wanderers choice,
you are in for an amazing treat once you arrive at the cabin! the drive up was so beautiful and we were greeted with snowfall and a cozy spot to enjoy for a few days. the cabin has a wood stove that is fully stocked with fire wood. a large kitchen to fix up your favorite homemade soup to enjoy around the large table with your friends and family. the cedar tub is a full on treat and the ambience at night is so peaceful and enjoyable with the hanging lights. we loved having the fire pit going while soaking in the cedar tub drinking wine. at the end of the day you will find yourself sleeping in the most comfortable bed ever. we loved utilizing the stocked board and card games with our family. the shower is very impressive accompanied by a heated floor.
added touches include s’mores kits, espresso coffee and an amazing time!
see you soon Hurricane ridge!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our favorite stay, ever! This cabin is nestled in one of the most beautiful forests in the whole world, for starters. The location was great. We arrived in a spring snow storm that made it even more enchanting. There is even a hiking trail that leaves from the driveway. Everything about the cabin itself was so well-considered and hospitable. You can tell that it is well-cared for. Our family (2 grownups, 2 kids, and a newly walking toddler), was completely comfortable. Great amenities for indoor and outdoor cooking, lots of games and toys, etc. Nicely updated bathroom and laundry with every detail provided for. The owners were very easy to get in touch with and very welcoming. The best!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the cleanest place I have ever stayed. The attention to detail was phenomenal. They have really gone out of their way to make this cabin special. The hot tub was perfect and we managed to make a fire in the fire pit for s’mores (they provide the supplies!) even though it was pouring out. This cabin is beyond perfect! We will definitely be back.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended. Beautiful cabin and location. Would definitely recommend it.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best Airbnb experience hands down!!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is everything you could want in a quiet, relaxing mountain getaway. The cedar hot tub is phenomenal after a long day of hiking. bonus points, there's even a trail right off the driveway that goes deep into the woods. didn't see a soul on it the entire time we were there or when we walked it. You won't be disappointed with this BNB, provided you remember you've got satellite internet here in the middle of no where. Time to disconnect!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Booked this location for my employee’s birthday weekend as a thank you for his hard work. Sounds like it was the exactly what he was expecting based on the listing and they had a perfect weekend.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our favorite cabin yet! So comfortable and in a beautiful location. A great home base for all the Pacific Northwest activities we had planned!
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,We hosted a men's support group retreat at the Hurricane Ridge Retreat cabin. It exceeded our expectations and Wanderers Choice had set the bar for the location amenities. Thank you!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay here! The Hurricane Ridge Retreat is a beautifully maintained property with so many cozy features. The heated bathroom floor, the cedar tub, the king-sized bed in the master - all were amazing! The decorations were very tasteful and give that perfect woodsy feel, I especially liked the electric kerosene lamps in every room. The kitchen had everything we needed to make our meals and the nespresso machine provided a tasty treat every morning. It is clear that the hosts have put a lot of thought into taking care of their guests' every need. I also love that the Retreat is as close as it gets to Hurricane Ridge, definitely worth it to drive up the mountain for some amazing views and exploration. All in all I could not recommend this property more, and truly hope to return someday!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Hurricane Ridge Retreat is an amazing cabin; it's clean, comfortable, and has everything you need to make your trip to the Olympics a memorable one. Our group thoroughly enjoyed the cedar tub and fire pit after a long day of hiking and exploring, and greatly appreciated the comfortable beds. Highly recommended! Thanks!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my wife went to celebrate our second anniversary in Wanderers Choice place. it was a great location, the outdoor pool and fireplace was great, even the master bedroom was also fantastic including the bedding.
one thing I think they can add is the mirrors, we liked the outdoor vibe near the fireplace and hot tub, but it kind of felt scary as there was no fence towards the forest.
Great place, great location, would love to come again."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the location, easy to find.
Never wanted to leave the Hot Tub!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to spend a relaxing weekend!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place, out in nature but still close enough to the city to spend the day there if you want. The beds are comfy and have plenty of pillows, the bathroom floors are heated, nice rainfall/pebble shower, the hot tub is great and easy to use. Overall, a wonderful experience."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Multiple times during our stay we raved about how this is a 5 star air BnB! From the absolute coziness of the cabin with its several places to relax (hello, daybed! I need one at home now), to the well stocked kitchen that had everything we needed for meals, and then some. The hot tub was perfect after a long hike, and the bed very comfortable. You can tell the hosts take the time to think of everything their guests will need to make their stay enjoyable. It was also quiet while still being very accessible from main roads. 10/10 would stay here again!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"The perfect cozy cabin to stay with the cutest decor 😍 super easy to get to, communication with the host is fast! Would stay here again for sure!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house, great location to the National Park. Definitely recommend!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Came for the skiing but stayed for the cabin. We loved how close the cabin was located to Hurricane Ridge, being first timers we were amazed with the views as we drove up to the ridge. We enjoyed the beauty of the trees and snow while being cozy and comfortable in the cabin. It was the perfect place to enjoy some good food and board games with friends. Sitting in the cedar tub was a true treat to top off our stay at this winter wonderland."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, and the owners are really helpful. My vehicle stuck in the snow and they came and helped me. Thank you."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Magical
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you are looking for a place to take a break from school and work, this is the place! We had everything we need in the lodge, and the lodge has enough space for 5 people to live in! Indeed the yard is really big, and we really enjoyed the views of the snow and trees! It's also close to the hurricane ridge ski resort if you are a ski lover! Such a fun place to stay and will definitely come back!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely lovely.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful place! Had such an amazing time that we already booked our next stay!!!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a gem!! It is the definition of home away from home. A rain shower, espresso Machine, Netflix and walking trails! Pictures don't do this place justice. And if you have kids, there's plenty of games and things to keep them entertained. Can't wait to come back!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The value of this stay cannot be explained enough! We felt perfectly warm and cozy amidst the forest- completely immersed in nature. This Airbnb has endless amenities and is so beautifully designed. Easy drive to town for food, even easier drive to hiking trails. Will definitely return if we are ever back in the PNW!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space with lots of room and privacy. The backyard was beyond our expectations. Numerous beds but only one shared bathroom. Cedar tub was amazing!

2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stop your search, this is as perfect of a cabin in the mountains experience as you're going to get. The fire chimney, cedar hot tub, hammocks everything oozes coziness! We had great family bonding playing all kinds of board games, making dinner with the fully stocked kitchen. Port Angeles is only a 10 minutes drive down the mountain and the hurricane visitor center is 20 minutes up. Trust us, you will not regret one bit. Come to this heavenly retreat to de-stress, reconnect, and feel alive again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing location. Fully equipped with everything you want and need.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our time at this home. It was very clean and had everything we needed. The location was perfect for us as we were visiting the Olympic National Park. We had fun fishing on Lake Sutherland which is inside the gated community where the home is located. Gavin was quick to respond to any question we had. We would definitely stay here again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful views. Great place for family vacation. The loft & bath would be great for kids! The kitchen accommodations were above expectation.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband, daughter and I had a wonderful 2 night stay at Gavin’s Tiny Home.
Olympic Peninsula is spectacular and having the ability to stay at a wonderful place like Gavin’s made the trip extra special.
We would love to return and spend more time …and will certainly try to stay at Gavin’s place again."

Recommend this place for a small group or family looking to explore the Olympic Peninsula!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at this AirBnB, and we will certainly be back. First, the AirBnB is in a perfect location--near a lake and beautiful wooded hillside and just a few minutes drive from amazing hikes in Olympic. Second, the place itself had everything we could possibly need. It's cozy, clean, and well-stocked. I'm especially grateful for the bin of board games. Finally, Gavin is an extremely kind and responsive host. I highly recommend this place!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just book this enchanting Airbnb! From the moment you drive up you won't want to leave! Amber listed all the must do's around the property, which was very helpful, and everything was withinan hour or closer drive. She takes pride in her beautiful home, it was spotless, beautiful, and the hot tub was the perfect way to end every day after exploring! Not to mention the bed is so comfortable! I would stay here over and over again. Thank you for sharing your home."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I needed a dreamy, peaceful getaway and this was it! I was absolutely delighted as soon as I arrived. The lights on the deck, the rushing river, the moss covered trees..it was like stepping into a different world. Very cozy, very inspiring!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Sol Duc Serenity! It is not only beautiful, but in a great location for exploring Olympic National Park! We greatly enjoyed the hot tub and relaxing in front of the fireplace after a long day of hiking. The bed is super comfortable! On our last day, six eagles were hanging out around the river. It was so peaceful! Also, I didn’t realize it until days after we left, but I left a banana bread I made in the oven! I’m so sorry for the cleaner if he/she had to find/clean it or the next guest! We really enjoyed our stay! Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent 2 nights here and were blown away by the location right on the river. It was so beautiful it was hard to leave each day to go hiking! We loved the large windows and the well stocked kitchen (we bought groceries from Forks and cooked meals in the house), and the deck overlooking the river. We saw bald eagles fly by!
This place was a good location for us to explore the Hoh Rainforest and some western and northern beaches on the peninsula.
The only issue we had was that the warm water from both sinks only lasted a minute or so before becoming freezing cold (fortunately this didn’t happen in the shower).
Overall it was an amazing stay and I’m so happy availability opened up for my trip! You will not regret booking this place!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"i went back to count and of the 16 airbnb’s my husband and i have stayed at, this is by far our favorite. perfect in every way. beautiful. great location. had everything we needed. i only
wish we could’ve stayed longer :)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All I can say is, book it! If you’re coming to the area to experience the Olympic National Forest/Park like us, then this is the perfect place. Centrally located to see everything we wanted to see. We stayed five nights, and spent one of the days just enjoying the place and spending a lot of time in the hot tub feeling completely immersed in the forest. Cannot wait to return. Believe the hype in the reviews, it was perfect for us."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christine and I stayed in Sol Duc Serenity for our honeymoon and it did not disappoint. The house is right next to the Sol Duc River and has two large picture windows. The cool evenings are perfect for the hot tub which is private and also overlooks the river. The highlights of our stay were morning coffees, sitting by the fire in the living room and reading, having a dip in the hot tub, watching movies in the evening and listening to the rain. We hope that Sol Duc Serenity will be available for years to come so that we can return to celebrate our anniversaries."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the most beautiful places that I have ever stayed! We saw an eagle from the porch, the fireplace was perfectly cozy, and it was easy to get to hikes in Olympic National Park and beat the crowd. Pretty sure I will be coming back ASAP!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My Fiancé and I (he proposed on the porch of this place!) had the most amazing stay here! The instructions were very clear, check out instructions were easy, and Amber was incredibly kind and caring and helped immensely with his proposal. The Hot tub was very clean and amazing even though it was chilly out, and the sounds of the river were unmatched! Definitely book this place, you won’t regret it - it blew all of our expectations out of the water!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is even better than the photos! Beautiful inside and out, and has everything you need for a long or short stay. The hot tub is simply amazing after a long day of hiking. Incredibly cozy inside, with a view so gorgeous it almost makes it hard to go venture into Olympic Nat’l Park."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Third time visiting. It’s a great spot and lovely location
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful Airbnb, private with breathtaking views. Saw bald eagles flying by every afternoon. Had an issue with the bottom which was handled promptly by Amber. Loved it"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Place! My boyfriend & I did a 9-day roadtrip for my birthday, & this was our first stop! Absolutely beautiful home.
Remember to download offline maps before your trip! It's a lifesaver :)
We both loved it! Spent a day exploring the Hoh Rainforest, & came back to relax in the hotub. We ate our meals on the patio, & spent our nights looking up at the stars.
Perfect romantic getaway. Would definitely stay again!
- Jess & Randy"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As you can probably tell by the fact that this place books up very quickly - this is an amazing stay. We were here for two nights and it was so peaceful, comfortable, and beautiful that we wish we could have stayed forever. Sol Duc River was gorgeous and had the most calming ambiance.
We found the bed to be very comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked, and the cabin itself was pristine.
If you can find an opening, BOOK IT. Even if it's in a slower season. Wonderful stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The easiest 5-star review we have ever written!
My wife and I just got married & spent the first part of our Honeymoon here! Amber’s gem in the PNW could not have been a more perfect experience & exceeded any and all expectations we had during our stay.
The location was prime, and was right in the middle of all the major attractions we were hoping to see in the ONP. During our four day stay, we were able to visit Mount Storm King, Marymere Falls, Hoh Rainforest, Cape Flattery, Ruby Beach & much more! And the view from the place? With breathtaking scenery and peaceful sounds from the Sol Duc River, the photos do not do its justice. After a long day of hiking, the hot tub and fireplace were magical.
Amber’s attention to detail is hard to miss, from the beautiful coffee mugs to the selection of books available, to the series of twilight movies at hand. She’s incredible! If you are looking for the perfect PNW getaway experience, look no further! We will be back again ❤️"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was an absolute delight! The location is perfect for a quiet getaway, surrounded by scenic views that are truly stunning. It was the ideal spot for relaxing after a day of hiking. I highly recommend for anyone seeking a tranquil escape!!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb was absolutely beautiful. Everything was clean and easy to find. There were dvds and board games provided and of course the hot tub was perfect. The bed was also extremely comfortable. I didn’t realize the neighbors were going to be so close but fortunately everyone was still quiet during our stay. Overall, this place was gorgeous and we were very bummed to only stay for one night. Amber was also very responsive when we messaged her with questions :)"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot right on the river. You could while away your whole trip just looking at the view! Good base for exploring the national park as well, just be prepared for longer drives as the places to see are quite spread out. Would definitely recommend and would love to come back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely spot for rest and relaxation. Peaceful, amazing nature, cozy cabin. Perfection all around. Super clean, very comfy bed and sofa. Great hot tub."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber’s place is an absolute oasis! We loved every minute of our stay there. The most serene, beautiful location. The surroundings were incredible, and we thoroughly enjoyed our time on the deck, in hot tub, and by the fire pit-even with the PNW rain. Comfy bed, cozy space, spacious bathroom. We will most definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay at Amber's home. The location is super convenient for exploring the nearby Nation Park or other scenic areas / trails. The home itself is very cozy and the hot tub on the river is an incredible experience. We so enjoyed the tranquility of our stay and hope to come back again for another visit in the future.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great weekend getaway with easy access to hiking and the coast. The hot tub overlooking the river was incredible.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot to get away for a couple of nights. Very quiet and comfortable. Soaking in the hot tub while watching the river flow by was a real treat. We spent a day exploring some of the beaches that we hadn't been to before: La Push, Ruby Beach and Kalaloch. Forks and the beaches are not too far away and the drive is beautiful. Since we were here during the winter, we mostly just lounged about, played games and read. The cabin makes a great base camp for explorations in the national park and surrounding areas."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amber’s place was amazing! We loved the hot tub by the river and sitting by the fireplace. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was fully stocked. Location was very easy to get to. We’d love to come back again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's the stunning setting that really makes this place special. Very quiet and serene. It's very private, however, if the neighbors are there just make sure you wear your bathing suit. The floor to ceiling windows allow for a spectacular river view.
The space is small but very well decorated with a full kitchen that has everything you'll need to make nice meals. And you will want to bring food because restaurants are about 25 minutes away. The closest easy hike is about 5 minutes down the road with otherwise hikes 10 minutes away. We loved our visit and hope to return again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved staying here!! It was even better than we expected and had everything we could’ve needed!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We came here for our honeymoon and could not be happier with our time here! It was so beautiful and so peaceful. We definitely plan to come back in a couple years for an anniversary. :)
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The quintessential Pacific NW cabin experience! Gorgeous setting among moss-draped trees along the banks of the Sol Duc River. The sound of the river rushing by was peaceful and relaxing. The cabin was well-stocked with everything you need, including cozy blankets, local guide books and board games. Loved the Northwest-themed decor throughout. Being able to enjoy the river right from the hot tub was wonderful. While the river drowns out the road traffic noise on the river side of the house, the noise is somewhat audible in the bedroom, though not a major issue unless you are a very light sleeper. Amber was extremely responsive and friendly, even allowing us an early check-in. We'll be back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,thanks
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,incredibly beautiful place. I wish I could stay longer
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,amazing
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Amber’s cabin. It was the perfect weekend getaway. I loved the hot tub and the river views.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Little slice of paradise in the PNW! Where to start with this gem…my friend and I were just there during this deep freeze in Jan, and it was the coziest , warmest , most peaceful place we have stayed in awhile. The bed was extremely comfortable, pillow top soft , all the fixtures and amenities were new and modern. You can tell Amber takes care of the property and pride in hosting. The cake topper is the hot tub , right next to the lovely flowing river , moss covered trees surrounding you, a gorgeous sunset down river … and then once the sunsets you have the most glorious view of the night sky . It really is magical.
As for location , it is easy to access from the main road, no need to worry about needing to have 4wheel drive . It is a perfect location to explore the upper part of the peninsula, from hiking shi-shi beach trail, to cape flattery , or to the east to spend time in Port Angeles or exploring Lake Crescent , it gives you a great jumping off point for flexible exploring !"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Probably my favorite Airbnb stay for the year! Cabin is modern, cozy, well decorated and stocked, beautiful surroundings with hot tub right on the Sul Doc, and a great launching pad for Olympic adventures. Unfortunately the power went out because of a big storm but Amber was super responsive and compensated me for the disruption. Plan to come back soon and often! This place is a gem"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay! The river and hot tub were wonderful.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great New Years trip here! The cabin was cozy and location was perfect to stay in and relax as well as do some hiking.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very relaxing and wonderful retreat, with a hottub right by the river. The cozy fireplace felt really nice during the Christmas week I stayed. Clear instructions, easy check-in, and a plenty of amenities and towels. One of my favorites near the Olympic National Forest"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a lovely little cabin an hour away from Port Angeles and 20 minutes from Forks. It just off the road but feels so peaceful and secluded because the sound of the river drowns out everything else. Lovely little place! Would highly recommend.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was lovely with a beautiful river view! Amber was also very communicative. Would definitely stay at the cabin again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful cabin! Would definitely stay again
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A magical stay even in the colder months. Hiked in nearby trails and sat in the hot tub listening to the river rush by. Couldn't have been better, warmed my heart."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfection! Serenity is the perfect name for this little gem. The cabin was cozy, clean, wonderfully decorated, and private. THE VIEW! Wow! We arrived after dark, so waking up to the stunning view of the river was a magical feeling. Amber has done an amazing job making the cabin a beautiful home away from home and the hustle & bustle of the city.
We will definitely be back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Ambers place, we loved everything about it. The view off the deck is outstanding and the windows from the living room and kitchen are so big you really get to enjoy the view even from inside. The fireplace was so cozy and really warmed the place. The hot tub was so relaxing, and we enjoyed being surrounded by trees and listening to the river. We also enjoyed the location because we felt away from it all, but didn’t mind taking a drive to the many things to do and see in the national park. We were able to see beaches, go hiking, and our favorite was exploring the Hoh rainforest. We would love to stay here again in the future!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was by far the best we have ever stayed at. The pictures do not do it justice! It was so peaceful, magical and cozy - everything I wanted for a getaway to relax and check out. My only regret is not booking it for the whole week! It was within an hour of the majority of things we wanted to do and see in Olympic National park and perfect location between forks (for all the twilight fans) and port Angeles. The hot tub and fire place were amazing and made us feel like we were finally on vacation. WiFi is iffy but Amber warned us of that and we wanted a break from day to day life anyways so it actually helped us not be all up in our phones, but for those who don’t have the same plan as us, just keep that in mind. We had one tiny hiccup with the washing machine and Amber was extremely responsive and helpful! It was clean, beautifully decorated and matched the description. This is now our favorite place to stay in the PNW and I can’t wait to be back."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amber’s cabin on the Sol-Duc was perfect for a weekend getaway. We’d love to stay here again!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was like something out of a dream definitely a must stay if visiting Olympic national park you won’t regret it also amber was super nice and very helpful with check in and check out very sweet person:)
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Airbnb’s we’ve stayed in! I don’t think you’ll find a better place location-wise in the park. If you want to visit the coast, the rainforest, the lake, or Port Angeles, this place is right in the middle of it all - which is important because it’s a huge park that requires a bit of driving to see everything.
The house is exactly as you see it in pictures. A quaint getaway with a wonderful fireplace that warms the main room to the coziest degree. The porch opens to the Sol Duc, a blue river in the midst of mossy green trees and the relaxing sound of moving water right outside your door. We took full advantage of the upgraded hot tub and cooked hot dogs over the fire.
There aren’t a ton of food options on the peninsula, but luckily Amber has the house stocked with everything needed to make a meal, including a variety of spices. We picked up provisions in Forks and cooked salmon and steak each night!
Amber even came out within 30 min to help with the fireplace."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place to get away. If peace and quiet and beauty are what your looking for this is it!! Back porch sticks out over the river bank and the white water river puts off peaceful music for relaxation! The hot tub on the bank is a perfect place to relax coupled with the fire pit in the front. Neighbors were around working chopping wood etc but no noise or hassle what so ever. It’s not a go out on the town place it’s a get away and relax place and that’s exactly why we were there !!! Kitchen was well equipped for cooking and the fire place was an added enjoyment. All in all a great place and easy host! Don’t leave without seeing the Hoh rain forest and taking a trip out to the beach!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you’re on the fence - just book it….You won’t regret it. We will be back time after time to visit this cabin. We are forever grateful to Amber for providing a lifetime of memories for me and my family.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had the time of our lives on our honey moon here. We arrived late at night and was pleasantly pleased to walk into the most coziest, charming place. Waking up to the view was unreal. We were blown away with the beauty of the location and home, From inside to out, this home is truly special and so beautiful. The amenities were all readily available and plenty of options for things to utilize if need be. The bed was literally the best bed we have both ever spelt in. Thank you so much Amber for a wonderful stay!! We will hopefully one day return!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved every second of our stay! It is secluded and private, with stunning views! Amber gave us plenty of recommendations and we tried every single one! It was super clean and exactly what we were looking for. It was perfectly located for all the things we wanted to see and visit while in Washington. If we ever take a trip to Washington again, this is where we will be staying because Amber is an amazing host!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber’s place is a beautiful and peaceful little getaway spot for the weekend!! The space had everything needed for a trip between two friends looking for a cozy weekend away from the city, with all the natural beauty of Sol Duc River and Olympic National Park surrounding it.
Amber was super helpful and proactive at sending instructions and giving us a description of the space and where to get groceries nearby, and everything was clean and well organized. Highly recommend! 😊"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easiest 5 star review I’ve ever written! This cute little house on the river is a dream. We spent two nights and it definitely wasn’t enough. The picturesque view looking out to the beautiful fall foliage and the river were everything we could have hoped for and more. Warning: you’ll never want to leave the deck once you park yourself there to listen to the running river with a cup of coffee or glass of wine. We were lucky enough to be there during the peak of fall foliage. Relaxing in the hot tub was very peaceful. The house was clean and cozy. Thanks Amber :)
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house was absolutely beautiful and in such a unique spot!!!! I couldn’t be happier with our stay here! It was so cool with the beautiful mossy trees and the river right there. Also it was a great location for where we went to the park and also isn’t far from the coast! We would definitely stay here again!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber's cabin is such a perfect place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the world. She gives excellent directions and its quite easy to find for feeling like you're miles away from everything. There is so much to do locally, hiking, beaches, tourist activities, or just enjoy the peace and quiet of the cabin with the river in the background. It is the perfect place unplug and unwind, either with your partner or some friends. The hot tub overlooking the river is the perfect place to let your body and mind take a break. Book your trip, you won't regret it!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A little slice of heaven is how I would describe Amber’s place. Nothing can describe the beauty that surrounds this little home. Waking up every morning and drinking my coffee on the porch with that beautiful view of the river was probably my favorite part of my trip. Amber was so helpful and an excellent communicator. My husband and I can’t wait to visit again, and we will definitely be staying here."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was hands down my favorite airbnb I have ever stayed at. Breathtaking views right out the front door. Amber has everything you could need in this little cabin and provided us with plenty of recommendations that we checked out. We used the hot tub every evening after being out hiking all day. Very comfortable bed and the shower water gets so hot, which is a must for me! I would definitely recommend this place to to anyone and would love to stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the most beautifully serene places I’ve ever been. Amber’s cabin is the cutest and perfect for my husband and I. It comes well equipped with most essentials and she was very helpful through the whole process.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"So a spiritual place, fell in love from the first sec. The view from the deck is simply fantastic. Very convenient location, but at night you feel like you sleep on the road, it's very close to the highway. The neighbors are very close also, but we were lucky with not so many people around. The cabin is tiny but it's ok for two people."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was magical!!! 😍😍 my boyfriend and I loved it. Looks even better in person! So cute and comfy. Super relaxing! Definitely recommend this place!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful place. The amenities were great, and everything we could ever need was provided. Nothing could beat sitting on the porch drinking coffee in the morning and then warming up around the fireplace inside at night."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amber's place was incredible! so beautiful and great location! we will definitely be back.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space is stunning, with mossy trees, bright stars, and a peaceful river."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time at Amber’s home. It was a perfect way to spend the weekend in Olympic Park and celebrate our engagement. Thank you!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my 40th birthday trip and it was absolutely perfect! The hot tub and views of the river we're incredible. The home is so cozy and perfectly decorated. The bed feels like you sleeping on a cloud. I just couldn't have picked a better spot to ring in this new year of life!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were in need of a getaway. Amber's cabin was exactly what we were looking for! The location is central to a lot of landmarks that we were interested in exploring. We stayed 3 nights and we were able to visit Kalaloch Beach, Ruby Beach, Rialto Beach, Lake Crescent, Hall of Mosses, Forks and Cape Flattery. The longest drive was a little over an hour.
The cabin was exactly as described. Tucked away from the highway and overlooking the river. I was able to make my way down to the river for some amazing sunset pictures. We had no complaints! Bed was comfy, living room and kitchen have everything you need (no microwave, but we didn't need it).
Finally, let's talk about the hot tub! Sometimes we come across these magical settings that we want to experience for our self....this is it! The hot tub is as close to the river as it can get. We enjoyed every minute looking at the scenery and listening to the sounds of the river. We will be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent a few days at Amber's place and it was perfect! It was clean, so cute, close to the Olympic National Park and such a peaceful location. It's such an amazing place for a getaway."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect stay. Such a peaceful environment. Things we enjoyed the most: the amazing hot tub overlooking the river, the super plush rugs on our feet, the bed and linens were incredibly comfortable, the outdoor chairs to read and drink coffee while overlooking the river were perfect. I would absolutely stay here again."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location in a cozy cabin. Looks exactly like the pictures!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ambers place was the perfect location for our trip to Olympic National Park. It was conveniently located to all of the hikes and attractions we were interested in! We loved walking down to the river and cooling off a bit after the hikes and then taking a dip in the hot tub at night or building a fire! We enjoyed drinking our coffee each morning on the deck with the view and sound of the river in the background. Amber was an excellent host and very responsive! If I find my way back to Olympic National park area I will 100% book again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing! What a treat, we made dinner and breakfast and ate outside enjoying the beautiful sounds of the river"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place. It was a much needed retreat. 10/10 would book again, if we’re back in the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Truly unreal setting on a beautiful river— lived hanging out in the hot tub listening to the sound of the river.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time and loved that the cabin was literally right in the middle of everything that we wanted to do. Olympic National Park is huge and everything will still quite a drive away, but we were right in the middle between the coast's hiking trails, Cape Flattery and Hurricane Ridge. Had we stayed in Port Angeles or Forks everything would have been much more of a drive each direction. The cabin was secluded and private, everything was clean and we felt very safe. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quiet retreat."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Along the Sol Duc River, the cabin is orientated towards the river and forest. Though the access road is close by, the river’s current muffle most noise of the little traffic one might hear. New hot tub was clean and allowed muscles to warm up after days of hiking. Centered between Crescent Lake and Forks, it was convenient if one is found going north, or south."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stunning location and home! Also loved all the thoughtful touches throughout the house. Hot tub was incredible at the end of the day.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was an absolutely beautiful home with breathtaking views. The perfect getaway! Ambers home was clean and had so many helpful instructions and cute notes🩵
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber's place was amazing. The river views are breathtaking and the house is cozy and clean. Host was great at communicating promptly. We will definitely be renting this house again, if you are looking for a place to relax and unwind, this is it!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome little cozy space with a beautiful view. Amber was great at providing everything we needed for a great stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect relaxing getaway! Right off the river which created an amazing ambiance. The place itself was modern and picturesque. Lots of great areas to explore around the place itself. Will definitely be back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent cabin, right off the river. The place itself was modern and picturesque. Communication with Amber was very easy. We traveled with our 10-months old baby boy and can recommend the place to families. Lots of great areas to explore around the place itself."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! I impulsively booked this place after seeing a tiktok and I am so thrilled that I did! The cabin is in perfect proximity to the river for a gorgeous view and relaxing white noise. Our stay was truly therapeutic! The location was perfect for us to easily drive to Hoh Rainforest, Forks, La Push, Lake Crescent, Sol Duc Falls and the most beautiful of my life at Cape Flattery. We were able to make simple meals for ourselves in the kitchen between hikes and drives which was a real time saver for us. The hot tub was a wonderful way to relax tired muscles at the end of the day. We would love to return again someday in the future! I’ll be thinking about this trip for a long long time!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber’s cabin was absolutely amazing. It is conveniently located and just a short distance from Forks where we bought our groceries for the week and they have a couple of restaurants. The cabin and the view are absolutely beautiful and we really enjoyed the hot tub at the end of each day, which was full of hiking so it was perfect. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom is very spacious. Amber is highly responsive and sent clear pre- check in and pre-check out instructions. We highly recommend this cabin and if we ever come back to the area we would 100% book here again. Thank you Amber, for helping make our honeymoon relaxing and stress free!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place that I’d happily revisit!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful and peaceful location. Definitely romantic for couples. We can’t to rebook!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was one of the best places I’ve stayed! I’ll definitely be staying here if I go back to Washington!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You kind of have an idea of the feeling Amber’s place has based off the pictures but it is so much better in person. I didn’t think it was possible. The home, the views, everything about it. Amber was very friendly and super informative on everything. Her home has little notes to remind you how to work certain things which I think is super helpful. I unfortunately had to cut my trip short but would stay there 10x over. Port Angeles isn’t too far (45 mins) and the drive is beautiful everywhere you go. This place is a little slice of heaven. I hope to stay here again in the future!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A truly magical stay - I could not even put into words what a great getaway this trip was. Sadly didn’t get to try out the hot tub but I’m definitely planning on coming back soon!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly one of the best spots we’ve stayed in around the area if solitude and scenery are what you are looking for. Nothing quite like waking up and strolling into the living room to the big windows and the river right outside.
The place was very comfortable and really felt like home for the time we were there, so much so that it was quite sad to have to leave and go back to our actual home.
Couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate an anniversary and to escape the fast paced world for a few days. Definitely will want to try and make this a tradition for us moving forward."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t begin to describe how wonderful our stay was. Amber was an amazing host. Always friendly and responsive. The location feels like the set of a movie. It is so magical, beautiful, and peaceful, that although we ventured out to Olympic National Forest and did other exploring, we were content to spend a lot of time at the home. Everything was perfect. All of the little touches like the lights on the porch, the hot tub, the fire pit, just made it extra special. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10!! Would be delighted to stay again!!
Amber has created a gorgeous modern retreat on the river and has provided perfect amenities, from a riverside hot tub and gorgeous open deck, to an updated Kitchen, cozy living room (all with incredible views of the river), a fabulous and updated large and clean bathroom, and a charming bedroom with a super comfy bed.
I'm so happy I treated myself to time at this unforgettable place! The rushing river and lush surroundings captivated my attention and fed my love for nature. Truly incredible!
After reading other reviews with guests lamenting having to leave the airbnb for other activities they'd planned, I knew I needed no further excursions- this amazing location is one of a kind and you won't want to leave!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely beautiful I proposed to my girlfriend here and it was absolutely perfect experience amber was the perfect host
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely enjoyed this stay! What a beautiful and well kept property. Stunning views.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I loved our stay! The place is very easy to navigate to and simply stunning! You will love waking up in the morning to the beautiful river views. The common area is spacious, kitchen has everything you need to cook and bake, and is even equipped with laundry machines if needed. The heating kept us cozy and hot tub was the perfect way to end the day. I even saw a bald eagle fly over! Amber was very responsive and helpful as well. It was truly a magical stay and we would love to go back. Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great location for a few days of adventuring around Olympic National Park. It was cute, but small if you are looking for a place for more than a couple people. Hot tub and fire place are 10/10."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here. Incredibly private and peaceful. Exactly what I would look for in a vacation rental. Hope to return soon!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful and tranquil experience. Although exploring the Olympic Peninsula was in our plans, we could have just as easily spent all our time at the AirBNB relaxing. Would definitely stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I planned a surprise anniversary getaway to Olympic National Park for my husband and I, which far exceeded my expectations. The place is a slice of paradise! Tucked in the woods yet fully accessible, it has been beautifully crafted and accessorized with everything you need for the perfect romantic and coziest weekend. My only regret was not booking more nights here as we did not want to leave. Amber is extremely thorough as well. There are instructions for everything, everywhere! In addition she provides recommendations for things to do nearby, and includes an assortment of games and movies for any downtime in the cabin. Truly one of the best host and I highly recommend staying here. I was on the fence when I first stumbled upon this place as I thought it was too good to be true, but I read someone else’s review who said book it you won’t regret it. Well I echo those thoughts. Book this place if you want to spend your weekend in paradise.
P.S. The hot tub and firepit are a plus!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little place, impeccably kept by Amber. Felt so cozy. Sitting in the hot tub and enjoying the river was an amazing experience. Really comfortable quilt on the bed."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one of the most beautiful Airbnbs I’ve stayed at, both for the surrounding nature and the clean and cute interior! We loved it."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely obsessed with Amber’s place. We literally did not want to leave- it’s even better than the photos. We spent our two days bouncing between the hot tub, the deck, and snuggling in front of the fireplace, and even decided to cut some of our travels short so we could spend more time at the airbnb. It’s not only gorgeous, but felt so welcoming and comforting. We will ABSOLUTELY be back, and I’m already recommending a stay to all of my friends."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful place! We didn’t want to leave.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a treat staying at this beautiful cabin. The view of the river was amazing and so peaceful. Would love to stay here again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great ambiance! very beautiful & amidst nature. river flowing & the sound of the wind over the water is very soothing & refreshing!!
we had planned quite a few places to visit in & around the area. with the great ambiance, my daughters were just excited to stay indoors & just enjoy the nature that was perfectly blended with this place."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We got this cabin as a little weekend get away and it was PERFECT! The surroundings were so relaxing and it was everything we were looking for. The host left great instructions and was communicative if we had any needs. Definitely recommend this cabin and the serenity it brought!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Honestly, words can not describe Amber’s place. It’s stunning, surreal, magical, just unbelievable. I loved everything second. We had light rain then full snow. It was the most beautiful experience ever. Even cleaning dishes I located a Bald Eagle! I’m will be back!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little gem was just what we needed to have some relax and recharge time.
Everything was just as described and the place was so comfy and inviting. The mattress in the bedroom was like sleeping in a cloud. The sound of the river was so soothing and the hot tub was clean and just the perfect place to “zen” out.
The location is perfect and not to far to travel for some day adventures.
One of the best cabins I’ve stayed in booking from air bnb, will definitely be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved being right on the river.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful place to stay! We had such a great time. Sitting in a hot tub by a rushing river … the absolute dream! And it was so private. Comfortable furnishings. Lovely getaway.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a gem! Very unique and we felt as if we were part of the forest! The large picture windows were an amazing bonus! The view truly could not be beat! If you are looking for something that communes you with nature and helps to soothe your soul, THIS is the place to do it."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place! The view is breathtaking and the space is so comfortable! It is only a 20-30 min drive to everything you need. This was our first time in the area and we are so happy we booked this Airbnb!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks so much for sharing your Sol Duc River getaway with us!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! Amber has done wonderful work making this cosy and romantic. Perfect for a couple’s getaway. We appreciated the very functional and usable kitchen and loved the cosy bed and the hot tub. We enjoyed this as our base during our fly fishing trip, it was a wonderful place to come home to after the long cold days on the river. Thanks Amber!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amber’s place was absolutely breathtaking. We will definitely be returning to this peaceful little spot. It’s modern even though it’s secluded and has the cutest furniture! We absolutely loved staying here.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amber’s rental cabin was extraordinarily beautiful. It was so peaceful and a slice of heaven to stay at! The views are captivating, the living room area is so cozy with the fireplace, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the hot tub was much needed after a long day of hiking at Olympic National Park. Definitely recommend staying at Amber’s!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location, everything just as described. We loved our stay overlooking the river. Clean and comfortable with all amenities clearly listed. Communication was clear and helpful."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin is a dream! Beautifully furnished, great amenities, perfect location. The gorgeous large windows let you relax with the view and sounds of the Sol Duc. Even on a rainy day in February, it was worth the trip to relax in the hot tub and just nest inside. Amber made everything easy and responded to questions quickly. Would absolutely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was truly an amazing experience. Everything was so well thought out and cozy. The bed was especially comfortable - loved your comforter. Amazing views and the Hot is amazing. Amber is a great host as well, you can ask her recommendations and stuff. But overall, had a great time! Five star airbnb!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"this place was absolutely beautiful! It truly felt like home and was just so perfect. I booked this place for my boyfriend and I on our last day of our vacation and it made our whole trip, truly the most peaceful and wonderful place. It was very clean and relaxing with an amazing view. I would definitely book again and recommend you to book as well ! Amber and her home are 10/10"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this little cabin for my birthday and it was the perfect cozy oasis for two nights. We loved being right on the river and having access to the hot tub and warming up inside by the fire!
The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to make our meal (we love cooking!) and we enjoyed our time listening to the rain on the roof, playing games, and even got sunshine on our final morning. Serene little cabin with everything you need for a true PNW getaway."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, beautiful view of the river and great proximity to the Forks/La Push area."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, beautiful location. Exactly what we hoped. We had a great time. Thanks, Amber!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I took my daughter and I up to this beautiful Airbnb and was not disappointed! Not only was the drive there gorgeous but the house and nature around it was everything we wanted. The hot tub right next to the river made nights surreal and the windows in front made mornings inviting. We would absolutely recommended this Airbnb to anyone who wants a relaxing getaway.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was utterly amazing. Amber was a fantastic host, clearly communicating the check in and out process. Her space is exactly as described and made for an amazing weekend away. Thank you so much for sharing, Amber!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber’s place was really nice, placed right next to the river. You could hear the beautiful stream whenever youre outside, but inside is dead silent. The bit windows really give a good view. The place is small and intimate, definitely suited for a couple or couple with small kids."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Words really can’t describe how amazing it was to be that close to the river. Late night hot tubbing is highly recommended, the sound of the river, is just perfect to keep you relaxed. If you stare at the river long enough, you’ll see bald eagles hunting for fish, I promise you won’t be disappointed. I’ll be back soon !"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place has an incredible location overlooking the River and trees surrounding that you feel like you’re deep inside the forest even though you’re not far from the cabins next door. It is small but cozy, enough for a couple of people who are looking to be out and about all day and then come back to hot tub and sit by the fire. Amber was great - very responsive and helpful."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Amber's place is beautiful! The location and views of the river couldn't be beat. It was easy to check in and check out, and everything was as described. We did have issues with both the fireplace and the hot tub (power must've blipped before arriving or just bad luck), but Amber was very communicative on how to fix them. Unfortunately the hot tub didn't heat enough to use it during our stay, which was one of the main reasons we booked this spot, but Amber reimbursed us for that portion. Everything else was great about the stay and Amber was a great host!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Well worth it and beautiful. Definitely will return.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,unique place to stay
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time at Amber’s place. The description and the photos are accurate. It’s a lovely little house, tucked into a gorgeous forest, right on the river. Cozy and beautiful. Also very quiet and extremely clean. I’d say it’s better for a couple—or an individual—than a group because it’s small. That said, if you stay in the summer, then there’s a large patio and a huge lot, so space isn’t so much of an issue.
Anyway, we highly recommend Amber’s place!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little cabin made for a cozy couple of days during a snow storm. It wasn’t easy to drive around the surrounding area for a day due to the weather, but with some groceries and supplies brought with us, the fire place and hot tub (the hot tub is exquisite!) made that no problem. For being a bit snowed in, loved having a few games & movies at the Air bnb already to pass the time. The location with the river along the backside of the cabin is spectacular, and having seen it in the snow, I’d love to be back one day in the spring/summer season. Everything about it was as described in the listing, and it was a lovely stay."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wow! This cabin is absolutely stunning. The large windows face out to the river with stunning views. I could hear the river as I slept. The inside is stocked with everything you need to cook and have fun. She has games to play as well. The beds were both very comfortable. The interior design was well thought out. The bathroom was very spacious and luxurious. We were there in winter while it rained so we couldn't do the fire pit but it looked entertaining! our favorite was sitting in the hot tub under the trees at night. I will 100% be back!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, everything about this cabin on the Sol Duc river lived up to the reviews and the description. I will be coming back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a beautiful place. It is located right on the river. You get to hear the sounds of the river flowing while enjoying the hot tub located right next to it. It has beautiful windows that face the river and the woods behind it. It is very beautiful. I recommend for anyone looking to get away and loves the outdoors.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our time here! Was the cutest house in the most beautiful setting — the River back drop was beautiful to see and listen to. Hot tub was perfect for the 2 of us. Had a slight challenge with getting the fireplace on but the heating was fine and Amber was incredibly responsive and helpful. Would absolutely stay again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little cabin. Very well appointed and can’t beat the location.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. The location was amazing right on the river. The place was very clean. We can’t wait to come back.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place! Relaxing, modern, and spectacular view. Just what we needed to get away and unwind."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hands down my favorite Airbnb I have ever stayed in. Owner was very helpful and was able to put us on some of the best hiking trips around. 10/10 recommend.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend this cabin to anyone looking for relaxation and peace and quiet. The sounds of the River are so soothing in the mornings while drinking coffee. The cabin itself is very cozy my wife and I didn’t want to leave.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! Amber went above and beyond to make sure this cabin was the perfect spot for a relaxing get away!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best time at Amber's place. It was clean, nicely designed, perfectly situated along the Sol Duc river, and overall an oasis on the Olympic Peninsula. Amber responded to us quickly when we had questions, and the home is conveniently located to access hiking trails, a small town, the beach and Port Angeles. Thank you for having us and being a fantastic host Amber!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location. I can’t wait to come back here. So peaceful and serene.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re questioning whether to book here or not…do it!!! My husband and I enjoyed every second here. The days got just a little warm without A/C but the evenings cooled it off quickly. The bed and living room furniture was super comfortable, the kitchen had everything you could possibly need and the views of the river and moss covered trees was so serene. Thank you!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect location and setting for a few days in Olympic. Amber gave very detailed communication and made the stay incredibly easy and enjoyable. Highly recommend.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved staying here, I wish we had more than two days. The location was perfect for exploring ONP and coming back to a cozy little cabin on the river for a relaxing evening. The house was in great condition and Amber was very responsive. The location is pretty far from grocery stores, so make sure you bring everything with you! Would highly recommend staying here for a magical wilderness experience."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay. So peaceful, quiet, and had everything we needed. Very tastefully decorated and we felt every little detail was very thought through! Also great restaurant recommendations."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place! Host is super communicative. Place is clean and super neat! For us most importantly - it was quite!! There is a river right outside providing natural white noise, but also windows and doors block noise very well. Not sure it was needed though, as the area is very quite in general. We saw one neighbors once, but didn’t hear anyone or any noise. Just the type of rest we were looking for!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a really nice stay during the summer. The location is really ideal if you want to visit multiple locations throughout Olympic park which is what we did.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin is beautiful and a relaxing place to stay, well suited for unwinding after exploring the PNW and Olympic peninsula! Cabin is clean, well maintained, and host provided clear instructions and communications to make this a really enjoyable stay!!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, beautiful location, and great host! Highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The home had an ambiance with the river off the back patio and patio lights for evening conversations. We enjoyed the hottub although it was a tight fit for adults. It was quite a hot weekend for the PNW in the mid 80's and one of the screens in the kitchen wasn't installed so it took a while for the house to cool down without a cross wind or portable fans to pull in cool air. When we opened the windows there was lots of traffic noise from the road in the bedroom. Lots of towels and sheets were available but we couldn't seem to find any kleenex around the home. We enjoyed the keurig for morning coffee but would have loved access to the wifi to update our families on our trip! Overall an enjoyable stay in this quaint cabin.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Peaceful stay right on the river! Appreciated the stocked kitchen.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute house with immaculate views! Location was great, allowed us to explore Olympic with a central home base."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a memorable stay! The house was very clean and the views were spectacular. There is a hot tub right on the Sol Duc River and a firepit for marshmallows. The bathroom was beautiful and very spacious. There is a TV, but if you're looking to stream Netflix, Hulu, etc., make sure your computer has a USB port. The host also provided several DVDs that we watched."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this place. You are RIGHT ON THE RIVER- this is such an incredible luxury of sound, beauty, and sensory (we went in it for cold plunges). The location is great for so many good hikes like the Sol Duc Falls area and Storm King. It was very clean and thoughtfully and beautifully designed with quality details such as good knives and stocked kitchen, good shampoo and conditioner, and washer/dryer. The bed was very comfortable, the instructions and communication about everything were great. The deck and river were AMAZING. I would love love love to come back."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What can you say about staying on a river when visiting Olympic National Park? Well, its just idyllic. Being lulled to sleep and awakened by the sound of the river was incredibly relaxing. Watching the stars through the trees from the hot tub late at night was especially memorable as well. Thanks Amber! We hope to return in the future:-)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful view! Between the moss-covered trees, river and gorgeous deck, we did not want to leave. Perfect location to explore the park and the place was so comfortable and clean! Amber was wonderful and communicative before our visit. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb was incredible! The view of the river and whole atmosphere were unbelievable and Amber thought of everything that someone could want while staying. Truly such a relaxing place to retreat to at the end of a full day exploring the Olympic Ntnl Forest.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place is as described. Large deck overlooking rain forest and Sol duc river is unbeatable. Place is well kept and the host is very accommodating. You will love the place.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber was such a great host. The cabin was private, right in the river and had just the right amount of rustic/creature comforts. We would highly recommend this for a couples romantic getaway!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little gem! We enjoyed our stay at the peaceful getaway and can’t wait to come back.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Two large picture windows frame a magnificent view of the Sol Duc river. The sound of the water provides a soothing background. The large deck became our favorite spot for morning coffee and evening meal. We marveled at the wildlife. Inside Amber has fully outfitted her cozy space. The recently added (very comfy) Adirondack chairs and Solo fire pit out back add another gathering place. The location is an easy drive to the Olympic National Park where we hiked and fished. My husband also fished in front of the cabin. It was too early in the season to get much fish action (water too high and fast) but who cares when the scenery is so breathtaking. When an unpredictable, natural event required us to vacate the cabin, Amber was responsive and helpful. She is, indeed, a Super Host. A very lovely spot."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place with beautiful deck overlooking the river. The house is well furnished and had all the basic amenities we needed. The host is easy to communicate with as well. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a beautiful home and a perfect getaway! Truly a gem we would love to return to
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect location to access everything Olympic NP has to offer! Cutest set-up ever! We were greeted by string lights and a beautiful river! SO inviting! Lovely signage and instructions throughout the property so you know how to use everything.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing rental, perfect location for visiting the National Forest, beach etc. The river is the perfect tranquil sound for relaxing.
Nightly soaks in the hot tub, listening to the river was the best!!
We also enjoyed playing cards out by the fire pit!! The home was super clean, furnished and we highly recommend this home!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for a relaxing weekend getaway!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very pleasant and immaculately set up. The host was very communicative and helpful. We wished we could have stayed longer.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic place, will plan to stay again"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Sol Duc Serenity! Love the hot tub, huge windows, and deck overlooking the river - it was nice to hear the sound of the river from the patio. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very spacious. We enjoyed unplugging and watching a movie on the DVD player :)"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute cabin with a stunning view, perfect for a romantic getaway! It had everything we needed, and was a central location for hiking at Olympic National Park. Would return :)"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber has created such a cozy space and we loved having it as our home base during our elopement weekend! The picture windows overlooking the river, fully stocked kitchen and lack of connection to the internet and media, was awesome! Plus, she has awesome recommendations for anyone looking for something to do around the cabin. Would certainly stay here again and am recommending to anyone looking for a back to the basics, cozy space for you and your partner!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, cute cottage, clean and well supplied. Although the weather didn't permit use of the deck, it's a lovely secluded spot overlooking the river with the sound of rushing water. Communication with the owner was good and she was responsive to a couple of issues we had. There IS a wireless network if you ask--otherwise you have to walk a bit down the road to communicate, which would be inconvenient if you need the owner's attention for an immediate problem. As in the property description, it's a drive to any shopping or restaurants, so prepare to be self-sufficient with food. But the location is fairly central to some of ONP's major destinations. Perfect couples' getaway!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 will come back!! My husband and I traveled to Washington for a week and stayed here for two out of the six nights. It was an easy drive to so many beautiful locations and we loved coming back to such a cozy place with an amazing view. One of our favorite parts was spotting three different eagles hanging around over the river and watching them for hours while we were in the hot tub before they flew off around dusk.
Amber was also really helpful with any questions we had and did a wonderful job of giving directions to everything you need to know about the house in a thoughtful binder you will find when you arrive.
We hope to come stay here again in the future!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We rented as a “lets detach from the world” kind of trip and let me tell you, we were not disappointed!!! Such a beautiful area, the view of the river off the back porch was amazing and the house was so cozy. Location was great too, not too far of a drive from where we wanted to sightsee but also super quiet.
Definitely would recommend for anyone needing to reconnect with the world around them."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber’s place is magical. It is the first Airbnb I’ve stayed in that was even better than pictured. The setting is gorgeous, the huge windows are a dream, the hot tub on the river is incredible, but on top of all of that, the home is so thoughtfully decorated and furnished, and so clean. Very comfy and warm bed, great shower, cozy living area and a fully stocked kitchen so we could cook meals. We were truly blown away. Watching the bald eagles catch fish from the hot tub was the highlight of our trip. The central location made exploring ONP so easy. And because the house is *right* on the river, you don’t even realize you are just off the main road. Like others have mentioned, we did not have cell service, but it wasn’t really an issue, we just looked up anything we needed when we had service down the road. We cannot wait to come stay here again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time, Amber was super helpful and friendly, and the house was perfect for our visit. We loved hearing the river and the hot tub was fantastic for relaxing after hiking. The location was perfect for our visits to the coast and Olympic National Park and we highly recommend Amber's house."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a beautiful house in a perfect location right on the river. Very clean and great communication. I will be staying again next time I’m out here. Thanks for a great stay!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"WOW!!! This location couldn’t be any more perfect! The backyard is absolutely stunning with gorgeous views of the river, and the home is situated in the perfect location to explore all things Olympic NP! Amber’s home is extremely clean and the kitchen is well stocked with every thing you need to cook meals while staying at the cabin. I would give this a home an 11/10 if I could, and my family can’t wait to return in the future!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here on our trip to Olympic National Park. Everything was so comfortable and cozy, and there’s nothing like enjoying the hot tub by the river. Would absolutely stay here again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,beautiful home views were amazing.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The views and proximity to the river were even better than advertised. The hot tub was amazing, and overall a perfect sized place for two people. Very cozy and comfortable."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You will not want to leave!!! THIS is a true PNW rainforest getaway gem.
So private and cozy with an INCREDIBLE view. No problems finding! It’s 100% an escape with limited service and no WiFi. We LOVED it!!!
Watching and listening to the river, feeling the rainfall, all while cozy in a hot tub is MAGICAL! Top it off with the fireplace, a good book, some coffee and the VIEW… 10/10. Lovely girls getaway!
Amber is super responsive and on top of it as well! This is the best Airbnb we’ve stayed at yet."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is an absolute dream! The home is gorgeous and Amber is incredibly accommodating. It was my favorite spot we stayed on our whole trip!
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,An incredible little hideaway to come back to after a day of adventuring!

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing setting, beautiful place, Amber is a good communicator. Hot tub did not work, and a few other issues presented themselves, but Amber was able to respond and help."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was so peaceful staying here! Hot tub overlooking the river was amazing. Check in was easy.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible!
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Really wonderful little place with an amazing view of the Sol Duc River! The interior decor was really cute and the kitchen worked great for cooking. The location is close by to a lot of beautiful hiking and sight seeing.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only needed a one night stay this trip but already have this beautiful space in mind for the next time! While small, the space is maximized to the fullest. It is so comfortable and aesthetically pleasing! I am already working through how I can mimic the decor at my house! Thank you again for a wonderful experience at your beautiful space."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was very cute, well stocked, and cozy.
We appreciated the thought put into the place instead of a stock Marshall’s furnished house. It was very cozy with everything you would need to enjoy the surrounding area. The hosts even provided some basic supplies if you forgot to pack something!
It is directly next to the main house but we were not bothered by anyone. Location is about 15-20 mins from nearby shops/restaurants."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place. From the thoughtful touches to the decor and amenities galore. Perfection. What a great stay we had.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was exactly as described and pictured. The bed was extremely comfortable. They thought of everything, from a s’mores tackle box to the toiletry items you ask for at the hotel front desk when you forget them. I highly recommend this place!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shelly and Michael's place was the perfect getaway!! It was well stocked with everything you could need, including thoughtful touches such as a smore tackle box. Everything was clean and comfortable. We loved our stay and are hoping to go back for a longer stay next time!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was absolutely wonderful! We loved all of the amenities. These hosts are truly masters of hospitality. The ""Snackle Box"" with s'mores fixings and the bathroom furnishes (including a ceiling the Bluetooth speaker) are nice touches. We highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Olympic National Park area! Very cozy spot to rest your head after a busy day adventuring :)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very well built and maintained tiny house, you got everything you would needed and even more, hosts are very responsive. My family had great time, would come back and stay longer next！"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Shellay and Michael’s place is so thoughtfully appointed you have everything you need and more! Such a wonderful cottage surrounded by the beauty of Olympic and close to town—couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay on my last night. I wish I could’ve stayed longer and would absolutely stay here again! 10/10.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best place to stay when visiting olympic!! This little place exceeded our expectations. Shelley & Michael had thought of all the extra amenities that make this stay feel like home. Impeccably clean, great recommendations, beautiful surroundings and not a bad drive to all the popular hikes in olympic. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Hands down best Airbnb! Don’t hesitate book now. Shellay & Michael’s place was incredibly beautiful - immaculately clean. We immediately felt comfortable and at home. So many amenities and anything you could possibly need. The s’mores kit was a huge hit for the kids. We cooked a few great meals. Everything was perfect and I didn’t want to leave. I appreciated the check in too to see if we needed anything else. The area itself was beautiful with deer visiting us daily. Right down the road from a sweet little park on the whale trail. Convenient to Port Angeles / Olympic Nat’l Park and plenty of great areas to adventure. Hope to come back one day - we’re inspired! Thank you 😊
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect:) Shellay and Michael are wonderful hosts, very proactive, responsive and provide you with everything you may need for an amazing trip to Olympic National Park!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We lovedddd our stay here! Shellay & Michael’s place was the perfect, cozy getaway after a day in the Olympic National Park. We stayed just for the night but wish we could’ve stayed longer. They had absolutely everything you could need, and neatly stored so nothing felt cluttered. A very comfortable bed and stunning bathroom. It was woodsy enough that we woke up to the birds chirping, and a family of deer were feeding next to the house as we checked out, but also easy to find/get to. Check in and check out were simple and seamless. We will absolutely come back as it was a perfect little staycation to reconnect to nature and each other (:"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, quiet, and nice stay near Olympic National Park. Shellay and Michael have provided nearly anything you could need. I’d recommend for anyone in the area!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely place! We wanted to stay much longer than the one night we’d booked on our way around the Olympic Peninsula.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Shellay and Michael's place was exactly what we wanted for a mother-daughter trip to the Olympic National Park.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We love this place so much and are so happy whenever we get to visit Port Angeles and stay at this wonderful spot.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful place to rest your head after spending the day exploring Olympic National Park. Not far from town and Strait Slice Pizza is a go to local pizza place. Shelly was a great host and provided a list of local places check out.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My colleague and I adore Shellay and Michael's place. It's a little piece of heaven with the best bed I've ever slept in. They are fabulous hosts and we always love to return. Can't recommend their cozy home away from home more highly.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My friends and I absolutely loved this place!! It was so homey and cozy, perfect for the chilly nights. It was in close proximity to Lake Crescent and Madison Falls. We loved the s’more kit + marshmallow roaster (big highlight for us), the coffee in the morning, and the rainfall shower. Shellay was very responsive, met us at check in, and gave us recommendations for what to do. If you are looking for a small, private get away, this is it!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had such a wonderful stay at Shelley & Michael’s place. The cabin was so well appointed. They truly thought of everything. It was also a great location for everywhere I wanted to check out in Olympic NP. Will definitely try and make it back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is in our top 3 Airbnbs ever. It’s a very special place and the owners have put a lot of work in making it so. Very relaxing and the hosts are very responsive.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was such a great stay! My husband, 2 year old, and I stayed to explore port Angeles and the surrounding area.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of my favorite Air BnB’s I’ve ever stayed in. Very welcoming and only 15 minutes from Port Angeles and 35 from Lake Crescent and Mt Storm King. So clean, so detailed to make us feel welcomed. Loved having a fire after a long day of hiking and the premade s’mores “snacklebox”. This will be the top of my list whenever I’m back around the Olympics! Thank you Shellay and Michael!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home! Loved every minute there.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My colleague and I LOVE staying at Shellay and Michael's place. It's sublime.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow, this place is AMAZING!! So incredibly stocked with everything you may need for any stay, long or short. The entire place was so cozy, the bed was very comfy, and the location was perfect. We saw deer both days, experienced lovely weather and enjoyed the local restaurants and shops. Our only critique is that we found the wifi to be slow and unreliable, we wouldn’t recommend for remote work, but this didn’t impact our stay at all as our phone service worked just fine (Verizon). The hosts were very responsive and provided fantastic information and recommendations. We would gladly rebook a stay here 10/10, five stars!! Thanks so much!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This cabin was the perfect little getaway spot for me and my girlfriends. It had everything we needed and we felt very comfortable and welcomed!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you're looking for a place in Port Angeles, look no further. Shellay & Michaels quaint little cabin was one of the best AirBnBs we've ever stayed in. The bed was 5-star, the turkish robes and bath towels were what dreams are made of, and we woke up to a herd of deer out our window. The hosts thought about every little detail, and it showed. The cabin was well-equipped with everything you might need (there is even a fan in the closet for those who need the noise for sleep), there was a lovely coffee and tea selection, and the tackle box full of smores ingredients was a wonderful touch (it was snowing, so we didn't take advantage of the fire pit, but we might have snuck a Hershey's bar or two.) There was a ""junk drawer"" full of handy odds and ends, and the bathroom was stocked full with the little things that help make an overnight stay successful. Check this place out; I promise, you will NOT be disappointed!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I absolutely loved my stay here! Very sad because I would’ve loved to stay so much longer! The cabin had EVERYTHING. It was a dream walking in. There were no complaints whatsoever.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My spouse and I had a wonderful 5 night stay at Shellay and Michael's cabin. It was cute, comfortable, and had everything we could possibly need.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shellay and Michael,
Our two day stay your cabin was a heartwarming experience. Every detail was thoroughly arranged creating a space that felt like an extension of our own home. The christmas decor added a special touch of joy. We are inspired to take many of these decor ideas back with us.
The true highlight for us was our conversation with you, Shellay! Sharing stories from our lives and hearing about your journey was incredibly moving. Next time, we are excited to cook a traditional indian meal for you and enjoy it together.
Thank you for such a memorable stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We slept 12 hours at this amazing spot. We were exhausted from a very long travel but no place would have given this much comfort. No detail has been missed at this inviting place. EVERYTHING you need is there just show up and enjoy!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at this sweet cabin. Everything about this place speaks of care and comfort.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I arrived with my fussy crying daughter in the evening. Shellay greeted us warmly. She gave me simple and clear information about the cabin, stayed with my crying girl to keep her safe while I gathered things from the car, and she even made us a really nice meal. She is so friendly and understanding.
About the cabin. It has everything you can think of. Very true to the description. Cozy, quiet, and peaceful like heaven. I'd be here again and again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shelley and Michael were great hosts. Very friendly and accommodating and the cabin is amazing.

Delightful experience."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was perfect. Super quiet and relaxing. The bed was so comfortable. The shower was amazing. Exactly what we needed and wanted after a day of travel and hiking and before starting another day of travel and hiking.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's a great place and looks even better and cozier than it does on the pictures, ideal to unwind for a bit.
There are lots of little things, like a full set of marshmallows and marshmallow forks to roast over the fire. They also have all the herbs, and more than enough coffee.
It's also a good base to explore more of the Olympic Peninsula, although you also won't regret staying in."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little cabin with modern amenities. Clean, cozy and well organized.
What stands out is the care the hosts put into ensuring the cabin is well stocked with useful items. The pantry included coffee, teas, s'mores makings, wood for the campfire etc. There were outdoor blankets, walking sticks, hiking guide books etc.
All of these little touches really show the hosts care about their guests and want to ensure they have an enjoyable visit. Would stay again!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Incredibly chic, cozy, ingenious, thoughtful, helpful, and affordable spot to stay. Shellay and her mother greeted us with big bright smiles and very warm welcomes. The cabin is beautifully done. Form meets function and more function, and more function. Along with s’mores kits, great little bbq, and a very sweet visit from a poodle- the shower has a stunning skylight and the bed isn’t something to envy. I’ll be begging for links. I would go very far out of my way to visit here again. Really great spot."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem of an Airbnb! It was full of thoughtful touches (stuff for smores, a wide variety of cooking things, items for a bonfire, etc.) and Shellay & Michael were wonderfully accommodating. Highly recommend."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shellay and Micheal’s place was a little slice of heaven. The location is great, felt like staying in a fairy tale among the giant trees! We saw deer right outside the cabin on several occasions.
Inside the place is cozy and has everything you could want. Shellay really thought of everything to make you feel at home! The bed is so comfortable and the bathroom feels like a spa. We really enjoyed our time at the cabin and hope to return.
The location is close to trails, beaches, Olympic National Park, and Port Angeles. Top notch place and hosts!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Shellay and Michael were super responsive and catered to your needs. Great place and great hosts!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay with Shellay and Michael, and once again everything was perfect. The cabin is so peaceful and cozy while being remarkably clean. This is our favorite place to stay when in the Port Angeles area!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay. Super cozy and everything we needed… including an adorable s’mores kit and items to make pancakes in the morning! Super clean, towels and bedding smelled so fresh … we wish we had longer to stay there!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great cabin! We came here to explore Olympic National park and the cabin is very close to multiple beaches, is just a short drive to the main park entrance and about an hour and a half to Forks and Hoh Rainforest. Shellay greeted us when we arrived and gave us some recommendations in the area. The cabin was BEAUTIFUL and perfect for our two night stay. They had it decorated perfectly and included things like beach items and a s’mores kit that most people wouldn’t have brought on the plan which made such a personal touch. Would love to stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shellay and Michael's place is perfection, so charming, and my colleague and I had a wonderful, comfortable and very relaxing time there. The little extras like s'mores ingredients, chocolates and pancake mix were so thoughtful. We can'd wait to return!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my all-time favorite Airbnb I have ever booked! It had everything you needed - bath and kitchen necessities! From the bathrobes, coffee/tea, s’mores kit, pancake mixes, etc.. so much and more was provided to us. The bed was super soft and the shower has a roof window to look up too! I was able to meet Shellay and Michael, and they were very kind to start a fire for us :,) We were even lucky is see a family of deer roaming infront of the home right before sunset. I wish we stayed longer! I will definitely be booking again when we return:) thank you again <3"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying here for a night close to the Olympic National Park. Shellay’s place was easy to find and check in was easy. The home is designed beautifully and the bed is super comfy. Just to note the wifi did not seem super strong and we couldn’t get anything to stream. We were there for the park so this didn’t bother us. If we get a chance to come back to the area, we would definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We cannot say enough about this place! It was immaculate and there wasn’t a thing they didn’t think of! Amazing hosts! We can’t wait to come back and we will definitely stay here again!!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely stay. Would definitely visit again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our favorite stay - a real hidden gem - among many on a road trip from coastal Washington through central Oregon. Shellay and Michael have created a wonderful experience for anyone lucky enough to book a stay here. This was the first time I have ever stayed in an AirBnB and have it feel as comfortable as my own home.
The personal touches in this AirBnB blew my partner and I away. Shellay and Michael have anticipated every need that guests might have, including (adorably) a s'mores kit complete with several kinds of chocolate, marshmallows, and graham crackers for guests who choose to use the outdoor fire pit.
We were sad to leave after only one night at this AirBnB. Next time we visit the Olympic Peninsula, we will definitely try to book the space again, and for a longer stay. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a quiet, lovely place to stay several miles outside Port Angeles but easy to get to. Spotlessly clean. The owners have thought of EVERYTHING someone might need while staying. Everything from the kitchen to the bathroom to the outdoor space is so well organized, and the decor throughout is attractively done and creates a peaceful surrounding. It's an easy jumping off point to the ferry to Victoria or the Port Angeles side of Olympic National Park. Although the wifi signal is not strong and rather slow, based on all the other positives, we would definitely choose to stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Incredible place... like a dream. Great communication and beautiful space. excellent facilities surrounded by beauty.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow, what an absolute gem! This is one of the few Airbnbs I’ve stayed in that genuinely felt like home. The decorations were gorgeous. The amount of little details to make us feel comfortable was outstanding! Extra towels, s’mores kit, board games, DVDs, breakfast items, coffee, extra toiletries, etc. Michael and Shellay are excellent hosts! Check in was easy and the Airbnb felt private. The bed was out of this world comfortable. I would absolutely stay here again. 10/10!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quite a lovely, quiet and relaxing place. We would love to stay here again. Very well cared for and lots of nice extra touches."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 recommend staying here. They had all the amenities you could ask for but they provided so much more. They even provide a mini s’more kit which was amazing for sitting out on the porch to just relax and talk. Loved the variety of movie selection they provided, very clean and they provided their local input which help us out so much for we can explore and feel as one of the locals! We will for sure be returning here for future stays."

Absolutely spot on!
So many personal touches!
Others should take lessons from Shellay and Michael.
Just lovely!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Majestic Cedars is such a special place. This modern rustic cabin is a true getaway. Michael and Shellay have truly thought of every single detail to make your stay exceptional. The amenities in the bathroom were incredible: from robes to tooth brushes, shaving cream, and more…it’s all there. The kitchen is so well stocked for its size. Our favorite was the s’more kit! Coffee and tea was plentiful and there were amazing breakfast basics like pancake mix and condiments in the fridge.
The provided beach toys and an entire beach kit complete with sunscreen for kids as well as ample literature and the cutest porch reading spot.
The king bed was so so cozy…soft and comfortable. Be mindful that the futon is fairly small and would be great for two small children but not much bigger than that.
We loved being on the outside of Port Angeles and tucked away from the hustle and bustle of town. Don’t miss the Freshwater Bay park down the road to view the sunset!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,na
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An impeccably designed, immaculately clean, and exceptionally comfortable cabin about a 15-minute drive from Port Angeles--an ideal base to explore Hurricane Ridge, Lake Crescent, and other natural attractions nearby (Shellay offered us good recommendations). The bathroom is a showstopper, but so is the rest of the cabin, with beautiful fresh flowers and other unique touches (like a spray to help you sleep better). The combination of style and comfort makes this cabin a destination in its own right."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful and secluded stay! This place is exactly as described. The bathroom is unreal:) hosts are very responsive and hospitable. Gave me a lot of good recommendations in the area.
Don’t think twice about booking."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful accommodations where you can tell the owners thought of everything. The bed was extremely comfortable and the decor was picture perfect. It is the little details that sets this place apart. Fresh flowers, fresh cut simple greenery sprinkled inside and out. S’mores kit, blankets for sitting outside, beach kits and so much more. Coffee and tea station and little supplies for breakfast to get you started on your perfect trip. We could go on and on the about the perfect little details that made us feel instantly at home. It is centrally located for a quick drive to the city and far enough out that you feel at peace and ready for a great hike."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Would absolutely stay here again! The hosts were great and even recommended a local spot where we were able to see some otters! Most importantly, without a doubt the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! Shellay and Michael really go the extra mile with toiletries and little things you may have forgotten to pack. 10/10 recommend!! Enjoy :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was very nicely decorated and very clean. We were only there for one night but it was quiet and relaxing. Would definitely recommend.

We would recommend this cabin to anyone looking to stay in the Port Angeles area!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We’ve stayed in lots of Air B&Bs over the years and this is at the top of the list. From the moment we pulled up, the property exuded peace and relaxation. The design was so thoughtful and there were extra touches for enjoyment of the space. We loved the s’mores tacklebox, the French press, the bathroom Bluetooth speaker, the luxurious linens and super comfy bed. The artwork was perfect for the space and I loved the rain shower with the skylight. We had a perfect night’s sleep after a long day of hiking and traveling. The location near the national parks and Port Angeles was so convenient - we had amazing ice cream at Welly’s and a delicious breakfast at h the Cottage House. Our hosts were super responsive - my only regret was not being able to stay longer. If back in the area, I would definitely seek to stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. Truly a gem of the gems. Hard to describe how much more luxe it feels in person. I travel for work and pleasure often, in some super fancy hotels even, and this is by far was the only bed I’ve ever loved as much as my own, if not more!! The thoughtfulness and consideration in their amenities and extras is beyond ❤️❤️❤️"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such a cozy place to stay! We enjoyed everything about the place including the well supplied kitchen, very nice bathroom, and great options for outdoor seating. We would definitely come here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This spot was beautiful -- well appointed inside and out. Thoughtful extras -- cozy robes, pancake mix and coffee, guide books -- made us feel right at home and were an added bonus during our trip. We would love to stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We have a good wonderful short stay which if a next time would love to do a longer stay. I agree with the prior posts the bed is like sleeping on clouds which was unfortunate had to wake up early to head out.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in great location me and my wife both noticed the little extras they put into the place to make it special
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is very thoughtfully decorated with high quality materials/products. Parking is easy and there is space for 2 cars. Location is good, however you cannot easily walk to the coast/water. Overall a great and easy stay"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shellay & Michael's cabin is wonderful!! It's well decorated and VERY well-stocked--Shampoo/conditioner, extra toiletries, waters, popcorn, pancake mix, spices, even chocolate! Very impressed! Service is spotty but wi-fi worked well. Thank you for a great stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Airbnb! It was a wonderfully decorated cabin with anything you might need (extra toiletries, first aid kits, games, well stocked kitchen, guidebooks, etc). The entire cabin is very clean and cozy - we were especially impressed by the immaculate bathroom! Honestly felt like we were in a resort. Shellay is very responsive, as well and quick to suggest recommendations for food and activities or answer questions. Olympic National Park is very big so you do have to drive everywhere but we couldn’t suggest a better place to stay. Would highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you aren’t sure if you should book this cabin, just do it, you will not regret it!! Beautiful place, looks just like the photos, tons of amenities and got great local recommendations. Good location close to Port Angeles and a lot of good spots in Olympic National Park! Plus the bed was like sleeping on clouds! 10/10 recommend!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin with many well thought touches.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the best air bnb experiences ever! This cabin was fully stocked with everything you could need plus more. It even included a smores kit, firewood & kindling, and games. The bathroom was amazing and had super soft, comfy robes!
The area was perfect as it was close to Olympic NP and 15 minutes from a grocery store but still quiet and secluded.
Stayed with 4 people total. The bed was super comfy, the futon though was a tight squeeze for 2."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We feel incredibly lucky to have spent time at this little slice of heaven. The cabin itself is perfect with everything you could imagine you might need and even a few things you didn’t think about… but end up needing. The location is perfect. Out of the way of hustle and bustle but close enough for a quick day trip to Hoh… Cape Flattery… Forks… La Push & right around the corner from Hurricane Ridge. Freshwater Bay is literally around the corner and was one of our favorite places. We saw otters and bald eagles and it wasn’t crowded at all. Practically perfect in every way.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a beautiful home. Shellay and Michael thought of everything from all the amenities available to us, as well as making sure it’s a cozy, comfortable home. Shellay was extremely responsive and welcoming. I would stay here again and again. As a frequent traveler and Airbnb user, their place is now my top spot."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As previous tenants already described: a great cottage, very fully and tastefully equipped. The only downside is the neighbor's dog. This barks all day when the owners are away.
Highly recommended, this cabin!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shellay and Michael have put so much thought and effort into building a perfect cabin in the PNW. Look forward to staying again one day!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was one of our favorite Airbnbs. Super cozy and peaceful. Would highly recommend. Thanks!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Shellay & Michael's charming cabin in Port Angeles, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the moment we arrived, we were enchanted by the warm and inviting atmosphere. The cabin served as an ideal retreat after our exhilarating hikes in the Olympic National Park. Its cozy interior provided the perfect setting to unwind and recharge.
We appreciated the cleanliness of the cabin, which added to the overall comfort of our stay. The thoughtful and tasteful decorations throughout the cabin added to its charm. We felt right at home and appreciated the personal touch that the host put into creating such an inviting space.
One of the standout aspects of the cabin was its convenient location. It was just the right distance from downtown Port Angeles, allowing us to easily explore the town's attractions and sample its local cuisine. I cannot recommend Shellay & Michael's cabin highly enough."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the pleasure of staying at Shellay and Michael’s charming cottage for two nights in mid-June. As other guests have noted, the spotless cottage is equipped with virtually anything you’d want for a vacay stay, from barbecue tools to bathrobes. The bed is super comfy and the location in a grove of towering cedars is very peaceful. Shellay even dropped by at our invitation to share great local hiking and dining suggestions. If you do decide to go into town to buy groceries or grab a bite, it’s a 15-minute drive."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Shelley & Michael’s place was a gem. It was so cozy and the perfect cabin getaway. The place is very well stocked and organized. They truly thought of everything!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"With all due respect to other Airbnb properties we have stayed, Majestic Cedars set the bar! Private, spotless, cozy, beautifully furnished and well appointed.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Majestic Cedars cabin was beautiful inside and out. The decor was lovely - nice artwork, spacious bathroom.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t recommend this beautiful little cabin enough! The location is perfect to do a number of hikes and sight seeing in the area. The neighbourhood felt very safe and peaceful. The Airbnb was perfect. So many thoughtful touches.
We loved freshwater bay, just a short drive away. We spent our mornings there watching the otters, and even saw seals!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little cottage in the trees is first rate in every way! Spotless, beautifully decorated, and filled with extra touches. We’ve stayed at many Air B n B and this one is right at the top. Loved it in every way and highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Shellay and Michael’s cabin exceeded my expectations of a cozy place to stay after a long day of hiking and exploring Olympic National Park. The attention to detail when it comes to amenities was phenomenal. I would love to stay here again on my next visit and would recommend it to everyone visiting the area.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we saw the bright orange door, the covered porch and lovely table and chairs perfect place for early morning coffee or night cap. The interior was perfect! The interior was immaculate, just as pictured. The appliances were again new and modern. Everything we needed for meals was within reach. The furniture was new, comfy the bed and linens were luxurious. The bathroom was off the charts and saving the ideas for our next bath makeover. Again, sleek modern surfaces, robes, thick, fluffy towels. My favorite was the skylight overhead. I felt like I was showering among the cedars. The original artwork was beautiful and added that special touch to the cabin. One of the special treats was being able to watch deer feed out among the cedars from the back window or quietly from the porch! Again a wonderful relaxing retreat after a long flight."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shellay and Michael have a beautiful cabin just west of Port Angeles that is very peaceful and quiet and close to nature.  Their cabin was very clean and comfortable, and they have thought of everything and more you will need to stay here. They were very responsive and communicated quickly when we had any questions."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time at this clean and comfortable cabin. Beautiful surrounding area! Had everything you could think of and very cute touches throughout.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful place. A little ways to sightseeing and stores, but this just made it more peaceful. Totally worth it. We felt right at home and really enjoyed all the thought they put into stocking this place with everything you could need."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect location for a few days exploring the Olympic Peninsula. The cabin was incredibly comfortable and had everything we could need. Port Angeles is about a 10-15 minute drive away and has plenty of shops and restaurants. We visited several of the more popular sites along the coast, which are between an hour to two hours away, but a very easy drive. Would highly recommend this cabin if you’re planning to explore the National Park and coast."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place with great attention to details to everything. Loved our stay and would love to come back.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shellay and Michael’s place was the perfect place stay after a day exploring the Olympic National Park. The cabin was cute, clean, and well appointed. No detail was over looked. It’s a short drive to downtown Port Angeles and a very short drive to freshwater bay park which was a lovely beach. Our only regret was that we didn’t stay a second night. We wouId absolutely come back."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shellay and Michaels place was such a dream! The cabin was everything we wanted and more!! They had all the amenities from extra towels to bedtime pillow spray. We loved our visit and would definitely stay again!! Perfect location!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful. The linens were top of the line. The bed was so comfortable, I had to ask where they bought it so I can buy myself one."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin exceeded my expectations! It was beautiful, comfortable, and full of surprise amenities. Additionally, the bed and pillows were so comfortable it was hard to get out of bed in the morning. Shellay and Michael were responsive and welcoming hosts and flexible with check in check out time to fit our needs. Only con of the place was the weak wifi signal which made it hard to do remote work, so come in with the expectation of digital detoxing and enjoy the nature around!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My daughter and I visited for one night drop Toronto as we made our way to Forks from Seattle. We instantly fell in love with the cabin we asked to extend our stay. The night was comfortable, the shower from heaven and the kitchen and bathroom stocked so well, with every detail thought of. We drove down to the boat launch late at night and first thing in the morning and saw over 20 deer and heard a rooster in the a.m.
We would be back. Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay in this cozy, clean, and quiet cabin. It is so nicely furnished and includes so many special amenities from the pancake breakfast fixings to the plethora of games and dvds. The bed is very comfortable and the shower is e tra fun with music, skylight, and rainshower head. Shellay checked in/texted with us each day to see that we had all that we needed and to offer to answer any questions if necessary. We really enjoyed meeting the hosts in person just before our departure, as they are both so friendly and welcoming. We hope to return for a future visit as this is one of the best airbnbs we have ever visited. Thank you Michael and Shellay!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay. The cabin was perfect. Shelley and Michael were very responsive and gave us a lot of tips on where to go in the area.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Impeccable, well appointed, and very comfortable. The hosts thought of every detail and we lacked for nothing while enjoying our stay. The bathroom was particularly well done, including a skylight over the shower looking out at the cedars.
We were a bit disappointed in how far it was from the water and the sea view was fairly minimal, but the place itself was absolutely perfect."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place with thoughtful details. Our kids loved the s’mores kit. We loved the fire pit and shower skylight.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice hosts and a great place! We had a fun time. Really enjoyed the shower area with views of the trees in the skylight
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and relaxing space! I wanted to get away from the city for my 23rd birthday celebration as I had just finished working a 60 hour week and I could not have picked a better location. Hosts were friendly, communicative, and overall wonderful and the space was exactly as pictured. The bathroom shower had nice water pressure and the bathroom had a Bluetooth speaker! The bed and couch were so comfy my friends and I could’ve probably spent all day just lounging around and napping. I would definitely stay here again, in fact I’ve favorited this Airbnb just in case I find myself needing another trip away from the city. Book it, you won’t regret it!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"By far one of the best airbandb experiences!!!! While the space is small, it has everything one might need for a comfortable experience. We stayed with our two boys ages 9 and 12. They were thrilled about all the board games, beach toys, outdoor space to run around, and complimentary s’mores kit and hot chocolate!!!! Check-in and communication were a breeze. The place is less than five minutes from a great beach, which was beautiful to explore even in cooler weather. Proximity to Olympia National Park is a huge bonus, such a majestic area!!! It is slightly outside of town, so about 15 minutes away from stores/restaurants. The surrounding area is very quiet and peaceful…we saw dear and bald eagles close by!!! Every aspect of the cottage was thought out to provide visitors with all they need to enjoy the stay…..sand toys, fire pit with logs ready to go, supply of coffee/tea, bath products, bathrobes, and both beds are extremely comfortable!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place! Shellay & Michael thought of everything in this rental. It’s a great home base for your time in the national park. It was very clean, bed was extremely comfortable and they had anything you needed for your stay. The cooler/ice packs for our picnic lunch was a nice touch. The only surprise was that you aren’t really in ‘the woods’. There are trees on one side but you actually face a road. It wasn’t an issue as we were hardly there. We’ll definitely be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cannot say enough about our stay at this airbnb! It was the perfect little getaway. Shellay & Michael have thought of every detail to make this experience exceptional. We travelled with our toddler and I honestly didn't even need to bring anything, they had it all- a crib, booster seat, toys, baby bath, etc. The space was serene and it was lovely to have a home-base to come back to following an epic day of adventuring the Olympic National Park.
Would highly recommend this airbnb to anyone exploring the area.
Thank you again Shellay & Michael for hosting us!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far one of the best airbnbs I’ve ever had the pleasure of staying! It was even nicer than the photos, and had small touches throughout that made the place cozy and relaxing. It was the perfect home base for a few days checking out the national park, lake crescent and the greater forks area. Definitely recommend and hope to be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A cozy and relaxing retreat surrounded by large, breathtaking trees and a peaceful landscape. The bed was plush and the space was intimate. Close to the Olympic National Park and Port Angeles. Highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a peaceful and wonderful location. The fire pit on a cold night was such a fun treat. I’ve stayed in places all over the world and I’ve never found a place that was so well equipped !!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shellay & Michael’s cabin was incredibly special. We escaped Seattle for the weekend to enjoy Olympic National Park and it did not disappoint. They were very kind hosts and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. The cabin was so cozy and peaceful. It’s obvious they have an eye for detail and went above and beyond to curate the space. A quick drive into the park makes day trips easy. 12/10 for this place. I can’t wait to book it again 🙂
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent accommodations and close to some great hikes!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the Majestic Cedars was above and beyond what we expected and we wished we could have stayed longer! The place was tastefully decorated, cozy, comfortable, convenient and the hosts have thought of everything; from a s’mores kit, to extra bathrooms essentials, to blankets, condiments, books, relaxing room spray. Basically, anything you could want this place has it. It’s very private and peaceful. You will have to drive into town but it is well worth it and perfect for a weekend (or more! Which I highly recommend) on the Olympic Peninsula.
Thank you Shellay and Michael for a wonderful stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is amazing! Super comfy and cozy with a luxury feel. Everything was extremely clean and organized and well stocked. There were plush bathrobes and super soft towels and the bed was like a cloud! We absolutely loved our stay here. The location is great-super close to the downtown area (shops & restaurants) and only 3 min drive to the water. One thing to note is the guest house is right next to the main property but they do a great job of making it feel private.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love it love it can’t get enough of it. I’ll definitely be coming back sometime.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay!! So cozy and stocked with amenities that made our weekend even better than we expected. The location is quiet and peaceful and the bed was so comfy! We’ll absolutely come back the next time we take a trip to the peninsula :)

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time my wife and stayed here and it was exactly as we remembered. The owners have included so many thoughtful touches, from the wide assortment to coffee, to the insanely comfortable bed and futon.
The interior was spotless and the check out routine was one of the easiest I’ve ever encountered.
Port Angeles is such a hidden treasure and Shelley and Michael’s listing is absolutely a treasure itself. We’ll be making this a yearly visit."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is super cute and they stocked it well with tea, cocoa and coffee."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My girlfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here. It was spotless, so quaint and perfect for the two of us. There were amenities everywhere!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My boyfriend and I came here for a short getaway weekend and it exceeded our expectations! The home was very cozy and is a perfect size for 2. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was very pretty. Thank you Shellay and Michael!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shellay & Michael's cabin was wonderful and had everything we needed and more! It was clean, well-stocked, comfortable, and felt like home.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our five nights were fun, relaxing, and full of local options. Shellay & Michael helped us surprise a dear friend who lives close by. We enjoyed the area with drives to Lake Crescent, Forks, Port Gamble, and Poulsbo. The area is rich in history and beauty. And of course, we enjoyed our time dining & shopping in Port Angeles. Their cabin will not disappoint…it is not only as listed, but it is also chocked full of surprising touches to make your stay perfect for you. Great place to unwind and to just enjoy your peaceful stay (including daily deer visits) or whatever soothes your soul."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shelley and Michael’s home was absolutely perfect. The space felt brand new, was tastefully designed, and comfortable. There were numerous amenities such as a full kitchen and other small touches that make you feel at home. The hosts were extremely responsive and made check in easy. The location was also quiet off of any main roads. I would highly recommend staying with Shelley and Michael when in Port Angeles."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The attention to detail and comfy and inviting-ness of the cabin was unreal. Top five best airbnbs we’ve ever been to! Highly recommend.
The bed was almost too soft and too comfortable. Felt like we were on a cloud. Great bathroom too!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin was so lovely and COZY. The bed was amazing and the pillows were to die for! They had lots of cute things set up for you to use such as makeup remover wipes, coffee, extra toiletries if needed and they also had plenty of towels and such. I loved that they had games & books to find info about nearby hikes. It was a great stay. The only downside- the wifi didn’t work all that great. My phone had no service and the wifi was spotty & didn’t work on my phone all the time and the tv was a bit blurry from wifi connection. Other than that, I CANNOT complain. I would love to come back!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful cabin. They clearly invested in making the fixtures modern while keeping a cozy cabin feel.
Location is behind their house, but they put up partitions to seal you away."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just when I needed some peace and quiet on the Peninsula, I came across Shellay and Michaels' cabin. What a dream! Nestled among the cedars, but close to main roads and the Water, this cabin has everything you'd ever want for a relaxing time, or a base-camp for exploring the Olympics, the Forest or the Peninsula, generally. It was so comfortable and charming, and I felt immediately at peace. I loved having my coffee each morning on the front patio and seeing deer stroll by. I got some of the best sleep I can recall. The bed and furnishings are amazingly comfortable. Thank you Shellay and Michael!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here! It was so incredibly cozy and was located in a great spot for beautiful drives to explore the area.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great stay for my friends and I while I was up visiting the PNW for the first time. Lovely little cabin minutes away from the beach and tucked into some trees. Will absolutely stay again if I can.

There was a family of deer that would walk through the yard every morning while we drank our coffee. We had a very relaxing and peaceful time away from the city.
Shellay and Michael were responsive when we reached out to them. If you’re looking to stay somewhere in this area I’d highly recommend this cabin."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was FANTASTIC. The host had obviously put so much thought into all of the details.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friends and I were visiting from CA to hit the different scenic areas of Olympic National Park. We found this Airbnb as the perfect midway point to drive around all the different areas of the park we wanted to visit. The views of the place was AMAZING and it was just the perfect location to do all the exploring we did! We got to watch the sunset while sitting the living room which was super cool! 10/10 recommend staying here for you visit to Port Angeles!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Awesome place! Would go again anytime, the views of the ocean make it a treasure find"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Extremely pleasant and peaceful stay. House was perfectly clean. Jeff was a friendly and responsive host. View from the location was always spectacular.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place has an amazing view and practically everything you need. We were lucky enough to see the northern lights from the patio. Also, although many people mentioned that the bedroom on the second floor is essentially open, there is a cellular shade that divides the bedroom from other areas to give you more privacy. The ground-floor bedroom's soundproofing isn't perfect. Sometimes you can hear the flushing noise from the bar next door. Other than that, everything is great! Will come back next time."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff’s place has beautiful views and the binoculars were a nice touch! It is right off a main road and next to a wine bar but even in this location, noise was not an issue. Bed was super comfortable. I would stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff's Port Angeles home was a perfect hub for our girl's trip to Victoria, BC and the Olympic National Park. Walking to the ferry was easy and local shops were great! Wide water views from every room that were especially beautiful at night."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Incredible view, Incredible stay! We honestly had so many things planned but just wanted to stay and enjoy the view. You can regularly see the harbor seals swimming by!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! We loved the view and the abundance of reading materials about the area/ Olympic national park. The binoculars came in handy. Lots of cool birds and sea lions swimming in the harbor!
Place was very clean and had everything we needed for a relaxing and rejuvenating weekend. Primary bed was very comfortable.
Close to town, we were able to walk and grab dinner! It’s right off the main drag, so there was road noise at rush hour, but nothing that got in the way of us relaxing/ sleeping well.
Thanks again Jeff, we’ll be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Knowing that weather can be iffy in March, we wanted a place that would be enjoyable rain or shine. Jeff's place definitely delivered! Gorgeous waterfront views from all 3 levels, room to spread out, and walkable to restaurants, shops, the waterfront, etc.
Jeff was great with communication. All the instructions & directions were clear, and we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.
We loved this place, but it is a little quirky and slightly dated. The ground floor bedroom is private, but the master bedroom is open to the main living area (with a partition that we didn't use) and the loft (with a futon, desk, etc.) is also open. This worked for our family with two teens, but may not work if you require more privacy."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location! Jeff was really easy to work with and let us check in early. Place was comfortable with a fantastic view.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place. I could sit and look out at that view all day. Located just a couple of minutes walk down to the town, you can easily walk to restaurants or the ferry over to Victoria. There is also a wine bar right next door if you’re into that sort of thing. The unit itself is quite spacious and has gorgeous views from every room. We loved this place."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"His accommodation was very clean and the view was especially nice. The dishes provided were very clean and varied in different types. We were especially grateful that he showed us around in person. The house was clean and pleasant as if it was newly remodeled, and everything you need was well-equipped. We loved it there very much and would use it again. It was easy to find there and the trails nearby were clean and good. I recommend it to people who need a break. I really liked it there."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The pictures do not do this place justice. The windows and views make this place one of our favorites ever. It’s within walking distance to so many great restaurants and bars and there is an amazing wine bar next door. We had the best time here and will definitely be back. Jeff is a great host, super communicative and helpful."

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"As soon as we entered Jeff's place, we were wowed. It was better than the description. The view, the personal touches, and the decor were relaxing and gave a sense of peace. We immediately felt relaxed after a long day of outdoor activities. There are good restaurants and shops within walking distance. We had a great time and would love to come back if we are in the area. As a host, Jeff was very responsive, timely, and detail-oriented. We had all the necessary instructions we needed during our stay."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jeff’s place was a joy to stay at! Lots of room for guests, pristine condition with everything you might need while on vacation!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jeff’s place was absolutely perfect! It had a beautiful view of the water. Was within walking distance to numerous restaurants and shops. Was so quiet and felt right at home. Everything you could need in an Airbnb.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great view; great space; great location.
The view was so spectacular it was tempting to just stay in and enjoy it. We loved watching the Coho Ferry arrive and depart. The home had three levels. Ground level had small bedroom, full bath and laundry; 2nd level had kitchen, dining, living room and primary bedroom and full bath —very open floor plan; there was a third level with office space and a futon etc to lounge. Easy for our group to spread out and views on all levels. Being able to easily walk to restaurants and shops and the ferry was a real plus. Would definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks, Jeff, for welcoming us and creating this beautiful space. The views are amazing. The layout of the place makes is very functional for 2 couples to enjoy. We enjoyed the Kokopelli Grill right down the street - easy to walk to - and there were many other attractions easy to walk to from the site."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, recently redone. Roomy, comfortable, with all necessities provided (including good coffee and lots of towels).

And close to entrance to Olympic National Park."

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint farm house located in the foothills of Olympic National Park. Comfortable beds, cute kitchen with all the tools you need to cook your own meals. My family and I fell in love with Port Angeles and while the location of the Farm House is a bit of a drive to the park and Port Angeles, we would stay there again if we go back to PNW."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy to find, quiet and beautiful setting. Best for groups up to six people."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susie had the house stocked with everything we needed and some things that we didn’t think to bring she had available.

Suzie is A++++ host--friendly, helpful and fun to talk to. And she gives great massages!!
We had everything we needed to stay in the house for 10 days. The kitchen was very well equipped, the beds were super comfy. We also enjoyed sitting out on the back deck and watching the birds--and especially the hummingbird that seems to live out there.
Thank you for everything, Suzie, it could not have been better!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnB is an absolute dream. A stunning and easy to get to location, perfect location for hiking and exploring WA, and well stocked entertainment.

Thanks Suzie and crew for a great stay!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Farm House is absolutely charming. It’s cozy and home and yet modern enough to not feel antiquated or musty.

The farmhouse studio comes with a cozy living room, well-equipped kitchen, comfortable beds and clean bathroom but I will forever treasure the quality family time (great board games and walks on the property!) and the memories we created during our stay here.

We enjoyed the easy practicality of the set up and labeling of light switches and cabinets. The written instructions had just the right amount of detail.
I think it was the cleanest Air BNB I've ever stayed in. Location was very convenient to Dungeness, Port A, Salt Creek and Olympic allowing us to limit car time and maximize adventure time. Loved sitting on the deck listening to geese fly by at night and the view of mountains and cows out the dining area windows.
We would definitely return if we ever make it back to the PNW!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This has been by far my favorite place I’ve stayed in all of the Airbnbs I’ve had the opportunity to stay in. The farm is PERFECT!
With the Olympic mountains as your view with sweet cows roaming freely in the pasture next to it, there isn’t anywhere else you’d rather be when the sun sets. The house was spotless with that cozy old time feel. We played cds from their awesome collection with the windows open, letting in the ocean breeze while we danced and cooked dinner together has a family. It elevated our trip to the peninsula ten fold.
This sweet farm was a place we didn’t want to leave and in hindsight, wished we had stayed at for our entire trip. We will stay here again the future!
Thank you Suzie for being such a lovely host! There isn’t a thing I would change about your lovely home, it was truly perfect."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! I’ve stayed in a lot of Airbnb’s and this is by far my favorite. We visited to hike in Olympic NP, and although some things are a bit of a drive, this location is definitely worth it! The views are spectacular and the house is amazing"

and history displayed throughout the space created a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The hosts' attention to detail was evident in every corner of the house from the linens to the decorations.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is the second time we've stayed at Suzie's place/Finn Hall Farm, and it felt like coming home. Undoubtedly there will be a third time. Such a perfect location for its glorious view of the mountains and immediate comfortable, rural surroundings, with such easy proximity to so many great places on the water, or in the mountains and forest, and with both Port Angeles and Sequim in easy reach for restaurants, shops and more. In addition, Finn Hall Farm is doggy heaven. Our dog, Peaches, requested I mention that.

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The farmhouse was beautiful, well stocked, and properly accommodated our needs. The mountains were gorgeous and all the surrounding properties were great to walk by on the road. All in all, a great value, would 100% recommend for a party of 5."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"As a family with three smaller children, the location is very nice. The children can get out, there is a sandbox, a slide, fruit and berries invite you to snack. In addition, it is very quiet.
We enjoyed it very much and would recommend the house at any time."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Peaceful, quiet retreat with beautiful views. Lots of things to explore outside. Close to fun activities and Olympic National Park."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wow, this place is a gem! It was a real treat to stay in a beautiful and totally peaceful home. Waking up to the rural surroundings, watching grazing cattle in the distance, and mountain views of the Olympics was the best. And learning about the rich history of the property from all the books and photos was so much fun. We booked another stay the same day we checked out!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We didn't get to meet Suzie, but we felt right at home during our short stay. Had we known just how beautiful the surroundings were, we would have planned to stay a little longer. This is a gem of a spot to land and it has everything you need for a cozy, peaceful stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a peaceful and cozy place! We had a great stay! The host was very kind!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our time here. It was so peaceful and beautiful.

The place was perfectly stocked and beyond comfortable and the communication with quick and always friendly and helpful. Our only regret is we coulddn't stay longer!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,we had a great stay. nice comfortable place for a small town.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed here for a second time and will stay here again! Great property in the country. Quiet, quaint, comfy beds and a great hot shower! Loved this stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I chose this Airbnb looking for a peaceful place to spend the 4th of July with my elderly dog who is terrified of the fireworks in my neighborhood and it was perfect! The house was so clean and was much more spacious than I expected. Even though it’s dog friendly there is no doggie smell in the home. My old man loved exploring the area around the house, there are lots of herbs in the landscaping and there was even a nest of baby birds in one of the birdhouses, I enjoyed listening to the babies when the parents would come and go.
The house had everything we needed for a lovely stay, including a big dog blanket for my pup to snooze on in front of the couch. I already booked our stay for next year."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing house to stay in. Loved the decor and the homey feel. Great bed! Appreciate the ability to do laundry. Nice hot shower. It was a lovely stay!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this beautiful farmland retreat and would recommend it without hesitation. In fact, I wish we could have stayed longer. Everything was as described and it was clean, comfortable, and cute. It’s also a great “jumping off” location for adventures on the Olympic Peninsula. The tidepooling at Salt Creek Recreation Area can’t be beat and walking the beach at Dungeness Spit is a sensory experience to savor. We especially appreciate the owners’ commitment to preserving farmland and the welcoming, inclusive messages on the property."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My boys loved the place, plenty of room to play! Definitely would stay again!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We only made a stop here and for our needs the farmhouse was totally fine. Families with children will certainly have a lot of fun here. The view of the mountains is ingenious but unfortunately you can't get anywhere to the water, as the houses in the first are all private. Thank you for letting us be there."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We love coming here. It is so peaceful and relaxing, but also centrally located to lots of recreation. The setting is perfect, a quiet country road on one side, and green pastures then the Olympic mountains on the other. I love being on the farm, especially knowing that this particular farm is preserved farmland. The hosts are so friendly and accommodating."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was lovely to stay at Suzie’s place! Would do it again!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, convenient and a gem of the house with a lot of history. Close to Port Angeles and Olympic National Park. The property itself was sprawling yet with a cozy farmhouse stay. Lots of old books, literature on the caboose - which is worth a trip anyway. We used cell phones as hot spots so didn’t miss wi-fi. Listened to classical music on CD’s."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The farm house was adorable and comfortable. The view spectacular.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Farm House is truly lovely! The best place to relax after days of hiking & camping in Olympic National Park (and grab a shower before re-entering society). We were in awe of the house, the property, and the views and will definitely come back if in the area again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay here! It’s quiet and tranquil, comfortable, and the farmhouse is well appointed. You’ll have everything you need here and we recommend checking out all the little farmstands in the vicinity.
We loved feeling like we are part of the living legacy of the farm. We wanted to stay longer!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place and views. The area is surrounded by pastures. Very quiet and peaceful. The farm house was roomy enough for the 4 of us! Appreciate all of the personal touches and amenities she provided. Definitely would stay again
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was the best and loveliest AirBnB stay experience! The farmhouse was lovely with the charming view of the mountains. The farmhouse had everything we could have needed during our stay. Although it was a peaceful getaway in a small town, it is so convenient for grocery shopping, dining out, and enjoying coffee. The place is close to everything (5-10 minutes driving). We really enjoy the farmhouse, the area, and local shops. We will definitely go back."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at the farmhouse as a family of 4 for the 1st time period. This was our 1st family trip with our 3 months old and 8 year old.We had A-blast and the home has so much to offer with lakes restaurants and trapost within driving distance or close by. We loved our stay and will probably stay again as the farmhouse is 1 of our favorite airbnb's to visit.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The place was beautiful you see the Mountains like living in the old days of my Grandma and Grandpa the old books the old furniture. It was awesome thank you?
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Suzie’s farm house was absolutely incredible! It was a super private and cozy stay. The fire pit at night was awesome and there’s no neighbors to really worry about. Me and my two friends had a great time. The Master bedroom has the most incredible view out of all the Airbnbs I’ve been to ever!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy, clean and packed with history in a beautiful and peaceful setting. I wish I could have stayed longer. A true gem. Can't thank Suzie enough for sharing this lovely place."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My group of 4 really enjoyed our stay at the Farm House! We arrived late and check-in was very easy. It felt like coming home after a long day of traveling. The view the next morning was stunning! Great location, amenities and convenience. Susie’s place had everything we needed."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Suzie's space was great for a short trip to visit Olympic National Park. Very cute space with all the amenities you need for a quiet getaway. Very quiet location, but close enough to Port Angeles if you need anything you forgot to bring from home. Enjoyed an evening fire and enjoyed the s'mores that were provided. Would definitely consider staying with Suzie again on future trips to the Port Angeles area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The farm stay was a perfect place to relax and unwind on our long road trip. It’s a cute and well-kept home and the back porch has a beautiful, peaceful view. The friendly cows right out back also add to the character and give even more of a peaceful stay. Would gladly recommend Suzie’s stay and could see ourselves coming back again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying at the farm house, so we were familiar with the place but was the first time we were visiting with many kids. It was fantastic. Had a pack n play, extra cots and a baby seat too. The caboose and crooked room were big hits and the additions like the slide for kids made the farm a lot of fun. Will visit again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Suzie’s Farmhouse was peaceful and relaxing with beautiful views. We truly enjoyed sitting outside watching the cows and roasting s’mores in the fire pit. The location was perfect as it was in the middle between Port Angeles and Sequim allowing for quick trips into either town. We enjoyed exploring the grounds and booked massages with Suzie. We can’t wait to return!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Suzie and her co-host were very warm and welcoming while giving us space to relax and unwind. Absolutely beautiful property and home. The children were in love with the caboose, mooing with cows, and playing twister on the deck. We were also super close to Dungeonous spit, a perfect walk and beach experience for our whole crew. Absolutely the memories we were hoping to make with them on this trip."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay & found everything we needed. Enjoyed the fresh coffee and watching the cows, and spent time hiking in the parks and along Dungeness spit."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an incredible stay! Words can't do it justice. So beautiful and peaceful. My children LOVED the sandpit made from a repurposed boat/dingy (so cute!). We loved the fire pit and all the small details that take your stay from a stay to a wonderful moment in time where you create memories with your loved ones. If ever we are back in the area (which I'm sure we will be), we will be staying at the farm house with Suzie (if there is availability). Thank you Suzie!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Suzie’s place was exactly as described and made us feel right at home. The Farmhouse is located on a peaceful farm with breathtaking views of the nearby mountains. We loved having a fire and making s’mores out back and had a blast working our way through her nostalgic collection of CDs! The property also has so many unique features including a refurbished train that guests can explore. Our pups also enjoyed their accommodations including water bowls, towels and toys. 10/10 would recommend to anyone visiting the PNW. Thank you Suzie!"

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Friendly little cottage. Very nice environment and very peaceful. The house is atypical with all the games and old books. Retro side can be a tiny bit for us but it all depends on the tastes.
Cute little touches including everything to make smores.
Thank you very much."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a wonderful stay! The location is quiet and open. The views of the Olympics were a joy to see every morning. The yard is big. We had plenty of room for our dog to run around. The house was clean and cozy. The kitchen has the amenities needed to stay in and cook. The beds were very comfortable. We loved the extra thought put into having supplies for our pup ( blankets, towels, bowls, etc). We had good cell service (T-mobile) for the occasional check in. We didn't miss having wifi as this location is a perfect place to disconnect from technology and reconnect with family. Thank you Suzie!"

The views of the Olympics in the mornings are AMAZING and the front yard you get sneak peak of the water!! Best part is we can have our dog Sydney with us. We'll be back next March!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a perfect place for an evening stay in the area. Friends were getting married nearby the following morning and allowed us to get up early for a wedding.
We arrived a few hours before sunset and our daughter was able to play in the sandbox before we headed out for dinner in Port Angeles. The huge field was great for throwing the ball with our dog.
The interior was delightfully decorated and gave a sense of history to the family farm. We enjoyed the old photos throughout the house and felt right at home.
We’d definitely stay here again. Thanks!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"3 adults, a toddler, and a small dog. The kitchen was well stocked for cooking and our 2 year old enjoyed exploring the house and playing with the little farmhouse toy. We enjoyed the fire pit, and picked up some essentials at the Agnew store, which also had a small petting zoo with a goat and more! The beds were comfy and the view from the larger bedroom was so stunning we slept with the curtains open so we could wake up to it. Suzie was helpful and friendly. We were even able to get massages from her! Her massage studio has a few little things you can buy as well. There were handcrafted wooden earrings, potted, succulents, and cards. I picked up a wooden snowflake ornament as a memento of our stay. Highly recommend!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is such a lovely spot for a getaway in the Sequim/Port Angeles Area. The view from the master bedroom and kitchen of the farmland and Olympics was a delight every morning. Dungeness Spit is a short drive away, and there are great restaurants nearby (like Old Mill Cafe) as well as plenty to eat in Sequim and Port Angeles. We felt right at home. There's no WiFi, which we knew, we had a great time listening to a big stack of CDs and watching DVDs Suzie provided. There were also board games. (AT&T was also pretty reliable out there.) We would happily come back."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Suzie’s farm was a wonderful home away from home. The place had everything we needed and more. Good music is available and made the ambiance of the little farmhouse that much better. We stayed the night of a windstorm, power goes out momentarily, but candles and lamps are around if needed. Beds are comfortable and clean and we slept very good even with the roaring winds outside. Suzie was also a fantastic and communicative host. Definitely would recommend a night or two here if you’re in the area."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay on the farm was perfect! Although the Airbnb is further from town, getting to each was very easy. Being away from town was actually a huge plus, as it really gave space to see the amazing views of the mountains, and les light pollution to gaze at the stars! Make sure to check if there are any meteor showers happening during your stay!"

We really enjoyed the together time. Suzie hooked us up with everything! We took the boys to the game farm, the petting zoo n town. The picked apples off the trees, tan in the fields, watched the cows, made a campfire and cooked s’mores! Then we had a big country breakfast with all local area farm supplies."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The view from the back patio is just divine. The house itself is full of lots of interesting details. It was easy to get to the hikes we wanted to do. Do yourself a favor and don’t miss having a meal at Alder Wood Bistro.

It is equipped with everything needed for a comfortable and relaxing getaway. We especially loved watching the sun set over the surrounding mountains, sitting around the fire pit, and hanging with the cows. My only regret is that we didn’t stay longer. If you’re going to be exploring the Olympic peninsula, make this your home base."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute little farmhouse with comfortable room for our family of 4. Suzie was very helpful friendly and responsive. Convenient location to access various parts of the Olympic National Park. Loved the views out the backdoor.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I got lucky and found this place after a cancellation. it was the perfect location for a stay after a long hike at Olympic National Park.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little cozy place with a super cool view.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The farm house had everything we needed for a family of 4. The view is absolutely beautiful and surroundings very peaceful. You could smell the lavender from the farm across the street. There were lots of thoughtful touches: stuff for s’mores, coffee, ice in the freezer, shampoo, soap, and all the paper products. My kids enjoyed exploring the caboose and other areas of the farm. I would happily stay at the farm house again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A PERFECT place in the Country to stay while you explore Sequim!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Suzie's. Suzie is a great host. The place is very clean and nice. We enjoyed roasting marshmallows, relaxing ad stargazing. I think it is such a great place to relax and enjoy the lavender fields nearby. It is also a good point to start your trips for the Olympic Park. We definitely recommend and can not wait to be back."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED Suzie's place! It was spacious and clean and the views were gorgeous. The backyard was so sweet, and we made wonderful use of the little grill including the fixings for s'mores that Suzy left for us as a gift. We loved having our coffee out on the back porch every morning and picking blackberries on the road and marveling at the lavender farm right across the street. The view of the mountains is breathtaking. The cows are sweet, and we enjoyed their gentle mooing. The caboose museum right next to the house is adorable. We had an all-around wonderful stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay while visiting the Olympic peninsula. Raspberries were ripe while we were there, so we got to have a treat with our breakfast. Comfortable space for our group; beautiful view of the mountains."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was in such a peaceful location—quiet, dark at night, and lots of open expanse. Great location for sites near Sequim and Port Angeles. The house is very tastefully decorated and the owners thought of everything you might need. We enjoyed the s’mores supplies left for us, as well as grilling outside (briquettes were on site). There were raspberries and currants ripe for picking when we were there and fun things for our 8-year old to explore. As a city family, it was a welcome chance to simply slow down. The CD collection was novel for our son and kept him entertained for hours! My husband even enjoyed a massage from Suzie while at the house, which was an unexpected bonus, since Suzie is a massage professional and has a cute studio on site. Highly recommend Hurricane Ridge at sunrise, Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge any time, and the Dungeness Valley Creamery to see the cows and try ice cream and raw milk. Berry picking at Graymarsh Farm was also a treat. Thank you for a memorable stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great trip to the farm house. Perfect setting to relax and unwind and close to so many options for outdoor activities.

We will definitely stay here the next time we are visiting the area, and wish we could've stayed longer! Highly recommend Lindsey's place, it's the best airbnb we've ever stayed in. Thank you Lindsey!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy is an understatement! This was a home away from home. I chose this location because it was 2 hours from Seattle and 2 hours from Hoh Rainforest. So glad I did!.
Lindsey was a rock star host! Gave great recommendations -Ediz Hook, the coolest black sand beach is a must. I felt bad having the place to myself - so much room- but I got over it.
Bed was too good, almost stayed in it. Very quiet and private area. Wish I would have made time to enjoy outdoor space. Loved the lights. Kitchen rocked. Bathroom was more than expected! Even washed a small load of clothes!!
Beware of adorable guard cat. Bringing my kids next year! Thank you again ❤️"

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at Lindsey’s was great! She was extremely communicative and the place looks exactly like the pictures. It was such a cute set up, very modern and clean, and perfect place for us to crash after a day of adventures in Olympic National Park. She even went the extra mile and provided a care package for my dog! Only a few minor issues which is why I didn’t give it 5 stars, but not the end of the world by any means. The TV sound and remote was difficult to work and malfunctioning, and the oven didn’t work. I brought this to Lindsey’s attention and she is looking into it so I imagine it won’t be an issue for anyone else staying there! Overall, I would absolutely stay here again!"

It is super well decorated and is a very relaxing place to stay. You can see the ocean from the room and it’s located in a neighborhood that feels secluded enough for a great time yet is close enough to Port Angeles for anything you will need!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This space is so welcoming and the view from the porch was one of our favorite things about our trip to Washington.
Anita is very friendly and easy to communicate with.
The home was clean and comfortable."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a GREAT place to stay! Cute little spot with lots of very thoughtful amenities and features. Anita left us a very friendly card on our arrival. The neighborhood is beautiful. If you're considering this spot, reserve it, you won't regret it!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is in a quiet, well kept neighborhood along the coast. Highly recommend booking this comfortable, immaculately clean unit. Anita could not have been more responsive, kind or accommodating. She genuinely desires that her guests have a terrific time in Port Angeles. We had a hike of a life time on the Obstruction Point trail off of Deer Park Road. If you can handle a 7.5 mi hike (about 1/2 of the trail's length) where 1/2 of it is pretty much straight up (and 8 mi drive on a winding dirt road) you must take this hike! The view of the Olympic Mountains was breathtaking. Very pleased that we booked with Anita."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place with a very nice host
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anita was very responsive! She and Brent have a beautiful home with a view of the ocean. It is so peaceful and quiet. Their space had everything anyone could ever need, even a coloring book and colored pencils! A small drive to the middle of Port Angeles, but very easy! The perfect place to stay if you are hiking in Olympic."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anita's place was very spacious and luxurious. It was obvious that no expense was spared in the layout, furnishings and decorations. It was warm and inviting.
It's a little farther away from the beaten path. But the tradeoff is that the neighborhood is in very beautiful, very lush surroundings. Peaceful and pristine.
In my experience, the suite is twice the size of the average Airbnb. With a king-size bed, a pull-out bed and a decent sized couch, it can comfortably accommodate four people."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just like the photos. Very quiet and a beautiful place to stay the night between travels. Laundry is a plus 🙂
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay! The place was so peaceful and homey! A great, restful escape from long days exploring the area and the sunsets over the cliff were gorgeous!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and comfortable. Nice little kitchen with everything we needed. Some great information for things to do in the area. Quiet. We never met the owners, which is probably them being respectful of our privacy, but I would not have minded."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great! Thank you Anita for making our stay so comfortable. Will be back!

The open floor plan provides ample space for luggage, dogs, and people. There are thoughtful touches everywhere and the unit is well-stocked. The neighborhood is peaceful and a great place to visit if traveling with dogs. We only stayed one night and plan to return."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anita’s place was a small slice of heaven! The ocean view, the library, the Seattle chocolate — everything was superb. I would highly recommend!"

The place itself is adorable and they have thought of everything one might need while traveling. It was clean, welcoming and we would definitely recommend it to our friends."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. Perfect location near Olympic but close enough to the coast, Sequim, restaurants. The view is really relaxing after a day out. Friendly deer in the front yard. The space is immaculate and would be great for couples or families. Thanks for sharing."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little space to stay. Very well thought out like the other reviews mentioned. If you stay here and have questions or concerns, I’m sure Anita would be very responsive, but if you look around, you’re probably bound to find the answer. The decor is lavender and Jesus themed. Very nice."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"💯% Every mynute detail was so downright perfectly appointed; there's no way it's even 99%! Things were so stunning and flawless, it almost felt intimidating to use anything. Bottom line though, of course, was there was such a warm welcoming atmosphere you could ease up from that sensation. Magnificent View! We weren't there more than maybe 5 minutes, one of the blinds concerned us that we might break it due to how heavy it was to lower. Anita showed up at the door Immediately in response to my text of concern, and showed us it was no problem! You'll never find another vacation place to stay any better in every way than Eagle's Rest"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for your beautiful place. We enjoyed the view of the water and peacefulness of the neighborhood. The kitchen was stocked with tea even cheese and crackers were available. The place was super clean and easy to use. Thank you again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed in many Airbnbs across the globe. I don't say that to sound snotty, but to say with some experience that this space is so obviously lovingly thought out and delightfully well-appointed. We enjoyed our short stay, and appreciated extra touches Anita afforded us. Great place."

The view from the place was beautiful and the indoors were cozy, and it was close enough to all the places we wanted to see in Olympic national Park. Thank you, Anita!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot was perfect for our needs with visiting Olympic National Park and the west coast. It’s such a quiet neighborhood, with beautiful views, and easy access to Port Angeles. The suite was so clean and cozy, and after long days of hiking, it was nice to come back to wash up, relax with the fireplace going, and have a cup of tea. Our hosts were so thoughtful and got me a card and a bottle of wine for my birthday, which was so unexpected but so very much appreciated. We loved our stay at Eagles Rest, and can’t wait to come back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and spacious with all necessary amenities. Easy check in, would book again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect stay for a trip to Olympic National Park.
I live in Seattle and needed somewhere to stay to break up my drive home after visiting Olympic National Park. I also wanted an AirBNB that would be unproblematic due to trying to also secretly plan my proposal.
This stay was everything I needed and beyond for a similar price as the Olympic Inn where I stayed the last time I travelled to Olympic NP. However, this stay was significantly better quality.
(1) The king sized bed is very comfortable; (2) the bathroom was spotless and I love that we had a washer and dryer available; (3) the room itself is spacious, well planned with the sleeping areas, kitchenette, and living area placed in pleasing setting with a wonderful view of the water; (4) The hosts are friendly, thoughtful, and communicative. I did not experience any issues, but I did let them know about my proposal and they ensured our experience was perfect!
There isn’t any more debate left to be had. If you’ve come to this review just go ahead and book it. My only regret was not booking for two nights."

Loved every minute while staying here and hope to return!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Anita's place for part our 1 year wedding anniversary trip. The stay was peaceful, romantic, and very clean. We loved all the local lavender products (lotions, soaps, cleaning materials). Stopped at a local lavender farm for a tour and site seeing per Anita's recommendation and had a blast! Spent most of our time at the national park which is very close by. The view from the stay is breathtaking at sunset! We could not be happier with our experience here."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A wonderful view and quiet relaxing neighborhood stay. Anita and Brent were so pleasant and responsive to helping us, even when we needed some materials to repair a personal item. The house is 10 minutes off Hwy 101 and 20 minutes to the Olympic National Park visitor center. We stayed here for 8 nights, did not even notice they have a dog until we saw it in the yard one day. Highly recommend this place!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anita has anticipated everything you’d want and more for your stay at her comfortable studio.

I highly recommend staying here. You will not be disappointed.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really wonderful place to stay about halfway between Port Angeles and Sequim. The place is quiet, cozy, clean and has amazing views.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Brent and Anita's place was extraordinary. Clean, clean, clean! Neat as a pin! All of the little touches added up to a cozy and comfortable stay. We especially enjoyed the electric fireplace and watching the ships pass by on the Straight of San Juan de Fuca from the two large picture windows. Nice, quiet neighborhood. Easy access to Sequim, Port Angeles, Hurricane Ridge, and Lake Crescent. Our daughter slept on the rollaway bed and said it was very comfortable. There was plenty of room for us to spread out and feel like we had our own space. Great value!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Really great spot and super cute on the inside! The only down side was you could hear a good amount from upstairs. Overall they stayed quiet for the most part tho! Loved the robe and shower in general! Plus they gave me a super yummy and cute cookie! I would stay again
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could live at Anita's place full time. Plenty of space, a great view of the water, cute deer hanging around the neighborhood.

About ten minutes from Sequim and Port Angeles as well as the entrance to the Olympic National Park and Hurricane. Wonderful place to stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I are so happy we booked with Anita! Our honeymoon to the Olympic National Park was that much better staying in this tucked away, cute place. The location is great, quiet neighborhood, right next to beautiful cliffs and a gorgeous view of the ocean. It's super close to neighboring towns and scenic spots too. Since Anita and Brent live above the studio, they are easy to get in touch with and have tons of recommendations for the area. With that, they respected our space and privacy. I've never had such accommodating hosts with airbnb, and highly recommend staying here!"

We didn’t stay in the room much because there is so much to see outside. It was very clean and welcoming. The view is great with the barges and BC on the other side. Even met their puppy on her terms. They do live above, but they were very quiet and it did not bother us in the least."

Big comfy bed, cozy fireplace, surprisingly well-equipped kitchenette and an ideal location for peninsula adventures - equidistant between Sequim and Port Angeles (15 mins) and an easy drive to ONP spots like Hurricane Ridge (45 mins) and Lake Crescent (45 mins). Anita was a responsive, lovely host and we so appreciated our stay!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful and spotlessly clean studio to stay in. Initially we were going to go with a spot in Port Angeles, but since this place looked so perfect we went with it. Was not disappointed either! Exactly as advertised which was beautiful decorated and comfortable studio with an awesome bathroom shower and bathrobes. Had all the kitchen stuff we needed and then some. Met husband of the host very briefly. He was very pleasant and encouraged us to ask for anything we needed. However we did not need anything else. Would stay there again. Was only a few minutes from Port Angeles, however was quieter almost country setting w/ nice view and cozy fireplace. If your have some doubt try it out. You won't be disappointed."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My takeaway is how great of a value this Airbnb is! It’s a very spacious, clean and well appointed unit with a nice view of the Salish Sea. The owners are very communicative and helpful. A far better spot than any hotel in the area. I highly recommend this Airbnb to folks visiting the Olympic Peninsula!"

Beautiful view, spacious and clean, wonderful directions, incredibly comfortable, great location for exploring (I loved that it was right in between Sequim and Port Angeles as well as its proximity to the local and national parks), and a very kind host with excellent recommendations (Nourish and Granny’s were in fact delicious)!

Anita thinks of every detail down to laundry pods and slippers. The studio was much bigger than we expected and perfect for a getaway for two. The kitchenette has ample supplies and counter space to prep your hiking lunches or coffee and breakfast in the morning. The neighborhood is quiet, clean, and picturesque. We will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to Port Angeles."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Ocean views and close enough to hear the surf. Clean, quiet, and easy access with parking at the door. Great location between Sequim and Port Angeles. Totally positive experience with the accommodations and the hosts (and all of the neighborhood Deer)."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was just a bit out of town, and it was fairly easy to access. The hosts were very friendly and responsive, and the studio was exceptionally clean and tidy. We appreciated the detailed instructions in the binder and the extra blankets and towels if needed.
For it being a studio kitchen, It was still well stocked. We loved the tea and hot pot and used the fridge and freezer as well as the washing machine.
The hosts and their dog live above the studio, so we occasionally heard footsteps, but for the most part it was very quiet (we actually could have used a fan at night for some white noise so we didn’t hear each other!)
Since this stay was at the end of our trip, the one bedroom studio for three of us did start to feel a little small after a couple of days, but we were gone so much enjoying what the area head to offer that we were really only there for sleeping!
There is a great paved trail nearby for running or biking."

Definitely go to Sequim to the lavender farms and to Nourish for lunch! Rainforest was a hike but worth the extra car trip, if not just for the gorgeous drive."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a cosy little gem! Close to Olympic National Park, Port Angeles and Sequim, it’s a great spot to come back to after a day of hiking/kayaking. Charming, comfortable, practical: everything you need!"

Neighborhood was quiet & the outdoor patio offered a very pleasant place for morning coffee & evening relaxation. Would highly recommend Anita's studio to anyone visiting the area! Anita offered great communication & was kind enough to mail our forgotten library book to us. Thanks again, Anita!"

BNB had everything we needed and more. Washer and Dryer if needed too.
Very comfortable bed. Slept very well after a fun day at the BEAUTIFUL NP."
,,,"DO NOT STAY WITH THIS HOST! My 1st bad Airbnb review. Facts: I gave her 2hr notice when I would arrive. She did not heat the RV for me. I had to search for 1 tiny space heater. Upon arrival, it was 50deg in the RV. She told me that it would warm up with both heaters on high. It never got warmer than 53 deg, and the water ran dry due to frozen pipes. I used my own water that I brought, in order to use the toilet properly (you have to fill it with water before using, or it will be very dirty.) I brought lots of warm clothing. I got very little sleep. I left the place spotless as I always do. There was never any hot water, even after the place warmed up with the sun the next day. No shower. Not enough TP provided. I left early and asked for a refund, which she agreed to. Both host and Airbnb get an F, since I had to beg for a refund, which I have not seen, 2 wks later. I am told I may get 30%. Unbelievable. Airbnb can't be trusted to advocate for guests. This host should be removed."
