2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Pat & Tom are fabulous hosts. Every little detail in their home was well appointed and clearly done with great attention to detail. It was absolutely spotlessly clean and fresh. We enjoyed learning the history of the home as well. We already booked for a second visit and are certain this will be our home away from home when we visit our son and his family in Meadville.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to rest up on our weekend getaway. The apartment was immaculate, secure, and comfortable. The country setting was nice, and the property was easy to get to. The host was extremely responsive to any questions we had. We'll plan on staying here again when in the area. Don't hesitate to book this one!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great stay! Patricia was so proactive in communication, and we felt right at home. One of the most important things to me in an Airbnb is a comfortable bed, and this delivered!!
A sweet little sitting area to enjoy the birds and beautiful flowers planted around the apartment made it so nice to sit outside at night.
This is a true gem 💕"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The king-sized bed is extremely comfortable and Patty's place feels like home. Another wonderful stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This stay was the best part about our weekend in town for a wedding. The host were so polite and accommodating. The location was great, parking was great, the yard and property are incredibly maintained and the space is really just quaint and pleasant. I recommend Davenport cidary for evening drinks like 10-12 minutes away. All in all a really nice airbnb that feels like a proper bnb. The host got an iron and ironing board out and ready for me and since our rental car was electric they setup an extension cord so I could top it off over night while we slept. (I don’t recommend relying on 110 charging if you have a rental electric car go to a charging station and don’t rely on your host to provide this for you! They were just helping us in a bind) I don’t know these host personally but they were inviting like your own parents would be. 10/10

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were in town for graduation at Allegheny College, so there were three generations staying in, or stopping by Gene's place. There was plenty of room for all of us and everyone felt comfortable. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare a meal and then some. For the coffee lovers, there is a keurig and a coffee press. The basics were so well stocked that we thought other members of our party had brought items supplied by our host. Gene was very responsive to questions both prior to and during our stay. It is clear that he cares about providing a nice place to stay as well as a good experience. We wish all hosts were as caring as Gene and all properties as nice as his."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gene’s place was perfect to visit family around Crawford county. The creek was lovely and the bird watching so relaxing. Gene went the extra mile by stocking the fridge, setting the table, etc. the place has so many sitting places to enjoy the beautiful scenery it was hard to decide each morning where to have coffee. We felt right at home with 4 adults and one dog. Would absolutely come back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gene's house is very well accommodated and on such a beautiful property! We wished the weather was a bit warmer during our stay to spend more time along the river and kayaking. Definitely recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was fantastic! There were 4 of us in the house and there was more space than we could use!
The provided breakfast items and snacks were a welcome surprise.
Gene's place lacked for nothing. Too bad it wasn't the right time for kayaking.
We would definitively come bach again and have already recommended it to friends and family."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great time at our hockey tournament we were in town for and felt safe, relaxed and calm while at the house. There was enough room and for the 6 of us and our dog. Gene was very friendly, kind and accommodating."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A perfect place to stay for our Erie and Pittsburgh pursuits. Extraordinarily spacious for our group of 5 plus dog. Quiet neighborhood surrounded by nature. Well stocked fridge made breakfast prep a breeze. And the well appointed, chef-friendly kitchen enabled a homemade dinner. The Christmas tree was a nice, festive touch as well."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house welcomed us in with a table set for dinner, snacks and breakfast foods in the refrigerator, plenty of space downstairs to spread out for 6 adults. Disappointed that we were not allowed to use fireplace as we had cold nights to enjoy it, but understandable. The kitchen was perfect for multiple stations and people to prepare a holiday meal. Plenty of cookware and utensils. The yard was great for the dogs and the Creek provided a lovely backdrop and gentle sound. We were looking for a meeting point for our extended family to share Thanksgiving together and this fit our needs well. Gene was a great host available and quick to respond. Two separate table areas allowed a spot to play games together. Wonderful few days."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Gene was a wonderful host! The house was just as the pictures indicated. The view of French Creek was great. Loved the fact that it was at the end of the road made it very private. The snacks and breakfast food waiting for us was a very sweet gesture. I would highly recommend this property and Gene as a host!!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were delighted with our stay. The house was perfect for my husband, my brother and myself to stay and visit family in the area. Gene’s house is very well appointed and furnished with everything we needed to feel right at home. The screened and open porches were excellent for enjoying the views of French Creek and listening to the many birds or watching the rabbits and chipmunks. The kitchen was well equipped and along with a big dining table allowed us to share a beautiful space with visiting family members for breakfast and lunch.
Gene was very responsive and helpful. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,The place was beautiful inside and put. Very peaceful. The view of the creek was nice. We enjoyed the fire pit. Within walking distance to small stores. Well stocked with cooking and cleaning supplies. Very clean. Loved the house. Beautifully decorated.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We vacation all over, usually using VRBO. This was my first time booking thru Air B&B and Genes home didn’t disappoint. Hands down best host, house and price up to this point. Everything was updated, clean, and above expectations. I told him we would be in late Thursday due to having to leave after my sons football practice and he even went as far as to leave snacks for the kids. Overall great host, house, price and location. I would definitely book again and recommend Gene to any of my friends traveling to the area."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a wonderful overnight stay! The accommodations were beautifully decorated, thoughtfully appointed, and very comfortable. There were many helpful details that we appreciated. The private entrance also made it easy for us to come and go without disturbing our host. This home is located in a very convenient area, with quick access to the college, the town, and local parks etc. It was a delight to meet our gracious host (and her darling pup). We recommend highly!!!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I greatly enjoyed my stay at Deb’s and definitely plan to book her stay again when I’m in the area. You have a massive suite to yourself with a private entrance. Deb was incredibly accommodating!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Deb's so many times, I have lost count. She is a wonderful host and such a sweet and kind person. Her place is always very clean and the bed is very comfortable. My husband and I love the fireplace and it is a big plus in the wintertime. Whenever we go to Meadville, we always check to see if her wonderful place is available before we even look at any other Airbnb properties. Thanks Deb for once again making our stay awesome."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Deborah’s room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Checking in was easy and Deborah was very accommodating and pleasant. There’s a little kitchenette, a nice sized private bathroom, small couch and double/queen sized bed that was comfy. And a dresser for your clothes.
It is a lower/basement type room and there was a hint of dampness in the air upon arrival but Deb had a dehumidifier running that quickly cleared that up. Private Access to the room is around the back through the yard. A walkway would be ideal but not a deal breaker.
I was in Meadville on business and Deborah was helpful in giving me directions to where I needed to be. I didn’t get much leisure time due to work but all in all I enjoyed staying at Deb’s place and will absolutely stay again if I find myself out that way.
I definitely recommend Deborah’s space to a solo or couple traveling through the area."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I had a lovely stay and will book again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice room with large bathroom. Very clean and comfortable. Deb explains everything very well.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My first time staying in a host's home. Deb's basement apartment is spacious, comfortable., and beautiful - very tastefully decorated and clean. The mattress was AMAZING, I think the most comfortable I've ever slept on in an airbnb. Although surprisingly the pillows aren't great, but I always bring my own :) The fireplace was a nice touch. Walking down through the yard to the outside entrance wasn't bad at all but might be dicey in the winter. There is noticeable noise of footsteps above, but the dehumidifier running helps cover that. (Note that it's best to empty the dehu bucket before bedtime, so it doesn't reach full during the night. Then you get loud beeps and dead silence which I learned the first night and then forgot to do the second night - my bad! I look forward to staying again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"In a few words, worth every penny. I needed an affordable CLEAN SAFE place to stay in Meadville for a short stay. This was the perfect solution. Owner was accommodating, pleasant, and very responsive.

The bed and couch are both comfortable; the kitchenette is convenient; the space is tastefully decorated and furnished with quality linens.
It was raining when we arrived and Deborah met us at the front door, with a friendly greeting and the direct route to our accommodations. On our several visits, she has been kind and responsive to any questions we have. I have no hesitation about recommending a stay at Deborah's to anyone visiting the area."

The accommodated space was spotless clean, very homey, and quiet. Bed was comfortable, extra linens and towels were provided too. Private patio space outside of the private entry door was a nice bonus, and if I was staying longer than one night, would’ve spent a lot of time out there, as her landscaping and flowers on the property are beautiful and very well kept.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah is such a wonderful host! She communicated very quickly and was very proactive when all of a sudden a storm came through and knocked the power out. She was quick to offer flashlights and candles. She was apologetic but it was really Mother Nature’s doing. She is so polite and kind. I would definitely recommend staying at her place if needing a place in Meadville or surrounding area. Very convenient to 19, 86, I-79. I would be careful if suffer from knee issues as getting in and out of bed was a little problematic since so low to floor. But she shows pictures, I just didn’t pay attention to those kind of details. The living area was so cute and she has a detailed page how to work the tv. The kitchenette was well stocked. She even had a little basket of snacks and a pitcher of water in mini fridge. She has toiletries in the bathroom just in case. Checking out was just as easy as checking in. Great place and superb hostess. Thank you for the weekend of respite!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deborah’s place is a great choice when visiting Meadville. It’s our son’s last year at Allegheny College and we were so glad we found this alternative to the area hotels! Lovely setting near the campus.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deborah is a great host and so considerate. My husband and I have stayed at Deborah's Airbnb several times and it is always very clean and comfortable with everything that I needed for a very pleasant stay. This time I was the only one who stayed and I felt safe and secure and enjoyed my stay immensely and the fireplace was amazing since it was so cold in Meadville. We have already booked with her for July and I am sure we will be staying there many more times over the years. I was able to spend some time talking with Deborah which I also enjoyed. She is a very nice lady. Thank you Deborah for everything and I look forward to seeing you in July.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stayed at Deborah’s with our two dogs for 1.5 weeks while visiting family. It was very quiet and private. We didn’t use the kitchenette much as we mostly ate at our family members house but it was the perfect size for wish we needed. Deborah was kind and responsive and we are happy to know we have a place to stay at whenever we visit family again. One thing to note is you can hear people walking around upstairs but it didn’t bother us at all. Thanks Deborah!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The perfect place for our quick Meadville stay. Thank you Deborah!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have not had such a relaxed and lovely time in Meadville in years! The location was perfect, and I was able to zip in and out of town to see friends, take walks at Woodcock, and enjoy the parade with ease! Comfortable bed, and amazing artwork! I'm already looking forward to my next stay!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely space on a quiet street. Deborah is very pleasant at check in and shows you the place. It's a spacious and cozy basement with a very comfortable bed. It's connected to the main part of the house, but it has its own entrance as well, so you're not walking through the main house to come and go. I recommend it."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, close to the college.
Deborah was welcoming and her place was wonderful. Spacious and well equipped. The bed was very comfortable. I will be returning!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Her home is beautiful and there’s a fire place. Y’all! There’s a whole fire place. It randomly came on too, which scared me at first, but I did enjoy it. She is super nice!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deb was a great communicator and gracious host. Her place was super cozy with everything we needed to feel right at home. Located in a beautiful neighborhood. Highly recommended.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a basement apartment. The room was about 25 by 15 with a separate bathroom and walk-in closet. WE used the separate entrance door that required walking around back. I think the garage was available, but we didn't need it. I think if you use the garage you can walk in and go straight downstairs. The place was very clean. Loved the bed! Very comfortable. There was a dehumidifier running full time, so there was no musky smell. The place is simply the best value if you are looking for a place to sleep and run around from. I will try and stay there again next time I am in the area. I would recommend it to anyone."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Only stayed overnight. Everything was clean and thoughtful touches throughout. Thank you!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Deborah was very accommodating and had a wonderful home. If ever in Meadville, I would be happy to book with her again."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Spacious, well-appointed location in a pleasant neighborhood. Great instructions, magazines to read, just about everything you could want in your own space. I definitely recommend this location.
The only item I can point out for other guests to consider if this may be an issue for you is that, being a basement apartment, you can hear just the regular walking about the house above you. This was not a problem for me but could be for others. Other than that, there is NO problem with noise as the neighborhood was very quiet."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome location near the Allegheny College. Very clean and quiet. Felt more like home…. Very cozy!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a very comfortable and quiet stay at Deborah's. She greeted us personally and welcomed us to her well-maintained home, tastefully decorated with art and art pottery. The lower level was spacious, private and opened to a large rear yard with trees and birds a-plenty.
Deborah's house is conveniently situated and very easy to find from the freeway, straight into town on Park Ave and a right turn just past Allegheny's athletic field."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for me to stay When I was
accompanying my daughter to Allegheny College.. Debbie was a true host who received us with so much warmth. She went above and beyond in hosting us.. After a very long flight and being tired. She offered to send her friends Peggy & Ross to pick us from the airport. I would not hesitate to visit this place in the near future"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Downstairs room with plenty of space to relax from your travels. Comfy bed, welcoming environment! We'll book again if available in the future!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Worth every penny!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Best AirBnB in the area. Very clean and private. We stay here every time we are in town. Deborah is a great hostess. She is friendly but still gives you your privacy.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A quiet little get-away with lots of privacy and a super comfortable bed!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great location with the view at the end of the street as rather scenic. Very nice accommodation with the only 2 minor drawbacks being an ultra cold refrigerator and having to empty the humidifier 3 times in 3+ days. But it truly was well worth the stay and Deborah is a great hostess!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very accommodating and dog friendly! Helpful answering all our questions. Complete privacy and great location.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would stay at Deborah's home again without hesitation! The room is larger than it looks in the pictures, quiet, well-equipped, comfortable (I found the bed very comfortable), and in an excellent location for parents of Allegheny College athletes in particular! It's just a short walk to the football field, track, etc. Deborah was a kind hostess, who responded quickly to my questions. This is a great find in the Meadville area."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay! Thanks Deb for a super clean accommodation, great communication, friendly hospitality and service and a terrific place to call home while we visit our college student. Appreciate you and everything!!!! THANK YOU!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome pet friendly private spacious lower level living. Could not have wished for better! Lovely serene neighborhood!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the first time I was ever away from home and in my own, and Deborah's space was a very nice, welcoming place for the first time anxiety."
2021-04-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Deborah’s basement bedroom with a private bathroom is quite roomy and there is a separate entrance that opens up to a concrete pad below the back deck. There is a comfy couch and coffee table too.
Because the space is in the basement, there is some noise from the floor above. The walking and creaking began around 7am. Also, there was a pump noise from an adjacent room that came on periodically, but not for too long. I recommend ear plugs if you are a late sleeper. Early risers... no worries.
The walk to the driveway along the side of the house is through the grass and there is a slope. I suspect the walk would be untenable in snowy conditions. And you will need to use your phone’s light if making the walk at night.
The bed is comfortable although four pillows would have been nicer than the three we had. Oh, and there is WiFi. The bathroom is well lit and a decent size. Don’t freak out if the hot water in the tub/shower seems out. The hot is on the right.
There were some breakfast snacks at the coffee station, which was nice. The fridge was a bit too cold and the creamer in there was frozen.
Overall, Deb is an excellent communicator and her place is roomy, very clean and has a very convenient separate entrance. Also, her pricing is very reasonable. There is some noise from above and from the water system, but early risers will have no issue with that."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Deborah's place is wonderful. My husband and I stayed there in December and I made a trip by myself this month so I stayed with Deborah again. Her place is so clean, comfortable, quiet and safe. The fireplace is amazing and so warm and inviting. I look forward to staying at Deborah's again. Thanks Deborah for everything. You are definitely a Super Host!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Soo much better than expected! Pic's really don't do the space justice..Deborah is very kind thoughtful and accommodating..Definitely would and plan to stay here again!.. 😁
2021-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Such a warm welcome and the attention to even the smallest details make such a huge difference!!..This was my fist stay at a place on ""air bnb"" and I have to say im pleasantly surprised! I really didn't expect such a warm welcome or such a comfortable, home-like environment to stay in but This host is amazing and the photos do not do the space justice..it's just perfect..I would definitely book with her again if ever im in tbe area!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay. You have your own entrance and the room was very spacious. Deborah was such a nice person and I really enjoyed meeting her. It snowed a lot while we were there and Deborah cleared a path in the snow for us to walk around her home and also cleared the driveway for us. The fireplace was so cozy and peaceful. The bed was comfortable and I am getting ready to book another stay with her. She is definitely a super host.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. The new rear door makes it so easy to social distance! Will stay again!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great hostess. Awesome experience.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great host.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! Would absolutely stay here again, it’s so worth the price!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space was exactly as described. It was comfortable and well laid out. The bed was exceptionality comfortable. Our only hold out was that we couldn't find much to watch on the channels with the tv. Deborah and her little fur baby greeted us upon our arrival with our own set of keys but it had its own entrance as well. This home is located on a side street quit near town. It is very quiet. Deborah gave perfect instructions too. We would definitely visit again and recommend.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is truly the best place in Meadville to stay! Deborah is great and very accommodating. I highly recommend her warm and cozy basement!!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is truly a great place to stay. Quiet and safe neighborhood so we would definitely stay again. Deborah's hospitality and communication were awesome! .

2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice place, cute dog and kind hostess"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We felt safe in that neighborhood. Deborah was friendly. The room wasn't modern and we didn't have a private entrance but considering the low price we paid it was a good deal.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful and safe neighborhood. The room in the walkout basement is twice as big as a hotel room so we were very comfortable!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, large, clean space in a quiet neighborhood. Deb provided everything I could need. It was a great stay.
There's a big field across from the end of the street where I walked my dog and saw others doing so also.
If you are out and about, do go to Casey's Candies & Ice Cream in Meadville for some very yummy ice cream. I also found a lovely municipal park, Roche Park, that was very quiet and clean that had a one mile walking trail that my dog and I enjoyed before our ice cream stop."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful home and great location
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here for a wedding at the Country Club this past weekend. The space was very clean and felt homey. Sitting by the fire was so nice and made the space feel extra cozy! Deborah was a great hostess and left breakfast bars for us!

2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Deborah's place provided my own spacious place to relax. While the basement did not offer a lock at the top of the stairs, I wasn't worried about invasion of privacy at all. If it had not been snowing, I may have used the private entrance at the rear that was offered.
The private bathroom was wonderful and everything was stocked - including small breakfast options that I was not expecting, as well as the option to make coffee. The price was phenomenal for the privacy. No hotel could have offered as much as I was told by my travelling companions. Deborah was also VERY pleasant and did not mind my late and early hours."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah’s place is beautiful. I appreciated the bright bold colors and subtle nods to a wide variety of culturally specific design elements which are well
blended into a peaceful space. The location is easy to find and conveniently located to Allegheny Campus just as promised. Best of all Deborah is a warm and genuinely kind host."

2019-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Deb is very gracious and considerate. She truly wants her guests to experience a peaceful stay. As one with certain aches and pains from aging, I was surprised at how comfortable the bed was...better than my own which is fairly new! She has taken steps to provide her guests with nice amenities, such as coffee and breakfast/energy bars, an interesting selection of books in case you like to read before bed, and a comfy chair with good light nearby for that reading. I look forward to staying again!"

Super comfortable! Deb is such a gracious hostess and is so accommodating. Thanks for all you do, Deb. Highly recommend!"

2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Deborah was a excellent hostess. She was very resourceful and helpful.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Deb's place was great! We were working in the area and we found Deb's place to suit all of our needs! At first, we were a little confused about the key situation. It did say ""self check in"" which, my fault, I assumed meant there would be a lock box and a code would be sent to me like the last one we stayed at. Deb clarified quickly for us that we just needed to grab the key from her upon arrival. No issues!
Once there, we met Deb and her precious little dog, and got the key and unloaded!
We had a few notes (ones that I always note for others in case it may be an issue), but nothing that we had a problem with:
-the bathroom door stuck a little, but with a little force, you can close and lock the door.
-during some times, you can hear footsteps upstairs.
-at night, the house IS in a quieter area, so you MAY need to bring a sound machine if quiet bothers you.
Otherwise, we were very grateful that Deb helped us with a personal accommodation that we had last minute!
Would recommend!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Deborah was flexible as our needs changed. Her place is a great home away from home, with a private entrance and a birds, a bunny and flowers just outside the glass. There is a convenient walk at the nearby college that includes wooded trails."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our favorite home away from home in Meadville!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, comfortable, quiet. The best bed ever. Thanks, Deb!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"cute little place! nicely decorated and furnished. the pictures are accurate to the house. comfortable rooms.
my only negative comments would be that the stairs were quite steep and slippery, many spiders/bugs, and I was surprised of the proximity to the neighboring house, but I can't say there was anything innacurate about the listing.
good distance to the wedding venue we were traveling to, local bars, restaurants, etc.
overall would stay there again for what we needed."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah’s place was perfect for what we needed! Family came for son’s college graduation! Plenty of coffee, tea and snacks to accommodate! Nicely decorated! The house only has one bathroom but it’s nicely organized for easy use!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We thought we left something behind and Hannah was very responsive in looking for the item. Thank you

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Hannah’s place was clean, and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. She responded quickly to a last minute request to stay, which was much appreciated, and accommodated our two pups. Great stay overall."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The perfect place to rent for the weekend of our wedding in Meadville! Dogs aren’t allowed in the hotels near by and we couldn’t imagine our special day without our fur baby! The house was perfect for him! Thank you so so much!!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a great place to stay and close to the wedding venue. Very flexible with letting us add a day and then giving us a later checkout. I would definitely recommend!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very close to everything!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a very comfortable stay! Great location, communication, and accommodations."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Was a great spot to stay to visit our Allegheny daughter.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hannah was fabulous! We traveled with two small children and were a little concerned about the stairs and without hesitation, she purchased and delivered a gate. Great host and great house!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great peaceful place. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Hope to stay there again!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay at this very cute house. The place was so cute with painted murals and everything was lovely.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My recent stay at this Airbnb home was mostly positive, with a few minor setbacks. The location was fantastic, offering a peaceful retreat in a quiet neighborhood. The tasteful decor and spacious rooms provided ample relaxation. However, the low water pressure in the showers, dirty dishes/utensils and some accumulated dust were drawbacks. The host was responsive and accommodating, addressing concerns promptly.
Overall, the home provided a comfortable experience, but with a few adjustments, it could offer an exceptional stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family's stay at Hannah's place was terrific! Traveling with 3 young children can be stressful but we had all the space and comforts we needed in a house that is so charmingly decorated! It's truly adorable. Hannah provided ALL the things that I live for as a traveling mom: fast internet, climate control, snacks, water, sound machines, comfy beds, washer/dryer, and plenty of towels and toiletries. The home is a real gem and I recommend it to anyone visiting the Meadville area!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah’s place was perfect for our group. The beds are very comfortable and nicely furnished. There’s plenty of room to spread out.
We did a lot of walking around town, visiting old spots from our youth."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hannah was a wonderful host. We enjoyed our stay very much!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean and comfortable space, perfect for our family needs and accessing Meadville area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, with a great host."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place was absolutely adorable. The house was so nicely decorated. The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen had everything you could ask for to make you feel at home. We will be planning our trip back out to French Creek again next year and hope this house is available to stay again.
The only negative would be that it is an old house and I would not recommend it for anyone that might have trouble with stairs as they are steep and a little crooked. Other than that it was charming. Walked easily to several food places and Market St to do a little shopping."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our stay at Hannah's place was amazing! The unit was exactly how it was described and it felt very homey. The beds were comfortable and everything was clean and well maintained. Hannah provided welcome snacks and left us a nice welcome message. It was very well stocked and she provided a variety of bath products to choose from in the shower. We would definitely stay again when we are in the area!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay at Hanna‘s place. The kitchen was well stocked, with spices, flour and sugar in the pantry, and every cooking tool you can imagine!
It was nice to have a spot to take off your shoes before venturing into the rest of the house. We didn’t have much chance to use the living room with its modern couch and funky rocking chair. The steep stairs were a challenge until we figured out to boy wearing socks, and turn our feet sideways! Upstairs bedrooms have comfortable beds, storage and are beautifully decorated. The small, single bathroom was a bit of a squeeze for four people trying to get out of the house in the morning.
The shower was narrow, but amply supplied with shampoo, conditioner, body wash. The toilet seat is particularly small - due to the size of the bathroom, no doubt. The location is convenient, plenty of parking on a quiet street, and a gorgeous tree shaded lot. We’d gladly stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hannah has a great place - love the décor!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"A wonderful, clean, and peaceful stay. Absolutely recommend a stay here."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Hannah. Ideal place for us to unwind. Appreciate the well done house and clean spaces. Hope we can come back!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! Worked great for our needs.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The check in instructions came in at a timely manner. Place was clean and well decorated. Kitchen and bathroom were very well stocked. Would book again if in the area.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great choice for our stay in Meadville for the Allegheny College commencement. The kitchen had everything we needed for our small family party. Nice decor, very pretty and clean! Just great!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hannah’s place exceeded our expectations! Her place is even more beautiful than the pictures show. Everything was neat and clean. She had thoughtful touches through out her place and even had sound machines in the bedroom which was a delightful surprise. There is a lot of road noise but with the sound machines it wasn’t a problem. She had a sweet welcome note, a snack tray with a variety of snacks, and water bottles in the fridge. Me and my family thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home is so charming! The decor is tastefully done with serene colors. Decorated with beautiful artwork.
There were no outside pictures of the home when I booked and that made me a little uneasy. There was no reason to be uneasy though because it’s a beautiful well kept home. Hidden by a tree lined front yard. The little yard in front is a nice space for walking a dog. Seemed like a nice safe area to walk to restaurants close by- I didn’t because it rained during my whole stay. There is a nice little fire pit area set up on the other side of the concrete driveway.
There were many personal touches that made the host stand out from leaving us a nice handwritten welcome note to leaving us snacks. We appreciated it all very much and made us feel welcome."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah’s place was as depicted. It met our needs for the weekend as a place to get ready and sleep for our sons wedding. It was clean and neat with most all of the amenities we needed, the exception was a full size coffee pot . We brought our own from home. The bedrooms are small and the stairs are very steep going upstairs. It would not work for anyone with any degree of mobility issues.
I found the beds to be very firm, which some prefer . Again, overall not bad for the price."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for visiting our daughter at Allegheny College. The kitchen was well stocked. The house is clean and the beds are comfortable. Highly recommend.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautifully decorated and updated home. It was a convenient location to visit my college student. We were so happy to be able to find a place that allowed us to bring our dog. The neighborhood was quiet. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Hannah went above and beyond I feel for our family. She made sure she accommodated us well into her home. She understood the length of travel and the unfortunate circumstances of why we were there.
She helped us check in early and even went out of her way to leave sympathy flowers for our loss. Thank you so much for opening your home so cozy and warm it did help keep the family together for support."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah was an amazing host - the descriptions of the property were detailed, accurate, and helpful. The check-in process was seamless as well. The property was perfect for our visit. It was extremely clean and organized, not to much the fresh linens and towels. Overall, myself and the other guests had a great visit and Hannah's property and communication were a big part of it. We would love to come back again next time we're in town!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely place to stay. Cozy and well decorated. Extra bonus was the excellent/diverse tea selection. Would recommend.
Only cons were no dishwasher, and stairs to 2nd floor were a bit steep (did have a handrail but just a word of caution for young kids/elderly) but still a great pet-friendly place to stay - and very walkable area for dogs too."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You don't want to miss Hannah's place. So much charm and very very spacious. She thought of so much and special touches in decorating. She also left much appreciated snacks.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah was absolutely wonderful. Her place was so lovely, I even extended the stay. 10/10 recommend and look forward to coming back next year."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great house, exactly as described. Wonderful space for four adults (and two dogs) to have a relaxing Thanksgiving holiday. The kitchen was well stocked with plenty of dishes and spices, etc. Super cute and comfortable home in a quiet neighborhood. Plenty of space for the dogs to wander in the yard and several decks (and a firepit) for spending time outdoors too."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"The stay was great! We loved that you had munchies and water, coffee etc. for us! Loved the personal touch and the beds were very comfortable! The noise machines were an added treat"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little house in a great location. Quiet neighborhood. Tastefully decorated. We especially loved the fire pit!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for our visit to Allegheny College. House had everything we needed to make some home cooked meals for our student. Charming and what we expected for a small town east coast house.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice place to stay. Great host and house with everything we needed.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nice house very clean. Quiet neighborhood close to everything. Has great amenities and snacks. Will stay again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfectly quiet, very sweet home close to everything in Meadville but still very private. We appreciated being able to bring our dog with us as well. Hope to stay here again when we are back in Meadville. Thank you."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The listing is exactly as described with great communication and in a very convenient location. Would stay again
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay was amazing! The place was very clean, well stocked, and cutely decorated! You could tell that everything in the house was thoroughly cleaned and well-maintained. There were complimentary snacks set out for us upon arrival. Even the next door neighbor, Mr. Jones, welcomed us and was very friendly. It was the perfect place to spend the weekend at, driving back and forth to Edinboro University for the Highland games. There were several restaurants nearby, including a Tim Horton’s! The town was very cute and felt safe. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone and we will definitely be back in the future!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was wonderful!
The house was exceptionally clean and the amenities that were provided were very thoughtful and appreciated! We enjoyed the location and the walking distance to many areas. The fire pit was awesome and the area was great for walks.
We liked the train park near the house! Great place to stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In town for a family wedding- Hannah’s place was perfect. Very clean, lots of space, and an all around lovely space. Very close to town and lots of room for parking. Highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very nice and clean! Hannah was very attentive and quick to respond during our stay. Our dogs enjoyed the house!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very clean
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,A wonderful stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow. Might be a lengthy review, but this place was great. The first thing you will notice is the cleanliness of the home along with the gorgeous way it is decorated. It’s the very definition of cute, chic, & homey.
The second thing you notice are the sweet touches Hannah has put in for her guests, down to the very snacks she left for us to munch on (chips, granola bars, cereal, candy, tea!) to the little notes around the home.
Hannah made herself available to us anytime we needed it. We were sadly coming back to Meadville for my Aunt’a funeral, & Hannah accommodated us with early check-in so we could get ready prior to the visitation after a 10 hour drive from NC.
Additionally, while we normally stay with family, I was bringing my senior dog this time, & my family here has cats that do not get along with dogs- thus, we needed an AirBnB. The home & neighborhood has ample yardage for a dog to explore & play. Sometimes you can tell if an AirBnB allows pets because it smells like animals- not Hannah’s home. It smelled amazing!!
Another thing we loved was the lock pad on the door- we felt secure & it was nice not to carry around an actual key to the home.
Finally, the neighbors are the sweetest. Mr. Jones lives in the home next door- he is so friendly, welcomed us back to Meadville, & offered sincere condolences.
We definitely will be staying here anytime we’re back in town. Thank you, Hannah!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My fiancé and I had the most wonderful time while staying here. The house is everything it’s advertised to be and more. Communication with Hannah is always available and she looks to help in anyway she can. We will definitely be coming back to stay again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was lovely. It was clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. Hannah even left some thoughtful items, such as snacks, shampoo and coffee! The main bed was very comfortable and every bedroom included a noise machine for comfort sounds at night. We loved staying here!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice property!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Exceptional. Hannah’s house was beautiful, so clean and comfortable, lovely decor. Easy to find and check in. A few extra amenities were a nice touch. She was responsive, helpful, and kind. Highly recommend if you need a place to stay in the area!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Clean nice quiet area
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great experience here. The house was very clean, and cozy. It had everything you need for your stay. The location was quiet and relaxing."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very nice and quiet place. Great Location. Hannah was very easy going and responded very quick for any questions. Would definitely recommend.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah was a very nice and responsive host. She answered any questions in a timely manner, provided everything you could need at the house, and was super kind and thoughtful! Would definitely book again in the future."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great find in Meadville! Matt is an excellent host and was very communicative. The place was adorable and super comfy!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great value for a nice house (actually bottom floor of an over/under duplex)! It had pretty much everything we needed for our stay. It could use some more lamps, especially in the bedroom I stayed in because the overhead light was way too bright for evening and there was no lamp.
As always, I explored as much of the house as I could, and I found a scary situation in the basement right below where we stayed. The flue on the gas water heater had come apart on both ends, so all the exhaust gases were pouring right into the basement, where they no doubt found their way into the living space above. I managed to reconnect it, but it needs attention from a professional who can fasten it with screws since it had none when I discovered the problem."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very kozy and convenient place!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The house is very clean and well located sl
Same the decoration only the
outside is a bit damaged by the
Demas is a magnificent house that is close to the university"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just as described, beautiful historic home. Very close to town."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family of 3 and our pooch had a very nice weekend stay at this sweet unit in Meadville. It’s nicely decorated, thoughtfully equipped, and very homey. Living room had lots of comfy and attractive seating and it was a cozy place to hang out, and we loved the natural wood trim and details throughout the place. Since we were just there for a few days, we didn’t cook any real meals, but the kitchen was well equipped and we could have easily made a nice dinner if we had wanted to. Matt was very responsive to any questions and proactive about sharing instructions and checking in with us to make sure we had everything we needed. He had great suggestions for take out the first night (Mannino’s pizza) and we had a nice pub grub meal at Julian’s the second night (a busy Saturday, so we were glad we had reserved a table)."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our stay! Matt was very helpful through out our visit. The outside of the building may seem unique but the inside was kept nice and clean. Had older characteristics that we loved!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a wonderful place to stay with our family and it is right in the middle of downtown.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Inside was pristine. It completely met our needs and it was a great spot.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was great and the host kept in contact with us through the whole process. That the instructions were very clear and useful. It was our first time traveling with our dog and he settled in very well.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Matt’s place was nicely rostered and updated, one of our favourite air bnbs. Thanks for the helpful recommendations and responsiveness!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! The house was warm, cozy and convenient. We loved the little sunroom in the mornings. Will definitely consider staying here again if ever in the area"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Matt’s place was lovely. If it hadn’t been so snowy and cold we could easily have walked into the downtown area. Very conveniently located for our needs. The place was spotless and cozy. We hope to book again when we return to Meadville. Helpful suggestions on places to eat and to get coffee.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful Experience! Matt had great communication and clear instructions. Location is a 5 min drive from Allegheny College, which was convenient.
Home is the whole first floor and you can rarely hear people walking in the 2nd floor space.
One of the beds is very firm and the other is medium firm. we did not pull out the couch bed.
Kitchen had everything we needed and was decorated nicely.
We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Matt’s place more than met our family’s needs for the holiday week… even had holiday decorations to welcome us!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was great!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful place! Thank you for checking in throughout the week to see if we needed anything.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were really pleased with this property. It was just as Matt described. It was comfortable and warm with a cozy atmosphere. We enjoyed the games and the TV. Everything we needed was provided. I loved the beautiful woodwork, the antiques and decor. The pocket doors were a nice surprise. We definitely will check in availability when we are back again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Overall, Matt’s place is a cute little stay that was cozy and made you feel right at home. We enjoyed our time staying here and would recommend it to others! If back in Meadville in the future, I’d also rent Matt’s place again.
His recommendations for spots around the home were top notch and he was a very responsive host.
Otherwise, 10/10 would recommend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"the place was awesome, we were very close to the Harper Event Venue which was very nice. Matt was an exceptional host"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is great on the inside, so don't let the outside dissuade you."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt is a nice host, and a great stay that I can have in Meadville. I will like to choose this apartment to stay again, if my client invite me to visit again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, clean, and convenient!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Matt’s place was clean, comfortable, and convenient. We stayed for one night for a last minute trip to Meadville, which we wouldn’t have been able to do if we hadn’t found Matt’s place, allowing us to bring our dogs. Matt was very friendly and responsive, and we would love to stay at his place again next time we’re in Meadville."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our group was in the Meadville area to fish Erie tributaries. So our time at the house was limited from 10pm-6am. The driveway is tight and on street parking is limited. But the house fit our needs and was comfortable.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Matt has done a nice job preparing an old property for guests. A nice touch was having multi-plug adapters to help deal with the limited electric outlets common in older homes. Wifi was excellent.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don’t judge a room by its cover. The outside of the house looks like it could use a re-do…it’s a very old house. The inside has been re-done and was spotless. They did a good job of updating while keeping the “quaintness” of the old home.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Exactly as pictured/described- more spacious than I imagined. A great stay
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home and design. Very comfortable beds and plenty of space. Matt is a responsive host.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Everything went fine overall. I would rent from Matt again. There was little outside light (no bulb in the lamppost). Although the house was clean it shows its age. No coffee in the house. Good mattresses and quiet neighborhood. We got a good night's sleep which is what we needed most.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt was just great! He was perfectly communicative. The property was exactly as described, very clean, thoughtfully planned and decorated nicely."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is located in a pleasant residential neighborhood set back from the street. As a single woman traveler I felt safe during my stay. The apartment was comfortable and well-appointed with many pleasant, thoughtful touches, like a Brita water filter in the fridge. It was a great price with no hidden added fees (which I have recently been caught out by with other Airbnbs). I would recommend and would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt was an excellent host, and we had the most wonderful experience staying at his place!
He communicated with us throughout our time there in a helpful way, and his restaurant recommendations were amazing, especially the Kettle Lake Kitchen!
Matt’s place is exquisitely remodeled to provide for modern needs but still celebrates the unique design of these older houses!
We can’t recommend his place highly enough.
Thank you Matt!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The home was beautiful and Matt was very welcoming.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"the only regret i have is that i didnt stay long enough! matts place is beautiful, spotless, and full of all the essentials. i loved everything about the home from the antique accents to the modern updates. by the way, the bed in the back bedroom is SO comfortable! my friend actually wrote down the mattress brand so he could get one for his new apartment lol. i would definitey recommend staying here to anyone."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our house was easy to find and the upstairs neighbors were very respectful. The parking was good for 3 but a little tight for the boat and truck but doable. We really liked the house. It is an older home but that’s what we have. Easy to get around inside and the bathroom was very nice. Clean and comfortable and the beds were great. Matt was very communicative and concerned about our needs if any. Highly rated all around.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and Matt was an extremely responsive host.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable stay. Large space and well thought out.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, very helpful and responsive when I need for anything!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Matt’s Airbnb! It was the perfect distance from the wedding we attended, very clean and homey. It was a little noisy as the Airbnb was the second floor of a house and you could hear the upstairs inhabitants. Overall it was a great experience and Matt was very responsive host. Would definitely recommend his Airbnb!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We went to visit our daughter at Allegheny Collage and loved the house and location
Excellent pillows and mattresses. The decor is very nice and was prepared with details such as sugar, salt, cleaning supplies, etc.
Everything there was very helpful
We want to rent again next time we visit !!
Thanks Matt for everything"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Would stay there again for sure
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Meadville!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This vintage home was a perfect place for my overnight stay in Meadville. I loved the beautiful wooden doors, floors and wainscoting. Add to that the exposed brick living room fireplace and kitchen chimney, along with a mix of vintage and modern furnishings and you have a wonderful cozy atmosphere. The bathroom was clean and modern. Although I didn’t use the kitchen, it was clean and appeared to have all the necessities. I’d stay here again if I ever need a place to stay in Meadville again. And Matt was very quick to respond to any of my questions!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, clean and spacious house."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was ideal for our stay.
The house upgraded where necessary.
The beds were exceptionally and we would like to know the manufacturer.
We were very pleased"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute, spacious, great location! Apartment was exactly like the photos and very clean and comfortable. Matt was very responsive and was able to accommodate an early check-in for us so we could get ready for our 5pm event.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was described perfectly. We felt at home and will always use Matt’s place when visiting Meadville.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We have stayed here before and as always, have felt quite welcome here. It has almost become a home away from home for us! In fact, this last visit we hosted four of our children's families for a belated yet very joyful Christmas celebration.
Matt is an awesome host - readily available by phone and very proactive toward any issues. The home is very clean and well-kept with extra steps being taken to sanitize in light of today's health concerns. It is animal friendly, and our two dogs are very comfortable here. The housekeeper showed us linens that can be used to cover the usual white bedding and we bring extra furniture coverings as well. We truly love this place and would recommend it highly."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! Easy to find and affordable. Cozy little town. Would loved to stay longer. Thanks for sharing your lovely home with us:)

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The pictures depicting the furniture and decor were spot on. I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was, given how close the houses are and the potential upstairs apartment. I never heard a peep. The water pressure and temperature in the shower were fantastic... always a gamble in older homes. It was hard to find in the dark, so I suggest some additional lighting outside."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Amazing house, host and location. We can't say enough about Matt and how he went above and beyond any expectations we could've had. We were stranded for a few days after our original reservation, Matt jumped into action to help make anything possible easier for us. Also, we loved Meadville, it has such great character. We will most definitely stay here again"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough about our Host. Matt was absolutely delightful ! Prompt at answering any inquiries; or questions. He made sure to check in with us frequently, - ensuring that we always felt at home. The house interior is gorgeous. I love houses with character and this vintage home has all the authentic touches , with exposed original brick; panel doors between rooms; woodworking and beautiful long plank flooring. This home definitely has that 19th century vibe. I would highly recommend. We will book with Matt again should our travels have us back in Meadville in the future."

All around a nice stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"if this location meets your needs, I don't think you can do much better than Matt's place.
I looked at a ton of listings within 10 miles or so of this property, and nothing held a candle to this location, especially at this price point. Well done. Lots of cute touches. At the time of my stay there were a few small children living upstairs, that at times sounded like a herd of elephants on my head, but that is a MINOR nit pick. You will love this place!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful, clean and adorable! We love staying here!"

Matt is an incredibly attentive host and was in touch with via the AirBnb app throughout our stay to make sure we were comfortable and that our trip in town was going smoothly. Not only is he attentive and kind, but he is also incredible accommodating! We requested a last minute late-checkout due to changes in our plans, and Matt was quick to shuffle around some things to accommodate our need to check out a few hours past 11. Truly a 5-star experience, and will be booking with him again the next time we come to town."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were so happy to stay at Paula’s place when we were in the area for a family funeral. It was the perfect location for where we needed to be and accommodated our needs above and beyond! The house is spotless clean and immaculate. Very well stocked kitchen with good quality items that made you feel at home, not at a temporary rental. We loved all the extra rooms and spaces for gathering and sitting to visit and play games or have your morning coffee. They paid a lot of attention to detail with each of the rooms and you can feel it. Would love to stay there again if we need to!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! The home is gorgeous and surrounded by beautiful woods that make you truly feel at home. My favorite room in the home was the sun room. I could have spent the whole time there!

2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Our family found this house to be a warm and welcoming retreat, providing the ideal space for us to gather around the kitchen table, share meals, and connect. Its proximity to restaurants and stores, satisfying my mom's Tim Hortons coffee cravings, was a convenient perk, while the private setting allowed us to come and go without any disruption.
The picturesque scenery added a delightful backdrop to our coffee moments. The house was thoughtfully stocked with everything we could possibly need, including practical items like an iron and hairdryer, and the cleanliness was impeccable. Even with a baby in tow, the comfortable linens and baby-friendly environment made for a worry-free stay.
Paula's sweetness and proactive communication further enhanced our experience. A solid 10/10 recommendation – it truly exceeded our expectations!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Marion's place was just what we needed for a brief weekend to visit friends. It's a small apartment, but still the perfect amount of space for 2 people. Marion was a wonderful and accommodating host, and we especially appreciated the complimentary scones!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Marion is a kind and diligent host. They were descriptive and attentive to the space while also having the guests priority.

We will be recommending it to our folks in the future."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apt was perfect for a visit to my daughter at Allegheny College which was just a few minutes away. Bed was a little firm for my taste but it was in good shape. I could not find the shampoo or body soap which the listing stated there should be. To be fair though it was early in the morning when I noticed and I did not have time to reach out to Marion to ask about it or fix the situation.
It is a simple no frills place but very serviceable for a quick weekend. There is a full fridge, microwave, 2 burner stove and toaster oven. Marion very nicely left scones, yogurt, strawberries and juice in the fridge. I would stay again when I am in the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It felt like my own little apartment, very comfortable. Marion was also super helpful on how to find the place and left snacks and drinks for me! :)"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My two friends and I stayed in Marion's upstairs apartment while in town for a memorial service. The apartment was cozy and appeared as advertised; we knew the kitchenette would be small, but with a little ambition we were able to cook a simple meal and entertain an additional (4th) friend as a guest one night. Marion was responsive, attentive to our needs, and accommodating of my odd travel constraints as they pertained to my check-in time in particular. The apartment was located within a convenient driving distance of downtown Meadville, and not a bad walking distance either. All in all, it was a great place to stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marion greeted me even though it was many hours after check-in. Her instructions were clear and helpful. I loved being walking distance to the college in downtown!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay here and it was lovely. We were there for a weekend event at the college and the location was perfect for us. Marion is very kind and welcoming and I look forward to staying here again in the future.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy and clean 2nd floor quaint apartment. We were bike touring and able to store our bikes in the garage. Downtown Meadville was about a 20-minute walk away and the neighborhood itself was quiet. Breakfast included homemade banana bread, apples, Greek yogurt, oatmeal, cereal, milk, orange juice, and coffee, which was so nice to have before continuing our journey. Host Marion was kind and communicated well."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great stay. The place fit the description and was a great value. Host always checked in, and was very accommodating. She was quick to respond if I had any questions. We felt right at home. Will stay again!"

I asked to extend as I was there to drop off my son at Allegheny College and she did for one day as that is all she had available. This really helped us out, she is very sweet. I would stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My second stay with Marion! Very welcoming and great value. Generous and communicative host.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an older attic apartment but efforts were made to make it look better. There is only a wall unit air conditioner in the living room with futon, but bedroom with ceiling fan comfortable at night. Kitchen was well stocked, and breakfast food provided. Only had 4 cup coffeemaker. No shampoo provided but we had brought some. Stairs to the unit were narrow. Was able to park car in a garage. Communication was excellent. Quiet, pretty neighborhood."

I have spotty service in the area & showed up way too early & wasn't able to load the check in info, but Marion kindly directed me to a few areas I could wander while I waited for actual check in time (places which I'd missed when I was actually living here!). Really nice area, very comfortable rooms, and a quick shot to anywhere in town or the school up the hill."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came to meadville for Allegheny renunion! Apartment was just what we needed, quiet, close, private. Was a little worried about an older home, but everything was very clean. Way better than the local hotels!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the second time I have stayed at Marion's place. This is an upstairs apartment in a home that was built in 1900 or so. I love old houses, and this apartment is delightful. It is clean and comfortable and quiet. The bed is super comfortable as well. Marion is friendly and always leaves a lovely breakfast in the fridge. On this visit, she left homemade scones, fruit, juice, yogurt, and granola. There is also tea and coffee.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I needed a place to stay near downtown Meadvillle, as I was in town for my high school reunion. It was a perfect location and a great value. It was nice to park my car in a garage, too. Marion left delicious blueberry scones, as well as milk, juice, yogurt, oatmeal, and cereal. I’m not a coffee drinker, but there was plenty of that as well. The note on the counter had clear instructions for checkout, as well as a welcome to help myself to the goodies. I’ll check availability again next time I’m in town."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was just what we needed!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marion was kind, her scones were delish! and she left the kitchen well set with coffee, tea and breakfast items. The bed was comfortable and garage parking right outside the door was appreciated.
This hundred-year-old house is located on a quiet street in a residential area, an easy hop off I-79. It is walkable to Allegheny (as long as you don't mind hills!), downtown and the historic Baldwin-Reynolds House Museum.
I see only one negative review and perhaps that person was expecting posh. That it isn't. The house is as-described and the pictures represent it well. Everything was very clean and comfortable - I'd be happy to stay at Marion's again."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"The accomodations are as pictured. Cozy and clean, convenient location. Marion gives excellent directions for finding the location. I want to mention one thing for future guests. There is A/C in the living room and on a hot day it's quite comfortable in that room. But that is the only A/C in the apartment. The bedroom and kitchen were quite warm even with the living room A/C running. This isn't a complaint but just a heads up to others if you might be staying on a hot day. We ended up having to cut our trip short for personal reasons but if we had slept the night we would have slept on the living room futon instead of the bedroom just due to A/C. Otherwise I thought the space was perfectly fine."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house with some history! Very clean and cozy! All the amenities!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great communication on very short notice. Close to a grocery store and coffee shop. Surprisingly private for an apt. And you can't beat the price! note that there is no TV, but great wifi(ipads and laptops worked perfectly)"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location near the college and nice place to land if you're at Allegheny for a few days. Apartment is small and quirky (which should be no surprise to anyone with even a glancing familiarity with Meadville housing stock) but *scrupulously* clean. Many thoughtful touches (like delicious homemade scones), excellent communication, great experience overall. Will definitely book this again next reunion weekend."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marion's place is super cute and comfy! It is my kind of place. I had everything I needed. Even though I ate out a lot, the kitchen is all set for cooking. I appreciated all the breakfast options, including homemade chocolate banana bread! It was also nice to have coffee before heading out. The bed and pillows were comfortable. I slept so well. The kitchen table was great for a game of cards one night and the desk was perfect more some quick, work emails. It is close to the campus of Allegheny College. I recommend staying here if you are in the area. I will return if back in the area."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed over a week,"This apartment was just what we needed for our trip. We stayed with our six month old and had a lovely time being so close to the downtown, and we enjoyed the treats Marion left for us!"

Do not judge the accommodation by the entry staircase which is well used. The kitchen was & bathroom were well stocked & clean. Clean bedding & towels were supplied for our 2 week stay. Thank you Marion."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed a wonderful stay in this quaint home near the Allegheny campus. It was wonderful having little treats Marion left for us to enjoy in the kitchen.
2021-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Great price, communication, flexibility, and location. I wasn't able to get the shower water to a desirably hot level and the apartment took a while to get to the desired temperature. Otherwise, I enjoyed my stay and I will plan to stay there again for my next visit to Meadville."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A great find! Comfortable and a perfect location while visiting the college. Scones were a delicious extra. If our HS senior ends up at this college next year we will be back!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Apartment was just a described. Marion goes the extra mile with her baked treats and variety of breakfast choices she leaves for you. We were visiting for a football game at the college and the location was perfect. Thank you
2021-10-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Very disappointed in the apartment, ended up staying in a motel down the street."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed one night,This B&B is a cute little Suite in the upstairs of an old house which was just perfect for our one night stay. Communication with Marion was a pleasure. I would definitely stay here again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Marion’s apartment is very close and convenient to the Allegheny College campus. Very tidy and perfect for an overnight stay in Meadville. Will definitely return!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,A very quiet room which provides a good sleep. Scones wait for you in the morning. Delicious. Very close to the business district of Meadville. And a garage for your car. Recommend.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, nice host."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The apt is immaculate with many nice touches. Highly recommend!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Marion is a great host and the description of the upstairs apartment is very accurate. Accommodations are basic but very clean. The bed was firm and quite comfortable. The extra breakfast items were greatly appreciated.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Check in was such a warm welcome, the communication was clear, and she made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Absolutely fantastic host!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very lovely place, has everything you need and more"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,An Old Victorian house with all the odd corners and narrow steeper stairs you’d expect! An apartment snuggled into the second floor with wonderful children’s stories on the shelf and if you as lucky as we were fresh baked goods to sample. Near (a good hilly walk) to the college and Lucy’s laundry. Don’t forget to visit Kettle Lake Kitchen for the best tasty food in Meadville (old Market House location).
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"both beds were made up, lovely fresh scones prepared, great breakfast, highly recommend"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay, in an upstairs apartment. It felt loved. Very well furnished in the kitchen (plates, bowls, mugs, glassware, flatware, pots & pans, etc.). We enjoyed with many good foods (fruit, oatmeal, etc.) and fixings for hot drinks that she left for us. We especially enjoyed the zucchini bread that Marion baked special for us. The microwave oven takes a bit longer to cook, due to lower Watts than at our house. The shower worked well, the bedroom was spacious with a bed light. We really appreciated the air conditioner in the living room. We also have This End Up couches at home, but this is the first one I've seen with a foldout bed. The garage supports charging up (slowly) our electric car, very handy."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,A comfortable apartment in an old Victorian house. The best equipped kitchen and pantry we've ever seen in Airbnbs.
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Marion is an excellent hostess. Inside the apartment was very tidy and clean. The entry and stairs were not as clean - so get inside before making judgement. It’s a simple apartment, just like advertised with quite a bit of room. AC kept us cool in July. Very comfortable all around.
Marion makes sure you have more than you need and it’s really appreciated."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little apartment. Located within walking distance of Allegheny College. The space is basic, functional and clean."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marion was a great host. A real mother's touch to the place, very clean and she always responded quickly. It was a pleasure to rent from her. Her efforts to make my stay the best it could be showed in every way. Very thankful."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Marion's place was perfect for our stay. The selection of breakfast options, the wifi, the location - all great. We appreciated having the garage to park in (and the salted/shoveled driveway and walkway) when it snowed. The apartment stayed warm and cozy, with comfortable beds and bedding. Not to mention the homemade baked goods! Highly recommended."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication, really lovely and good location"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cute little 1 bedroom flat with a small kitchen in an old Voctorian. Everything we needed for a short visit to check out the local college. Would stay again!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Marion is very kind! She baked homedade muffins that were left in the fridge along with some other items for breakfast. She also was very friendly and talked with us both on our way in and out. The rooms were in an upstairs apt, so you do need carry items up a tight staircase. Older house so a little drafty but there were plenty of blankets. There is no tv, however there are a few books and games I loved all of the little touches in the kitchen that made the space feel homey. We had a lovely stay and would definitely stay again if we are in the area."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marion had homebaked scones and other goodies for us. The space was comfortable, sort of European feel to it. Would definately go back."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, very comfortable, super sweet special touches like homemade muffins as fresh a long drive and hot cocoa. Larger than expected."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay near the college
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful! Marion made us homemade scones for breakfast and the apartment was very comfortable. We definitely enjoyed our stay! 5 stars!!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Miss Marion was very sweet and excellent to work with! We were able to check in early so we could freshen up and get to a family wedding in town on time! We were only in for one night but she stocked up the little kitchenette for us with homemade muffins, fruit, granola, yogurt, juice, and coffee: a perfect morning recovery after a long night of dancing and drinking! The room would be perfect for a longer stay in town, or even for a student at Allegheny just up the hill!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a nice, roomy place. Clean, well furnished, and breakfast!!! The steps are steep, but worth the walk up. Would gladly stay here again."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing
2020-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Marion’s place was spotless, easy to navigate and served our purpose. Marion was extremely communicative both before, during and after our stay. The breakfast items she had placed in our refrigerator shot the overall value of our stay out of the park! The only downside, by no fault of Marion’s, was the noise of the traffic both late night and early morning on the bypass nearby. I should have brought earplugs."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marion was very welcoming and had a lot of local tips set out for us. The fresh blueberry scones was a thoughtful touch and she also had the kitchen very well stocked. 10 out if 10 we would stay there again.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marion is very pleasant.. the house is beautiful and thr location is close to everything. We loved it and hated to leave
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My mom had the most amazing experience. She enjoyed the shopping locally near by and how quiet it was there! Thank you for your hospitality and sharing your home with my mom!
2020-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Appreciated being able to park in the open garage. Those stairs up to the place are very narrow as stated—she wasn’t joking. The neighborhood is kinda rundown and the place is old but it’s clean and the continental breakfast items were a super-nice touch. Worth the price.
2020-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Older home. Stairs were steep as is described but hand rail was difficult to grip.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A fun, retro experience!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Marion was a wonderful host. She worked with us during a difficult family situation and was very helpful. She made sure that all our needs were taken care of and her house is conveniently located to everything in Meadville. I would highly recommend.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marion is top notch! So kind! Very friendly! Great communication! This is our second stay in her apartment and we feel so comfortable there. Great location to Allegheny College. Ample space in the apartment. Great value! And let me tell you - the breakfast items provided are so VERY much appreciated! Muffins and scones are better than a downtown bakery! Thank you Marion! See ya again!!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was quite delightful!
All of the personal touches of milk, OJ, yogurt and muffins made our stay even better!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Marion is so easy to work with, and did so many thoughtful things for my stay. The place is exactly as described. I will come again."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location for an overnight before an Allegheny College visit - excellent value, too! The garage was spacious, and easy to park in. The place was just as described, and the directions for check-in easy to follow. Marion said hi as we were heading out for dinner (to a really great Italian place - Chovy's? - nearby). Bed was a little hard for our taste, but everything else was really comfortable. Marion provided us with scones, milk, cereal, coffee, oatmeal packets - more than we expected for an easy breakfast in the room. The place is small, as described, but thoughtfully arranged and quite comfortable. I'd go back in a heartbeat."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marion's home is cool and kitchy and Marion is very warm and welcoming. We were so grateful and surprised by the wonderful cranberry scones, butter, two types of milk, orange juice, coffee, delicious yoghurt for every day we were scheduled to stay. Marion's home is in an area of fantastic, huge old homes. We cannot wait to return!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very convenient location with lovely touches. Great communication and immaculate apartment. Highly recommend!

2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Best air bnb experience so far. Was pretty straight forward and easy.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment is very neat and clean.You can put your vehicle in the garage and it only a short walk to the apartment. You have a kitchen, bathroom, livingroom and bedroom sleeps 4 and In a nice neighborhood."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marion's place is perfectly situated btwn the Allegheny College campus and downtown Meadville - everything is in walking distance. I've stayed a few times at Marion's. I park my car in the provided garage space and leave it there until I'm ready to leave Meadville. Marion always leaves homemade fresh baked goods, all the coffee/tea supplies you need and other breakfast/snack food. This accommodation is very thoughtful. There are always extra towels and blankets, generous amounts of toilet paper. I've never felt that supplies are 'rationed'. We typically cook at least 1 meal/day during our stays. The kitchen has everything you need to cook basic meals. This is becoming out home away from home when in Meadville. Thanks Marion!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Marion's place is perfect for us when visiting our daughter at AC! The location is superb! Apartment is much larger than we anticipated and the extra space is a welcomed plus! Marion was very helpful with her excellent communication and kind greeting when we arrived. And most of all - the breakfast items, including homemade scones and muffins are TOP NOTH and appreciated! Thanks Marion. Hope to see you again!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very nice quiet place to stay. All the practical essentials of a small apartment and thoughtful host. Perfect host to guest interaction. Plenty of room to relax and recover from a day of activity.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great help, warm welcome, home baked blueberry scones!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first Airbnb experience. If all hosts are like Marion, sign me up! The apartment was great. There were so many pluses: location is close to everything, very clean, super comfortable bed, lots of nice touches like snacks, juice, and filtered water. A total bonus were all of the breakfast items provided, especially the homemade scones! Marion was so nice, available but respectful of your space. I can't say enough good things about my weekend there. Thanks, Marion!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a lovely stay at Marion’s house. The location was perfect and she included some special touches that made the stay even more enjoyable. Her communication was timely and simple to understand. We would recommend staying here while in Meadville.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marion’s Place is perfect for long stays or short! There is a little living room, a bedroom, a bathroom and a cute little kitchen with an eating bar! The place is very clean and is in a nice area of town, and everything was well thought out and taken care of. She provided a delicious breakfast, and was incredibly sweet to talk to you! I would definitely stay here again!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice clean quiet apartment in an old home, steep stairs to climb, so keep in mind, but garage parking, in a quiet neighbourhood. Will stay again"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marion is a great host who provides a comfortable place to stay and plenty of goodies for her guests.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,You can expect great hospitality. A very clean apartment with everything you need. There are fairly steep narrow stairs to go up as it is an old house. You also get to park in a garage.
2019-05-01,3,Stayed one night,The house is old but clean. Breakfast was a thoughtful touch.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Marion has a nice apartment, provides snacks and breakfast and made wonderful muffins for us. We appreciated the little extras. It was as described and what we needed for our short stay."

2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at Marion’s place and would recommend her place to others. Really enjoyed having coffee, fruit, and breakfast items available for us each morning. Walking distance to town and lots of places to eat. Marion is a great host and very hospitable."
2019-03-01,4,Stayed one night,A clean space in a historic home. It was exactly what our family needed for our stay in Meadville. I especially appreciate the local dining suggestions and the generous breakfast items left for us. Marion was very responsive.
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Second time staying here...would be a few more when I’m in the area but she books up fast—and there’s a reason why: her place is great! Always clean, always a wonderful host. I’ll be back...if I can get in before she books up!!"

2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Older home, but quite comfortable, including thermostat. Host is thoughtful and responsive. Generously provided fruit for snacking and great breakfast items, with juice, coffee, and milk. Chobani yogurt (my favorite). Looking forward to our next trip!"
2018-12-01,4,Stayed one night,Lovely spot near some of the tasty bits of Meadville! The breakfast Marion provides is lovely!
2018-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Marion’s place is clean and comfortable, and has all the necessary amenities. Good WIFI signal. She greeted us as we arrived and settled in. Was perfect for our brief overnight stay. Home baked goodies were a nice treat!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Marion’s place is in the heart of Meadville. Close to everything. Marion made us delicious pumpkin scones. We appreciated the extra touches of kindness. It was a great place for the my husband and two boys.
2018-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This home is exactly as described. It’s comfortable but not luxury very pleasant and close to the college

2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The perfect stay for our weekend. Comfortable, convenient and plenty of space. Marion was a great host!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space! Exactly what I was looking for
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I loved our one night stay at the victorian house. It was very cute! Marion was very nice and kept us informed about parking and arrival. She gave us some tips on new places to try in Meadville, which was very kind. And she left us a variety of breakfast options, the scones she had when we were there were delicious! She made us feel very comfortable. Everything was clean and well prepared, and it was nice to know that she was closeby if we needed anything. Thanks for the great stay, Marion!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a nice, clean place. Entrance way well lit. Nice to park in garage. Marion had beverages and many breakfast items out. Great communication (even reached out to me to let me know we left something behind). Bed was comfortable. Nice, easy drive to Erie. Would definitely stay here again."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Marion was absolutely wonderful. She allows you to park in the garage which really adds to how safe you feel at her Victorian house. She balances the perfect amount of support while not being overwhelming. When you arrive here, it will be around the side of the house and up a steep set of stairs. You have a small kitchenette which she includes several of the things that you would need in such as yogurt, milk, some fruit, and cereal. Fantastic choice for Voodoo brewery or commons and downtown. Great stay!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"It suited our needs perfectly for our one night, brief stay. It was great to have all that we needed for breakfast (plus homemade scones!) available, as we were pressed for time. While it is an older apartment with a small kitchen, it is kept well cleaned and space is organized. Communication was great too."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location is exactly as stated and is great having a garage for the vehicle and so close to town and still easy to the interstate.

2018-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"I was in town for a wedding, and Marion’s place was in very close proximity. My boyfriend and I appreciated the small touches and quiet space, although we weren’t able to find silverware to eat the lovely breakfast foods with."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Good value apartment with many thoughtful touches, including lots of breakfast food."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great locations. Close to the Allegeny college. The kitchen is well furnished. It's very convenient to cook occasionally. The room is enough big, clean and good.
Marion is very kind and a good baker. She was very busy and took the time to cook us some really good snacks. My son likes to taste it. She gives me many advices. Great thanks. Hope to see you again."
2018-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Breakfast options were great. Very basic apartment but good for the price. Very clean.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Marion offers a pleasant and relaxing little apartment in Meadville. My family and I were in town for a wedding, and her apartment was perfect for us since it is centrally located, and it was a nice clean and quiet place to return to after the busyness of our days. She was attentive to our needs and even thoughtfully provided a nice little array of breakfast foods and snacks. Thank you Marion for helping our visit to Meadville go so smoothly, and helping us feel comfortable in a home away from home!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful host, after arrival and check in instructions Marion greeted us and offered fresh cut watermelon. :-) very clean, feels like home away from home. Thanks you, Marion!"
2018-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"This was a very convenient place to stay for visiting Allegheny College. It’s no more than 5 minutes to campus. Marion communicated effectively in advance. The apartment itself was clean. I have stayed in other AirB&Bs that were more homey and well-appointed. If this were a hotel property based on five stars, it would be a 2-3 star property in terms of amenities and overall feel. It’s more like the feel of a motel. I travel extensively and that’s what it felt like to me — solid but very basic. Unlike most hotels, however, Marion provided wonderful homemade bread and great breakfast options in the fridge."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,It’s clean and the thoughtful touches for breakfast are wonderful. Marion is a wonderful host.
2018-07-01,4,Stayed one night,No
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I have never used AirBnB, so to say we were skeptical is an understatement. However, we could not have had a more perfect first experience. Marion made sure everything was a breeze from check-in, snacks (scones, juices, milk, and water), recommendations in the area, and just a friendly chat. Marion’s place is perfectly situated to the point that walking to Meadville is both easy and enjoyable. The apartment was absolutely spotless. If we ever find ourselves back in the area, we will definitely take advantage of Marion’s hospitality and amenities again!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice to have a garage to park in, with unpacking and packing, we didn’t have to really worry about rain or snow. Marion had breakfast foods and drinks provided. We had to get to an event early so that was especially helpful to get us there on time. Very clean and nice space to stay. We loved it and recommend this place with 5 stars!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Marion is a wonderful host! Loved the scones and breakfast provided!
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marion’s place was exactly as stated and even more. The house says it is old and while that’s true, Marion had touches in the apt that were perfect for our stay. The place was clean, banana chocolate chip bread, fruit, yogurt, coffee etc in the fridge as well as other breakfast foods available. This was great for us so we didn’t need to rush out and find breakfast. Fresh flowers were nice too. We were able to put our car in the garage and it was rainy so appreciated that. Great value, close to town where we went to have dinner."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The apartment is amazingly cozy, I like the layout. Unlike places of this day and age. Would surely stay again when coming by this way!"
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Understand that this is an older home with a steep flight of stairs to get to the apartment. But once you're in the apartment you're sure to appreciate just how much Marion goes out of her way to make your stay stellar. She absolutely blew us away and she knocked it out of the park. We will definitely re-book if ever in the area again!
2018-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Good value, cozy place, the continental breakfast was very nicely done and a nice treat during our stay. Comfortable and basically as advertised."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was perfect for us. We were traveling with our bikes and could store them safely in a garage. The town was interesting to walk around in too. But Marion herself won us over. She was so gracious and thoughtful--leaving whole milk in the fridge since she knew we were traveling with our toddler. I would drive out of the way to stay there on another trip.
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location...Marion is a sweetheart!
2018-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What can I say other than this place is perfect. Marion offers all you could ask for and then some. I forgot a ziplock bag for some of my food to store and she even had those for us to use! Treats in the fridge were an added touch which we loved. The place was clean and oh so cute. It was perfect for our visit to Allegheny college and if I become an Allegheny Mom, you can bet I’m going to look to stay here again. Thanks for a wonderful stay-you’re truly a gem!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean, comfortable place. Bed was very comfy . Large selection of breakfast stuff. Nice to have a garage to park your car in. Marion was a wonderful host."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy and accommodating, comfy bed!!"
2018-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Marion is a delightful host and her space is amazing. The bed was comfortable, the space was spacious, super clean and there were lots of great breakfast items in the refrigerator. The homemade scones were absolutely delicious! The location to downtown and Allegheny College was awesome. I would stay there again for sure!"
2018-01-01,4,Stayed one night,Great location if visiting Allegheny College.
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very good
2017-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great communication with our unexpected change in plans! ...was glad to hear Marion came out to greet my future daughter in law when she arrived. Marion is a great hostess
2017-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Marion couldn't have been a better host, everything was perfect. My family and I had a late check in due to flight conditions so it was a very nice surprise when Marion greeted us. The house is just that, an old Victorian, but very warm and comfortable, not over done. Marion provided us with everything you could ask for, even baking blueberry scones a nice treat to go along with the hot chocolate for my son. A simple fruit basket was also welcomed after long day of travel. Our family would absolutely stay again with our next visit and would recommend her place to anyone traveling."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for Allegheny graduation. The house was perfect—a short walk up the hill to campus. Very clean and comfortable. Two notes: the stairs to the bedrooms are steep and some guests may not appreciate the Christian message decor.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was nice and clean. I very much appreciated the no-shoe rule, and it was reflected in the condition of the floors. There were some toys and books for young children, which my son enjoyed. There is no television or toiletries — not a criticism, just an FYI to pack accordingly. But if you forget anything or want to cook, local grocery stores are nearby. The hosts welcomed us with a personal handwritten note, which was a nice touch.
Our visit was short (eclipse weekend!) and we spent much of our time out of the house, which is why my review is short. We enjoyed our stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place to hang out with co-teachers over a teachers conference weekend. Very gorgeous and welcoming space. Lots of updated features to a very uniquely old house. Thanks for the cookies and the other accommodations!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great place, will book again."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,This was our second time staying here and it was great. Our son is a student at Allegheny and this is the perfect place to relax as a family while visiting! Thank you...we plan to come back many times over the next four years.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I lived just a couple blocks aways from this home over a decade when I went to Allegheny College. This Airbnb was absolutely perfect! Very cozy, yet spacious. Incredibly clean and homey. A lot of really nice touches that made it a wonderful experience. The hosts wrote us a handwritten note and left us home baked cookies when we arrived! I hope to book this home for a longer stay when I return to Meadville next fall!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,The house was beautiful!! Everything was just as described on the listing. Lots of room and space in the living space to eat and hang out together while at the same time allowing privacy with multiple bedrooms and bathroom. will definitely come back !
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was very homey! We stayed here to move our daughter into college at Allegheny. It is a little more than a 10 minute walk to campus but still very easy to get there. There was plenty of room for all of us and it felt just like home. They had EVERYTHING we could have needed and even extras if something was forgotten. It is a great place to stay!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We can’t say enough about this wonderful place! Better than the pictures even! VERY spacious and VERY clean! The hosts were super kind and accommodating! I thought we would be lost not having a TV there but they had lots of toys for my 4yo and many games and puzzles for us which was just what we needed! We connected and where unplugged for those few days! It was perfect! My teenagers didn’t even mind not watching the tube! It was a quiet neighborhood which made it easy to relax. I would say bring your lawn chairs and sit out by the fire pit. We didn’t bring any and they offered us theirs!! So sweet!! Unlike some Airbnb’s where you have to bring your own TP and bedding, Townhouse on Lord had everything you need and so neatly organized! They even had a diffuser on when we walked in, so it smelled wonderful.
We had a wedding so really have no need to go back there BUT might make up a reason just to stay again!! It was incredibly enjoyable and we wish we could’ve stayed longer!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We truly enjoyed our experience while in Meadville this past week. We were dropping our freshman son off at Allegheny College where he will be joining the men's golf team and this home was a perfect transition location for our family. There is lots of room to spread out or to play board games together for some good family time and the kitchen is wonderful! We have already booked our next trip for September at this same location. Bill B. - Montrose, Colorado"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean and inviting with fresh flowers and cookies on the dining room table! They kept us updated and messaged to make sure we had what we needed, and what check-in and check-out should look like. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot. No central air but 3 wall units that make it plenty cool enough on a hot day. There are no tvs in the house but it was very cozy and welcoming.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great location for anyone visiting Meadville. The downtown area is an easy 10-15 min walk and the home is on a quiet street. Everything was very clean and organized in the home and we could not have asked for a better stay.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,This was a welcomed and comfortable respite during our visit. Great setting and would definitely revisit again next time in the area.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were very satisfied with the place. The best thing about the place was that it was very kid friendly. Kids loved the toys and the hammock.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"The ""Townhouse on Lord"" struck the perfect balance between simplicity and homey. It was immaculately clean yet it still felt cozy, with bookshelves and plants. The hosts thought of everything, even having cookies at the house when we arrived."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for Allegheny's graduation. We loved that this beautiful home was walking distance from campus, yet also on a quiet, peaceful street!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Host was very communicative and everything was exactly as advertised. Some homemade cinnamon rolls and a nice note we’re there on arrival. Recommend to all
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location and house.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We were amazed at the incredible log cabin. The family handcrafted the home which took years to complete and it's like a magazine photo promotion-absolutely beautiful. The acreage is so peaceful and enjoyable to walk through-stream, pond, beautiful woods etc. It was a great relaxing getaway for our family. Chad responded quickly to all my questions. Only wish we had more time to spend there. I'd be willing to bet the fall colors in those incredible woods would be incredible."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"A gem of a home on a beautiful property. I stayed a long weekend with my husband and three friends during the eclipse. The cabin itself is spacious yet cozy, and was stocked with everything we needed for meals and rest. The surrounding land and property is gorgeous and quiet - we took walks by the creek, to the pond, and up through the woods. Good groceries and a local brewery in nearby Meadville kept us stocked. All around a great stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin! Perfect for a few days away with colleagues. The fireplace, living space was amazing for conversation, games, and relaxing. Perfect example of higher end B and B cabins. Wonderful experience and highly recommend."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful Host. Only downside was internet and phone service was not good. We couldn’t connect phones or laptops and cell service kept going to SOS. But we were there to relax and enjoy the surroundings so we walk the beautiful property. The house was wonderful and hosts were great. We enjoyed the fireplace and having Christmas morning in front of the fireplace was amazing!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed the serene isolated property. Lots of room to run around for the kids, indoors and out. They have baby gates and loads of other awesome amenities. A great little get away !! We’ll be back !"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at the cabin! It was quiet, peaceful, and relaxing! Beautiful space to walk and explore outside, too! Host was super responsive if we needed anything! We will be back to stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,What an incredibly beautiful location and house! We really appreciated the stories you shared about the history of this house and family retreat. Hiking around the pond and in the woods provided us with a peaceful and energetic weekend. We certainly would love to return here someday. Thanks!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rented the airbnb for a ""get ready"" house prior to my wedding. This house is beautiful inside and out. Clean, plenty of space, just wonderful. We would rent it again and again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just a Wonderful place to spend time with the Family. When you learn about the family and how the property was built , it will make sense why . Chad was a perfect responsive host . If you want a awesome house and beautiful space to roam . Book this “Dano” . You won’t regret it . Young people probably do not know “Dano”
So Book a stay !"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful property! Very clean and well maintained. Perfect for our stay and near to where we needed to be but quiet and peaceful area. I would definitely recommend for a get away!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you for sharing our home with us! It was the absolute best weekend being together as a family :) your cabin felt so cozy and the property is beautiful!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This property is a hidden gem! The cabin is rich with family history and the grounds were great for exploring. Every amenity was provided: fully-appointed and well-stocked kitchen, ample outdoor seating, and an inviting firepit set within the trees. We made some great memories here: we spotted many deer and heard much wildlife, my dad taught my daughter how to fish in the pond, we heard owls while sitting around the firepit, and we even saw a bald eagle fly over. We were able to have a very relaxing and peaceful family getaway. I imagine the property would be breathtaking in the fall with the changing of the leaves. We all loved it so much we hope to return next year!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful time. The photos were exactly what was there. Everything was perfect. We will definitely be back again.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Exceeded our expectations. Plan to stay there again in the future. Beautiful property with a cool family history. Well worth the price!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We couldn’t have been happier with this place! The cabin itself is amazing, and the property is unbelievable. It is so peaceful and quiet. There was so much to do and explore on the property; our kids had a blast walking the trails and playing in the creek. The wrap around porch was so nice to sit on in the morning and the evening. The cabin was so unique and we loved learning about the story of how it was built. We’ll definitely be back for another stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,I can’t say enough good things about this cabin! It was absolutely perfect! It is a must see and stay. 10/10 would recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,A little piece of heaven on earth! Truly stunning property! If you’re looking for a peaceful and historical place to go. You’re missing out if you don’t go here. I didn’t want to leave
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We had a cousins weekend getaway at the cabin, and this cabin by far was the BEST place that we have ever stayed at.
The cabin is absolutely stunning!
It was very clean and very well stocked.
Plenty of room for the 6 of us.
We enjoyed the porch in the evenings. We could hear the spring peepers at night and the sound of the crick.
It is very peaceful.
We walked the property and saw deer and we spent some time at the pond and saw fish and baby newts in the pond.
This cabin and property is Heaven on earth.
We had the best time and hope to rent it again in the future."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an outstanding place to visit if you are traveling with family! We stayed for 2 nights, as a family member was getting married at the Harper Event Center. Owner is highly responsive and informative. Great neighborhood. Quiet and serene. We will definitely be back for a family get away in the future!!!! Thanks Ryan!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Just as advertised. Nice spot for a family. Kids loved the basement!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Serenity Escape in Meadville, PA is a wonderful place to stay. We stayed here for a graduation. The host (Ryan) was super responsive and friendly. The house is in a quiet neighborhood, not too far from downtown Meadville. The house is super spacious and comfortable. It was perfect for our family."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house had enough space for 10 people with air mattresses for the extra 4. The house was clean and there was lots of outdoor space. The kitchen had a lot of extras like cooking spray and spices. If you have small children there are a lot of fragile items in the house. We enjoyed out stay and it was a great location to watch the eclipse in totality. Ryan was responsive to all our questions.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Good location, lots of space. Pretty well equipped. Responsive host, and good value in the winter. Many things have not been touched or changed in years, so it is a bit of a museum."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect location and enough space for my family. Very helpful with checking in from coming out of town. Will definitely be coming back.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredibly spacious home that can accommodate a large group. Ryan was very responsive to questions. It was in a great location for us as we were visiting family for the holidays. I’d love to visit again during the summer and be able to use the pool!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Used as sleeping overflow while visiting relatives for Thanksgiving. Place was clean. Beds were comfortable. Kitchen well stocked. Plenty of room for our family of four (there was an entire area downstairs we didn't even enter). It was November so pool/outside patio were closed for season but looked like it would be a great place to visit in summer. Will definitely book again next time visiting.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay at Ryan’s place! Easy check-in process and everything was as described! We were attending a wedding at the Harper event center just down the road so this spot was very convenient for us!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We needed a place to hang out with our son thats in college in the area, this place was perfect for us. Easy to find and check in."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,I loved the back deck! Perfect place to have some of my daughter wedding pictures taken.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Will stay again when we return
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,The home is on a quiet culdesac. The beds are comfortable. the kitchen was well stocked. there was a nice amount of towels. the only complaint we have was the over abundance of glassware and the lack of dinnerware. but over all a great place to stay. would book again if in area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Ryan always was available to us. So kind and friendly. The pool was great and the kids really enjoyed it. It was convenient to the town of Meadville and still felt that you were away from it all.
2023-08-01,4,Group trip,The pool was incredible and the place was very clean. They had a large amount of towels which was very nice since we were there for several nights and didn’t have time to do laundry!
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,"Pool and back deck area was awesome. So quiet and peaceful for a getaway. Has a gazebo, swing, and plenty of chairs by the pool. Even has an umbrella that goes over one end of the pool."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice house . Was there for sons wedding at the Harper Event center . i could not have ask for a closer more convenient Home . very clean nice pool great home away from home for wedding weekend . One note is decor just little .... there is dated christmas decor everywhere just gave us weird vibes BUT AMAZING RENTAL FOR MOST PART !!!!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Ryan was a wonderful host and was very responsive. We already want to book the house again for our vacation next year.
2023-06-01,4,Group trip,The house is beautiful. Our children enjoyed the pool. We were worried about all the fancy decorations but everything worked out for our family. The neighborhood was nice and appeared safe .
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"As described, clean, and overall a great stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a wonderful stay. Do it again
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best, cleanest, friendliest Airbnb that I have stayed in. I have used Airbnb in Clifornia, Oregon, Texas, and Italy. This one stands out as the best. Ryan was most accomodating and an excellent host. I give this place my highest reccomendation, and hope to stay here again when visiting my daughter."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay for our wedding weekend! The host was right next door and introduced themselves and assured us it was ok to contact them if we needed anything. The space was so nice and clean and the pool was amazing!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Ryan's place for our daughter's medical school graduation. We felt right at home during our 3 night stay. The home so nice, clean and spacious and the outdoor space and use of bbq was enjoyable on a warm spring day. The kids loved the heated pool. Ryan was super responsive with any questions we had."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"If we would need to stay in the area again we would stay at Ryan’s house. We felt at home there, cozy, friendly - a good to place unwind. We were super busy due to a wedding and would have liked to been able to enjoy the house more. Great place"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ryan's house was great. There was abundant space for my kids to play and a lot of old school toys which my kids loved. We'll definitely book again if we're in town.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Scenic and quiet setting on serene cul de sac, with very comfortable beds and great layout."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super clean, super large home with a wonderful host. We stayed during the winter so didn't have the advantage of the lovely pool and deck. Hosts were prompt with communication. Located on a quiet residential street that's safe for kids to play. Will be reserving this location again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, hope to stay there again! Very easy to work with, quick responses. House was very clean😊"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place in a quiet, walkable neighborhood and close to anything you’d want to do in the Meadville area. It was spotlessly clean, well stocked and very comfortable. We didn’t get to enjoy the pool because it was December, but maybe we’ll get a chance to come back in the summer. Ryan is next door and very responsive, but we didn’t need anything because he’d already taken care of everything."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family of five stayed here for Thanksgiving while visiting my in-laws. It was a perfect rental for us. The house is spacious and clean. The location is central to everything and the neighborhood is lovely. The host is easy to communicate with and helpful and check-in/out is convenient. We plan to stay here again on our next visit to town.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was great for us while visited family in the area. It was SUPER clean! The kids enjoyed having TVs in every room! Ryan was an excellent host!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay. Everything was great and will definitely book again when in the area
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was our 2nd time staying at Edgewood! We recommend it if you enjoy being away from street noises but also only 5 min from town :D
We really enjoyed the electric fireplace vibes for evenings and the individual room AC units kept the whole place at the cooler temperature we love 💘
Clean and comfortable with spacious rooms. Elizabeth was very responsive in communication. Everything is exactly as pictured and described.
Would be our first choice if we are in the area again 👍👍"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had traveled to Meadville to be in the path of totality for the solar eclipse while avoiding a major metropolitan area. Elizabeth's Edgewood Guesthouse was the ideal location for the viewing and the weather cooperated. The guesthouse was comfortable, clean, and close to downtown Meadville where we found restaurants and some local events associated with the eclipse. We enjoyed our stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful experience! It was exactly as pictured, and Elizabeth is a great communicator and host. I appreciate the installation of the keypad to allow for self-check-in, especially as I was delayed and arrived later in the day.
There is so much to love about this gem in a small town. My favorite features were the electric fireplace and the AC/Heaters in each room. Having individual control in the bedrooms is a great option.
The Kitchen was fully stocked, which I appreciated! Overall, the home feels spacious and minimal yet warm, and it is like a home.
I plan to return as it is only 5 min from Allegheny College, which makes visiting my Gator very easy."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We had an absolutely amazing time staying here for our wedding weekend. The house was clean and the pictures don’t do it justice for just how spacious it is. If you are planning to have your wedding at the Harper we definitely recommend here as a place for you and your fiancé or wedding party!
2024-05-01,3,Group trip,"The house is beautiful but could use better cleaning as far as under beds, baseboards, things like that.
It's extremely dark in the area and the house could use a motion activated light. The lockbox seemed to be in an odd location esp with how dark it is there. There is nothing much in the immediate area so plan accordingly! The space in the home was well decorated."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Overall it was a great place to stay. This home is clean, spacious, and comfortable. Adam and Kaitlyn were very responsive to our messages both leading up to our stay and during our stay. We did have to contact them when we arrived because we hadn’t received the code for the lockbox. They responded quickly and we were able to get right in. One thing we would recommend to folks that are planning on staying here is you should grab some drinking water before you get there because the water smells like sulfur. Keep in mind that there is an additional cleaning fee if you have visitors, which was not mentioned in the booking process."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was beautiful and peaceful. Unfortunately we were in town for a funeral, but the location was conveniently located close to the where the services were held and family. It was a great respite for a few days and just the right size for my family. They were quick to respond when I requested to extend my stay. I would rent again."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Super responsive host! Accommodated our busy, changing schedule in a very friendly fashion!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Nice place , matched the description. Very friendly hosts ."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,Adam and Kaitlyn were wonderful hosts. The pictures really don’t do the space justice; it is so spacious and the perfect spot for a young family. They had personalized touches and were extremely responsive
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Their place fit our needs perfectly. Convenient location. Thank you! A+++++
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, clean and updated house. ! Tastefully decorated w thought put into details. Perfect for my family of 6 as we came to the area for our daughter's wedding; extremely convenient, 8 min from wedding venue. The 4 bedrooms gave the perfect amt of privacy . The kitchen was immaculate and a bonus was the fully stocked laundry room w ironing supplies. Loved the entry / mudroom, a great place to organize your grab and go supplies.
Caveats: the step from the mud room up into the house was a little high for my elderly mom. Hand rails would have been helpful for stairs too .
Wish we would have been able to hang at the house longer ( nice large family room for conversations) but was ideal for what we needed; family coming from 3 diff states for wedding. Super responsive, accommodating hosts! Recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I would definitely stay here again! We were in town for a wedding and the house accommodated our family perfectly. We could relax in the spotless home and beautifully manicured lawn instead of being confined to a hotel room which made our weekend much more pleasurable.
We didn’t have time to explore the town of Meadville but did grab some lunch at The Whole Darn Thing sub shop and they were hands down the best we’ve ever had! Very cute town and definitely worth returning so we can explore more.
Thanks for being responsive hosts and providing such a beautiful place to stay. And for the extra special touches🥰"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay. The home is located just 5 minutes from the Harper Event Center where our son got married. We were able to be together with our immediate family for this occasion and we all had a great time! Thank you!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"awesome place, food hosts"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This lovely home looks better than the photos and feels much bigger too. It is peaceful, welcoming, clean and comfortable. My daughter and her bridesmaids relaxed before the wedding with movies and girl time- they called the home perfect and dreamy! It was so much better than a hotel. They loved it!! The hand written note and details were thoughtful and personalized. My husband saw it and would love to go back again. Thanks for a lovely weekend, it could not have been better."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, would definitely recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Adam and Kaitlyn’s place was absolutely perfect for my daughter’s wedding in Meadville! I loved how bright and airy everything was! It was beautiful and just like the pictures! We had some last minute changes and Kaitlyn was immediately responsive and accommodating. The town was only 5 minutes away. We will definitely stay there again next time we are in Meadville.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a family reunion in the area and 8 of us stayed in this house. It was a great space with an open concept. It was very clean and the decorating looked new. I would stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had several family members coming into town for a wedding. The cottage was only 7 minutes from the venue and offered a relaxing and comfortable atmosphere for our families to make lasting memories. We had a few questions upon our arrival, the hosts answered immediately. The cottage was recently renovated and was updated beautifully. The beds were comfortable and freshly cleaned. Because the kitchen was stocked with all the basic items needed, we enjoyed several home cooked meals. We also enjoyed using the grill and fire pit (they provide wood). The cottage doesn't have central air but the two window units and fans seemed adequate for our stay. There was plenty of parking for our multiple cars as well. We highly recommend and would stay here again if we are ever in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family stayed at Adam and Kaitlyns place while visiting family in the area this past week. We were very comfortable in their home. It was like home away from home. The place was clean and spotless and they had everything we needed. I was concerned when I realized they didn’t have central air conditioning but a window unit in the upstairs bedroom and one on the main floor. But to my surprise, we were very comfortable both day and night with the temperatures outside in the mid eighties the entire time we stayed in their home. THANK YOU, Adam and Kaitlyn for opening your beautiful home to us so we could continue making new memories."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,The hosts were extremely helpful and willing to accommodate to our needs. We used this as a bridal suite for our bridesmaids to stay and as a place to host dinner for the bridal party and it worked perfectly. There were even little additions to the space to make it feel more like home such as unique firestarters on the kitchen table. Beautiful set up and mud room!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at this home. Perfect for our family of 6 plus 2 grandparents. Thank you!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Lovely space to stay, very accessible and easy to get to, get in, etc. Very kind and responsive hosts, comfortably slept 9 of us with no issues. Lovely decor and cute little firestarters for the campfire! Only very small issue was that there were only 2 bathrooms with 9 of us and we couldn't shower all of us in a timely manner/without running out of hot water, but with some planning, we were fine and it was still worth the stay! Definitely recommend."
2023-06-01,4,Group trip,"It was hot and humid that weekend and Central Air Conditioning would have been nice. Upstairs bedroom stayed cool with window AC unit, but just one small AC unit to cool the whole downstairs was not enough. Back bedrooms stayed very warm and muggy. Downstairs bedrooms could really use window unit. Otherwise, very nice home with all the amenities and very clean."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,This house was perfect for the night before a wedding nearby at The Harper. Everyone had a comfortable place to sleep and the kitchen was a perfect hangout spot.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay for group of friends in town for an Allegheny reunion. The house was clean, comfortable, and in a great location for our needs. Loved being able to start the day with a cup of coffee outside, enjoying the birds and other wildlife. Kaitlyn was very responsive and accommodating, would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a charming jewel! We stayed here for our daughter’s graduation from Allegheny College. The house was close enough and was convenient to drive to and from. We arrived late, but it was easy to check in, and the house made us smile from the second we walked in. It was so clean and had all the things we needed- to include a wine opener and coffee for the morning. We went outside to have a glass of wine after a long drive, and were amazed at the cacophony of magical nature sounds coming from the bullfrogs and birds. When we went back inside, however, it was quiet and relaxing. I only wish we had discovered this home earlier in our journeys. Thank you for a wonderful stay."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Very nice place. Clean and well-stocked. We enjoyed our time there, would stay again when traveling to Meadville in the future. Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed our stay in Adam and Kaitlyn's home. The space is as advertised - clean, comfortable, and a great place to relax after a long day. They were always responsive too which was very helpful."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,We had a weekend event to attend in Meadville and the place was perfect for our needs.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Adam and Kaitlyn’s home is beautiful, clean, modern and spacious. Everything was as described in the listing, the home was very comfortable and well appointed for our short stay. Our group of 3 families with small children had plenty of room for dinner, games and crafts. Everyone slept comfortably and checkout was easy. My only complaint is that the lighting throughout the kitchen, dining and living room areas are super bright and kind of harsh first thing in the morning. The only floor lamp in the living room was burnt out, so an additional low light source or a hall nightlight would’ve been clutch, but other than that everything was great!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable and cozy. Very satisfied with our time spent here and would highly recommend anyone looking for a peaceful stay. Would definitely book again in the future.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend these hosts and this house. Adam and Kaitlyn were very accomodating and exceeded our expectations. Under the tough circumstances we were faced with during our stay, you were very flexible and understanding. Thank you"
2022-10-01,2,Group trip,"While initially I wanted to leave them a good review, my thoughts have changed based on how we were treated after our stay. Things were going great in the beginning, however, upon leaving the house and driving back to Ohio, I was greeted with a message two days later at 5pm saying that my group violated house rules due to their cleaning lady finding pet hair. For some context, myself, as well as the other guests have pets at home, and most of us work at a small animal vet clinic. Based on this information, pet hair will inevitably travel with us. Not only did we find accommodations to have our pets watched in our home state 3.5 hours away, one guest has a service dog and elected not to bring him based on house rules and the fact that there would be 4 other people to help her if needed. When I got the first message this evening (10/18/22 at 3:30pm) I was told that we violated house rules and that the cleaning lady had to actually clean the house instead of apparently just doing a spot clean. So not only were we wrongly accused, but it seems as though they don't launder the blankets and sheets on a regular basis? Safe to say we will not be staying at their house in the future due to this experience."
2022-10-01,4,Group trip,"Nice house and location. Not far from the town, yet secluded in a nice neighborhood. The layout of the house is open and spacious. Wonderful space to relax with modern upgrades."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. Plenty of space, newly remodeled, and comfortable. Nice fire pit and a grill. The sulphur smell in the water noted in two prior reviews was still an issue for us, despite the responses that the water filtration has been fixed. We used bottled water for cooking, washing vegetables, or drinking, so we went through a lot of bottled water. I’m not commenting on health and safety, but the sulphur smell was unpleasant."
2022-09-01,4,Group trip,"This is a sparkling clean and spacious home conveniently located just south of Edinboro and an hour drive to Erie. We appreciated the kitchen basics and the ample supply of towels. There's also plenty of easy parking for 2-4 cars. The only downside for was a lack of dressers and tabletop space in all the bedrooms and bathrooms. We stayed in the area for a wedding and would have appreciated more space to better unpack and organize ourselves. You should also know the home uses well water. This isn't a big deal, but it's worth noting in case you want to buy water in advance."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We went to meet friends and it was spacious and comfortable. Also, the house might be on well water as the water had a smell to it so bring drinking water. However I absolutely loved the updated everything. Thanks for having us."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"I would recommend this property to whom ever would ask. Really clean
and quiet. Beds were comfortable."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You can't go wrong with this cottage, clean and accurate as described in the listing. Perfect location for those with plans around Meadville town or Allegheny college. Perfect for large families get together. The amenities offered/included in the cottage worked out well for us. Rented it out for 4 days when dropping our son to College and will definitely rent it out again if needed."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Loved our stay! Adam and Kaitlyn's place was clean, spacious and comfortable. The layout is open and perfect for a large group. I loved the house plants throughout the house that thrive because the house gets a lot of sun. There is very little traffic on the road and it is very peaceful. Newly renovated and landscaped, it is very welcoming. The kitchen is stocked with plenty of dishes and glassware. We didn't do any cooking while we were there but it seemed like there was everything you could need! Easy check-in and great communication with the hosts. My family fell in love with the area! Great find!! Thank you Adam and Kaitlyn!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,This was a truly restful retreat weekend! The owners have done a beautiful job of renovation to this perfectly appointed home!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Very clean, cozy and beautifully decorated. We loved everything about it! Excellent communication!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute place.. newly renovated
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Wind in the Willows Cottage was absolutely perfect and met all of our needs for a staff retreat (5 people). Adam & Kaitlyn were incredibly kind and easy to work with and went above and beyond to accommodate for an early check-in and late check-out (and a date change!). The space was inviting, cozy, and provided plenty of space for us to work and relax!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Great spot - beautiful scenery, ample sleeping space that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Adam and Kaitlyn were as amazing as their home. This was my first experience with an Airbnb. We decided Meadville PA was the half way point between our friends in NJ and us from Indiana. We were super happy with the communications of Adam and Kaitlyn , the beautiful home they let us stay in, along with the town of Meadville.
Adam and Kaitlyn were super responsive from the beginning of our booking to the end our stay. Any questions we had were answered quickly.
The home itself it’s absolutely beautiful and you can still smell the newness of their remodel they did to the house. We needed a place the slept our two families a group of 10. After looks at halfway point this was our selection. It had plenty of space for everyone. We felt the home was very specious. You can tell they put a lot of work into the remodel. We went and googled the address. Google still had a picture of what it looked like before the remodel was done. So it was actually cool to see kinda before and after pictures.
Amenities:
We used the grill once to make some cheeseburgers and it worked well. Had to start it with a lighter, but that was provided at the house. The inside of the house had plenty of room for the kids to play. We also bought toys for the yard which has a lot of space to play. Kaitlyn and Adam were kind to turn on the water so we could fill a small kiddie pool up with water. We used the fire pit two of the nights and made s’mores. Kaitlyn and Adam have a great stock pile of wood to use, so you don’t have to go hunting firewood and are able to enjoy the fire pit right away.
The Town:
The town of Meadville actually was really nice. Restaurants, good coffee shop, farmers market (on saturdays), and little shops all within 5-10 minute drive. We really enjoyed the restaurant Julian’s and the French Roast coffee shop.
Thank you Adam and Kaitlyn for letting us stay at your home. We made some great memories."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Adam and Kaitlyn are considerate, attentive hosts and this place is clean as a whistle and very accommodating! It is tasetfully decorated and has everything you need for a peaceful, restful, overnight stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Adam and Kaitlyn have a beautiful house in a quiet location. Their house is tastefully arranged and decorated. There are many thoughtful touches from a fire ring and firewood to nice house plants. The kitchen has everything we needed, and we enjoyed cooking there. Also, everything is new as the house is newly remodeled. The house is bit far away from center Meadville but is very near to Tamarack Lake."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth's French Creek Haven was exactly what we looked for and needed for our visit to Meadville for my 50th College Reunion at Allegheny College. It was bright and clean and just 7 minutes away, by car, from our event. What I liked best was the bed in the main bedroom (didn't try the other bed). I slept wonderfully well the several nights I was at Elizabeth's 'F.C.H.' Thanks Elizabeth !"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth’s place is very homey, clean and well maintained. We enjoyed a comfortable stay here, perfect for the weekend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super cozy space with nice decor and no extra clutter.
Main bed is super comfortable.
Only negative I noted (which is not the fault of the host) is the street noise can be loud in main bedroom. They provided a noise machine we used and we were so tired it wasn’t really an issue for us. No dishwasher, so be prepared to clean your dishes with provided supplies or bring paper.
Would rebook if we are ever in the area again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Elizabeth's place was great. Everything we needed was provided.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, clear instructions, great location (quick zip up to the College). Will definitely stay there again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We came up for the Eclipse. It was a great place to come back to after a day of exploring. Really close to down town.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place perfect for our hockey weekend. Close to a lot of great restaurants and not to far from the arena!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable and exactly as described. Short drive to pretty much everything. Elizabeth is a great and very responsive host. Will definitely try and stay here again next time we’re up there.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was very nice and would definitely go back.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth was wonderful to work with. I wished to arrive very early Friday morning to beat the snowstorm, and Elizabeth was very accommodating. Space was a good fit for my group of three. The apartment is part of a duplex, and at first it was a little hard to tell which door to use. The duplex ""neighbor"" came out and cleared our deck and steps of snow several times throughout the weekend. Because of the weather, we mostly stayed indoors, but we did enjoy the walking trail between the river and the train tracks."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a work trip. Easy to find. Great host!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My stay was wonderful as always.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was fantastic as usual. Elizabeth puts a little extra thought into everything. This stay she left me a drink with a bow and note saying, it happened to be a favorite drink of her husband and herself. It was in fact good. It’s the little things in life really. I didn’t expect it but it’s kind and that means something."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Traveling Nurse: The accommodations were great and handy to the facility I’m currently contracted through. I will definitely stay again when it’s available. Only disadvantage is the microwave is kept on top of the refrigerator and I am short. After being on my feet all day for work (12hr shifts), climbing on a chair to use the microwave would probably end badly for me. BUT it’s definitely not enough issue to not return for another stay. The place is just as clean as I had hoped and I am particular about clean 🤭. Thank you very much for the wonderful place to sleep!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect as always and can’t wait to stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! The apartment was so cute and very comfortable! We appreciated the little extras too, like the selection of card games, and the homemade treats!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place that is relaxing and close to whatever you would need; restaurants that deliver, grocery stores, pharmacy, clothing store right next door."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Elizabeth is a very nice and friendly host, always responsive and willing to share things and information. I do have a really great stay in the apartment, and there is no doubt the brownie made by Elizabeth is the one of my favorite, ever! Thank you Elizabeth!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfy and cozy with so many amenities within walking distance.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying here! Super cozy, incredibly easy and private. Elizabeth was so responsive and helpful, we had a great time. And we had little towel animals! Above and beyond."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! Elizabeth was a great host. The home was spotless, beds were super comfortable, and the cookies she made were delicious!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay! Very clean, well stocked and comfy bed! Thanks so much for taking our reservation with such late notice!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet place with a nice living room to hangout with family and friends. Boot box next door was nice to walk to and look around. It was a little chilly so I bought an Ariat hoodie for $30 which was a good price. Would definitely stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was nicely decorated, and our family of 6 enjoyed our stay! We were in town to visit friends so we weren’t at the house during the day, but the evening and sleeping accommodations were perfect."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth is a great host, very responsive and though of every little detail in the house. Location is very close to everything."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our stay. From the cookies that were left for us to the super fast wifi, everything was great. There were little nice things like the towels were folded to look like an elephant and there were Q-tips in the bathroom. There were cookies left for us as well.
We'd very much like to return."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was exactly as presented. Elizabeth was easy to communicate with and the place was clean and updated.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice comfy place to stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute, clean, easy access to campus. My 18yr old loved the little cookies left by Elizabeth when we arrived :)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth is an amazing hostess! Her communication was second to none. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a pristinely maintained, very clean, fresh scents, and just the right amount of technology (smart tvs and ~300 Gbps internet). The air conditioning is AMAZING! I am perpetually hot and the central air, not window units, deserves 5 stars by itself!
Finally we accidentally left a pillow that wasn’t cheap but more importantly is key for my wife to get a good nights sleep. Normally we would not have seen it again. However, Elizabeth contacted us, went out of her way to arrange for our friends to pick it up for us. It may seem small but what she did meant the world to us.
We would definitely stay again, but next time we will triple check to make sure we don’t leave anything behind! 😁"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Comfy and cozy place
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a welcoming cozy place to stay. Elizabeth responds quickly and is a joy to work with. We loved our time there. Everything we needed was provided and prepared for us! Highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy to find. Just as described. I thoroughly enjoyed my time.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"French Creek Haven was just as wonderful as described in the listing. Comfortable for 3 people but would potentially be tight for more than 4. Elizabeth was a very hospitable host, going out of her way to be sure we had enough linens and bringing cookies when she replaced our supplies. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Elizabeth's apartment. It was sparkling clean, bright and quiet. The apartment was well equipped with everything we needed for our weekend visit. Elizabeth provided excellent instructions every step of the way.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay so much and felt ready to move in because it was just so cute! The place was very comfortable and cozy. There are several stairs so I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with mobility issues. Otherwise, I highly recommend this apartment!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host and location!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I came here right after our wedding. This cabin was perfect for relaxation and for remembering and locking in all the highlights of our wedding. We sat out on the porch as much as possible, enjoyed the hot tub and fire pit. I also enjoyed the gas fireplace, it was perfect to nap infront of. We brought our bikes and found the quiet roads perfect for ride around. The cabin is well built and really provides privacy without being too far from store for basic odds and ends. Will be recommending this spot to other couples who need a getaway."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, peaceful, and clean.
Very pleasant and thoughtfully laid out; an excellent use of available space.
It was incredibly clean!
If you’re looking for a quiet and private retreat, this fits the bill nicely.
Some caveats:
Access to the second floor, where the only bed is, is by a staircase that is basically like a ladder. If you have mobility issues it will be inaccessible.
The hot tub was well serviced but it is on a pad not covered by a roof- inclement weather will keep you from using it.
Not good or bad, just more info:
The tap water has a strong iron taste and smell, typical for well water in this area.
The decorations are very Christian centric, for some people this is a positive, for those who are not Christian it may be off putting.
The property is on a dirt road, it doesn’t require 4WD drive, but I’d be careful in snow or rain.
We had excellent cell service on the AT&T network."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here on our honeymoon a year ago and were privileged to be able to spend our first anniversary at the same place. Jonathan was a great host like always and we thoroughly enjoyed our relaxing time there.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a relaxing weekend away. Just what we needed to try to reconnect. There is privacy here. It was beautiful, clean and very well taken care of.
The issues we had were we couldn't find the firewood, it should be listed where it is for people. Jonathan emailed me back the next day informing me where it was, which was fine we ended up not having a fire. The fire pit needed cleaned out and we just decided to spend more time inside together.
Sunday morning went to have coffee on the porch and there were 2 dogs running loose around the property at Sweet Solitude.
It was a relaxing weekend still to try to reconnect with one another."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you need some time to decompress and detach from the day to day, to remember what it’s like without binging Netflix on the weekends and scrolling TikTok, this is the place! What a fantastic place to hit the reset button! The beautiful snow falling outside really added that cozy feeling…looking to make this an annual thing!"

A special thank you to the hostess Jonathan for bringing us a propane tank @ 9:30 on a Sunday night. Also thank you to is wife and or daughters for the zucchini bread.
Thank you again. Lori & Pj"

We will return to Sweet Solitude but for a longer stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place very private clean and cozy! The stairs are more like a ladder to get to bedroom. The hot tub and fire place are very nice.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a lovely spot for a weekend getaway. It was exactly what we were looking for!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was beautiful, private, perfect and serene. We spent our sixth wedding anniversary here and it was everything we could have hoped for!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing cabin in amazing surroundings! It was super quiet during our stay and I believe the only traffic on the road was 2 ATVs that went by. The interior was a relaxing rustic theme. We loved the hot tub and the romantic loft bedroom! Thanks for your hospitality and it was a pleasure to see a fellow Christian helping to spread the Good News!! 👍
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Hope to get a chance to stay in the future! Sorry Jonathan

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very good stay
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing time as a last minute getaway to this cozy cabin of solitude. Everything was perfect, from the hot tub to the fireplace, and everything kept very neat and clean. From a contracting background, we appreciate all the small details and architectural features throughout the entire house and it's history. We will definitely be booking here again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautifully created space to unplug, relax, & revive off of the beaten path, but still close enough go out for a good meal."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful place! Romantic getaway for me and my husband. Jonathan came over to do some maintenance which was fine but he gave us pretty short notice. Luckily we weren’t home but since the place is so secluded and we weren’t checking our phones much, we would have been a bit freaked out if someone showed up without warning in the evening."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I stayed here for a romantic night away for his birthday. We loved it so much that we’re already planning our next trip there in the fall. It’s super close to a ton of restaurants but the cabin is secluded in the woods. We really enjoyed the hot tub and fireplace. Such a charming place for a weekend getaway. Jonathan and his family truly made the cabin feel like home away from home. Can’t wait to go back!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and welcoming!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jonathan's place is just as advertised. The beautiful cabin is small and cozy, and very clean and well organized. It is a perfect place for a couple to enjoy some down time. We would definitely stay there again in the future."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What everyone else has said is so very true. The pictures don’t do it justice. It’s clean, quiet and cozy. Any basic amenities you need are provided, the bed is comfortable and the hot tub was great. A great quiet getaway to relax and recharge. Great way for us to spend our New Years. Will be returning for sure."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome little cabin tucked away in the woods with plenty of privacy. This place is definitely a hidden gem in my eyes, absolutely beautiful location and scenery. Everything was exactly as described and very clean, well worth the money spent"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Another perfect stay at the cabin!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was so comfortable, clean and cozy. Even with the frigid temps outside it was warm inside! Such a wonderful place to unwind and relax. Jonathan's thought of everything to make a great spot for anyone! We highly recommend their cabin!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place nice little get away definitely going to be doing stuff like that more!!! Thank you Jonathan for the stay amazing place and super quiet. 10/10 definitely recommend
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Very quiet and relaxing. Lots of birds and wildlife in the area. The cabin is more beautiful than the pictures & was stocked with anything we might need.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed this little cabin. Very pretty area and felt super homey.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're interested in relaxation and a quiet, peaceful and beautiful countryside, this is the location for you. Fo us, the lack of TV and Internet was awesome - it is nice to be of the grid for a period of time. There's good cel signal here if you need to get online. The cabin is perfect for 2 people - just enough space. It is very clean and has everything we needed to make breakfast and lunch (we ate out for dinner). The hot tub was a nice feature especially in the chilly air. Overall a great relaxing place."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed the hot tub and it was so clean and just all around a beautiful place to stay even if it was just for one night!!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I came to the cabin for a quick weekend getaway. We absolutely loved it! It felt like home the minute you walk through the door. We will definitely be making another trip here!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, private, quiet, cozy."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We just spent our 30th wedding anniversary at the cabin. This was our 3rd visit and our best. Since we visited last, Jonathan installed a hot tub out back. What a nice addition to our stay! As we mentioned in our last reviews, this is the most cleanest place we have ever stayed at through Airbnb. It is the perfect place to get away from it all and refocus."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb was exactly what we were looking for. It was cozy, very clean, and a great experience overall!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing little get away.
Very quaint little cabin perfect for a couple looking to get away. The cabin is very nice the location is just as nice.
Located far enough out you’re on your own but close enough to shopping food and even a trip up to Erie and the beaches.
You won’t be disappointed if you’re looking for some alone time.
Pictures do this place justice except for how extremely quiet it is out there.
This cabin is smaller but the memories are huge!
This place was exactly what I needed for a little weekend To relax and forget about everything.
Lots of items stocked and available for use.
Would highly recommend this place and I’ll be staying again someday hopefully soon."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was one of the best Airbnb properties I have ever stayed in, and I’ve stayed in so very many! I arrived far later at night than expected after a trip to Pittsburgh, but the self check-in was so easy I was able to safely get in and get situated. Such a beautiful and quiet place to enjoy nature and see the stars, and to hear the birds, it was the perfect getaway from the city. It was hands down the cleanest and most nicely decorated place I have ever stayed. I would come back in a heartbeat if I’m ever in the area again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very nice and quaint little cabin secluded in a peaceful environment. Perfect for a simple get-a-way. Very clean and well maintained.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect for a small get a way. The cabin was warm and inviting. Upon arrival you feel right at home and at peace.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is very clean and accommodating! We highly recommend this quaint cabin!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a beautiful place to stay and we will certainly be coming back! The couch was super comfortable and the gas fireplace, while a little confusing to run, was really cool and heated the place well. The cabin was well-stocked with thoughtful little amenities like toothbrushes, bottled water, and K-Cups. One item to note— the staircase up to the bedroom in the loft is more like a ladder and is steeper and more difficult to climb than we expected. Could be a little unsafe for people with any limited mobility, so just something to keep in mind. It was a wonderful stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful place to stay. Truly a space to relax, unwind and renew. Would love to come back here."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This sweet little cabin was exactly what we needed for our anniversary weekend! It is off the beaten path, mostly secluded, adorable, VERY clean, and fully stocked. Host is super attentive via the app in case you need anything at all. We enjoyed exploring the local towns, Pymatuning State Park, Erie, and Presque Isle - all very convenient from this cabin. I have already recommended this place to numerous friends & we will 100% come back in the future!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am beyond happy with this stay! This was my first Air BnB Experience and it was fantastic. I was so happy on arrival. We are from Pittsburgh and it was a short ride and great price for an anniversary unwind! Very private! Cozy, Adorable! Hot Tub was private and relaxing, full Kitchen and Grill made this ""camping"" a ""glamping"" experience. Fire pit was perfect for mountain pies and s'mores. They provide fire wood and propane, everything you need. Slept Like a baby! So Clean. fireplace inside was a wonderful touch. Great Lighting for how dark it is outside at night. AC Unit in the window kept me happy at the hottest part of the days. Would visit again! Use the Swing! Highly recommended!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful cabin & great hosts, the perfect place to get away from everyday life."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location is secluded. it's a small cabin down a dirt road that invites you to unwind. The sound of nature and the morning air are clean and refreshing. Enjoy the hot tub, warm fireplace and the sound of nature on the front porch."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little place was perfect. We were looking for somewhere to get away, relax, and unwind while spending quality, uninterrupted time together and that’s just what we got. When we arrived, the cabin was very clean and just as it was pictured. The new hot tub was an added bonus. We also were welcomed with a sweet treat that was a special added touch. We couldn’t have been more happy with our stay and everything about Jonathan’s place. We had a great time and look forward to being able to visit again in the future. If you’re looking for a secluded, quiet, special little getaway place.. you won’t be disappointed."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I came to the cabin for a bit of a retreat for my birthday weekend- this cabin was absolutely perfect. There was more to do than we expected and some great food options in Meadville. The cabin itself was adorably decorated and had everything we needed- including a corkscrew, k-cups, and creamer! The loft was more spacious than we expected and the fireplace was so cozy. The carport was also extremely convenient since it snowed quite a bit while we were there. Very secluded- we felt like we were in our own little world. This place was even better than the pictures!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is PERFECT! It is so cute and has everything you could possibly need! The host is great and willing to help with everything! We will definitely be going back!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"A Much Needed Getaway!
Wow! This place is one of a kind! My son and I were looking for a place to stay while checking out some of the local trails. This place exceeded our expectations! The cabin was one of the cleanest places I have ever stayed. The decor, the lighting, the fireplace, and even the comfortable quality furniture is like a page out of a magazine. All the little details were taking care of ( we loved the Blackberry pie waiting for us when we got there). We honestly cannot wait to stay in the Spring when the weather is a little warmer!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cabin was wonderful! Very clean and quiet, it was a very enjoyable weekend!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a perfect place to get away for a weekend. The cabin is super cosy and cute. We loved all the features and the location. Despite the cold weather during our stay, inside the cabin it was very warm. We would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to spend a few days together with the nature!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great cabin! Perfect for getting away and unplugging.
It was easy to find and check in was very smooth. Nice clean kitchen if you want to spend some time cooking. Fireplace is perfect and easy to use.
We went in winter which was very cozy but the yard is pretty big for playing games and having a fire in the outdoor pit when the weather is warmer."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin is a fairy tale. There are many ways to adjust the lights. There was a treat on the table for us when we came in. The cabin is so clean that it looks brand new. Shampoos, soaps, toothbrushes, and even dental floss were provided. Coffee and creamer were available also. There are plenty of dishes and even a nice cast iron pan. There is a convenient sink up in the loft at the top of the stairs, and there is one under the stairs as well. The temperature was very warm and comfortable. There is a ceiling fan in the kitchen and one in the loft. The bed is super cozy. Everything is high quality. It is a dream. You will love it!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, just wow! This place is as advertised- fantastic private location but close enough to the state parks and downtown Meadville. I didn’t see anyone from the moment I pulled in and I wanted it that way. Privacy is key! The place was immaculate, clean, well-stocked, everything I needed for a solo getaway from the city. Quiet and comfortable. Jonathan was easy to work with, friendly, and responsive. I recommend this to couples looking for a romantic excursion or to friends wanting to reconnect or even to solo vacationers hoping for some peace and solitude. A+++."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, cozy cabin that you can kick back and relax!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute cozy cabin with no wifi and no tv. Great chance to escape and love nature!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is exactly what we were looking for! Very secluded, in the middle of the woods, but still close enough to all of the things to do in Meadville or Conneaut Lake. The electronic reclining love seat in the living room was very comfortable and the gas fireplace which was connected to a thermostat was perfect for keeping the cabin warm and cozy when the weather turned cooler on the 2nd day of our stay. Cabin was very clean, and perfect for our anniversary get away. I would recommend to anyone trying to escape for a special occasion."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin is absolutely beautiful! Our stay went above and beyond our expectations. Jonathan was so very accommodating on such short notice and made the cabin warm and welcoming for our arrival. The cabin was clean, beautiful, quaint and just perfect! Beautiful front porch, beautiful cabin! Thank you again Jonathan for your gracious hospitality!"

Jonathan and Jennifer were very accommodating (we booked it just a few hours before check in), they were friendly and even left us a little heart shaped cake to celebrate!
The cabin is stocked full of everything you could possibly need for a stay! Just bring some food and s’mores, and you’re all set!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great cozy and immaculate cabin a few miles outside of Meadville.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is very cute. Everything was clean and beautifully decorated. Kitchen was well well equipped, and fire pit and grill were very nice. Private but close enough to things to do. Would love staying again. Only thing would say is that getting up to the loft bedroom might be tough for those with physical limitations."

The place was cozy, clean, private, as well as supplied with linens, first aid, firewood, etc. They also provided special touches that just warmed our hearts - sparkling drink, table set, and homemade zucchini bread waiting for us!
We also totally enjoyed biking around Lake Willhelm 20 min way that Jonathan had recommended.
We highly recommend this place!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I honestly didn’t know what to expect when I came to Jonathan’s Airbnb, but I was absolutely blown away in the best way possible. The property feels like something I would find in a fairy tale. The coziness of the cottage, unique entrance to the bedroom, and gorgeous condition of the house was everything I could want in a secluded getaway weekend for myself and my girlfriend. The place was stocked with tons of kitchen ware fir available use, which was a great touch. On top of all that, Jonathan was extremely accommodating and helpful with providing information on different things to do in the area. I most definitely will be returning to Jonathan’s amazing property and hospitality"
